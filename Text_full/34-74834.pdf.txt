Application of Certain Title VII Requirements to Security-Based Swap Transactions
Connected with a Non-U.S. Person’s Dealing Activity That Are Arranged, Negotiated, or
Executed By Personnel Located in a U.S. Branch or Office or in a U.S. Branch or Office of
an Agent
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule; proposed rule amendments.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) is
publishing for comment proposed amendments and a re-proposed rule to address the application
of certain provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) that were added
by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
(“Dodd-Frank Act”) to cross-border security-based swap activities. The Commission is
proposing amendments to Exchange Act rules 3a71-3 and 3a71-5 that would address the
application of the de minimis exception to security-based swap transactions connected with a
non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that are arranged, negotiated, or executed
by personnel of such person located in a U.S. branch or office, or by personnel of such person’s
agent, located in a U.S. branch or office. The Commission is also re-proposing Exchange Act
rule 3a71-3(c) and proposing certain amendments to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a) to address the
applicability of external business conduct requirements to the U.S. business and foreign business
of registered security-based swap dealers. The Commission also is proposing amendments to
Regulation SBSR to apply the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to
transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of non-U.S. persons, or
1

personnel of such non-U.S. persons’ agents, that are located in the United States and to
transactions effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered securitybased swap execution facility), along with certain related issues, including requiring registered
broker-dealers (including registered security-based swap execution facilities) to report certain
transactions that are effected by or through the registered broker-dealer.

under the Exchange Act regarding the application of Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank
Act to cross-border activities.
The Commission is proposing to amend the following rules under the Exchange Act: rule
3a71-3 (addressing the cross-border implementation of the de minimis exception to the “securitybased swap dealer” definition and the definition of certain terms); rule 3a71-5 (regarding
availability of an exception from the dealer de minimis analysis for cleared anonymous
transactions that fall within proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C)); and Rules 900, 901, 906, 907,
908(a)(1), and 908(b) of Regulation SBSR. The Commission also is re-proposing Exchange Act

I. Background
A. Scope of this Rulemaking
The Commission is proposing to amend certain rules and is re-proposing a rule regarding
the application of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act 1 (“Title VII”) to cross-border security-based
swap transactions and persons engaged in those transactions. The proposed amendments include
rules regarding the application of the de minimis exception to the dealing activity of non-U.S.
persons carried out, in relevant part, by personnel located in the United States, 2 and the
application of Regulation SBSR 3 to such transactions and to transactions effected by or through a
registered broker-dealer, along with certain related issues. We are also re-proposing a rule
regarding the application of external business conduct requirements to the foreign business and
U.S. business of registered security-based swap dealers.
Each of these issues was considered in our May 23, 2013 proposal, in which we proposed
rules regarding the application of Title VII in the cross-border context more generally. 4 On June
25, 2014, we adopted rules and guidance based on the May 23, 2013 proposal addressing the

1

Public Law 111–203, 124 Stat. 1376 (2010). Unless otherwise indicated, references to Title VII
in this release are to Subtitle B of Title VII.

2

In this release, unless otherwise noted, we use the terms “personnel located in the United States”
or “personnel located in a U.S. branch or office” interchangeably to refer to personnel of the nonU.S. person engaged in security-based swap dealing activity who are located in a U.S. branch or
office, or to personnel of an agent of such non-U.S. person who are located in a U.S. branch or
office.

Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 74244 (February 11, 2015), 80 FR 14563 (March 19, 2015)
(“Regulation SBSR Adopting Release”). With these proposed rules and rule amendments, the
Commission is not re-opening comment on the rules adopted in Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release.

See Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities; Re-Proposal of Regulation SBSR and Certain
Rules and Forms Relating to the Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major
Security-Based Swap Participants, Exchange Act Release No. 69490 (May 1, 2013), 78 FR 30968

application of the “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant”
definitions to cross-border security-based swap activities. 5 In that release, among other things,
we adopted rules specifying which cross-border transactions must be included in a person’s
security-based swap dealer de minimis or major security-based swap participant calculations. 6
We explained, however, that we were not addressing the application of the “security-based swap
dealer” definition to “transaction[s] conducted within the United States” because commenters
had raised several significant issues related to this requirement of the proposal. 7 We stated that
we anticipated soliciting additional public comment on the application of the “security-based
swap dealer” definition to transactions between two non-U.S. persons where one or both are
conducting dealing activity within the United States. 8
In this release, we propose amendments to Exchange Act rules 3a71-3 and 3a71-5 that
reflect a modified approach to this element of the initial proposal and solicit comment on the
proposed amendments and re-proposed rule. The proposed amendments would address the
activity of a non-U.S. person in the United States in a way that more closely focuses on where
personnel of the non-U.S. person engaged in dealing activity (or on where personnel of its agent)
are arranging, negotiating, or executing a security-based swap. The proposed amendments
would not require a non-U.S. person engaging in dealing activity to consider the location of its
non-U.S.-person counterparty or the counterparty’s agent in determining whether the transaction

(June 25, 2014), 79 FR 47278 (August 12, 2014 (republication)) (“Cross-Border Adopting
Release”). With these proposed rules and rule amendments the Commission is not re-opening
comment on the rules adopted in the Cross-Border Adopting Release.

needs to be included in its own de minimis calculation. Instead, the proposed amendments
would require a non-U.S. person to include in its de minimis calculation any transaction with
another non-U.S. person that is, in connection with its dealing activity, arranged, negotiated, or
executed by personnel of the non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office or by personnel
of the non-U.S. person’s agent located in a U.S. branch or office.
We also are re-proposing rules regarding the application of the external business conduct
requirements to the foreign business of registered security-based swap dealers, and we are
proposing to amend Regulation SBSR to address the reporting and public dissemination
requirements applicable to security-based swap transactions involving non-U.S. persons that
engage in relevant activity in the United States and to transactions effected by or through a
registered broker-dealer, along with certain related issues.
B. The Dodd-Frank Act
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a comprehensive new regulatory framework
for swaps and security-based swaps. Under this framework, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission (“CFTC”) regulates “swaps” while the Commission regulates “security-based
swaps,” and the Commission and CFTC jointly regulate “mixed swaps.” The new framework
encompasses the registration and comprehensive regulation of security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants, as well as requirements related to clearing, trade
execution, regulatory reporting, and public dissemination. 9 Security-based swap transactions are

9

We have proposed a series of rules regarding these matters. See Cross-Border Proposing Release,
78 FR 30972 nn.11-18.
The Dodd-Frank Act further provides that the SEC and CFTC jointly should further define certain
terms, including “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant.” See
Dodd-Frank Act section 712(d). Pursuant to that requirement, the SEC and CFTC jointly adopted
rules to further define those terms. See Further Definition of “Swap Dealer,” “Security-Based
Swap Dealer,” “Major Swap Participant,” “Major Security-Based Swap Participant” and “Eligible

10

largely cross-border in practice, 10 and the various market participants and infrastructures operate
in a global market. Dealers and other market participants may transact extensively with
counterparties established or located in other jurisdictions and, in doing so, may conduct sales
and trading activity in one jurisdiction and book the resulting transactions in another. These
market realities and the potential impact that these activities may have on U.S. persons and
potentially the U.S. financial system have informed our consideration of these proposed rules.
In developing this proposal, we have consulted and coordinated with the CFTC, the
prudential regulators, 11 and foreign regulatory authorities in accordance with the consultation
mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act. 12 More generally, as part of our domestic and international
efforts, Commission staff has participated in numerous bilateral and multilateral discussions with

Contract Participant,” Exchange Act Release No. 66868 (April 27, 2012), 77 FR 30596 (May 23,
2012) (“Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release”); see also Cross-Border Proposing Release,
78 FR 30972 n.9 (discussing joint rulemaking to further define various Title VII terms).
10

See Section II.B.2, infra, regarding the preponderance of cross-border activity in the securitybased swap market.

11

The term “prudential regulator” is defined in section 1a(39) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 1a(39), and that
definition is incorporated by reference in section 3(a)(74) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(74). Pursuant to the definition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(“Federal Reserve Board”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, the Farm Credit Administration, or the Federal Housing Finance Agency
(collectively, the “prudential regulators”) is the “prudential regulator” of a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant if the entity is directly supervised by that
regulator.

12

Section 712(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides in part that the Commission shall “consult and
coordinate to the extent possible with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and the
prudential regulators for the purposes of assuring regulatory consistency and comparability, to the
extent possible.”
In addition, section 752(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides in part that “[i]n order to promote
effective and consistent global regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, the Commodity
Futures Trading Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the prudential
regulators . . . as appropriate, shall consult and coordinate with foreign regulatory authorities on
the establishment of consistent international standards with respect to the regulation (including
fees) of swaps.”

11

foreign regulatory authorities addressing the regulation of OTC derivatives. 13 Through these
discussions and the Commission staff’s participation in various international task forces and
working groups, 14 we have gathered information about foreign regulatory reform efforts and
their impact on and relationship with the U.S. regulatory regime. We have taken this information
into consideration in developing this proposal.
C. The Cross-Border Proposing Release
Our prior proposals and final rules regarding the application of Title VII to security-based
swap activity carried out in the cross-border context (including to persons engaged in such
activities) reflect the global nature of the security-based swap market and its development prior
to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. 15 We also noted our preliminary belief that dealing
activity carried out by a non-U.S. person through a branch, office, affiliate, or an agent acting on
its behalf in the United States may raise concerns that Title VII addresses, even if a significant
proportion—or all—of those transactions involve non-U.S.-person counterparties. 16 We initially
proposed to require any non-U.S. person engaged in dealing activity to include in its de minimis
calculation any “transaction conducted within the United States.” Thus, under the Cross-Border

13

Senior representatives of authorities with responsibility for regulation of OTC derivatives have
met on a number of occasions to discuss international coordination of OTC derivatives
regulations. See, e.g., Report of the OTC Derivatives Regulators Group (“ODRG”) on CrossBorder Implementation Issues November 2014 (November 7, 2014), available at:
http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@internationalaffairs/documents/file/oia_odrgreportg20_
1114.pdf.

14

Commission representatives participate in the Financial Stability Board’s Working Group on
OTC Derivatives Regulation (“ODWG”), both on the Commission’s behalf and as the
representative of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), which is
co-chair of the ODWG. A Commission representative also serves as one of the co-chairs of the
IOSCO Task Force on OTC Derivatives Regulation.

12

Proposing Release, a non-U.S. person engaged in dealing activity would have been required to
include in its de minimis calculation any transaction where either the person itself or its
counterparty performed relevant security-based swap activity within the United States.
The Cross-Border Proposing Release also included proposed rules regarding the
application of the clearing, trade execution, regulatory reporting, and public dissemination
requirements. Under the rules proposed in that release, the clearing requirement and the trade
execution requirement also would have applied to a “transaction conducted within the United
States,” a transaction having a U.S.-person counterparty, or a transaction having a counterparty
that is a non-U.S. person whose counterparty has a right of recourse against a U.S. person, 17 with
certain exceptions. 18 The regulatory reporting requirement under that proposal would have
applied to a “transaction conducted within the United States,” a transaction in which either side
of the security-based swap includes an indirect or direct U.S. person counterparty, a transaction
in which a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is a direct or
indirect counterparty to the security-based swap, or a transaction that is cleared through a
clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States. 19 The public
dissemination requirement would have applied to a “transaction conducted within the United
States,” a transaction in which a U.S. person is a direct or indirect counterparty on each side of
the security-based swap, a transaction in which at least one direct counterparty is a U.S. person
(except in the case of a transaction conducted through a foreign branch), a transaction in which

17

In this release, we use the terms “non-U.S. persons whose counterparties have a right of recourse
against a U.S. person under a security-based swap,” “non-U.S. persons whose obligations under a
security-based swap are guaranteed by a U.S. person,” and “guaranteed non-U.S. persons”
interchangeably.

one side includes a U.S. person and the other side includes a non-U.S. person that is a securitybased swap dealer, or a transaction cleared through a clearing agency having its principal place
of business in the United States. 20
D. The CFTC Staff Advisory
In November 2013, the CFTC’s Division of Swap Dealer and Intermediary Oversight
issued a Staff Advisory (“CFTC Staff Advisory”) addressing the applicability of the CFTC’s
transaction-level requirements to certain activity by non-U.S. registered swap dealers arranged,
negotiated, or executed by personnel or agents of the non-U.S. swap dealer located in the United
States. 21 The CFTC Staff Advisory stated CFTC staff’s belief that the CFTC “has a strong
supervisory interest in swap dealing activities that occur within the United States, regardless of
the status of the counterparties” and that a non-U.S. swap dealer “regularly using personnel or
agents located in the U.S. to arrange, negotiate, or execute a swap with a non-U.S. person
generally would be required to comply with” the CFTC’s transaction-level requirements. 22 On
January 8, 2014, the CFTC published a request for comment on various aspects of the CFTC
Staff Advisory, including whether the CFTC “should adopt the Staff Advisory as Commission

20

See rule 908(a)(2), as re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release.

(November 14, 2013), available at:
http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@lrlettergeneral/documents/letter/13-69.pdf.
In the Interpretive Guidance and Policy Statement Regarding Compliance with Certain Swap
Regulations (July 17, 2013), 78 FR 45292 (July 26, 2013) (“CFTC Cross-Border Guidance”), the
CFTC defined transaction-level requirements to include the following: (i) required clearing and

policy, in whole or in part.” 23 In response to this request, the CFTC received approximately 20
comment letters addressing various aspects of the CFTC Staff Advisory. 24 CFTC staff
subsequently extended no-action relief related to the CFTC Staff Advisory until the earlier of
September 30, 2015, or the effective date of any CFTC action in response to the CFTC Request
for Comment. 25 We understand that the CFTC Staff Advisory and comments received in
response to the CFTC Request for Comment are under review at the CFTC.
E. Comments on the Proposed Definition of “Transaction Conducted within the United
States” and Application of the Definition in the Cross-Border Proposing Release
A number of commenters on our Cross-Border Proposing Release addressed the
definition of “transaction conducted within the United States.” Although two commenters
supported our proposed use of this defined term, 26 commenters generally criticized the proposed
definition. These criticisms generally focused on four areas: the scope of activity potentially
captured by the initially proposed defined term, the operational difficulties of implementing the
defined term, the costs of implementation, and competitive concerns. Market participants also
expressed a variety of views on the application of the regulatory reporting, public dissemination,

conduct-based approach is consistent with longstanding Commission practice but also noting
potential ambiguities). One of these commenters supported the initially proposed definition

clearing, and trade execution requirements. Several market participants opposed the application
of the requirements to “transaction[s] conducted within the United States” because of concerns
about workability or the scope of the statute, while other commenters argued that the application
of the requirements should be expanded to apply to any “transaction conducted within the United
States.” 27 In light of these comments and our understanding of the structure of the securitybased swap market, we determined that our proposed treatment of “transactions conducted
within the United States” would benefit from further consideration and solicitation of further
comment.
II. Economic Considerations and Baseline Analysis
A. Broad Economic Considerations
These proposed amendments and re-proposed rule would determine when a non-U.S.
person whose obligations under a security-based swap are not guaranteed by a U.S. person and
that is not a conduit affiliate is required to include in its dealer de minimis calculation
transactions with another non-U.S. person and when certain regulatory requirements apply to
these and certain other transactions. To provide context for understanding our proposed rules
and the related economic analysis that follows, this section discusses how this particular proposal
fits within the Title VII framework and identifies broad economic considerations that we
preliminarily believe underlie the proposal’s likely economic effects.
27

These comments are discussed in further detail below, in Sections III.B.2, IV.D, and V.C. As
reflected in our discussion throughout this release, we have carefully considered both the CFTC
Staff Advisory and the comments submitted in response to the CFTC’s request for comment on
the CFTC Staff Advisory in developing this proposal. Moreover, in connection with our statutory
obligation to consult with the CFTC in connection with Title VII rulemaking, our staff have
engaged in extensive discussion with CFTC staff regarding our proposed rules. We note,
however, that our discussion of both the CFTC Staff Advisory and the comments received by the
CFTC about it reflects our understanding of these documents. Accordingly, neither our
discussions of these documents nor any preliminary views expressed herein should be interpreted
as necessarily reflecting the views of any other agency or regulator, including the CFTC.

16

This analysis considers the effects of the proposed rules on security-based swap market
participants and transactions that, as a result of these proposed rules, would be subject to rules
that we have already adopted, or that we have proposed but not yet adopted, pursuant to Title
VII. In particular, we consider the potential adverse effect on market participants of a securitybased swap market that may remain opaque to regulators and market participants and that may
lack robust customer protections. 28 We also consider possible competitive disparities arising
under current and proposed rules.
Title VII provides a statutory framework for the OTC derivatives market and divides
authority to regulate that market between the CFTC (which regulates swaps) and the
Commission (which regulates security-based swaps). The Title VII framework requires certain
market participants to register with the Commission as security-based swap dealers or major
security-based swap participants and subjects such entities to certain requirements. The Title VII
framework mandates that we establish rules that apply to certain security-based swap
transactions, including mandatory clearing, mandatory trade execution, regulatory reporting, and
public dissemination.
These proposed amendments and re-proposed rule, together with our previously adopted
rules defining “security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant” and
applying those definitions in the cross-border context, would define the scope of entities and
transactions that are subject to the requirements of Title VII. Although these proposed
amendments and re-proposed rule do not define the specific substantive requirements, the scope
of application that they define will play a central role in determining the overall costs and

application of external business conduct requirements. See Section III.B.4, infra, for a discussion
of how our proposed approach would support regulatory transparency.

17

benefits of particular regulatory requirements, and of the Title VII regulatory framework as a
whole. 29 For example, to the extent that the proposed application of the de minimis exception
leads to a higher number of registered security-based swap dealers, it is reasonable to expect that
the aggregate costs and benefits associated with requirements applicable to such dealers will
increase. 30
Several broad economic considerations have informed our proposed approach to identify
transactions between two non-U.S. persons that should be subject to certain Title VII
requirements. First, to the extent that a financial group carries out security-based swap business
in the United States, our ability to monitor dealers for market manipulation or other abusive
practices may be limited, even with respect to a registered security-based swap dealer’s securitybased swaps with U.S. persons. For example, permitting a financial group to carry out a dealing
business with U.S. persons through a registered security-based swap dealer and to hedge
transactions arising out of that business in the inter-dealer market using the same personnel
operating out of the same branch or office in the United States, but acting on behalf of an
unregistered non-U.S.-person affiliate, would limit our ability to obtain records that would
facilitate our ability to identify potentially abusive conduct in connection with the U.S. person’s
transactions with U.S.-person counterparties both within the security-based swap market as well
as in markets for related underlying assets, such as corporate bonds. Moreover, a non-U.S.
person engaged in dealing activity with non-U.S. persons in the United States but not subject to
Regulation SBSR would not be required to report its trades, which could make it more difficult

29

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47327 (stating that the registration and regulation of
entities as security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants will lead to
programmatic costs and benefits).

See Section VI.B.1, infra.

18

for the Commission to monitor that activity for compliance with the federal securities laws and
could reduce the transparency of prices in the security-based swap market in the United States.
The proposed rules thus reflect our assessment of the impact that the scope of security-based
swap transactions and security-based swap dealers subject to regulatory reporting and relevant
security-based swap dealer requirements (such as external business conduct standards and
recordkeeping and reporting requirements) may have on our ability to detect abusive and
manipulative practices in the security-based swap market.
Second, in formulating these proposed rules, we have taken into account the potential
impact that rules adopted as part of the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release and the
Cross-Border Adopting Release might have on competition between U.S. persons and non-U.S.
persons when they engage in security-based swap transactions with non-U.S. persons, and the
implications of these competitive frictions for market integrity. As noted in prior Commission
releases, although the Dodd-Frank Act, including Title VII, seeks to achieve a number of
benefits, 31 it also imposes costs on registered security-based swap dealers that unregistered
persons are not required to bear. 32 For example, section 15F of the Exchange Act imposes
various requirements on registered security-based swap dealers, including capital and margin
requirements, recordkeeping and reporting requirements, and external business conduct
requirements. While the Commission currently applies similar requirements to registered
broker-dealers, Title VII applies these requirements only to persons that are registered as

31

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47280 n.11 (citing Dodd-Frank Act preamble, which
states that the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted “[t]o promote the financial stability of the United
States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to
fail’, to protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive
financial services practices, and for other purposes”).

security-based swap dealers. Under current Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii), adopted in the
Cross-Border Adopting Release, a non-U.S. person that engages in more than a de minimis
amount of dealing activity with non-U.S.-person counterparties using personnel located in the
United States may face lower regulatory costs than a U.S. competitor engaging in identical
activity, because the non-U.S. person is not required to include such transactions in its de
minimis calculation. Competitive disparities may also arise as a result of differences in
application of other Title VII requirements between U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons that are
engaged in dealing activity using personnel located in the United States. As a result, such a nonU.S. person may be able to offer liquidity to its counterparties on more favorable terms than its
U.S. competitors.
Under Exchange Act rule 3a71-3, non-U.S. persons may be able to subsidize their
transactions with U.S. persons with profits from transactions with non-U.S. persons, allowing
them to gain a competitive advantage with respect to transactions with U.S. persons from other
dealing activity that is not subject to Title VII, even though it is carried out using personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office. In the absence of the rules being proposed in this release,
these competitive effects of disparate regulatory treatment may create an incentive for U.S.
persons to use non-U.S.-person affiliates or non-U.S.-person agents that are located in the United
States to engage in dealing activity with non-U.S.-person counterparties, because these non-U.S.
persons could continue to deal with non-U.S.-person counterparties without being required to
comply with any Title VII requirements. 33 This disparity could make transactions with U.S.-

33

We note that, under Exchange Act rule 3a71-3, a non-U.S.-person affiliate of a U.S. person is not
required to include such transactions in its dealer de minimis threshold calculations if that nonU.S. person’s counterparties do not have recourse to a U.S. person under the terms of the
security-based swap and the non-U.S. person is not a conduit affiliate. See Exchange Act rule

20

person dealers less attractive than transactions with non-U.S.-person dealers, even if the latter are
arranging, negotiating, or executing the transaction using personnel located in a U.S. branch or
office.
Moreover, differences in the application of the Title VII regulatory requirements may
impose differing direct costs on different counterparties. For example, a non-U.S. person
seeking to trade in a security-based swap on a U.S. reference entity may prefer to enter into the
transaction with a non-U.S.-person dealer rather than a U.S.-person dealer. Even though both
dealers are likely to arrange, negotiate, or execute a transaction on a U.S. reference entity using
personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, the non-U.S.-person dealer may be more attractive
because, for example, a transaction with that dealer may not involve a requirement to post
collateral consistent with Title VII margin requirements or to comply with Regulation SBSR.
The prospect of directly incurring the costs associated with compliance with Title VII
requirements may cause these non-U.S. persons to prefer dealing with unregistered non-U.S.person dealers, particularly if they can obtain the benefits associated with arranging, negotiating,
or executing such a transaction using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. The rules
being proposed in this release are designed to mitigate this outcome.
Regulatory frictions arising from a difference in the treatment of dealing activity
occurring in the United States could fragment security-based swap liquidity into two pools, one
for U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons whose obligations under a security-based swap are
guaranteed by a U.S. person, and the other for non-U.S. persons. Non-U.S. persons that arrange,
negotiate, or execute transactions in connection with their dealing activity using personnel

3171-3(b)(1)(ii) and (iii) (applying the de minimis exception to cross-border dealing activity of
conduit affiliates and non-U.S. persons).

21

located in a U.S. branch or office may, under current Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b), seek to limit
dealing activity with U.S. persons (for example, by quoting larger spreads to compensate for the
expected costs of entity-level requirements) or may entirely refuse to supply liquidity to U.S.
persons. This disparity in treatment may provide further incentives for U.S. persons to
restructure their business to permit them to carry out their business with non-U.S. persons on
similar terms. 34 This incentive may be particularly strong among U.S. dealers that are active in
the inter-dealer market.
To the extent that the large inter-dealer market 35 shifts in significant part to non-U.S.
dealers as a result of current rules, security-based swap activity in the United States could consist
of one very large pool of transactions unregulated under Title VII (inter-dealer trades, and
transactions between dealers and non-U.S. person non-dealers) and one much smaller pool
limited to transactions between dealers and U.S.-person counterparties. This fragmentation
could adversely affect the efficiency of risk sharing among security-based swap market
participants, as discussed further in Sections VI.B.4(a) and VI.B.4(b), below.
Different treatment of transactions depending on whether they are arranged, negotiated,
or executed by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office may create similar fragmentation
among agents that may seek to provide services to foreign dealers. To the extent that using
agents with personnel located in the United States results in substantial regulatory costs to
foreign dealers, such foreign dealers may prefer and primarily use agents located outside the

34

See Section VI.B, infra, for further discussion of potential effects of the proposed rules on nonU.S. persons’ incentives to use personnel located in U.S. branches or offices to arrange, negotiate,
or execute security-based swap transactions.

constitutes inter-dealer transactions. For the purposes of this analysis we classify any securitybased swap transaction between two ISDA-recognized dealers as inter-dealer activity.

United States, while U.S. dealers may continue to use agents located in the United States. This
fragmentation of dealer and agent relationships, as in the case of liquidity fragmentation
discussed earlier, may adversely affect the efficiency of risk sharing by security-based swap
market participants.
B. Baseline
To assess the economic impact of the proposed amendments and rule described in this
release, we are using as our baseline the security-based swap market as it exists at the time of
this release, including applicable rules we have already adopted but excluding rules that we have
proposed but have not yet finalized. 36 The analysis includes the statutory provisions that
currently govern the security-based swap market pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act as well as rules
adopted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the Cross-Border Adopting Release,
Regulation SBSR, and the Security-Based Swap Data Repository (“SDR”) Rules and Core
Principles. 37 Our understanding of the market is informed by available data on security-based
swap transactions, though we acknowledge the data limit the extent to which we can
quantitatively characterize the market. Because these data do not cover the entire market, we
have developed an understanding of market activity using a sample that includes only certain
portions of the market.
1. Current security-based swap market
Our analysis of the state of the current security-based swap market is based on data
obtained from the DTCC Derivatives Repository Limited Trade Information Warehouse
36

We also take into account, where appropriate, current industry practice in response to the actions
of other regulators, such as the CFTC and the European Securities and Markets Authority.

37

Exchange Act Release No. 74246 (February 11, 2015), 80 FR 14437 (March 19, 2015). As
noted above, we have not yet adopted other substantive requirements of Title VII that may affect
how firms structure their security-based swap business and market practices more generally.

23

(“TIW”), especially data regarding the activity of market participants in the single-name credit
default swap (“CDS”) market during the period from 2008 to 2014. According to data published
by the Bank for International Settlements (“BIS”), the global notional amount outstanding in
equity forwards and swaps as of June 2014 was $2.43 trillion. The notional amount outstanding
in single-name CDS was approximately $10.85 trillion, in multi-name index CDS was
approximately $7.94 trillion, and in multi-name, non-index CDS was approximately $678
billion.38 Our analysis in this release focuses on the data relating to single-name CDS. As we
have previously noted, although the definition of “security-based swap” is not limited to singlename CDS, we believe that the single-name CDS transactions that we observe are sufficiently
representative of the market and therefore can directly inform the analysis of the security-based
swap market. 39
We preliminarily believe that the data underlying our analysis here provide reasonably
comprehensive information regarding single-name CDS transactions and the composition of the
single-name CDS market participants. We note that the data available to us from TIW do not

38

See Semi-annual OTC derivatives statistics at end-June 2014 (December 2014), Table 19,
available at: http://www.bis.org/statistics/dt1920a.pdf.

39

While other repositories may collect data on transactions in total return swaps on equity and debt,
we do not currently have access to such data for these products (or other products that are
security-based swaps). In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we explained that we believed
that data related to single-name CDS was reasonable for purposes of this analysis, as such
transactions appear to constitute roughly 82% of the security-based swap market as measured on
a notional basis. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31120 n.1301. No commenters
disputed these assumptions, and we therefore continue to believe that, although the BIS data
reflect the global OTC derivatives market, and not just the U.S. market, these ratios are an
adequate representation of the U.S. market.
Also consistent with our approach in that release, with the exception of the analysis regarding the
degree of overlap between participation in the single-name CDS market and the index CDS
market (cross-market activity), our analysis below does not include data regarding index CDS as
we do not currently have sufficient information to identify the relative volumes of index CDS that
are swaps or security-based swaps.

24

encompass those CDS transactions that both: (i) do not involve U.S. counterparties; 40 and (ii)
are based on non-U.S. reference entities. Notwithstanding this limitation, we preliminarily
believe that the TIW data provide sufficient information to identify the types of market
participants active in the security-based swap market and the general pattern of dealing within
that market. 41
(a) Dealing Structures and Participant Domiciles
Dealers occupy a central role in the security based swap market and security-based swap
dealers use a variety of business models and legal structures to engage in dealing activity with
counterparties in jurisdictions all around the world. 42 As we noted in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release and as discussed below in Section III.B.4(a), both U.S.-based and foreign-based entities
use certain dealing structures for a variety of legal, tax, strategic, and business reasons. 43

40

We note that TIW’s entity domicile determinations may not reflect our definition of “U.S.
person” in all cases.

41

The challenges we face in estimating measures of current market activity stem, in part, from the
absence of comprehensive reporting requirements for security-based swap market participants.
We have adopted rules regarding trade reporting, data elements, and public reporting for securitybased swaps that will, when fully implemented, provide us with appropriate measures of market
activity. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14699-700.

42

Commission staff analysis of TIW transaction records indicates that approximately 99% of
single-name CDS price-forming transactions in 2014 involved an ISDA-recognized dealer.
“Price-forming transactions” include all new transactions, assignments, modifications to increase
the notional amounts of previously executed transactions, and terminations of previously
executed transactions. Transactions terminated, transactions entered into in connection with a
compression exercise, and expiration of contracts at maturity are not considered price forming
and are therefore excluded, as are replacement trades and all bookkeeping-related trades. See
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31121 n.1312. For the purpose of this analysis, the
ISDA-recognized dealers are those identified by ISDA as belonging to the dealer group, including
JP Morgan Chase, Morgan Stanley, Bank of America, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank, Barclays,
Citigroup, UBS, Credit Suisse, RBS Group, BNP Paribas, HSBC, Société Générale, Credit
Agricole, Wells Fargo, and Nomura. See, e.g., http://www2.isda.org/functionalareas/research/surveys/operations-benchmarking-surveys/.

43

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 30976.

25

Dealers may use a variety of structures in part to reduce risk and enhance credit protection based
on the particular characteristics of each entity’s business.

Bank and non-bank holding companies may use subsidiaries to deal with counterparties.
A U.S.-based holding company may engage in dealing activity through a foreign subsidiary that
faces both U.S. and foreign counterparties, and foreign dealers may choose to deal with U.S. and
foreign counterparties through U.S. subsidiaries. Similarly, a non-dealer user of security-based
swaps may participate in the market using an agent in its home country or abroad. An
investment adviser located in one jurisdiction may transact in security-based swaps on behalf of
beneficial owners that reside in another.
In some situations, an entity’s performance under security-based swaps may be supported
by a guarantee provided by an affiliate. Such a guarantee may take the form of a blanket
guarantee of an affiliate’s performance on all security-based swap contracts, or a guarantee may
apply only to a specified transaction or counterparty. Guarantees may give counterparties to a
dealer direct recourse to the holding company or another affiliate for its dealer-affiliate’s
obligations under security-based swaps for which that dealer-affiliate acts as counterparty.

to as “US”), (2) new accounts with a domicile outside the United States (referred to below

person, account of a foreign branch of a U.S. person, and accounts of a foreign subsidiary
of a U.S. person (collectively referred to below as “Foreign Managed by US”). 44 Unique,
new accounts are aggregated each quarter and percentages are computed on a quarterly
basis, from January 2008 through December 2014.

As depicted in Figure 1, the domicile of new accounts participating in the market has
shifted over time. A greater share of accounts entering the market either have a foreign domicile,
or have a foreign domicile while being managed by a U.S. person. The increase in foreign
accounts may reflect an increase in participation by foreign accountholders while the increase in
44

Following publication of the Warehouse Trust Guidance on CDS data access, TIW surveyed
market participants, asking for the physical address associated with each of their accounts (i.e.,
where the account is organized as a legal entity). This is designated the registered office location
by TIW. When an account does not report a registered office location, we have assumed that the
settlement country reported by the investment adviser or parent entity to the fund or account is the
place of domicile. This treatment assumes that the registered office location reflects the place of
domicile for the fund or account.

27

foreign accounts managed by U.S. persons may reflect the flexibility with which market
participants can restructure their market participation in response to regulatory intervention,
competitive pressures, and other stimuli. Alternatively, the shifts in new account domicile that
we observe in Figure 1 may be unrelated to restructuring or increased foreign participation. For
example, changes in the domicile of new accounts over time may reflect improvements in
reporting by market participants to TIW rather than a change in market participant structure. 45
Additionally, because the data include only accounts that are domiciled in the United States, that
transact with U.S.-domiciled counterparties, or that transact in single-name CDS with U.S.
reference entities, changes in the domicile of new accounts may reflect increased transaction
activity between U.S. and non-U.S.-person counterparties or increased transactions in singlename CDS on U.S. reference entities by foreign persons.
(b) Market Centers
Participants in the security-based swap market may bear the financial risk of a securitybased swap transaction in a location different from the location where the transaction is arranged,
negotiated, or executed or the location where economic decisions are made by managers on
behalf of beneficial owners. Similarly, a participant in the security-based swap market may be
exposed to counterparty risk from a jurisdiction that is different from the market center or centers
in which it primarily operates. These participants appear to be active in market centers across
the globe.
The TIW transaction records include, in many cases, information on particular branches
involved in transactions, which may provide limited insight as to where security-based swap

45

See note 44, supra.

28

activity is actually being carried out. 46 These data indicate branch locations located in New
York, London, Tokyo, Hong Kong, Chicago, Sydney, Toronto, Frankfurt, Singapore, and the
Cayman Islands. Because transaction records in the TIW data provided to us do not indicate
explicitly the location in which particular transactions were arranged, negotiated, or executed,
these locations may not represent the full set of locations in which activities relevant for these
proposed rules take place. Moreover, because we cannot identify the location of transactions
within TIW, we are unable to estimate the general distribution of transaction volume across
market centers.
(c) Current Estimates of Number of Dealers
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we estimated, based on an analysis of TIW
data, that out of more than 4,000 entities engaged in single-name CDS activity worldwide in
2013, 170 entities engaged in single-name CDS activity at a sufficiently high level that they
would be expected to incur assessment costs to determine whether they meet the “security-based
swap dealer” definition. 47 Approximately 45 of these entities are non-U.S. persons and are
expected to incur assessment costs as a result of engaging in dealing activity with counterparties
that are U.S. persons or engaging in dealing activity that involves recourse to U.S. persons. 48
Analysis of those data further indicated that potentially 50 entities may engage in dealing activity

46

The value of this information is limited in part because some market participants may use
business models that do not involve branches to carry out business in jurisdictions other than their
home jurisdiction. For example, some market participants may use affiliated or unaffiliated
agents to enter into security-based swap transactions in other jurisdictions on their behalf. The
available data currently does not allow us to identify with certainty which type of structure is
being used in any particular transaction.

47

29

that would exceed the de minimis threshold and thus ultimately have to register as security-based
swap dealers. 49
Updated analysis of 2014 data leaves many of these estimates largely unchanged. We
estimate that approximately 170 entities engaged in single-name CDS activity at a sufficiently
high level that they would be expected to incur assessment costs to determine whether they meet
the “security-based swap dealer” definition. Approximately 56 of these entities are non-U.S.
persons. Of the approximately 50 entities that we estimate may potentially register as securitybased swap dealers, we preliminarily believe it is reasonable to expect 22 to be non-U.S. persons.
2. Levels of security-based swap trading activity
Single-name CDS contracts make up the vast majority of security-based swaps, and most
are written on corporate issuers, corporate securities, sovereign countries, or sovereign debt
(reference entities or securities). Figure 2 below describes the percentage of global, notional
transaction volume in North American corporate single-name CDS reported to the TIW between
January 2008 and December 2013, separated by whether transactions are between two ISDArecognized dealers (inter-dealer transactions) or whether a transaction has at least one non-dealer
counterparty.
Annual trading activity with respect to North American corporate single-name CDS in
terms of notional volume has declined from more than $6 trillion in 2008 to less than $3 trillion
in 2014. 50 While notional volume has declined over the past six years, the portion of the
49

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14693.

50

The start of this decline predates the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the proposal of rules
thereunder, which is important to note for the purpose of understanding the economic baseline for
this rulemaking. The timing of this decline seems to indicate that CDS market demand shrank
prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, and therefore the causes of this reduction in trading
volume may be related to market dynamics and not directly related to the enactment of legislation
and the development of security-based swap market regulation.

30

notional volume represented by inter-dealer transactions has remained fairly constant and interdealer transactions continue to represent a significant majority of trading activity, whether
measured in terms of notional value or number of transactions (see Figure 2).
The high level of inter-dealer trading activity reflects the central position of a small
number of dealers, each of which intermediates trades between many hundreds of counterparties.
While we are unable to quantify the current level of trading costs for single-name CDS, those
dealers appear to enjoy market power as a result of their small number and the large proportion
of order flow they privately observe. This market power in turn appears to be a key determinant
of trading costs in this market.

Against this backdrop of declining North American corporate single-name CDS activity,
about half of the trading activity in North American corporate single-name CDS reflected in the
set of data that we analyzed was between counterparties domiciled in the United States and
counterparties domiciled abroad. Basing counterparty domicile on the self-reported registered
office location of the TIW accounts, we estimate that only 12% of the global transaction volume
by notional volume between 2008 and 2014 was between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties,
compared to 48% entered into between one U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreign-domiciled
counterparty and 40% entered into between two foreign-domiciled counterparties (see Figure
3). 51
When the domicile of TIW accounts is instead defined according to the domicile of an
account’s ultimate parents, headquarters, or home office (e.g., classifying a foreign bank branch
or foreign subsidiary of a U.S. entity as domiciled in the United States), the fraction of
transactions entered into between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties increases to 32%, and to
51% for transactions entered into between a U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreigndomiciled counterparty.
Differences in classifications across different definitions of domicile illustrate the effect
of participant structures that operate across jurisdictions. Notably, the proportion of activity
between two foreign-domiciled counterparties drops from 40% to 17% when domicile is defined
as the ultimate parent’s domicile. As noted earlier, foreign subsidiaries of U.S. parent companies
and foreign branches of U.S. banks, and U.S. subsidiaries of foreign parent companies and U.S.
51

See note 44, supra. For purposes of this discussion, we have assumed that the registered office
location reflects the place of domicile for the fund or account, but we note that this domicile does
not necessarily correspond to the location of an entity’s sales or trading desk.

32

branches of foreign banks may transact with U.S. and foreign counterparties. However, this
change in respective shares based on different classifications suggests that the activity of foreign
subsidiaries of U.S. firms and foreign branches of U.S. banks is generally higher than the activity
of U.S. subsidiaries of foreign firms and U.S. branches of foreign banks.

between (1) two U.S.-domiciled accounts, (2) one U.S.-domiciled account and one non-U.S.domiciled account, and (3) two non-U.S.-domiciled accounts, computed from January 2008
through December 2014.

3. Regulatory reporting, clearing, and trade execution of security-based swap
transactions
We have adopted final rules implementing regulatory reporting requirements for securitybased swap transactions, although compliance with most aspects of this regime is not yet
required. 52 Although counterparties are not yet required to comply with rules that require them
to report transaction information, virtually all market participants voluntarily report their trades
52

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14566.

in single-name CDS to TIW, which maintains a record of these transactions, in some cases with
the assistance of post-trade processors. 53 Among other things, this centralized record-keeping
facilitates settlement of obligations between counterparties when a default event occurs as well
as bulk transfers of positions between accounts at a single firm or between firms.
Clearing of security-based swaps, which is currently voluntary in the United States, is
currently limited to CDS products, and a substantial proportion of single-name CDS accepted for
clearing are already being cleared. Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear
Europe engaged in CDS clearing activities pursuant to exemptive orders issued by the
Commission. 54 Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe were
deemed to be registered with the Commission in July 2011 as clearing agencies for securitybased swaps. 55 ICE Clear Credit began clearing corporate single-name CDS in December
2009, 56 and, as of March 17, 2015, had cleared a total of $3.06 trillion gross notional of single-

Commission considered clearing practices of those central counterparties (“CCPs”), including,
inter alia, their risk management methodologies.

55

Section 17A(l) of the Exchange Act provides in relevant part that a derivative clearing
organization registered with the CFTC that clears security-based swaps would be deemed to be
registered as a clearing agency under section 17A if, prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank
Act, it cleared swaps pursuant to an exemption from registration as a clearing agency. Both ICE
Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe also are registered with the CFTC as derivative clearing
organizations.

name CDS on 368 North American and European instruments. 57 As of the beginning of this
year, ICE Clear Credit accepted for clearing a total of 207 CDS products based on North
American instruments, 168 CDS products based on European instruments, and fifteen CDS
products based on individual sovereign (nation-state) reference entities.
Staff analysis of trade activity from July 2012 to December 2013 indicate that, out of
$938 billion of notional traded in North American corporate single-name CDS contracts that
have reference entities that are accepted for clearing during the 18 months ending December
2013, approximately 71%, or $666 billion, had characteristics making them suitable for clearing
by ICE Clear Credit and represented trades between two ICE Clear Credit clearing members.
Approximately 79% of this notional value, or $525 billion, was cleared through ICE Clear
Credit, or 56% of the $938 billion in new trade activity.
Figure 4 shows the proportion of new trades and assign-entries defined as clearable at
ICE Clear Credit that were ultimately cleared. 58

57

ICE Clear Credit also has cleared a total of $37.3 trillion gross notional on 137 index CDS as of
March 20, 2015. See ICE Clear Credit, Volume of ICE CDS Clearing, available at:
https://www.theice.com/clear_credit.jhtml.
In addition to clearing single-name CDS on North American corporate reference entities, ICE
Clear Credit also clears CDS on certain non-U.S. sovereign entities, and on certain indices based
on North American reference entities.

58

For the purposes of this analysis, “clearable” describes CDS contracts on North American singlename corporate reference entities between clearing members that reference the ISDA Standard
North American Corporate (SNAC) documentation, are denominated in U.S. dollars, do not
include restructuring as a credit event and have a standard coupon. If ICE Clear Credit accepts
CDS on the reference entity for clearing, then a standard coupon is one that is accepted for
clearing for that reference entity by ICE Clear Credit; otherwise, standard coupon means a
coupon of either 100 or 500 basis points. See SEC Division of Economic and Risk Analysis,
Single-Name Corporate Credit Default Swaps: Background Data Analysis on Voluntary Clearing
Activity, 15 (April 2015), available at http://www.sec.gov/dera/staff-papers/whitepapers/voluntary-clearing-activity.pdf.

Evidence from the TIW data suggests that even single-name CDS written on reference
entities that were initially accepted for clearing by ICE Clear Credit were traded infrequently.
Figure 5 plots of the daily mean number of transactions per trading day for each of the 538 North
American single-name corporate reference entities with at least one transaction per month on
average during the period from January 2011 to December 2013. 59 Each vertical bar represents
the mean number of transactions per day for a reference entity. 60 The 538 reference entities are
presented in decreasing order of the mean number of transactions per trading day. Commission
staff has identified the 68 reference entities in the sample that were cleared by ICE Clear Credit
prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act (the “deemed submitted” reference entities). The
68 deemed submitted reference entities are marked by Xs forming a line near the horizontal axis.
The remaining Xs (those not on the line of Xs near the horizontal axis) represent, for each
reference entity, the fraction of days with no transactions. The evidence in Figure 5 suggests that
within the sample period, the most traded entity of the 68 “deemed submitted” reference entities
was traded approximately 15 times per day on average. Despite the low average number of
transactions per day, these 68 reference entities generally have a lower proportion of days with
no transactions relative to the rest of the single-name CDS market represented in the sample.

59

We analyze single-name corporate reference entities with at least one transaction per month on
average from January 2011 to December 2013 to avoid including outliers that trade extremely
infrequently. Of the 573 North American single-name corporate reference entities with at least
36 transactions included in Figure 5, only 538 had at least 36 new trades, implying that the other
35 had price forming transactions that were not associated with new trading activity, such as
terminations or assignments. See id. at 41.

60

Transaction types include all price forming transactions: new trades, amendments that change
economic terms of the contract, assignments, and terminations.

36

ICE Clear Europe began clearing CDS on single-name corporate reference entities in
December 2009, 61 and, as of March 17, 2015, had cleared a total €2.48 trillion in gross notional
of single-name CDS on 161 European corporate reference entities. 62 As of the beginning of
2015, ICE Clear Europe accepted for clearing a total of 161 CDS products based on European
corporate reference entities.
Staff analysis of new trade activity from July 2012 to December 2013 indicate that out of
€531 billion of notional traded in European corporate single-name CDS contracts that have
reference entities that are accepted for clearing during the 18 months ending December 2013,
approximately 70%, or €372 billion had characteristics making them suitable for clearing by ICE
Clear Europe and represented trades between two ICE Clear Europe clearing members.
Approximately 51% of this notional value, or €191 billion was cleared through ICE Clear
Europe, representing 36% of the total volume of new trade activity. 63

See Exchange Act Release No. 61973 (April 23, 2010), 75 FR 22656, 22657 (April 29, 2010)
(discussing ICE Clear Europe’s CDS clearing activity as of April 2010).
ICE Clear Europe commenced clearing index CDS in July 2009. See Exchange Act Release No.
60372 (July 23, 2009), 74 FR 37748 (July 29, 2009) (order granting temporary exemptions under
the Exchange Act on behalf of ICE Clear Europe).

62

ICE Clear Europe also has cleared a total of €14.4 trillion in gross notional on 64 index CDS as of
March 20, 2015. See ICE Clear Europe, Volume of ICE CDS Clearing, available at:
https://www.theice.com/clear_credit.jhtml.
Aside from clearing single-name CDS on European corporate reference entities, ICE Clear
Europe also clears CDS on indices based on European reference entities, as well as futures and
instruments on OTC energy and emissions markets.

63

These numbers do not include transactions in European corporate single-name CDS that were
cleared by ICE Clear Credit. However, during the sample period, there was only one day on
which there were transactions that were cleared by ICE Clear Credit (December 20, 2013) and the
traded notional of these transactions was minimal. For historical data, see
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/99.

We preliminarily believe that it is reasonable to assume that, when clearing occurs within 14 days
of execution, counterparties made the decision to clear at the time of execution and not as a result
of information arriving after execution.
An “assign-entry” involves the substitution of one of the contract counterparties in an existing
instrument for a new counterparty in exchange for cash consideration. It is economically
equivalent to a termination of the initial contract between the “old” counterparty and the “static”
counterparty and a new trade between the “replacement” counterparty and the “static”
counterparty.

Figure 5. North American Single-Name Corporate CDS Transaction Activity: January
2011–December 2013

Unlike the markets for cash equity securities and listed options, the market for securitybased swaps is characterized almost exclusively by bilateral OTC negotiation and is largely
decentralized. 65 The lack of uniform rules concerning the trading of security-based swaps and
the historical one-to-one nature of trade negotiation in security-based swaps has resulted in the
formation of distinct types of trading venues and execution practices, ranging from bilateral
negotiations carried out over the telephone, 66 single-dealer RFQ platforms, 67 multi-dealer RFQ

65

See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR 10951.

66

“Bilateral negotiation” refers to the execution practice whereby one party uses telephone, e-mail,
or other communication methods to contact directly a potential counterparty to negotiate and

39

platforms, 68 central limit order books, 69 and brokerage trading. 70 These various trading venues
and execution practices provide different degrees of pre-trade transparency and afford market
participants different levels of access. We currently do not have sufficient information with
respect to the volume of security-based swap transactions executed across these different trading
venues and using these various execution practices.

execute a security-based swap. The bilateral negotiation and execution practice provides no pretrade or post-trade transparency because only the two parties to the transaction are aware of the
terms of the negotiation and the final terms of the agreement. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76
FR 10951.
67

A single-dealer RFQ platform refers to an electronic trading platform where a dealer may post
indicative quotes for security-based swaps in various asset classes that the dealer is willing to
trade. Only the dealer’s approved customers would have access to the platform. When a
customer wishes to transact in a security-based swap, the customer requests an executable quote,
the dealer provides one, and if the customer accepts the dealer’s quote, the transaction is executed
electronically. This type of platform generally provides pre-trade transparency in the form of
indicative quotes on a pricing screen, but only from one dealer to its customer. See SB SEF
Proposing Release, 76 FR 10951.

68

A multi-dealer RFQ electronic trading platform refers to a multi-dealer RFQ system whereby a
requester can send an RFQ to solicit quotes on a certain security-based swap from multiple
dealers at the same time. After the RFQ is submitted, the recipients have a prescribed amount of
time in which to respond to the RFQ with a quote. Responses to the RFQ are firm. The requestor
then has the opportunity to review the responses and accept the best quote. A multi-dealer RFQ
platform provides a certain degree of pre-trade transparency, depending on its characteristics.
See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR 10952.

69

A limit order book system or similar system refers to a trading system in which firm bids and
offers are posted for all participants to see, with the identity of the parties withheld until a
transaction occurs. Bids and offers are then matched based on price-time priority or other
established parameters and trades are executed accordingly. The quotes on a limit order book
system are firm. In general, a limit order book system provides greater pre-trade transparency
than the three models described above because all participants can view bids and offers before
placing their bids and offers. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR 10952. Currently, limit
order books for the trading of security-based swaps in the United States are utilized by interdealer brokers for dealer-to-dealer transactions.

70

“Brokerage trading” refers to an execution practice used by brokers to execute security-based
swaps on behalf of customers, often in larger-sized or bespoke transactions. In such a system, a
broker receives a request from a customer (which may be a dealer) that seeks to execute a specific
type of security-based swap. The broker then interacts with other customers to fill the request
and execute the transaction. This model often is used by dealers that seek to transact with other
dealers through the use of an inter-dealer broker as an intermediary. In this model, there may be
pre-trade transparency to the extent that participants are able to see bids and offers of other
participants. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR 10952.

40

We have proposed, but have not yet adopted, rules establishing a registration regime and
core principles for security-based swap execution facilities (“SB SEFs”). We have not proposed
to implement the mandatory trade execution requirement contained in section 3C(h) of the
Exchange Act. Currently, there are no SB SEFs registered with the Commission, and as a result,
there is no registered SB SEF trading activity to report. There are, however, currently 25 trading
platforms that either are temporarily registered with the CFTC as SEFs or have SEF temporary
registration applications pending with the CFTC and currently are exempt from registration with
the Commission.71 As we discuss in Section II.B.5, the cash flows of security-based swaps and
swaps are closely related and many participants in the security-based swap also participate in the
swap market and so we preliminarily believe that many SEFs that currently serve as trading
venues for swaps are likely also to register with the Commission as SB SEFs. However, owing
to the smaller size of the security-based swap market, we currently expect that there will be
fewer exchanges and SB SEFs that will eventually host transactions in security-based swaps than
the 25 SEFs reported within the CFTC’s jurisdiction.
4. Global regulatory efforts
Efforts to regulate the swaps market are underway not only in the United States but also
abroad, and these efforts have received significant attention in international fora. For example,
in 2009, leaders of the G20—whose membership includes the United States, 18 other countries,
and the EU—addressed global improvements in the functioning, transparency, and regulatory
71

See Effective Date Release, 76 FR at 36306 (exempting persons that operate a facility for the
trading or processing of security-based swaps that is not currently registered as a national
securities exchange, or that cannot yet register as an SB SEF because final rules for such
registration have not yet been adopted, from the requirements of Section 3D(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act until the earliest compliance date set forth in any of the final rules regarding
registration of SB SEFs). A list of platforms that either are temporarily registered with the CFTC
or have SEF temporary registration applications pending with the CFTC is available at:

41

oversight of OTC derivatives markets. They expressed their view on a variety of issues relating
to OTC derivatives contracts, including trading on exchanges or electronic trading platforms,
clearing through CCPs, and reporting to trade repositories. 72 In subsequent summits, the G20
leaders have returned to OTC derivatives regulatory reform and encouraged international
consultation in developing standards for these markets. 73
Jurisdictions with major OTC derivatives markets have taken steps toward substantive
regulation of these markets, though the pace of regulation varies. Accordingly, many foreign
participants likely will be required to comply with substantive regulation of their security-based
swap activities apart from regulations that may apply to them pursuant to Title VII. The
concerns foreign jurisdictions seek to address with their regulations may overlap or be similar to
those addressed by the Title VII regulatory framework.
Foreign legislative and regulatory efforts have focused on five general areas: requiring
post-trade reporting of transactions data for regulatory purposes, moving OTC derivatives onto
organized trading platforms, requiring central clearing of OTC derivatives, establishing or
enhancing capital requirements, and establishing or enhancing margin requirements for OTC
derivatives transactions. The first two areas of regulation should help improve transparency in
OTC derivatives markets, both to regulators and market participants. Regulatory transaction
reporting requirements are mandated in a number of jurisdictions including the EU, Hong Kong
SAR, Japan, and Singapore; other jurisdictions are in the process of proposing legislation and

munique.pdf.

42

rules to implement these requirements. 74 The EU has adopted legislation for markets in financial
instruments that addresses trading OTC derivatives on regulated trading platforms. 75 This
legislation also should promote post-trade public transparency in OTC derivatives markets by
requiring the price, volume, and time of derivatives transactions conducted on these regulated
trading platforms to be made public in as close to real time as technically possible. 76
Regulation of derivatives central clearing, capital requirements, and margin requirements
aims, among other things, to improve management of financial risks in these markets. 77 Japan
has rules in force mandating central clearing of certain OTC derivatives transactions. 78 The EU
has its legislation in place but has not yet made any determinations of specific OTC derivatives
transactions subject to mandatory central clearing. Most other jurisdictions are still in the
process of formulating their legal frameworks that govern central clearing. A number of major
foreign jurisdictions have initiated the process of drafting rules to implement margin
requirements for OTC derivatives transactions.
5. Cross-market participation
Persons registered as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap
participants are likely also to engage in swap activity, which is subject to regulation by the
CFTC. In the release proposing registration requirements for security-based swap dealers and

major security-based swap participants, we estimated, based on our experience and
understanding of the swap and security-based swap markets that of the 55 firms that might
register as security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants, approximately
35 would also register with the CFTC as swap dealers or major swap participants. 79 Available
data suggest that these numbers remain largely unchanged. 80
This overlap reflects the relationship between single-name CDS contracts, which are
security-based swaps, and index CDS contracts, which may be swaps or security-based swaps.
A single-name CDS contract covers default events for a single reference entity or reference
security. Index CDS contracts and related products make payouts that are contingent on the
default of index components and allow participants in these instruments to gain exposure to the
credit risk of the basket of reference entities that comprise the index, which is a function of the
credit risk of the index components. A default event for a reference entity that is an index
component will result in payoffs on both single-name CDS written on the reference entity and
index CDS written on indices that contain the reference entity. Because of this relationship
between the payoffs of single-name CDS and index CDS contracts, prices of these products
depend upon one another, 81 creating hedging opportunities across these markets.

79

See Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants,
Exchange Act Release No. 65543 (October 12, 2011), 76 FR 65784, 65808 (October 24, 2011).

80

Based on its analysis of 2014 TIW data and the list of swap dealers provisionally-registered with
the CFTC, and applying the methodology used in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release,
we estimate that substantially all registered security-based swap dealers would also register as
swap dealers with the CFTC. See also CFTC list of provisionally registered swap dealers,
available at: http://www.cftc.gov/LawRegulation/DoddFrankAct/registerswapdealer.

81

“Correlation” typically refers to linear relationships between variables; “dependence” captures a
broader set of relationships that may be more appropriate for certain swaps and security-based
swaps. See, e.g., Casella, George and Roger L. Berger, Statistical Inference (2002), at 171.

44

These hedging opportunities mean that participants that are active in one market are
likely to be active in the other. Commission staff analysis of approximately 4,500 TIW accounts
that participated in the market for single-name CDS in 2014 revealed that approximately 2,500
of those accounts, or 56%, also participated in the market for index CDS. Of the accounts that
participated in both markets, data regarding transactions in 2014 suggest that, conditional on an
account transacting in notional volume of index CDS in the top third of accounts, the probability
of the same account landing in the top third of accounts in terms of single-name CDS notional
volume is approximately 60%; by contrast, the probability of the same account landing in the
bottom third of accounts in terms of single-name CDS notional volume is only 11%.
As discussed in more detail below, 82 the CFTC Staff Advisory issued in November 2013
stated the CFTC staff’s belief that the CFTC has a strong supervisory interest in swap dealing
activities that occur within the United States, regardless of the status of the counterparties. The
CFTC Staff Advisory, which we understand to be under review at the CFTC, 83 also stated the
CFTC staff’s belief that a non-U.S. swap dealer “regularly using personnel or agents located in
the U.S. to arrange, negotiate, or execute a swap with a non-U.S. person generally would be
required to comply with” the CFTC’s transaction-level requirements. 84 While CFTC staff has
granted relief from certain aspects of the CFTC Staff Advisory, 85 at least one commenter has
argued that the CFTC’s approach to regulation of swap dealers taken in the CFTC Cross-Border
Guidance has influenced the information that market participants collect and maintain about the

swap transactions they enter into and the counterparties they face. 86 Although that commenter
suggested that swap market participants have also adopted business practices consistent with the
CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, the commenter did not supply particular details as to the scope of
the changes to its operations. 87
The proposed amendments and proposed rule may, to the extent that they are not in
conflict with the approach taken in the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, permit non-U.S. persons
to use infrastructures developed to be consistent with the CFTC’s approach, to comply with
Commission requirements as well. Among those entities that participate in both markets, entities
that are able to apply to security-based swap activity capabilities that are consistent with the
CFTC Cross-Border Guidance may experience lower costs associated with assessing which
cross-border security-based swap activity counts against the dealer de minimis exception or
towards the major participant threshold, relative to those that are unable to redeploy such
capabilities. We remain sensitive to the fact that in cases where our final rules differ from the
CFTC approach, additional outlays related to information collection and storage may be
required.

The commenter further indicates a potential need to “build[] separate systems for a small
percentage of the combined swaps and SBS market instead of using the systems already built for
compliance with the CFTC’s cross-border approach,” suggesting that market participants have
adopted market practices consistent with the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. Id.

III. Application of the Dealer De Minimis Exception to U.S. Security-Based Swap
Dealing Operations of Non-U.S. Persons
A. Overview
The Exchange Act excepts from designation as a “security-based swap dealer” an entity
that engages in a “de minimis” quantity of security-based swap dealing activity with or on behalf
of customers. 88 Under the final rules adopted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release,
a person may take advantage of that exception if, in connection with credit default swaps that
constitute security-based swaps, the person’s dealing activity over the preceding 12 months does
not exceed a gross notional amount of $3 billion, subject to a phase-in level of $8 billion. 89 The
phase-in level will remain in place until—following a study regarding the definitions of
“security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant”—we either terminate
the phase-in period or establish an alternative threshold following rulemaking. 90
The Cross-Border Adopting Release finalized rules specifying, among other things, when
a non-U.S. person is required to include transactions arising from its dealing activity in its de
minimis threshold calculations. 91 These final rules addressed the application of the securitybased swap dealer de minimis exception to such person’s dealing activity involving U.S.-person

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30640-41. Exchange Act rule 3a71-2
establishes a phase-in period during which the de minimis threshold will be $8 billion and during
which Commission staff will study the security-based swap market as it evolves under the new
regulatory framework, resulting in a report that will consider the operation of the “security-based
swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant” definitions. In that release we
explained that at the end of the phase-in period, we will take into account the report, as well as
public comment on the report, in determining whether to terminate the phase-in period or propose
any changes to the rule implementing the de minimis exception, including any increases or
decreases to the $3 billion threshold. See id. at 30640.

counterparties, as well as the dealing activity of a non-U.S. person that is a conduit affiliate 92 or
whose counterparty has a right of recourse under the security-based swap against an affiliated
U.S. person. 93 Although we had proposed requiring a non-U.S. person to include in this
calculation any dealing activity involving another non-U.S.-person counterparty if it resulted in a
“transaction conducted within the United States” as defined in the proposed rule, 94 we did not
address this issue in our Cross-Border Adopting Release. As we noted in that adopting release,
commenters raised a number of significant issues related to this element of the Cross-Border
Proposing Release, including our authority to impose, and the costs of complying with, this
requirement, and we determined that final resolution of this issue would benefit from further
consideration and public comment. 95
In light of those comments and further consideration of the concerns raised by such
transactions and subsequent regulatory and market developments, the statutory objectives, and
the practicability of our initially proposed approach, we have determined to propose an
amendment to Exchange Act rules 3a71-3 and 3a71-5 that more closely focuses on certain
dealing activity carried out, at least in part, by personnel located in the United States. 96 The
proposed amendments would not require a non-U.S. person engaging in dealing activity to
consider the location of its non-U.S.-person counterparty or that counterparty’s agent in
determining whether the transaction needs to be included in its own de minimis calculation.
Instead, the proposed amendments would require a non-U.S. person to include in its de minimis

calculation any transaction connected with its security-based swap dealing activity that it enters
into with a non-U.S.-person counterparty only when the transaction is arranged, negotiated, or
executed by personnel of the non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office, or by personnel
of such person’s agent located in a U.S. branch of office.
As described in more detail below, we preliminarily believe that this proposed approach
would mitigate many of the concerns raised by commenters in response to our initial proposal,
while requiring persons that engage in dealing activity at levels that may raise the types of
concerns that Title VII addresses to register as security-based swap dealers and comply with
appropriate regulation. We also note that this approach would be generally consistent with the
approach that we have followed with respect to the registration of brokers and dealers under the
Exchange Act, which among other things requires that a broker-dealer physically operating in the
United States register with the Commission and comply with relevant regulatory requirements,
even if it directs its activities solely toward non-U.S. persons outside the United States. 97
B. Proposed Application of De Minimis Exception to Non-U.S. Persons Arranging,
Negotiating, or Executing Security-Based Swap Transactions Using Personnel
Located in a U.S. Branch or Office
1. Overview of the initially proposed approach
As we noted in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, dealing activity carried out by a
non-U.S. person through a U.S. branch, office, or affiliate or by a non-U.S. person that otherwise
engages in security-based swap dealing activity in the United States, particularly at levels
exceeding the relevant de minimis thresholds, may raise concerns that Title VII addresses, even
if a significant proportion—or all—of those transactions involve non-U.S.-person

(July 11, 1989), 54 FR 30013 (July 18, 1989).

counterparties. 98 Accordingly, we initially proposed to require any non-U.S. person to include in
its de minimis calculation any security-based swap transaction connected with its dealing
activities that is a “transaction conducted within the United States.” 99 We proposed to define
“transaction conducted within the United States” as any “security-based swap transaction that is
solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked within the United States, by or on behalf of either
counterparty to the transaction, regardless of the location, domicile, or residence status of either
counterparty to the transaction.” 100 Thus, under this initially proposed definition, a non-U.S.
person engaged in dealing activity would have been required to include in its de minimis
calculation any transaction where either the dealer itself or its counterparty, or the agent of either
the dealer or the counterparty, performed relevant security-based swap dealing activity within the
United States. 101

98

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31000-01.

See initially proposed 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii).

100

See initially proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(5). See also Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR 30999-31000. To address anticipated operational challenges associated with
determining whether a person’s counterparty is engaging in dealing activity within the United
States that would make the transaction a “transaction conducted within the United States,” we
also proposed permitting reliance on a representation by a counterparty that the transaction was
not solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked within the United States by or on behalf of that
counterparty. See id. at 31001.

101

As we noted in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the term “transaction conducted within the
United States” was intended to identify key aspects of a transaction that, if carried out within the
United States by either counterparty, would trigger the need for a non-U.S. person acting in a
dealing capacity to include transactions arising out of that activity in its de minimis calculation.
See id. at 30999-31000. The initially proposed definition of “transaction conducted within the
United States” did not include submitting a transaction for clearing in the United States, reporting
a transaction to a security-based swap data repository in the United States, or performing
collateral management activities (such as exchanging margin) within the United States. See id. at
31000.

2. Commenters’ views on the Cross-Border Proposing Release
Our initially proposed definition of “transaction conducted within the United States” and
our proposed use of that term to trigger various Title VII requirements generated a significant
volume of comment addressing a wide range of issues. Although two commenters supported our
proposal, 102 commenters generally criticized the proposed definition. These criticisms generally
focused on four areas: the scope of activity potentially captured by the initially proposed defined
term, the operational difficulties of implementing the defined term, the costs of implementation,
and competitive concerns.
(a) Scope of the initially proposed definition of “transaction conducted
within the United States”
Several commenters took issue with the scope of the initially proposed defined term.
Some commenters argued that the initially proposed definition was inappropriate in the context
of Title VII because it would capture transactions between two non-U.S. persons that happened
to involve conduct within the United States, even though such transactions are unlikely to create
risk to the U.S. financial system. 103 Commenters also expressed concern that the initially

102

See note 26, supra.

103

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at 4, A-3 (explaining that a transaction between two non-U.S.
counterparties does not create risk in the United States, even where it is conducted within the
United States); Letter from European Commission (“EC”) to SEC, dated August 21, 2013 (“EC
Letter”) at 2 (suggesting that the Commission’s rules should not apply to transactions when
conduct within the United States involves two non-U.S. counterparties because no U.S. firms are
at risk); Letter from European Securities and Markets Authority (“ESMA”) to SEC, dated August
21, 2013 (“ESMA Letter”) at 2 (requesting the Commission limit the definition of “transaction
conducted within the United States” to transactions booked within the United States because that
is the only activity that directly creates risk within the United States); Letter from Futures and
Options Association (“FOA”) to SEC, dated August 21, 2013 (“FOA Letter”) at 7 (arguing that
the test as initially proposed does not serve the goals of preserving the integrity of U.S. financial
markets and protecting U.S. counterparties because it reaches transactions with minimal nexus to
the United States).
Two of these commenters suggested that the initially proposed approach exceeded the
Commission’s authority under section 30(c) of the Exchange Act. See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at

51

proposed definition was overly broad because it would capture incidental or peripheral activity
within the United States, 104 arguing that such overbreadth could lead to conflicting or duplicative
application of regulations for certain market participants. 105

4 and A-4 to A-5 (suggesting that Exchange Act section 30(c) does not authorize the Commission
to extend its authority through a conduct-based approach where no risk is imported to the United
States); FOA Letter at 7 (stating that test goes beyond limits of Exchange Act section 30(c)).
Another commenter stated that the initially proposed approach was inappropriate because it
would have the effect of applying Title VII to transactions between two non-U.S. persons without
having an international agreement regarding extraterritorial application of each jurisdiction’s
regulations. See Letter from Japan Securities Dealers Association (“JSDA”) to SEC, dated
August 21, 2013 (“JSDA Letter”) at 3.
104

See Letter from Managed Funds Assoc. and Alternative Investment Management Assoc.
(“MFA/AIMA”) to SEC, dated August 19, 2013 (“MFA/AIMA Letter”) at 4 and n.18 (stating
that the lack of a materiality threshold would inappropriately subject transactions to Commission
regulation, including transactions negotiated during an employee’s visit to the United States);
SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-2 (explaining that “transaction conducted within the United States”
may include incidental conduct, which includes, in this commenter’s view, a decision by a nonU.S. counterparty to use a contact based in the United States to execute a transaction only because
executing it in the non-U.S. counterparties’ jurisdictions would be inconvenient or impossible due
to the timing of the transaction); Letter from Pensions Europe to SEC, dated September 3, 2013
(“Pensions Europe Letter”) at 1 (stating that trades executed outside the United States by
European pension fund managers should not be brought within Title VII only because the
managers wish to “benefit from the expertise and experience of U.S. operations”); Letter from
Institute of International Bankers (“IIB”) to SEC, dated August 21, 2013 (“IIB Letter”) at 10
(noting that the initially proposed test could capture transactions where the U.S.-based conduct is
only clerical or ministerial); Letter from Investment Adviser Association (“IAA”) to SEC, dated
August 21, 2013 (“IAA Letter”) at 6-7 (stating that the initially proposed test may capture parties
with minimal connection to the United States, such as a non-U.S. counterparty using a U.S.
investment adviser to manage its assets); Letter from Investment Company Institute (“ICI”) to
SEC, dated August 21, 2013 (“ICI Letter”) at 4, 8-9 (stating that exception from the definition
should be broader for non-U.S. counterparties that use U.S.-based investment managers and that
the retention of a U.S. asset manager should not cause transactions to be subject to various
regulatory requirements because a non-U.S. entity would not expect to be subject to U.S.
regulation based on its retention of a U.S. asset manager); Letter from Japan Financial Markets
Council (“JFMC”) to SEC, dated August 15, 2013 (“JFMC Letter”) at 5 (stating that the
transactions could be captured by the definition solely because they are executed through a U.S.
trading facility).

105

See IIB Letter at 8-9 (explaining that, because European regulations would apply to transactions
between two U.S. branches of European firms, the initially proposed approach would cause
duplicative and conflicting regulation); IIB letter at 10 (stating that a conduct-based test would
subject U.S. agents already registered with the Commission or exempted from registration under
broker-dealer or investment adviser regulations to additional regulation). See also EC Letter at 2
(suggesting that the Commission’s rules should not apply to transactions when the legal
counterparty to a transaction conducted within the United States is a non-U.S. entity because such

(b) Operational challenges
One commenter recognized the concerns that the initially proposed definition of
“transaction conducted within the United States” was intended to address but expressed doubt as
to whether funds would be able to monitor and confirm whether their dealing counterparties were
engaging in dealing activity within the United States. 106 A number of commenters expressed
concern that the defined term and its initially proposed application in the context of specific Title
VII requirements, would present significant operational challenges for market participants more
generally. 107 For example, one commenter noted that the approach would require market
participants to make determinations on a trade-by-trade basis as to whether a transaction was
“conducted within the United States” and would create inefficiencies and uncertainty in the
market. 108 This commenter stated that the initially proposed approach was vague, and would be
difficult to enforce and easy to manipulate. 109 One commenter specifically argued that

persons are subject to regulation in their home jurisdiction); ESMA Letter at 2-3 (noting that the
initially proposed approach could subject a transaction between two non-U.S. persons that is
solicited in the United States to the regulations of multiple jurisdictions); FOA Letter at 7
(requesting that the Commission defer to regulatory oversight of counterparties’ home country
regulators).
106

See MFA/AIMA Letter at 4 (acknowledging the Commission’s interest in preventing evasion of
Title VII but expressing concern that private funds that are not U.S. persons may not be able to
determine whether dealer counterparties have engaged in relevant conduct within the United
States and may not be able to obtain relevant representations from such counterparties).

107

See, e.g., IIB Letter at 11 (stating that the initially proposed definition is ill suited to the global
nature of the derivatives markets where activity may involve multiple physical locations); JFMC
Letter at 4-5 (noting that the initially proposed definition is impracticable and would subject
participants to duplicative and conflicting rules); JSDA Letter at 3 (expressing concern about the
activity-based approach because of the operational confusion it may cause by subjecting market
participants to the two separate approaches of the Commission and CFTC); ABA Letter at 3
(identifying ambiguities in the initially proposed definition, including whether negotiations over
ISDA documentation are relevant conduct for purposes of the transaction).

Letter”) at 3, A-2 to A-3.

53

operational difficulties in tracking the location of conduct on a trade-by-trade basis might be
impossible to overcome. 110
(c) Cost concerns
Some commenters stated that applying Title VII to transactions merely because they
involve conduct within the United States could not be justified from a cost-benefit perspective.
Some contended that the CFTC had not taken such an approach and that divergence from the
CFTC on the treatment of such conduct would impose a significant additional cost on market
participants. 111 One commenter also noted that, whereas the “U.S. person” definition would
typically be applied only at the beginning of a trading relationship, market participants would
potentially be required to perform a trade-by-trade analysis to determine whether it involved
conduct within the United States, which could significantly increase costs. 112
(d) Competitive concerns
Some commenters expressed concern that focusing on “transactions conducted within the
United States” would put brokers and investment managers located in the United States at a
competitive disadvantage to their foreign counterparts, on the grounds that foreign clients would
avoid doing business with them to avoid having their transactions become subject to

110

See IIB Letter at 8.

111

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at 3, A-3, A-6 (arguing that the Commission should harmonize its
approach to cross-border security-based swap activity to the approach reflected in the
commenter’s view of the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance); Pensions Europe Letter at 2 (preferring
its view of the CFTC approach in the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance, which the commenter
argues focuses on the location of principal headquarters); IIB Letter at 8 (stating that market
participants would incur costs and burdens to modify their existing systems in order to comply
with two different tests); JFMC Letter at 4-5 (urging that the Commission not adopt the defined
term “transaction conducted within the United States” because the CFTC did not discuss such an
approach in the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance).

112

See IIB Letter at 8 (stating that a conduct-based test would be costly and disruptive).

Commission regulations. 113 Another commenter, although critical of our initially proposed
definition as excessively costly to implement, urged that any alternative to the conduct-based test
described in the Cross-Border Proposal Release be designed to ensure that market participants
from the United States were not put at a competitive disadvantage. 114
(e) Other concerns
A few commenters, including some who expressed the concerns outlined above, sought
clarification or made suggestions related to limiting the scope of the initially proposed defined
term. 115 One commenter expressed support for the SEC’s position in the proposal that the
location where a transaction is cleared should not factor into determining whether a non-U.S.
person qualifies as a security-based swap dealer. 116 Another commenter requested that, if the
Commission adopts the “transaction conducted within the United States” test, market participants

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-6.

See IIB Letter at 9-11 (requesting clarification as to what degree of solicitation, negotiation, or
execution activity would trigger the initially proposed definition); ESMA Letter at 2-3 (inviting
the Commission to clarify which transactions between a U.S. branch of a foreign firm would be
considered “conducted within the United States” and arguing that location of booking alone
should be considered); FOA Letter at 7 (suggesting that, if a transaction has more than a de
minimis connection to the United States as a result of solicitation or negotiation in the United
States, the Commission should focus its regulatory authority on the intermediary performing
those activities); JSDA Letter at 3 (suggesting that the Commission limit the application of Title
VII to those transactions booked by non-U.S. persons with U.S. persons and requesting that
certain activity related to “operational activities” be excluded from the activity covered by the
initially proposed definition); ABA Letter at 3-4 (supporting the initially proposed definition but
suggesting clarification that it excludes a firm’s centralized risk management and legal and
compliance functions).

should be permitted to rely on their counterparties’ representations as to whether the transaction
was conducted within the United States. 117
3. The CFTC Staff Advisory and responses to the CFTC Request for Comment
As already noted, in November 2013, subsequent to the close of the comment period for
our Cross-Border Proposing Release, CFTC staff issued the CFTC Staff Advisory, which
addressed activity by registered swap dealers occurring within the United States. 118 The CFTC
Staff Advisory stated the CFTC staff’s belief that the CFTC “has a strong supervisory interest in
swap dealing activities that occur within the United States, regardless of the status of the
counterparties” and that a non-U.S. swap dealer “regularly using personnel or agents located in
the U.S. to arrange, negotiate, or execute a swap with a non-U.S. person generally would be
required to comply with” the CFTC’s transaction-level requirements. 119
As noted above, on January 8, 2014, the CFTC published the CFTC Request for
Comment on various aspects of the CFTC Staff Advisory, including whether the CFTC “should
adopt the Staff Advisory as Commission policy, in whole or in part.” 120 In response to this
request, the CFTC received approximately 20 comment letters addressing various aspects of the
CFTC Staff Advisory, including its relationship to the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance and its
general workability given current market practices. CFTC staff subsequently extended no-action
relief related to the CFTC Staff Advisory until the earlier of September 30, 2015, or the effective

obtain, and being able to confirm the accuracy of, such representations. See MFA/AIMA Letter

date of any CFTC action in response to the CFTC Request for Comment. 121 We understand that
the CFTC Staff Advisory and the related comment letters are currently under review by the
CFTC. Although the CFTC Staff Advisory raises issues that are, to a certain degree, distinct
from those raised by our initially proposed definition and use of “transaction conducted within
the United States,” the comments received by the CFTC in response to the CFTC Request for
Comment in many cases elaborate on issues that commenters raised in response to our CrossBorder Proposing Release. Given similarities between the approach set forth in the CFTC Staff
Advisory and our proposed amendments identifying relevant conduct within the United States, in
this section we provide our own brief summary of relevant comments received by the CFTC. 122
A few commenters supported the CFTC Staff Advisory. One commenter urged the
CFTC to formally adopt the approach in the CFTC Staff Advisory, arguing that any weakening
of it would permit “nominally foreign entities” to do business within the United States in
compliance with foreign laws and regulations, or potentially subject to no legal requirements,
rather than with U.S. law. 123 Another commenter stated that formal adoption of the CFTC Staff
Advisory was unnecessary but urged the CFTC to leave it undisturbed, arguing that without the
CFTC Staff Advisory, a U.S. person would effectively be able to enter into transactions with
121

See note 25, supra.

122

As reflected in our discussion throughout this release, we have carefully considered both the
CFTC Staff Advisory and the comments submitted in response to the CFTC’s request for
comment on the CFTC Staff Advisory in developing this proposal. Moreover, in connection with
our statutory obligation to consult with the CFTC in connection with Title VII rulemaking, our
staff have engaged in extensive discussion with CFTC staff regarding our proposed rules. We
note, however, that our discussion of both the CFTC Staff Advisory and the comments received
by the CFTC about it reflects our understanding of these documents. Accordingly, neither our
discussions of these documents nor any preliminary views expressed herein should be interpreted
as necessarily reflecting the views of any other agency or regulator, including the CFTC.

non-U.S. persons through its foreign affiliates while using U.S.-based trading operations,
“thereby evading and gutting the key components of financial reform.” 124
Most commenters, however, opposed the approach taken in the CFTC Staff Advisory.
These commenters expressed several concerns that may also be relevant to our own proposal to
impose certain Title VII requirements on security-based swap activity that is carried out from a
U.S. location, including the following: (1) the scope of the activity that would trigger application
of Title VII, (2) the workability and costs of complying with such a test and resulting effects on
competition and comity, and (3) the CFTC’s transaction-level requirements that should be
triggered by such a test. We will discuss the first two sets of concerns here and the third in
Section V below.
(a) Scope of the CFTC Staff Advisory
Several commenters argued that the scope and types of activity by non-U.S. swap dealers
captured by the CFTC Staff Advisory were unclear. The CFTC Staff Advisory notes that
“persons regularly arranging, negotiating, or executing swaps for or on behalf of [a swap dealer]
are performing core, front-office activities of that [swap dealer’s] dealing business.” 125
Accordingly, it expresses the CFTC staff’s view that the CFTC’s transaction-level requirements
apply to transactions of registered non-U.S. swap dealers with non-U.S.-person counterparties
when they “arrange, negotiate, or execute” those transactions “using personnel or agents located
in the U.S.” 126 Commenters argued that “arrange” and “negotiate” were overly broad and could

encompass activity that occurred only incidentally in the United States. 127 Some commenters
also noted that the apparent scope of the CFTC Staff Advisory was overly broad because nonU.S.-person counterparties may not typically know where the dealer engages in relevant conduct
with respect to a particular swap transaction. 128
Some commenters encouraged the CFTC to address these concerns by providing
“detailed definitions” of the relevant terms or to focus only on execution or other discrete
activities related to the transaction. 129 Several commenters urged the CFTC to abandon the
CFTC Staff Advisory’s approach altogether, or, if not, to revise the CFTC Staff Advisory’s
approach to focus on activities involving direct communication with the counterparty to the
swap. 130

127

See, e.g., Letter from Investment Adviser Association to CFTC, dated March 10, 2014 (“IAA
Letter to CFTC”) at 5; Société Générale Letter to CFTC at 7-8 (arguing that key terms of CFTC
Staff Advisory are ambiguous and do not reflect how swap business is carried out). Some
commenters also raised concerns regarding ambiguity in the CFTC Staff Advisory’s use of the
term “regularly.” See, e.g., Letter from Securities Industry and Financial Markets
Association/Futures Industry Association/Financial Services Roundtable to CFTC, dated March
10, 2014 (“SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter to CFTC”) at 16.

128

See, e.g., Letter from Société Générale to CFTC, dated March 10, 2014 (“Société Générale Letter
to CFTC”) at 8 (stating that “[m]ost clients have no control or knowledge over where their swap
is structured or designed, where the salesperson responsible for a particular product is located,
where the booking of their swap is entered into a trading system, or where their swap is hedged”).

CFTC”) at 3. See also SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter to CFTC at A-8 to A-9; IAA Letter to CFTC at 5

with counterparties, which communications commit the SD to the execution of a particular swap
transaction”); Letter from Barclays to CFTC, dated March 10, 2014 (“Barclays Letter to CFTC”)
at 4 (arguing that “only direct communication with counterparties by non-U.S. swap dealers to the
execution of the transaction should trigger application of the pre-trade disclosure requirements”
and that “the [CFTC] should explicitly exclude electronic or screen-based execution” as such
conduct “does not involve direct interaction” and the “non-U.S. person counterparty will not
know who is responding on behalf of the non-U.S. swap dealer, let alone the responder’s
location,” meaning that “the non-U.S. counterparty will not have a reasonable expectation that the

(b) Workability, costs, and competitive effects of the CFTC’s activitybased approach
Some commenters expressed concern that the CFTC Staff Advisory reflected a
significant departure from the approach that these commenters understood to be the focus of the
CFTC Cross-Border Guidance. 131 These commenters argued that developing systems consistent
with the CFTC Staff Advisory would cause them to incur significant additional costs. 132 In
particular, commenters stated their belief that developing systems consistent with the CFTC Staff
Advisory would require a trade-by-trade analysis, which would be impracticable. 133 One
commenter argued that these costs would not be justified by corresponding benefits because

it should capture only “direct communications by personnel in the United States with

communication, the counterparty has no reason to expect that U.S. law will apply to the
transaction). See also Société Générale Letter to CFTC at 8 (stating that, if the CFTC does adopt
the CFTC Staff Advisory, the CFTC should focus only on salespersons based in the United States

structure by approaching swaps regulation from an entirely different direction, layering even
more requirements and burdens onto market participants, and doing so in the absence of any
discernible risk to U.S. markets”).

market participants likely would already be subject to similar requirements in their home
jurisdiction. 134
One commenter criticized the CFTC Staff Advisory’s focus on whether a registered nonU.S. swap dealer is arranging, negotiating, or executing a swap using personnel or agents in the
United States as providing insufficient guidance to market participants, arguing that these
activities do not reflect current business practices among swap dealers. 135 For example, this
commenter stated that some personnel of a dealer may design swaps and hedging solutions but
lack authority to book the resulting swaps and have no interaction with clients; these same
personnel may book swaps that other employees have sold or negotiated for risk mitigation
purposes. 136 The commenter further noted that personnel involved in a particular swap may be
located in multiple jurisdictions. 137
Several commenters argued that the costs and impracticability of the approach taken in
the CFTC Staff Advisory would have competitive effects, although they disagreed whether it
would enhance or degrade competition. One commenter supported the CFTC Staff Advisory in
its current form, noting that without it, U.S. firms would be at a competitive disadvantage
compared to non-U.S. firms operating in the United States. 138 Other commenters argued that the
CFTC Staff Advisory, if adopted, would have adverse competitive effects on certain end

Some commenters also suggested that, if adopted by the CFTC, the approach taken in the
CFTC Staff Advisory could present difficulties for, and impose costs on, non-U.S.-person
counterparties of dealers, as such counterparties may not currently have systems in place for
complying with certain CFTC requirements, particularly if they are imposed only because the
swap dealer (and not the counterparty) happens to have carried out certain activities using
personnel or agents located in the United States. 140 As a result, commenters argued non-U.S.
swap dealers may no longer service non-U.S.-person counterparties from U.S. locations. 141
Commenters suggested that pressure from non-U.S.-person counterparties that do not
want their transactions to be subject to Title VII would lead at least some non-U.S.-person
dealers to exit the United States. 142 Commenters suggested that the adoption of the CFTC Staff
Advisory would likely interfere with the ability of certain swap dealers to cover U.S. market
hours for foreign counterparties with U.S.-based personnel, increasing costs to counterparties and
end users. 143

4. Dealing activity of non-U.S. persons in the United States
We have carefully considered the views of commenters, as discussed above, that dealing
activity carried out in the United States by a non-U.S. person with a counterparty that is also a
non-U.S. person lacks a significant nexus to the United States and does not raise any significant
regulatory concerns in the United States because the ongoing obligations associated with such
transactions do not reside in the United States. 144 However, as we discuss below, we continue to
believe that such activity falls squarely within our territorial approach to the application of Title
VII 145 and that it raises regulatory concerns of the type that Title VII addresses.
(a) Overview of common business structures for firms engaged in securitybased swap dealing activity
As we noted in our Cross-Border Proposing Release, financial groups engaged in
security-based swap dealing activity use a variety of business models and legal structures to
carry out such activity with counterparties around the world. Most such financial groups operate
in multiple jurisdictions, and they will typically have one or more dealer affiliates in one or more
hours and service their non-U.S. based clients by using U.S.-based personnel or agents”); CDEU
Letter to CFTC at 2-3 (arguing that the CFTC Staff Advisory’s approach would “force non-U.S.
[swap dealers] that use personnel or agents to ‘arrange, negotiate, or execute’ swaps to exit
certain markets or move personnel outside the U.S. in order to remain competitive in non-U.S.
markets[,]” and that the costs associated with such movements would “undoubtedly be passed on
to derivatives end-users and ultimately to customers…[which] would result in a loss of liquidity
that will leave non-U.S. end-user affiliates scrambling to find counterparties to hedge their
risks”). See also SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter to CFTC at A-6 (explaining that the desire of
counterparties to swap dealers to keep their transactions out of the reach of Dodd-Frank will lead
them to pressure non-U.S.-person dealers and foreign branches to move personnel out of the
United States); IAA Letter to CFTC at 3 (explaining that non-U.S.-person dealers may incur
expenses associated with moving personnel out of the United States or hiring personnel in other
jurisdictions, which may potentially lead to increased transaction costs and reduced services for
advisers’ non-U.S. clients, and that these higher costs may drive non-U.S. clients away from U.S.
investment advisers).

See note 103, supra (identifying comment letters arguing that such transactions pose no risk to the
United States or that the Commission lacks a regulatory interest in such transactions).

63

jurisdictions that book the security-based swap transactions related to their security-based swap
dealing business. An affiliate that initially books a transaction may retain the risk associated
with that transaction, or it may lay off that risk to another affiliate via a back-to-back transaction
or an assignment of the security-based swap. 146 These decisions generally reflect the financial
group’s consideration of, among other things, how it may most efficiently manage the risks
associated with its security-based swap positions.
The structure of the group’s market-facing activities that generate the transactions booked
in these affiliates often reflects different considerations. A dealing affiliate established in one
jurisdiction may operate offices (which may serve sales or trading functions) in one or more
other jurisdictions to deal with counterparties in that jurisdiction or in a specific geographic
region, or to ensure that it is able to provide liquidity to counterparties in other jurisdictions, even
when a counterparty’s home financial markets are closed. A dealer also may choose to manage
its trading book in particular reference entities or securities primarily from a trading desk that
can take advantage of local expertise in such products or to gain access to better liquidity, which
may permit it to more efficiently price such products or to otherwise compete more effectively in
the security-based swap market. We understand that a financial group that engages in a dealing
business may have business lines that are carried out in a number of affiliates located in different
jurisdictions, and that personnel of an affiliate may operate under the direction of, or in some
cases, report to personnel of another affiliate within the group; in some cases, such personnel
work on behalf of, or under the supervision of, more than one affiliate in the group.
Moreover, a dealer may carry out these market-facing activities, whether in its home
jurisdiction or in a foreign jurisdiction, using either its own personnel or the personnel of an
146

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 30977-978.

64

affiliated or unaffiliated agent. For example, the dealer may determine that another affiliate in
the financial group employs personnel who possess expertise in relevant products or that have
established sales relationships with key counterparties in a foreign jurisdiction, making it more
efficient to use the personnel of the affiliate to engage in security-based swap dealing activity on
its behalf in that jurisdiction.
Alternatively, the dealer may in some circumstances determine to engage the services of
an unaffiliated agent through which it can engage in dealing activity. For example, a dealer may
determine that using an inter-dealer broker may provide an efficient means of participating in the
inter-dealer market in its own, or in another, jurisdiction, particularly if it is seeking to do so
anonymously or to take a position in products that trade relatively infrequently. 147 Dealers may
also use unaffiliated agents that operate at the direction or request of the dealer to engage in
dealing activity. Such arrangement may be particularly valuable in enabling the dealer to service
clients or access liquidity in jurisdictions in which the dealer or its affiliates have no securitybased swap operations of their own.
We understand that dealers established in foreign jurisdictions (whether affiliated with
U.S.-based financial groups or not) may use any of these structures to engage in dealing activity
in the United States, and that they may seek to engage in dealing activity in the United States to
transact with both U.S. and non-U.S.-person counterparties. In transactions with non-U.S.person counterparties, a foreign dealer may affirmatively seek to engage in dealing activity in the
United States because the sales personnel of the foreign dealer (or of its agent) in the United

147

We understand that inter-dealer brokers may provide voice or electronic trading services that,
among other things, permit dealers to take positions or hedge risks in a manner that preserves
their anonymity until the trade is executed. These inter-dealer brokers also may play a
particularly important role in facilitating transactions in less-liquid security-based swaps.

65

States have existing relationships with counterparties in other locations (such as Canada or Latin
America) or because the trading personnel of the foreign dealer (or of its agent) in the United
States have the expertise to manage the trading books for security-based swaps on U.S. reference
securities or entities. And we understand that some foreign dealers engage in dealing activity in
the United States through their personnel (or personnel of their affiliates) in part to ensure that
they are able to provide their own counterparties, or those of financial group affiliates in other
jurisdictions, with access to liquidity (often in non-U.S. reference entities) during U.S. business
hours, permitting them to meet client demand even when the home markets are closed. In some
cases, such as when seeking to transact with other dealers through an inter-dealer broker, a
foreign dealer may act, in a dealing capacity, in the United States through an unaffiliated, thirdparty agent.
(b) Statutory scope and policy concerns arising from security-based swap
dealing activity in the United States
As discussed above, some commenters have suggested that the Title VII statutory
framework does not extend to transactions between two non-U.S. persons, even if security-based
swap activity occurs in the United States, and have argued that section 30(c) of the Exchange Act
limits our authority to reach this conduct. 148 We continue to believe, however, that it is
consistent with the Exchange Act to impose specific Title VII requirements on non-U.S. persons
that engage in activity within the United States that is regulated by the relevant statutory
provision. 149

148

See note 103, supra.

149

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47287. As we noted in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release, when the statutory text does not describe the relevant activity with specificity or
provides for further Commission interpretation of statutory terms or requirements, our territorial
analysis may require us to identify through interpretation of the statutory text the specific activity

66

In the Cross-Border Adopting release, we described how this approach applies in the
specific context of the definition of “security-based swap dealer.” We rejected the view that “the
location of risk alone should . . . determine the scope of an appropriate territorial application of
every Title VII requirement,” including the application of the “security-based swap dealer”
definition. 150 In doing so, we noted that “neither the statutory definition of ‘security-based swap
dealer,’ our subsequent further definition of the term pursuant to section 712(d) of the DoddFrank Act, nor the regulatory requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers focus
solely on risk to the U.S. financial system.” 151
Instead, the statute identifies specific activities that bring a person within the definition of
“security-based swap dealer”: (1) holding oneself out as a dealer in security-based swaps, (2)
making a market in security-based swaps; (3) regularly entering into security-based swaps with
counterparties as an ordinary course of business for one’s own account; or (4) engaging in any
activity causing oneself to be commonly known in the trade as a dealer in security-based
swaps. 152 We have further interpreted this definition to apply to persons engaged in indicia of
dealing activity, including, among other things, providing liquidity to market professionals,
providing advice in connection with security-based swaps, having regular clientele and actively
soliciting clients, and using inter-dealer brokers. 153 Neither the statutory definition of “security-

that is relevant under the statute or to incorporate prior interpretations of the relevant statutory
text. See id.

151

Id. at 47288. We have also noted that security-based swap dealer regulation may be warranted
either to promote market stability and transparency in light of the role that these dealers occupy in
the security-based swap market or to address concerns raised by the nature of the interactions
between such dealers and their counterparties. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release,
77 FR 30617.

152

See Exchange Act section 3(a)(71)(A), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)(A).

67

based swap dealer” nor our further definition of that term turns primarily on the presence of risk
or on the purchase or sale of any security, including a security-based swap. 154
Accordingly, the fact that the counterparty credit risk from a transaction between two
non-U.S. persons, where neither counterparty has a right of recourse against a U.S. person under
the security-based swap, exists largely outside the United States is not determinative under our
territorial analysis. The appropriate analysis, in our view, is whether a non-U.S. person in such a
transaction is engaged, in the United States, in any of the activities set forth in the statutory
definition or in our further definition of “security-based swap dealer.” If it is so engaged, in our
view, it is appropriate under a territorial approach to require the non-U.S. person to include such
transaction in its security-based swap dealer de minimis threshold calculations and, if those
security-based swaps (and any other security-based swaps it is required to include in its threshold
calculations) exceed the de minimis threshold, to register as a security-based swap dealer. 155
This analysis applies regardless of whether the non-U.S. person engages in dealing
activity (as described in the statutory definition and in our further definition of “security-based
swap dealers”) in the United States using its own personnel or using the personnel of an agent
acting on its behalf. As described above, persons engaged in security-based swap dealing
activity routinely do so both directly and through their agents. Indeed, our further definition of
154

See Exchange Act section 3(a)(71)(A), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)(A); Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, 77 FR 30617-18.

155

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47286-92 (describing the Commission’s territorial
approach). We note that another commenter argued that it was inappropriate to use activity in the
United States to trigger application of Title VII absent an international agreement between
regulators. See note 103, supra. As discussed above, we have continued to consult and
coordinate with other regulators in the United States and abroad in connection with financial
market reforms, see note 12 and accompanying discussion, but we do not believe that an
international agreement is relevant as a legal or policy matter in determining whether to impose
Title VII requirements on security-based swap activity, particularly given that we are proposing
to do so with respect to activity that is being carried out in the United States.

68

“security-based swap dealer” specifically identifies the use of inter-dealer brokers as one of
several indicia of security-based swap dealing activity, 156 and, in our preliminary view, engaging
an inter-dealer broker as agent or sending a trade to such a broker generally would be dealing
activity; to the extent that this activity is directed to a broker in the United States, we
preliminarily believe that the non-U.S. person would be engaged in dealing activity in the United
States. 157 Accordingly, a non-U.S. person that reaches into the United States by engaging an
agent (including an inter-dealer broker) to perform dealing activity on its behalf is itself engaged,
at least in part, in dealing activity in the United States. We preliminarily believe that it is
appropriate under a territorial approach to require the non-U.S. person to include transactions
arising out of those activities in its own de minimis threshold calculations.
Finally, in light of the foregoing analysis, we note that the statutory prohibition on
application of Title VII requirements to persons that “transact[] a business in security-based
swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States” has no bearing on these proposed rules. 158
Our proposed approach, as described in further detail below, would require transactions to be
included in a non-U.S. person’s dealer de minimis threshold calculations only when, in
connection with its dealing activity, it arranges, negotiates, or executes a security-based swap
using its personnel (or personnel of its agent) located in the United States. 159 Because we are

156

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30617-18 (further defining “securitybased swap dealer”).

157

More generally, we note that the routine use by dealers of the structures described in this
discussion suggest that a person may engage in dealing activity through an agent in a manner very
similar to such activity carried out through its own branch or office. Cf. Exchange Act section
3(a)(71)(A) (defining “security-based swap dealer”); Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release,
77 FR 30617-18 (further defining “security-based swap dealer”).

158

See Exchange Act section 30(c).

See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(1).

69

focusing in this proposal solely on transactions in which the non-U.S. person is engaged, directly
or indirectly, in dealing activity in the United States, the proposed rules would not impose
requirements on non-U.S. persons that are “transacting a business in security-based swaps
without the jurisdiction of the United States” for purposes of section 30(c). 160 Accordingly,
because such activities occur within the United States, they, and any resulting transaction, are
within the scope of Title VII.
Moreover, we preliminarily believe that requiring these transactions to be included in a
non-U.S. person’s dealer de minimis threshold calculations (and subjecting them to certain other
Title VII requirements, as discussed below) is consistent with the regulatory objectives furthered
by the relevant Title VII requirements. Under the rules we adopted in the Cross-Border
Adopting Release, financial groups may seek to avoid application of Title VII requirements to
their security-based swap dealing activity with non-U.S. persons (including with other dealers),
160

As noted above, we do not believe that our proposed approach applies Title VII to persons that
are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United
States,” within the meaning of section 30(c) of the Exchange Act. An approach that, for example,
treated a non-U.S. person dealer that used an agent, whether affiliated or unaffiliated, in the
United States to carry out some or all of its dealing business with non-U.S. persons (for example,
because using a U.S. agent allowed it to leverage higher liquidity and lower spreads in U.S.
reference entities) as transacting a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the
United States, would, in our view, reflect an understanding of what it means to conduct a
security-based swaps business within the jurisdiction of the United States that is divorced both
from Title VII’s statutory objectives and from the various structures that non-U.S. persons use to
engage in security-based swap dealing activity. But in any event we also preliminarily believe
that this proposed rule is necessary or appropriate as a prophylactic measure to help prevent the
evasion of the provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act, and thus
would help prevent the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act from being undermined. See
Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47291-92 (interpreting anti-evasion provisions of
Exchange Act section 30(c)). Without this rule, non-U.S. persons could simply carry on a dealing
business within the United States with other non-U.S. persons through agents and remain outside
of the application of the dealer requirements of Title VII. Permitting this activity would allow
these firms to retain full access to the benefits of operating in the United States while avoiding
compliance with, for example, recordkeeping and reporting requirements and Regulation SBSR,
which could reduce transparency in the U.S. market and make it considerably more difficult for
the Commission to monitor the market for manipulation or other abusive practices.

70

even though they continue to carry out day-to-day sales and trading operations in the United
States in a manner largely unchanged from what we understand to be current business
practices. 161 For market participants, avoiding Title VII in such transactions in the absence of
these proposed rules would require them only to book any such transactions in non-U.S. person
dealers whose obligations under such swaps are not guaranteed by a U.S. person. Doing so
would allow them to perform any other activities in connection with the transaction in the United
States without complying with Title VII requirements.
Such a reaction could result in a significant amount of security-based swap dealing
activity continuing to be engaged in by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, 162 but,
because the financial group chooses to book the transactions in a non-U.S.-person affiliate whose
obligations under a security-based swap are not guaranteed by a U.S. person, certain Title VII
requirements may not apply to such dealing activity. A dealer could continue to transact
security-based swaps with other dealers (and with non-U.S. persons that are not dealers) through
a U.S. sales and trading desk that is staffed by its own personnel or the personnel of its agent,
continuing to engage in market-facing activity in the United States without complying with any
Title VII requirements.

161

We understand that there may be significant advantages in continuing to carry out certain marketfacing activities using personnel located in the United States, depending on the location of the
counterparty and the nature of the reference security or entity. For example, market expertise in
security-based swaps on U.S. reference entities may be located primarily in the United States, and
relationships with counterparties in certain geographical regions may be managed out of a U.S.
branch or office. See Section III.B.4(a), supra.

162

This dealing activity likely would constitute inter-dealer activity, which, as noted above, accounts
for a majority of activity in the security-based swap market. See Section II.B.2, supra. To the
extent that there are advantages to trading U.S. reference entities from a U.S. location, activity by
personnel located in the United States may account for a significant proportion of the inter-dealer
business on those reference entities.

71

Although such transactions may not give rise to counterparty-credit risk within the United
States, they do raise other regulatory concerns, particularly when a firm is engaged in such
activity at levels above the dealer de minimis thresholds. We note that significant levels of
security-based swap dealing activity occurring within the United States without being subject to
dealer regulation or Regulation SBSR may pose a risk to the integrity of the U.S. financial
market, as the absence of regulation—and of access, for example, to the security-based swap
dealer’s books and records—may make it significantly more difficult for the Commission to
monitor the market for abusive and manipulative practices connected with security-based swap
activity in the United States. As we have noted elsewhere, Title VII recordkeeping requirements
will likely be the Commission’s primary tool in monitoring compliance with applicable securities
laws, including the antifraud provisions of these laws. 163 To the extent that we do not have
access to reports of such transactions available through registered SDRs or to the books and
records of non-U.S.-person dealers using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office,
manipulative or abusive trading practices within the United States are more likely to go
undetected, which may undermine the integrity of the security-based swap market in the United
States, and of the U.S. financial market more generally. 164 For example, a dealer using personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office may employ a trader who engages in trading practices in
163

and Broker-Dealers; Capital Rule for Certain SBSDs; Proposed Rules, Exchange Act Release No.

164

These concerns may arise whether the dealer is using its own personnel or personnel of an
affiliated or unaffiliated agent. For example, a security-based swap dealer may provide its
agent’s personnel located in a U.S. branch or office with false or misleading information
concerning the transaction, which the agent’s personnel then may deliver to the counterparty.

72

connection with security-based swap transactions that render the dealing activity in the United
States abusive or manipulative, but we may not be able to readily identify the abusive or
manipulative nature of that dealing activity without access to the dealer’s books and records. 165
Detecting misconduct may be particularly challenging if a significant proportion of transactions
in the relevant security-based swaps are carried out in the United States by traders employed by
unregistered dealers.
Moreover, these dealers could continue to trade—using U.S. sales and trading desks, and
potentially the same sales and trading desks used by their registered security-based swap dealer
affiliates—in the inter-dealer market in a manner that may be opaque to regulators and nondealers alike. This risk, in our preliminary view, is particularly high given that, as we have
noted, inter-dealer activity accounts for a significant proportion of all security-based swap
activity. This activity, to the extent it is carried out by personnel located in the United States,
should be subject to relevant regulatory requirements. Subjecting such transactions to
Regulation SBSR and potentially requiring firms engaged in such activity to register as securitybased swap dealers should bring additional transparency to what is likely to be a significant
proportion of the security-based swap activity that occurs in the United States and provide
market participants more confidence in the integrity of the market.

165

A registered security-based swap dealer that is engaged in abusive or manipulative conduct with
respect to a series of transactions may lay off risk from a transaction with a U.S. person
counterparty to a foreign unregistered dealer via an affiliated foreign unregistered dealer, using
personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. This conduct may not be apparent from the U.S.
counterparty-facing leg or the inter-affiliate leg. Thus, even if the affiliated or unaffiliated agent
has independent obligations arising from its role in the transaction, these obligations may not
address potential abusive or manipulative practices in the transactions. Moreover, detecting such
misconduct on the part of the affiliated foreign unregistered dealer, as discussed above, may be
difficult absent access to regulatory reports of the relevant transactions and to the books and
records of such dealer.

73

In light of these concerns, we preliminarily believe that it is appropriate to propose rules
that would impose certain Title VII requirements on dealers using personnel located in the
United States to engage in security-based swap dealing activity.

exception to non-U.S. persons using personnel located in a U.S. branch or
office to arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swap transactions
We have carefully considered the proposed application of the dealer de minimis
exception to “transactions conducted within the United States” in light of comments received on
the proposal, subsequent regulatory and other developments in the security-based swap market,
and the policy concerns described in the preceding section. As a result, we are proposing an
amendment to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3 that should address the regulatory concerns raised by
dealing activity carried out using personnel located in the United States while mitigating many of
the concerns expressed by commenters. Under this modified approach, we focus on marketfacing activity by personnel located in the United States that reflects, in our view, a dealer’s
determination to engage in dealing activity in the United States in a manner that warrants, if the
dealer exceeds the security-based swap dealer de minimis thresholds, application of Title VII
security-based swap dealer regulation.
Unlike the initial proposal, which included the defined term “transaction conducted
within the United States,” the proposed amendment would not include a separate defined term
identifying such activity. Rather, we propose to amend Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii) to
require a non-U.S. person engaged in security-based swap dealing activity to include in its de
minimis calculations any transactions connected with its security-based swap dealing activity
that it arranges, negotiates, or executes using its personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, or

74

using personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. 166 To the extent that a non-U.S.
person, in connection with its dealing activity, engages in market-facing activity using personnel
located in the United States, we preliminarily believe that it is reasonable to conclude that the
person is performing activities that fall within the statutory definition of “security-based swap
dealer” or our further definition of that term, as described above, at least in part in the United
States. 167
This proposed amendment reflects our reconsideration of the issues raised by securitybased swap dealing activity involving two non-U.S. persons in which one or both parties, or the
agents of one or both parties, using personnel located in the United States, engage in some
dealing activity. 168 We preliminarily believe that requiring non-U.S. persons to include such
transactions in their de minimis threshold calculations will help to ensure that all persons that
166

See proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C). Because, as a threshold matter, a person
would be required to include in its de minimis calculations only security-based swaps that are
arranged, negotiated, or executed in connection with its dealing activity, a non-U.S. person would
not be required to include in this calculation transactions solely on the basis that they were
submitted for clearing in the United States or because activities related to collateral management
of the transaction, such as the exchange of margin, occurred within the United States. See CrossBorder Proposing Release, 78 FR 31000.

167

Non-U.S. persons engaged in security-based swap dealing activity may include persons whose
counterparties have legal recourse against a U.S. person arising out of the security-based swap
transactions of the non-U.S. person or persons that are conduit affiliates. As noted above, our
Cross-Border Adopting Release finalized rules providing that a non-U.S. person must include in
its dealer de minimis calculation transactions arising out of its dealing activity with counterparties
that are U.S. persons, or such transactions with non-U.S. persons if it is a conduit affiliate or if its
counterparty has a right of recourse against a U.S. person under the security-based swap, even if
it is not engaging in dealing activity using personnel located in the United States to arrange,
negotiate, or execute the transaction. See Exchange Act rules 3a71-3(a)(1), (b)(1)(ii), and
(b)(1)(iii)(B). Nothing in the proposed amendment to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3 should be
construed to affect any person’s obligations created by any of these previously adopted rules.

168

As noted above, some commenters argued that transactions between two non-U.S. persons do not
create risk within the United States and should therefore not be subject to Title VII. See note 103,
supra. As we have discussed above, however, even if such transactions do not raise counterparty
credit risk in the United States, such transactions raise concerns about the integrity and
transparency of the U.S. financial market. See discussion in Section III.B.4, supra (citing and
responding to comment letters making this argument).

75

engage in significant relevant dealing activity, including activity engaged in by personnel located
in a U.S. branch or office, are required to register as security-based swap dealers and to comply
with relevant Title VII requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers. 169
At the same time, this proposed approach is intended to avoid unnecessary costs and
complexity that may make it difficult for market participants to comply with such requirements.
We recognize commenters’ concerns that our initially proposed approach to “transactions
conducted within the United States” potentially could have imposed significant costs on, and
presented compliance challenges to, market participants. As some commenters noted, the
initially proposed definition of “transaction conducted within the United States” was sufficiently
broad that it might have encompassed conduct within the United States by either counterparty to
the transaction that could be characterized as “incidental.” 170 In addition, market participants
may have incurred costs associated with monitoring the location of relevant personnel acting on
behalf of their counterparty and/or obtaining relevant representations from their counterparty on
a transaction-by-transaction basis, potentially increasing compliance costs significantly. 171 We

169

We note that some commenters urged us to abandon an activity-based approach entirely because,
in their view, the CFTC had not adopted such an approach and, diverging from the CFTC by
imposing such an approach on security-based swap transactions would result in significant
additional costs for market participants. See note 111, supra. As noted above, however, although
the CFTC has not finalized its view on such an approach, the CFTC Staff Advisory provided the
CFTC staff view that non-U.S. swap dealers should comply with certain requirements with
respect to swap transactions arranged, negotiated, or executed in the United States. See note 21,
supra, and accompanying discussion. Although the CFTC Staff Advisory does not appear to
address inclusion of swaps arranged, negotiated, or executed in the United States in the dealer de
minimis calculations of non-U.S. persons, the test set forth in proposed Exchange Act rule 3a713(b)(1)(iii)(C) is similar to the approach suggested by the CFTC Staff Advisory for determining
the applicability of certain transaction-level requirements. See Section III.B.3, supra.

170

See note 104, supra (citing comments expressing concern that the initially proposed definition of
“transaction conducted within the United States” would capture incidental conduct within the
United States).

171

See notes 108-110, supra.

76

preliminarily believe that our proposed approach of focusing solely on whether the non-U.S.
person engaged in dealing activity is using personnel located in the United States to arrange,
negotiate, or execute the security-based swap would address these concerns in a more workable
manner. Consistent with this focus on the location of activity carried out by the personnel of the
dealer or of its agent, the non-U.S. person engaged in dealing activity would not be required to
consider the location of its counterparty’s operations (or that of the counterparty’s agent) in
determining whether the transaction should be included in its own de minimis calculation.
In the following subsections, we describe key elements of the proposed amendment to
Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii), and address comments of particular relevance with respect
to each element.
(a) “Arranging, negotiating, or executing” a security-based swap
transaction
Proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) would apply only to transactions connected with a
non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that its personnel (or the personnel of an
agent) located in the United States arrange, negotiate, or execute. The proposed approach,
accordingly, would reach a narrower range of activity than did the initially proposed rules that
included the term “transaction conducted within the United States,” which would have included
any transaction solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked, by either party, within the United
States. 172
Consistent with our explanation for initially proposing the term “transaction conducted
within the United States,” we intend, for purposes of the proposed rule, “arrange” and

172

As noted above, the initially proposed rule would have required non-U.S. persons to include in
their de minimis calculation any “transaction conducted within the United States” related to their
dealing activity. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 30999-00.

77

“negotiate” to indicate market-facing activity of sales or trading personnel in connection with a
particular transaction, including interactions with counterparties or their agents. 173 Also for
purposes of the proposed rule, we intend “execute” to refer to the market-facing act that, in
connection with a particular transaction, causes the person to become irrevocably bound under
the security-based swap under applicable law. “Arranging,” “negotiating,” and “executing” also
include directing other personnel to arrange, negotiate, or execute a particular security-based
swap. 174
We recognize that several commenters expressed concern about the terms used in our
proposed definition of “transaction conducted within the United States” 175 and criticized the use
of the terms “arrange, negotiate, or execute” in the CFTC Staff Advisory, 176 objecting to those
terms both as ambiguous and as not reflective of how swap dealing activity is actually carried out
173

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31000 (noting that “dealing activity is normally
carried out through interactions with counterparties or potential counterparties that include
solicitation, negotiation, execution, or booking of a security-based swap”).
Consistent with the approach taken to the final definition of “transaction conducted through a
foreign branch” adopted in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, the proposed amendment
includes “arrange” instead of “solicit” in recognition of the fact that a dealer, by virtue of being
commonly known in the trade as a dealer, may respond to requests by counterparties to enter into
dealing transactions, in addition to actively seeking out such counterparties. See Cross-Border
Adopting Release, 79 FR 47322 n.381; 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)(A)(iv). Similarly, the proposed
amendment omits reference to where a transaction is booked because, in determining whether
dealing activity involving two non-U.S.-person counterparties occurs within the United States, we
preliminarily believe it is appropriate to focus on the location of the market-facing activity of
personnel arranging, negotiating, or executing the security-based swap on behalf of a non-U.S.
person in connection with its security-based swap dealing activity, as it is the market-facing
activity that raises the types of concerns described above. Cf. note 115, supra. If the transaction
is booked in a U.S. person, of course, that U.S. person is a counterparty to the security-based
swap and is required to include the security-based swap in its own de minimis calculation if the
transaction is in connection with its dealing activity. See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(i).

174

In other words, sales and trading personnel of a non-U.S. person who are located in the United
States cannot simply direct other personnel in carrying out dealing activity that those personnel
would otherwise carry out were those personnel not attempting to avoid application of this rule.

175

See note 115, supra.

176

See, e.g., notes 127 and 129, supra.

78

by market participants, and therefore as unworkable on a trade-by-trade basis. 177 In response, we
clarify that under this proposed amendment, we do not intend market participants to look beyond
those personnel who are involved in, or directing, market-facing activity in connection with a
particular security-based swap. This should enable market participants to identify the location of
relevant activity more efficiently than a test that would require market participants to categorize
personnel according to their functions. The proposed amendment would require such market
participants to focus on whether sales or trading personnel located in the United States engage in
this market-facing activity in connection with a particular transaction, not on where these or
other personnel perform internal functions (such as the processing of trades or other back-office
activities) in connection with that transaction. 178 Accordingly, the involvement of personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office in a transaction, where such personnel do not engage in
market-facing activities with respect to a specific transaction (such as a person who designs the
security-based swap but does not communicate with the counterparty regarding the contract in
connection with a specific transaction and does not execute trades in the contract) would not fall
within the scope of the proposed amendment. 179 Accordingly, preparing underlying

177

See notes 127 and 129, supra. See also notes 107, 112, and 135, supra.

178

One commenter urged the CFTC to exclude from Title VII requirements any transaction executed
electronically. See note 130, supra (citing Barclays Letter to CFTC). However, we do not think
that such an exclusion would be appropriate under our proposed approach given its focus on,
among other things, the location of personnel executing the transaction on behalf of the non-U.S.
person. To the extent that a non-U.S. person is using personnel located in the United States to
execute a security-based swap transaction, that transaction raises regulatory concerns that, at
sufficient volumes, warrant regulation under Title VII. In particular, we note that electronic
execution does not eliminate concerns about abusive or manipulative conduct. See also Section
III.C, infra (discussing proposal to make exception for cleared anonymous transactions
unavailable for security-based swaps arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in
the United States).

179

See note 104, supra (citing IIB Letter arguing that ministerial or clerical activity in the United
States should not trigger application of Title VII). On the other hand, to the extent that personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office engages in market-facing activity normally associated with

79

documentation for the transaction, including negotiation of a master agreement and related
documentation, or performing ministerial or clerical tasks in connection with the transaction as
opposed to negotiating with the counterparty the specific economic terms of a particular securitybased swap transaction, also would not be encompassed by the proposed approach. We
preliminarily believe that activities in the United States that do not involve the arrangement or
negotiation of the economic terms of a specific transaction are unlikely to raise the types of
concerns addressed by the Title VII requirements that we are proposing to apply to such
transactions. 180 Consistent with customary Commission practice, we expect that Commission
staff will monitor the practices of market participants as they develop under any final rules that
we adopt and, if necessary and appropriate, make recommendations to address such
developments.
We preliminarily believe that our proposed amendment should considerably mitigate
concerns raised by commenters regarding the scope and workability of an activity-based test for

sales and trading, the location of that personnel would be relevant, even if the personnel are not
formally designated as sales persons or traders.
180

Similarly, a transaction would not be captured under the proposed amendment merely because a
U.S.-based attorney is involved in negotiations regarding the terms of the transaction.
We also are not proposing to include either submitting a transaction for clearing in the United
States or reporting a transaction to an SDR in the United States as activity that would cause a
transaction to be arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in the United States
under the proposed rule, nor are we proposing to treat activities related to collateral management
(e.g., exchange of margin payments) that may occur in the United States or involve U.S. banks or
custodians as activity conducted within the United States for these purposes. We recognize that
submission of a transaction for clearing to a CCP located in the United States poses risk to the
U.S. financial system, and collateral management plays a vital role in an entity’s financial
responsibility program and risk management. However, we preliminarily believe that none of
these activities, by themselves, would raise the types of concerns associated with dealing activity.
See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31000. Cf. note 116, supra (citing comment letter
urging that application of Title VII not be triggered by the location at which a transaction is
cleared).

80

application of Title VII requirements. 181 Because the proposed amendment requires a non-U.S.
person to include a security-based swap in its de minimis calculation based solely on where it
(and not its counterparty) arranges, negotiates, or executes the security-based swap, a non-U.S.
person that is acting in a dealing capacity in a particular transaction would need to identify the
location of its personnel (or that of its agent’s personnel) involved in market-facing activity with
respect to the transaction, but not the location of its counterparty. 182
Some commenters urged that an activity-based test, if implemented, should look only to
where the relevant transaction was executed, or where the dealer’s personnel committed the
dealer to the trade. 183 Although we recognize that focusing solely on where a security-based
swap was executed (and not where it was arranged or negotiated) may meaningfully reduce
certain costs associated with the proposed amendment, we preliminarily believe that looking
solely to the location of execution could permit non-U.S. persons engaged in security-based
swap dealing activity using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office to avoid falling within
the definition of “security-based swap dealer” simply by ensuring that execution is performed by
personnel located outside the United States, even if the non-U.S. person uses personnel located

181

See, e.g., notes 108-110 and 115, supra.

182

One commenter supported the initially proposed term “transaction conducted within the United
States” in part because the commenter believed that it would help capture offshore funds with a
“U.S. nexus,” given that it would have encompassed all security-based swap trading activity
carried out by investment managers within the United States. See note 26, supra (citing Citadel
Letter). Under the narrower scope of activity captured in our proposed amendment, such activity
of a person not engaged in dealing activity would not require the transaction to be included in the
de minimis threshold calculation of its dealer counterparty. We note, however, that our rule
defining “principal place of business in the United States” as applied to externally managed
investment vehicles should help ensure that those funds whose security-based swap activities may
pose risks to U.S. financial institutions, even when transacting with non-U.S. dealers, are treated
as U.S. persons. See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii); Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR
47310.

See notes 129-130, supra.

81

in a U.S. branch or office to perform all other key aspects of its dealing activity. We also note
that the “security-based swap dealer” definition encompasses a number of activities, including
holding oneself out as a dealer or market-making, 184 which suggests that it is appropriate to focus
on the location of a wider range of market-facing activity.
(b) “Located in a U.S. branch or office”
Proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) would apply only to transactions connected with a
non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that are arranged, negotiated, or executed
by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. 185 This element of the proposed amendment
should mitigate the likelihood, noted by several commenters, 186 that a non-U.S.-person dealer
would be required to include in its de minimis calculations transactions that involve activity by
personnel of the non-U.S. person or personnel of its agent who are not assigned to a U.S. branch
or office, but instead are only incidentally present in the United States when they arrange,
negotiate, or execute the transaction. The proposed amendment generally would not require a
non-U.S. person to consider activity of personnel who are not located in a U.S. branch or office,
such as participation in negotiations of the terms of a security-based swap by an employee of the

184

See Exchange Act section 3(a)(71)(A)(ii); Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR
30617-18.

185

As noted above, however, if personnel located in a non-U.S. branch or office are arranging,
negotiating, or executing a particular security-based swap at the specific direction (i.e., engaging
in dealing activity of the U.S. person that the U.S. person would carry out itself were it not
attempting to avoid Title VII) of personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, we would view that
transaction as having been arranged, negotiated, or executed by the personnel located in the
United States. See note 174 and accompanying text, supra.

186

See note 104, supra (citing comments expressing concern that the initially proposed definition of
“transaction conducted within the United States” would capture incidental conduct within the
United States).

82

dealer assigned to a foreign office who happens to be traveling within the United States. 187 We
preliminarily believe that this type of activity is incidental and therefore not likely to raise the
concerns that the proposed approach is intended to address to the same degree as dealing activity
carried out by personnel who are located in a U.S. branch or office. 188
The proposed amendment would, however, not exclude security-based swap transactions
that the non-U.S. person, in connection with its dealing activity, arranges, negotiates, or
executes, using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office to respond to inquiries from a nonU.S.-person counterparty outside business hours in the counterparty’s jurisdiction. We
preliminarily believe that a non-U.S. person that uses sales or trading personnel located in a U.S.
branch or office to engage in market-facing activity in connection with its dealing activity is
likely to raise Title VII concerns, regardless of either counterparty’s motivations for entering into
the transaction. 189 Accordingly, we preliminarily do not believe that it would be appropriate to
exclude from the de minimis calculation transactions arising from such activity by personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office because their assignment to a U.S. branch or office suggests
that the presence of such personnel in the United States is not “incidental.”
We preliminarily believe that this element of the proposed amendment also should
mitigate the burdens associated with determining whether a particular transaction needs to be
187

Because proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) applies only to the security-based swap
dealing activity, it does not limit, alter, or address any guidance regarding our views or
interpretation of any similar provisions of the federal securities laws, including those applicable
to brokers or dealers under the Exchange Act, or investment advisers under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, Commission rules, regulations, interpretations, or guidance.

188

See Section III.B.4, supra.

189

One commenter described these transactions as being carried out on an “exception basis.” See
IIB Letter to CFTC at 12. See also note 143, supra. Other commenters urged us not to use
“incidental” activity in the United States to trigger application of Title VII or suggested that we
establish a materiality threshold. See note 104, supra (citing MFA/AIMA Letter and
SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter).

83

included in a non-U.S. person’s de minimis calculation. 190 We acknowledge that the proposed
amendment potentially would lead a market participant to perform a trade-by-trade analysis to
determine the location of relevant personnel performing market-facing activity in connection
with the transaction. However, because the proposed amendment encompasses a person’s
dealing activity only when its personnel or personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or
office have arranged, negotiated, or executed the transaction, a non-U.S. person performing this
analysis should be able to identify for purposes of ongoing compliance the specific sales and
trading personnel whose involvement in market-facing activity would require a transaction to be
included in its de minimis calculation. 191 Alternatively, such non-U.S. person may establish
policies and procedures that would facilitate compliance with this proposed amendment by
requiring transactions connected with its dealing activity to be arranged, negotiated, and
executed by personnel located outside the United States. 192
(c) “Personnel of such non-U.S. person” or “personnel of an agent”
Proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) would apply to transactions connected with a non-U.S.
person’s security-based swap dealing activity that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by
personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, whether the non-U.S. person arranges, negotiates, or
executes the transaction directly using its own personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, or
does so using personnel of an agent of such non-U.S. person, located in a U.S. branch or office.
190

See notes 108-110, and 133-134, supra.

191

We preliminarily believe that persons engaged in dealing activity may already identify personnel
involved in market-facing activity with respect to specific transactions in connection with
regulatory compliance policies and procedures and to facilitate compensation.

192

In addition, we note that some market participants engaged in both swap dealing and securitybased swap dealing activity may perform a similar analysis consistent with CFTC Staff Advisory,
which clarifies the CFTC staff’s view that Title VII requirements apply to transactions arranged,
negotiated, or executed in the United States by, or on behalf of, swap dealers. See notes 21 and
169, supra, and accompanying discussion.

84

As noted above, a non-U.S. person engaged in security-based swap dealing activity with
other non-U.S. persons, if it wishes to avail itself of the expertise of sales, trading, and other
personnel located in the United States, may carry out that activity using its own personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office, or using the personnel of its agent, located in a U.S. branch or
office. 193 We preliminarily believe that dealing activity carried out within the United States by a
non-U.S. person is likely to raise the concerns that the proposed approach is intended to
address, 194 whether that dealing activity is carried out by the non-U.S. person’s personnel located
in a U.S. branch or office or on its behalf by the personnel of its agent, located in a U.S. branch

193

For purposes of proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C), we would interpret the term “personnel” in a
manner consistent with the definition of “associated person of a security-based swap dealer”
contained in section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(70), regardless of whether
such non-U.S. person or such non-U.S. person’s agent is itself a security-based swap dealer. This
definition is, in turn, substantially similar to the definition of “associated person of a broker or
dealer” in section 3(a)(18) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(18). The definition in section
3(a)(18) is intended to encompass a broad range of relationships that can be used by firms to
engage in and effect securities transactions, and is not dependent solely on whether a natural
person is technically an “employee” of the entity in question. See Alexander C. Dill, BrokerDealer Regulation Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934: The Case of Independent
Contracting, 1994 COLUM. BUS. L. REV. 189, 211-213 (1994) (noting that the Securities Act
Amendments of 1964, which amended section 3(a)(18) of the Exchange Act, “rationalized and
refined the concept of ‘control’ by firms over their sales force by introducing the concept of an
‘associated person’ of a broker-dealer.”). Accordingly, we would expect to examine whether a
particular entity is able to control or supervise the actions of an individual when determining
whether such person is considered to be “personnel” of a U.S. branch, office, or agent of a
security-based swap dealer. This is particularly relevant in the context of a financial group that
engages in a security-based swap dealing business, where personnel of one affiliate may operate
under the direction of, or in some cases, report to personnel of another affiliate within the group.

Relationships with, Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds, BHCA-1 (Dec. 10, 2013), 59 FR

commonly referred to as the Volcker Rule, that the relevant “trading desk” of a banking entity
“may manage a financial exposure that includes positions in different affiliated legal entities” and
similarly “may include employees working on behalf of multiple affiliated legal entities or
booking trades in multiple affiliated entities”) (internal citations omitted).

or office. 195 Accordingly, we are proposing to require non-U.S. persons to include in their de
minimis calculations any transactions in connection with their security-based swap dealing
activity that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of such persons located in a U.S.
branch or office, or by personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. 196
We considered the view of at least one commenter that our existing broker-dealer regime
would be sufficient to address any concerns raised by personnel of its agent in the United States
acting on behalf of a non-U.S. person engaged in security-based swap dealing activity. 197
Because the Exchange Act defines security-based swaps as securities, an agent acting on behalf
of a non-U.S. person that is engaged in security-based swap dealing activity generally would be
195

We preliminarily believe that it is appropriate for the proposed amendment to take into account
where personnel of the non-U.S. person’s agent are arranging, negotiating, or executing the
transaction on behalf of the non-U.S. person, regardless of whether the agent is affiliated with the
non-U.S. person, as security-based swap dealing activity carried out through an unaffiliated agent
may raise the same concerns as such activity carried out through an affiliated agent. See note
164, supra.

196

Two commenters raised concerns that our initially proposed rule could put U.S. brokers and
investment managers at a competitive disadvantage by subjecting all security-based swap
transactions in which they are involved, including those in which they are performing services on
behalf of non-U.S. persons, to the relevant provisions of Title VII under the initially proposed
definition of “transaction conducted within the United States.” See note 113, supra (citing IIB
Letter and SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter); note 104, supra (citing Pensions Europe Letter, IAA Letter,
and ICI Letter). The re-proposed approach should mitigate this concern on the part of investment
managers, as proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) would look only to the location of
the dealing counterparty’s activity, meaning that the location of the investment adviser will be
immaterial to its dealing counterparty’s de minimis calculation under the proposed amendment.
This approach would also address concerns expressed by one commenter that private funds may
have difficulty identifying whether their dealer counterparties are engaged in dealing activity in
the United States. See note 106, supra.
However, under the proposed approach a non-U.S. person that uses a broker as its agent to
arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swap transactions in connection with that non-U.S.
person’s dealing activity would be required to include those transactions in its own de minimis
calculations. We recognize that this approach may make certain brokers less able to compete for
the business of non-U.S.-person dealers that would otherwise not be arranging, negotiating, or
executing transactions using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, but given the regulatory
concerns such transactions may raise, we think it is appropriate to require such transactions to be
included in the non-U.S. person’s de minimis threshold calculations. See Section III.B.4, supra.

required to register as a broker and, with respect to the transactions that it intermediates, could be
required to comply with relevant Exchange Act requirements with respect to those
transactions. 198 The commenter suggested that direct regulation of this agent would address
“most of the . . . objectives to be served by [security-based swap dealer] registration, as well as
the external business conduct standards.” 199
After careful consideration of this alternative approach, we have preliminarily concluded
that broker-dealer regulation would not, on its own, adequately address the concerns raised by
agents located in the United States acting on behalf of non-U.S. persons to facilitate the securitybased swap dealing activity of such non-U.S. persons. Given the range of regulatory concerns
such activity raises, 200 we preliminarily believe that, irrespective of any other regulatory
framework that may apply to the agent, the non-U.S. person engaged in security-based swap

Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act definition of “security” to
encompass security-based swaps. See Exchange Act section 3(a)(10), 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10), as
revised by section 761(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act. See also Exchange Act section 3(a)(4)
(defining “broker”). We previously granted temporary exemptive relief from compliance with
certain provisions of the Exchange Act in connection with this revision of the statutory
requirements in order generally to maintain the status quo during the implementation process for
the Dodd-Frank Act. See Order Granting Temporary Exemptions under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 in Connection with the Pending Revisions of the Definition of “Security” to
Encompass Security-Based Swaps, Exchange Act Release No. 64795 (Jul. 1, 2011), 76 FR 39927
(Jul. 7, 2011) (“Exchange Act Exemptive Order”). Among other things, this relief granted
temporary exemptions specific to security-based swap activities by registered brokers and dealers.
See id. at 39-44. In February 2014, we extended the expiration dates (1) for exemptions that are
generally not directly related to specific security-based swap rulemakings until the earlier of such
time that we issue an order or rule determining whether any continuing exemptive relief is
appropriate for security-based swap activities with respect to any of the Exchange Act provisions
or until three years following the effective date of that order; and (2) for exemptions that are
directly related to specific security-based swap rulemakings, until the compliance date for the
relevant security-based swap rulemaking. See Order Extending Temporary Exemptions under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Connection with the Revision of the Definition of “Security”

dealing activity through the agent, if it exceeds the de minimis threshold, should also be subject
to security-based swap dealer regulation. 201
First, as that commenter acknowledged, an agent using personnel located in a U.S. branch
or office would not be required to register as a broker-dealer if it could avail itself of certain
exceptions under the Exchange Act and the rules or regulations thereunder. 202 Given these
exceptions, reliance on the broker-dealer regime to address the regulatory concerns raised by
security-based swap dealing activity that a non-U.S. person carries out in the United States
through an agent could result in significant non-U.S. person security-based swap dealing activity
being carried out using an agent that, because, for example, it is a bank, is not in fact subject to
the broker-dealer regulatory framework. We preliminarily believe that this result would not be
appropriate, particularly given that, in Title VII, Congress established a new, separate regulatory
framework for security-based swap dealers that was designed specifically to encompass the
security-based swap dealing activities of banks. 203

201

Consistent with our views expressed in prior releases, if a financial group used one entity to
perform the sales and trading functions of its dealing business and another to book the resulting
transactions, we would “view the booking entity, and not the intermediary that acts as an agent on
behalf of the booking entity to originate the transaction, as the dealing entity.” Cross-Border
Proposing Release, 78 FR 30976. See also Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR
30617 n.264 (“A sales force, however, is not a prerequisite to a person being a security-based
swap dealer. For example, a person that engages in dealing activity can fall within the dealer
definition even if it uses an affiliated entity to market and/or negotiate those security-based swaps
connected with its dealing activity (e.g., the person is a booking entity).”). To the extent that the
activities performed by the first person involve arrangement, negotiation, or execution of
security-based swaps as agent for the booking entity engaged in dealing activity, our proposed
amendment would treat the booking entity’s transmission of an order and instructions to the agent
as part of the dealing activity of the booking entity itself. As already noted, a person engaged in
these activities on behalf of the security-based swap dealer may itself be subject to regulation as a
broker under the Exchange Act. See note 198, supra.

202

See note 105, supra (citing IIB Letter). For example, Exchange Act section 3(a)(4)(B) excepts
banks from the definition of “broker” with respect to certain activity.

203

See Exchange Act section 15F. Notably, the definition of “security-based swap dealer,” unlike
the definitions of “broker” and “dealer” under the Exchange Act, does not include any exceptions

88

Second, even absent the bank exception to the definition of “broker,” we are not
persuaded that broker-dealer regulation of the agent operating in the United States would address
the concerns raised by this security-based swap dealing activity. For example, although
regulation of the agent acting as a broker would provide the Commission with access to the
books and records of the agent relating to a particular transaction, it would not provide us access
to the relevant books and records of the non-U.S.-person dealer on whose behalf the agent is
acting, which likely would reduce our ability to monitor that non-U.S. person engaging in the
dealing activity for compliance with the securities laws, including with the anti-fraud provisions
of those laws. 204
As noted above, access to books and records is the primary tool for oversight of the
financial entity and for conducting market surveillance. But the broker’s books and records are
likely to be insufficient for this purpose, given that foreign dealers may allocate different duties
in connection with a particular security-based swap to their own personnel and other functions to
their agents, both in and outside the United States. The records of the agents would not be
sufficient to document other market-facing activity of the foreign dealer that is not carried out
through the agent, but that may be relevant to identifying activity in the United States both
within the security-based swap market as well as in markets for related underlying assets, such as
corporate bonds, that, in light of the other security-based swap activity of the foreign dealer, may
be abusive or manipulative. We would have access to these books and records necessary to
identify fraudulent or abusive conduct on the part of the foreign dealer only if the foreign dealer
is required to register as a security-based swap dealer. In addition, identifying certain
for banks or banking activities. See Exchange Act section 3(a)(71) (defining “security-based
swap dealer”).
204

See Section III.B.4, supra.

89

manipulative or abusive market practices may require information about security-based swap
transactions of the non-U.S.-person dealer that are not arranged, negotiated, or executed in the
United States. To effectively monitor for fraud and manipulation in a market where a significant
proportion of transactions are likely to be carried out by (and between) dealers using these types
of business structures, we preliminarily believe that the non-U.S.-person dealers that are the
counterparties to these transactions should be required to include these transactions in their de
minimis calculations. To the extent that they exceed the relevant thresholds, these dealers would
be subject to security-based swap dealer regulation, which would enable the Commission to
obtain access to the dealer’s books and records.
6. Other commenter concerns and alternatives
(a) Potential duplication and comity concerns
Some commenters expressed concern that an activity-based approach to the de minimis
exception and other Title VII requirements could lead to regulatory conflicts and overlaps, 205 or
that it does not adequately take into account the actions and interests of other regulators. 206 As
we noted above, Commission staff has participated in numerous bilateral and multilateral
discussions with foreign regulatory authorities addressing the regulation of OTC derivatives,
and, through these discussions, we have gathered information about foreign regulatory reform
efforts and their impact on and relationship with the U.S. regulatory regime. 207
We recognize that some non-U.S. persons that may be required to register as securitybased swap dealers as a result of proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) may already
be subject to regulation similar to our security-based swap dealer regulatory framework in other
205

See note 105, supra.

206

See note 295, infra.

207

See Section I.B, supra.

90

jurisdictions. At the same time, we preliminarily believe that it is appropriate to regulate dealing
activity that occurs within the United States, including by subjecting to security-based swap
dealer registration non-U.S. persons that exceed the relevant de minimis threshold by virtue of
security-based swap dealing activity involving the arrangement, negotiation, or execution of
security-based swaps on behalf of such person by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. 208
We previously have proposed to provide the opportunity for substituted compliance with respect
to certain security-based swap dealer requirements as set forth in our Cross-Border Proposing
Release. 209 We received comments on this proposal, which we continue to consider, and we
continue preliminarily to believe that the appropriate means of addressing potential overlap or
duplication is through substituted compliance rather than by forgoing regulation entirely. 210
(b) Reliance on representations
At least one commenter specifically requested that we retain the provision in the proposal
permitting reliance on a representation concerning whether a counterparty was engaging in

208

As noted above, one commenter specifically argued that the initially proposed approach would
subject U.S. branches of EU banks to duplicative regulations because EU regulations also apply
to the transactions of such branches. See note 105, supra. We do not believe the possibility that a
person may be subject to similar regulation by a foreign regulatory authority can be determinative
of the scope of our regulatory framework, given the specific authority Congress provided us to
regulate, among other things, security-based swap dealing activity in the United States and given
the potential for differences in regulatory interests and in supervisory and enforcement priorities
among different regulatory jurisdictions. We also note that EU regulations similarly apply to
transactions between two EU branches of U.S. banks. See Commission Delegated Regulation
supplementing Regulation (EU) No 648/2012 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 4
July 2012 with regard to regulatory technical standards on direct, substantial and foreseeable
effect of contracts within the Union and to prevent the evasion of rules and obligations, Article
2(1).

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31088-90 (describing proposed substituted

requirements).

91

activity within the United States. 211 The proposed amendment does not incorporate such a
provision, as the more limited scope of the re-proposed rule appears to make it unnecessary in
this context. The proposed rule would focus solely on the conduct of a non-U.S. person acting in
a dealing capacity, and only that person is required to account for such activity in its de minimis
calculations. Accordingly, whether one counterparty’s dealing activity occurs within or outside
the United States has no legal effect on the obligations of the other counterparty under the
proposed rule, and the location of the other counterparty has no effect on whether the transaction
falls within the scope of the proposed rule. 212
7. Request for comment
We request comment on all aspects of the discussion and analysis above, including the
following:
•

Is our understanding of the global nature of the security-based swap market
accurate? If not, why not?

•

Is our understanding of the dealing structures used by U.S. and non-U.S. persons
accurate? If not, why not? Are there other dealing structures used by market
participants?

•

Is our understanding of the use of affiliated or unaffiliated persons, such as
registered broker-dealers in the United States (including inter-dealer brokers)
accurate? If not, why not?

211

See note 117, supra.

212

Also for this reason, the re-proposed approach addresses comments regarding potential
difficulties private funds may have in obtaining such representations from their dealer
counterparties. See id. (citing MFA/AIMA Letter). See also note 106, supra.

92

•

Should a non-U.S. person that engages in dealing activity with other non-U.S.
persons be required to consider, for purposes of counting a transaction towards its
de minimis calculation, the location of its counterparty’s dealing activity in
addition to the location of its own or its agent’s dealing activity? Would the
proposed amendment requiring such a non-U.S. person to consider only the
location of its own dealing activity appropriately mitigate commenters’ concerns
while also ensuring that a non-U.S. person that engages in significant levels of
dealing activity using personnel located in the United States would be subject to
regulation as a security-based swap dealer?

•

Does proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C), which would apply only to transactions
connected with a non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that it
(or its agent) arranges, negotiates, or executes using personnel located in a U.S.
branch or office, appropriately focus on activity that is likely to raise the types of
concern addressed by Title VII? Is it appropriate to generally focus on marketfacing activities? Is the scope of activities too narrow or too broad? Why? Will
the approach be workable for market participants? Why or why not?

•

Is the use of the terms “arrange,” “negotiate,” and “execute” in the release and
rule text sufficiently clear? How could the terms be further clarified if necessary?

•

Is the focus on market-facing activities of the sales and trading desks appropriate
in identifying transactions between two non-U.S. persons that should be subject to
Title VII requirements?

•

Does the change to proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) that would require
transactions to be included in a person’s de minimis calculation only if personnel

93

arranging, negotiating, or executing the security-based swap are “located in a U.S.
branch or office” address the type of activity within the United States that is likely
to raise concerns under Title VII? Is the approach too narrow or too broad?
Why?
•

Should the proposed amendment incorporate an exception from security-based
swap dealer regulation for a non-U.S. person that arranges, negotiates, or executes
transactions using personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office to the
extent that the agent is a registered broker-dealer? If so, how should this dealing
activity be regulated? Specifically, to the extent that security-based swap
brokering activity is carried out by personnel of the non-U.S. person engaged in
dealing activity who are located in a U.S. branch or office, how should we address
it? To the extent that security-based swap brokering activity is carried out by a
bank, how should we regulate it? How would we obtain access to the books and
records for transactions outside the United States of an unregistered dealer also
doing business in the United States through a broker to monitor for market
manipulation or other abusive practices?

•

Do you agree with proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C), which requires a non-U.S.
person to include in its de minimis calculation, transactions that it arranges,
negotiates, or executes using personnel of an affiliated agent of such non-U.S.
person located in a U.S. branch or office?

•

Do you agree with proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C), which requires a non-U.S.
person to include in its de minimis calculation, transactions that it arranges,

94

negotiates, or executes using personnel of an unaffiliated agent of such non-U.S.
person located in a U.S. branch or office?
•

What types of controls would be necessary to ensure that a non-U.S. person
engaged in dealing activity counts transactions that it is required to include in its
dealer de minimis calculations under proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C)? How
would this work as an operational matter?

•

Is this proposed approach to applying Title VII to transactions connected with a
non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that it (or its agent)
arranges, negotiates, or executed using personnel located in a U.S. office
workable in light of the approach set forth in the CFTC Staff Advisory? Why or
why not?

C. Availability of the Exception for Cleared Anonymous Transactions
1. Proposed rule
Under Exchange Act rule 3a71-5, a non-U.S. person, other than a conduit affiliate, is not
required to include in its de minimis calculation “transactions that are entered into anonymously
on an execution facility or national securities exchange and are cleared through a clearing
agency.” 213 As we noted in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, this rule is intended to avoid
putting market participants in a position where they are required to determine the treatment of
the transaction under the de minimis exception in circumstances where the information necessary
to that determination (e.g., the U.S.-person status of the counterparty) is unavailable to them. 214
We also noted that, absent such an exception, execution facilities outside the United States might

213

Exchange Act rule 3a71-5.

214

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47325 n.412.

95

determine to exclude U.S. market participants to prevent a non-U.S. market participant from
potentially being required to register as a security-based swap dealer based on information
unavailable to the non-U.S. market participant at the time of the transaction. 215
We are proposing to amend rule 3a71-5 by adding new paragraph (c) to make this
exception unavailable to transactions that non-U.S. persons would be required to count under
proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C). We preliminarily believe that excepting such
transactions would be inconsistent with the purposes underlying the requirement that a non-U.S.
person include transactions arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in a U.S.
branch or office in connection with its dealing activity in its de minimis calculations. To the
extent that a non-U.S. person is, in connection with its dealing activity, arranging, negotiating, or
executing security-based swap transactions using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, it
raises the concerns described above, 216 regardless of whether such transactions are entered into
over-the-counter or on an SB SEF or national securities exchange. Requiring a non-U.S. person
to include these transactions in its dealer de minimis calculations does not appear to raise the
concerns that led us to adopt Exchange Act rule 3a71-5, given that proposed Exchange Act rule
3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C) requires the non-U.S. person to look only to the location of its own securitybased swap dealing activity in determining whether it is required to count the trade against its de
minimis threshold. Finally, as with disparities in the application of Title VII to transactions
arranged, negotiated, or executed in the United States more generally, 217 we note that, if a nonU.S. person could avail itself of this exception even when arranging, negotiating, or executing a
215

activity in the United States); notes 114 and 138, supra (citing comment letters expressing
concern about potential competitive disparities).

96

transaction in connection with its dealing activity using personnel located in a U.S. branch or
office, it could have a significant competitive advantage over U.S. persons, even with respect to
transactions that are executed on an SB SEF or national securities exchange and cleared on a
clearing agency located in the United States.
2. Request for comment
We request comment on all aspects of the proposed amendment regarding availability of
the exception for cleared, anonymous transactions with respect to identifying security-based
swap transactions that do not need to be included in the de minimis threshold calculations of
non-U.S. persons, including the following:
•

With respect to transactions that a non-U.S. person would be required to count
under proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C), should there be an exception from
counting such transactions if they are entered into anonymously on an SB SEF or
national securities exchange and are cleared through a clearing agency? Why or
why not?

•

Do security-based swap transactions entered into anonymously on an SB SEF or
national securities exchange and cleared through a clearing agency mitigate the
risk of fraud or market abuse or other concerns with respect to transactions
between two non-U.S. persons that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by
personnel located in a U.S. branch or office? Why or why not?

IV. Application of the External Business Conduct Requirements to the Foreign
Business and U.S. Business of Registered Security-Based Swap Dealers
A. Overview
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we proposed an approach to the application of
the security-based swap dealer requirements set forth in section 15F of the Exchange Act that

97

would classify each of these requirements either as entity-level requirements, which apply to the
dealing entity as a whole, or as transaction-level requirements, which apply to specific
transactions. In this taxonomy, entity-level requirements include requirements relating to capital
and margin, risk management procedures, recordkeeping and reporting, supervision, and
designation of a chief compliance officer. 218 Transaction-level requirements include, among
others, requirements relating to external business conduct and segregation, which are intended
primarily to protect counterparties by requiring registered security-based swap dealers to, among
other things, provide certain disclosures to counterparties, adhere to certain standards of business
conduct, and segregate customer funds, securities, and other assets. 219
We proposed generally to apply all requirements in section 15F of the Exchange Act, and
the rules and regulations thereunder, to both registered U.S. and foreign security-based swap
dealers. 220 We also proposed to establish a policy and procedural framework under which we
would consider permitting substituted compliance for registered foreign security-based swap
dealers under certain circumstances (but not for registered U.S. security-based swap dealers). 221
We proposed, however, to except the foreign business of registered security-based swap dealers
from the external business conduct requirements. 222
We are re-proposing this exception, which, as originally proposed, incorporated the term
“transaction conducted within the United States,” to reflect the re-proposed approach to
identifying relevant security-based swap activity of registered foreign security-based swap

218

98

dealers that they carry out using personnel located in the United States. We continue to believe
that the foreign business of registered security-based swap dealers should be excepted from the
external business conduct requirements of Title VII. We also preliminarily believe that it is
desirable that the types of activities in the United States that trigger application of the external
business conduct requirements to transactions of a registered foreign security-based swap dealer
with another non-U.S. person should be identical to those that require a transaction to be
included in a non-U.S. person’s de minimis threshold calculations, as a consistent test should be
more workable for market participants to implement and we preliminarily believe that the
proposed test captures the activity that is likely to raise concerns about business conduct in the
United States. Accordingly, we are re-proposing initially proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(c)
and related definitions solely to conform to the proposed amendments to the de minimis
exception. 223
B. Statutory Framework for External Business Conduct
Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to adopt rules specifying
external business conduct standards for registered security-based swap dealers in their dealings
with counterparties, 224 including counterparties that are “special entities.” 225 Congress granted

223

This proposal does not address application of any of the other elements of the Title VII securitybased swap dealer requirements described in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, including those
related to the application of entity-level requirements to security-based swap dealers; the
application of segregation requirements under Exchange Act section 3E, and the rules and
regulations thereunder; and the availability of the opportunity for substituted compliance
(including initially proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-5, which set forth, among other things, the
process for submitting substituted compliance determination requests and the standard we would
use in evaluating those requests). We anticipate addressing the comments on these elements of
that proposal in the context of our consideration of final rules regarding each of the respective
security-based swap dealer requirements.

224

Exchange Act section 15F(h)(6), 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(6), directs the Commission to prescribe
rules governing external business conduct standards for security-based swap dealers.

99

the Commission broad authority to promulgate business conduct standards that the Commission
determines to be appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 226
These standards, as described in section 15F(h)(3) of the Exchange Act, must require
security-based swap dealers to: (i) verify that a counterparty meets the eligibility standards for an
eligible contract participant; (ii) disclose to the counterparty material information about the
security-based swap, including material risks and characteristics of the security-based swap, and
material incentives and conflicts of interest of the security-based swap dealer in connection with
the security-based swap; and (iii) provide the counterparty with information concerning the daily
mark for the security-based swap. Section 15F(h)(3) also directs the Commission to establish a
duty for security-based swap dealers to communicate information in a fair and balanced manner
based on principles of fair dealing and good faith and to establish other standards as the
Commission determines are in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act.
In addition, section 15F(h)(4) of the Exchange Act requires that a security-based swap
dealer that “acts as an advisor to a special entity” must act in the “best interests” of the special
entity and undertake “reasonable efforts to obtain such information as is necessary to make a
reasonable determination” that a recommended security-based swap is in the best interests of the
225

Exchange Act section 15F(h)(2)(C), 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(2)(C) (defining “special entities”). As
discussed below, we have previously proposed business conduct rules and continue to consider
comments received on that proposal. See IV.C.1, infra. We intend to address these comments in
a subsequent adopting release finalizing rules establishing external business conduct standards,
including provisions applicable in transactions with “special entities.”

226

See Exchange Act section 15F(h)(3)(D), 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(3)(D) (“[b]usiness conduct
requirements adopted by the Commission shall establish such other standards and requirements as
the Commission may determine are appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this Act”). See also Exchange Act
section 15F(h)(1)(D) (requiring security-based swap dealers to comply with “such business
conduct standards . . . as may be prescribed by the Commission by rule or regulation that relate to
. . . such other matters as the Commission determines to be appropriate”).

100

special entity. 227 Section 15F(h)(5) requires that a security-based swap dealer that enters into, or
offers to enter into, security-based swaps with a special entity comply with any duty established
by the Commission that requires the security-based swap dealer to have a “reasonable basis” for
believing that the special entity has an “independent representative” that meets certain criteria
and undertakes a duty to act in the “best interests” of the special entity.
C. Prior Proposals
1. Business Conduct Proposal
We have proposed rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 under the Exchange Act to implement
the business conduct requirements described above. 228 In addition to external business conduct
standards expressly addressed by Title VII, we have proposed certain other business conduct
requirements for security-based swap dealers that we preliminarily believed would further the
principles that underlie the Dodd-Frank Act. These rules would, among other things, impose
certain “know your counterparty” and suitability obligations on security-based swap dealers, as
well as restrict security-based swap dealers from engaging in certain “pay to play” activities and
provide certain protections for “special entities.” 229
2. Cross-Border Proposing Release
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we proposed a rule that would have provided that
a registered foreign security-based swap dealer and a foreign branch of a registered U.S.
security-based swap dealer, with respect to their foreign business, shall not be subject to the

227

See Business Conduct Standards for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based
Swap Participants (“Business Conduct Proposal”), Exchange Act Release No. 64766 (June 29,
2011), 76 FR 42423-25 (July 18, 2011).

228

See Business Conduct Proposal, 76 FR 42396.

229

See Business Conduct Proposal, 76 FR 42399-400; proposed Exchange Act rules 15Fh-3(e)
(“know your counterparty”), 15Fh-3(f) (“suitability”), and 15Fh-6 (“pay to play”).

101

requirements relating to external business conduct standards described in section 15F(h) of the
Exchange Act, 230 and the rules and regulations thereunder, other than the rules and regulations
prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section 15F(h)(1)(B). 231
As described more fully in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, the proposed rule would
have defined “U.S. business” and “foreign business” with respect to both foreign and U.S.
security-based swap dealers. For a foreign security-based swap dealer, “U.S. business” would
have been defined to mean (i) any transaction entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on
behalf of such foreign security-based swap dealer, with a U.S. person (other than with a foreign
branch), or (ii) any transaction conducted within the United States. 232 For a U.S. security-based
swap dealer, “U.S. business” would have been defined to mean any transaction by or on behalf
of such U.S. security-based swap dealer, wherever entered into or offered to be entered into,
other than a transaction conducted through a foreign branch with a non-U.S. person or another

230

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h).

231

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31016. Section 15F(h)(1)(B) requires registered
security-based swap dealers to conform with such business conduct standards relating to diligent
supervision as the Commission shall prescribe. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(1)(B). All other
requirements in section 15F of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, would
apply to both U.S. and registered foreign security-based swap dealers, although we proposed to
establish a framework under which we would consider permitting substituted compliance for
foreign security-based swap dealers under certain circumstances (but not for U.S. security-based
swap dealers, even when they conduct dealing activity through foreign branches). See id. The
approach under the initially proposed rule would not have affected applicability of the general
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws to the activity of a foreign security-based swap
dealer. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31016 n.476.

232

See id. at 31016. Whether the activity in a transaction involving a registered foreign securitybased swap dealer occurred within the United States or with a U.S. person for purposes of
identifying whether security-based swap transactions are part of U.S. business would have turned
on the same factors used in that proposal to determine whether a foreign security-based swap
dealer is engaging in dealing activity within the United States or with U.S. persons and whether a
U.S. person was conducting a transaction through a foreign branch, as set forth in that proposal.

foreign branch of a U.S. person. 233 With respect to both a foreign security-based swap dealer
and a U.S. security-based swap dealer, “foreign business” would have been defined to mean any
security-based swap transactions entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on behalf of the
foreign security-based swap dealer or the U.S. security-based swap dealer that do not include its
U.S. business. 234
D. Comments
We received relatively few comments specifically addressing our initially proposed
approach to application of the external business conduct requirements to security-based swap
dealers. One commenter disagreed with our proposed approach with respect to U.S. securitybased swap dealers, arguing that all transactions of such persons must always be subject to
external business conduct standards, including those conducted through their foreign branches
with non-U.S. persons and foreign branches of U.S. banks. 235
Two commenters generally agreed with the initially proposed approach but suggested
certain modifications to address specific concerns. One commenter generally agreed with the
proposed approach that would not have imposed external business conduct requirements with
respect to the “foreign business” of a foreign security-based swap dealer but argued that these
requirements also should not apply to transactions with non-U.S. regulated funds whose securitybased swap activity is managed by a U.S. asset manager. 236 This commenter argued that such
funds would not expect to receive the protections of Title VII’s business conduct standards
merely because they use a U.S. asset manager and expressed concern that such requirements

would disadvantage these entities because foreign security-based swap dealers might prefer to
transact with non-U.S. funds managed by non-U.S. asset managers to avoid compliance with the
requirements. 237
Another commenter argued that the definition of “U.S. business” should be limited to
transactions with counterparties that are U.S. persons, and that this definition should apply to the
business of U.S. and foreign security-based swap dealers. 238 This commenter argued that
adopting a uniform definition of “U.S. business” and eliminating “transaction conducted within
the United States” from that definition would better accord with the purpose of the requirements,
with counterparty expectations, and with international comity concerns. 239 This commenter
further stated that there was insufficient “jurisdictional nexus” to warrant applying the external
business conduct requirements to all transactions conducted within the United States, regardless
of the U.S.-person status of the counterparties. 240
E. Discussion
We are re-proposing Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(c) regarding application of the external
business conduct requirements, and proposing amendments to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a) to
define certain terms to conform to the proposed amendments to Exchange Act rule 3a713(b)(1)(iii)(C), which identifies relevant security-based swap activity of registered foreign
security-based swap dealers in which they engage using personnel located in the United States
237

See id. This commenter suggested that we modify the proposed definition of “U.S. business” for
foreign security-based swap dealers by removing prong (ii) of the initially proposed rule, which
includes “any transactions conducted within the U.S.” in the definition of “U.S. business.” In this
commenter’s view, this change would help ensure that the transactions of such funds with
registered foreign security-based swap dealers are not subject to the external business conduct
requirements. See ICI Letter at 11 n.28 and accompanying text.

for purposes of the de minimis exception. Our general approach, however, remains unchanged:
The re-proposed rule would distinguish between “U.S. business” and “foreign business” and
except the foreign business of a registered foreign security-based swap dealer and a registered
U.S. security-based swap dealer from the external business conduct standards in section 15F(h)
and the rules and regulations thereunder (other than rules and requirements prescribed by the
Commission pursuant to section 15F(h)(1)(B)) of the Exchange Act, and proposed amendments
to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a) would incorporate these defined terms in the rule. 241
Specifically, our re-proposed amendment to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a) would modify
the initially proposed definition of “U.S. business” with respect to foreign security-based swap
dealers to refer to any security-based swap transaction arranged, negotiated, or executed by
personnel of the foreign security-based swap dealer located in a U.S. branch or office, or by
personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. 242 The definition of “U.S. business” for

241

See proposed Exchange Act rules 3a71-3(a)(6), (7), (8), and (9) (defining, respectively, “U.S.
security-based swap dealer,” “foreign security-based swap dealer,” “U.S. business,” and “foreign
business”); re-proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(c) (setting forth exceptions from certain
external business conduct requirements with respect to the “foreign business” of registered
foreign security-based swap dealers and registered U.S. security-based swap dealers).
This proposed approach to external business conduct standards would not except registered
security-based swap dealers from the rules and requirements prescribed by the Commission
pursuant to section 15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act with respect to their foreign business. As
already noted, section 15F(h)(1)(B) requires registered security-based swap dealers to conform
with such business conduct standards relating to diligent supervision as the Commission shall
prescribe. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(1)(B). We preliminarily believe that it is not appropriate to
except registered security-based swap dealers from compliance with such requirements. Because
registered security-based swap dealers would be subject to a number of obligations under the
federal securities laws with respect to their security-based swap business, we preliminarily
believe that having systems in place reasonably designed to ensure diligent supervision would be
an important aspect of their compliance with the federal securities laws. Under our Cross-Border
Proposing Release, these entity-level requirements would apply to a security-based swap dealer
on a firm-wide basis to address risks to the security-based swap dealer as a whole. See CrossBorder Proposing Release, 78 FR 31011.

242

Proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(i)(B). We intend the proposed rule to indicate the
same type of activity by personnel located in the United States as described in Section III.B.5,

105

foreign security-based swap dealers and U.S. security-based swap dealers would continue to
exclude certain transactions involving the foreign branches of U.S. persons. 243 The definitions of
“U.S. security-based swap dealer,” 244 “foreign security-based swap dealer,” 245 and “foreign
business” 246 would remain unchanged from the initial proposal, as would the text of re-proposed
rule 3a71-3(c), which would create the exception to the external business conduct requirements
(other than rules and requirements prescribed by the Commission pursuant to section
15F(h)(1)(B)) for the foreign business of registered security-based swap dealers.
We continue to believe that a registered security-based swap dealer should be required to
comply with the external business conduct requirements with respect to its U.S. business. The
proposed external business conduct standards are intended to bring professional standards of

supra. Moreover, for purposes of proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(8)(i)(B), we would
interpret the term “personnel” in a manner consistent with the definition of “associated person of
a security-based swap dealer” contained in section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(70), regardless of whether such non-U.S. person or such non-U.S. person’s agent is itself a
security-based swap dealer. See note 193, supra (discussing the Commission’s proposed
interpretation of the term “personnel” for purposes of proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C)).
243

Initially proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(6)(i)(A) provided that the U.S. business of a
foreign security-based swap dealer included any transaction with a U.S. person, “other than with
a foreign branch.” The proposed amendment replaces this language with “other than a
transaction conducted through a foreign branch of that person.” Similarly, initially proposed
Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(6)(ii) provided that the U.S. business of a U.S. security-based swap
dealer included any transaction of such dealer, other than transactions conducted through a
foreign branch with a non-U.S. person “or another foreign branch.” Proposed Exchange Act rule
3a71-3(a)(8)(ii) replaces this language with “or a transaction with a U.S. person counterparty that
constitutes a transaction conducted through a foreign branch of the counterparty.”
These changes are intended to clarify that the counterparty’s activity in each such transaction
must meet the definition of “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” set forth in
Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(3). These proposed changes are consistent with Exchange Act rule
3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(A), which permits non-U.S. persons to exclude from the de minimis calculation
transactions with U.S. persons, to the extent that such U.S. persons are engaging in transactions
conducted through a foreign branch.

conduct to, and increase transparency in, the security-based swap market and to require
registered security-based swap dealers to treat parties to these transactions fairly. As noted
above, the proposed rules would require, among other things, that registered security-based swap
dealers communicate in a fair and balanced manner with potential counterparties and that they
disclose conflicts of interest and material incentives to potential counterparties. Imposing these
requirements on the U.S. business of registered security-based swap dealers should help protect
the integrity of U.S. financial markets for all market participants.
We recognize that, depending on the particular structure used by a registered foreign
security-based swap dealer to do business in the United States, its personnel (or personnel of its
agent acting on its behalf) in the United States may be subject to other business conduct
requirements under U.S. law (such as broker-dealer regulation) that govern the professional
interactions of such personnel or agents with counterparties to a security-based swap. 247 We also
recognize that these other requirements may afford security-based swap counterparties
protections that may appear to be similar in many respects to the Title VII external business
conduct standards. We preliminarily believe, however, that, notwithstanding any requirements
that may apply to such intermediaries, it is appropriate to impose these Title VII requirements
directly on registered foreign security-based swap dealers when they use personnel located in the

247

See note 198, supra (discussing the Exchange Act Exemptive Order). The Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) also adopted a rule, FINRA Rule 0180 (Application of Rules to
Security-Based Swaps), which temporary limits the application of certain FINRA rules with
respect to security-based swaps. On January 14, 2015, FINRA filed a proposed rule change,
which was effective upon receipt by the Commission, extending the expiration date of FINRA
Rule 0180 to February 11, 2016. See Self-Regulatory Organizations; Financial Industry
Regulatory Authority, Inc.; Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of Proposed Rule
Change to Extend the Expiration Date of FINRA Rule 0180 (Application of Rules to SecurityBased Swaps), Exchange Act Release No. 74049 (Jan. 14, 2015).

107

United States to arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swaps, even with counterparties
that are also non-U.S. persons.
We note that, in Title VII, Congress has established a comprehensive framework of
business conduct standards that applies to registered security-based swap dealers, and we
preliminarily believe that this framework should govern their transactions with counterparties
when such transactions raise transparency and market integrity concerns that are addressed by
these requirements. Although other business conduct frameworks (such as broker-dealer
regulation) may achieve similar regulatory goals, the availability of exceptions may mean that
alternative frameworks may not apply to certain business structures used by registered securitybased swap dealers to carry out their business in the United States. 248 In our preliminary view, it
is appropriate to subject all registered security-based swap dealers engaged in U.S. business to
the same external business conduct framework, rather than encouraging a patchwork of business
conduct protections under U.S. law that may offer counterparties varying levels of protection
with respect to their transactions with different registered security-based swap dealers depending
on the business model (or models) that each registered security-based swap dealer has chosen to
use in its U.S. business. 249

248

See note 202, supra (noting exception from broker-dealer definition for banks).

249

Consistent with the view we expressed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, to the extent that a
registered foreign security-based swap dealer uses personnel of an agent to arrange, negotiate, or
execute security-based swap transactions from a U.S. branch or office, the dealer and its agent
may choose to allocate between themselves specific responsibilities in connection with these
external business conduct requirements. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31026-27.
However, we note that the registered foreign security-based swap dealer would remain
responsible for ensuring that all relevant Title VII requirements applicable to a given securitybased swap transaction are fulfilled. See id. at 31026. As noted above, the agent may also be
required to register as a broker (or, potentially, as a security-based swap dealer), or as another
regulated entity, depending on the nature of its security-based swap or other activity. See note
198 and accompanying text, supra; Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31027 n.574. An
agent may, accordingly, be subject to independent business conduct or other requirements with

108

We also note that imposing these external business conduct requirements on a registered
foreign security-based swap dealer when it uses personnel located in a U.S. branch or office to
arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swaps with another non-U.S. person should
mitigate competitive disparities between different categories of security-based swap dealers
operating in the United States. 250 This concern is particularly acute given the ease with which
U.S. security-based swap dealers may seek to avoid such competitive disparities by booking in
non-U.S.-person affiliates any transactions arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel
located in the United States. As noted above, this restructuring would allow these dealers to
continue using U.S. sales and trading personnel to carry on their security-based swap dealing
business in a manner largely unchanged from what we understand to be current business
practices while avoiding the external business conduct requirements of Title VII. 251
We have considered the views of the commenters that opposed imposing external
business conduct requirements on transactions between a registered foreign security-based swap
dealer and a non-U.S.-person counterparty, 252 but we do not believe that the issues raised by
commenters warrant refraining from imposing these requirements on all such transactions. The
re-proposed approach, which focuses on a transaction of a registered foreign security-based swap
dealer with another non-U.S. person only when the registered foreign security-based swap dealer
is using personnel located in the United States to arrange, negotiate, or execute the securitybased swap, should mitigate the concerns raised by one commenter regarding the potential effect
respect to its interactions with the registered foreign security-based swap dealer’s counterparties
that occur in the course of its intermediation of such transactions.
250

See Section II.A, supra (discussing competitive effects of disparate regulatory treatment of
activity in the United States).

of the initially proposed rule on U.S. fund managers that manage offshore funds, because, to the
extent an offshore fund is not a U.S. person by virtue of having its principal place of business in
the United States, only the location of personnel of the registered foreign security-based swap
dealer or the location of personnel of its agent, and not that of persons acting on behalf of a nonU.S.-person fund in the transaction, would be relevant to whether the transaction is U.S. business
or foreign business of the registered foreign security-based swap dealer. 253
We also disagree with the commenter that suggested that such transactions have an
insufficient nexus to the United States to warrant application of the external business conduct
requirements and that the external business conduct requirement should apply only to
transactions with U.S.-person counterparties. 254 As we discussed in the context of the de
minimis exception above, a foreign security-based swap dealer arranging, negotiating, or
executing a security-based swap transaction using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office is
not solely “transacting a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United
States.” 255 If the Commission adopts a rule that makes substituted compliance available for
253

See notes 236-237, supra. To the extent that a non-U.S. regulated fund is a U.S. person
(including because it has its principal place of business in the United States), a foreign securitybased swap dealer would be required to comply with external business conduct requirements in
any transaction with that fund because the counterparty is a U.S. person. See proposed Exchange
Act rule 3a71-3(a)(8). Cf. Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(A) (requiring non-U.S. persons to
include in their de minimis threshold calculations security-based swap transactions with U.S.
persons in connection with their dealing activity); Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47320
(describing Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(A)).

254

See notes 238-240, supra.

255

Exchange Act section 30(c). See also Section III.B.4(b), supra.
As noted above, we do not believe that our proposed approach applies Title VII to persons that
are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United
States,” within the meaning of section 30(c) of the Exchange Act. An approach that did not treat
security-based swaps that a registered foreign security-based swap dealer has arranged,
negotiated, or executed using its personnel or personnel of its agent located in the United States
as the “U.S. business” of that dealer for purposes of proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(c)
would, in our view, reflect an understanding of what it means to conduct a security-based swaps

110

external business conduct requirements and, pursuant to further Commission action, makes a
substituted compliance determination, substituted compliance may be permitted in such
transactions. 256
Our re-proposed rule maintains our initially proposed approach to the foreign business of
registered U.S. security-based swap dealers. We recognize that at least one commenter
suggested that all transactions of a registered U.S. security-based swap dealer should be subject
to the external business conduct requirements of Exchange Act section 15F, 257 but we continue
to believe it is appropriate to provide this exception for the foreign business of such persons. As
we noted in our initial proposal, the Dodd-Frank Act generally is concerned with the protection
of U.S. markets and participants in those markets. 258 We continue to believe that subjecting U.S.
security-based swap dealers to the Title VII customer protection requirements with respect to
their security-based swap transactions conducted through their foreign branches outside the

business within the jurisdiction of the United States that is divorced both from Title VII’s
statutory objectives and from the various structures that non-U.S. persons use to engage in
security-based swap dealing activity. But in any event we also preliminarily believe that this
proposed rule is necessary or appropriate as a prophylactic measure to help prevent the evasion of
the provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act, and thus help
prevent the relevant purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act from being undermined. See Cross-Border
Adopting Release, 79 FR 47291-92 (interpreting anti-evasion provisions of Exchange Act section
30(c)). Without this rule, non-U.S. persons could simply carry on a dealing business within the
United States with non-U.S. persons. Permitting this activity could allow these firms to retain full
access to the benefits of operating in the United States while avoiding compliance with external
business conduct requirements, which could increase the risk of misconduct. See Section III.B.4,
supra.
256

As noted above, in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we proposed an approach to substituted
compliance with respect to the external business conduct requirements. See note 223, supra. We
received comments on this proposed rule that we continue to consider, and we anticipate
addressing those comments in the context of our consideration of final rules regarding the
external business conduct requirement.

United States with non-U.S. persons would not appreciably further the goal of protecting the
U.S. market or U.S. market participants.
F. Request for comment
We request comment on all aspects of the re-proposed rule regarding application of the
external business conduct requirements to registered security-based swap dealers, including the
following:
•

The re-proposed rule would apply the external business conduct standards to
transactions that a registered foreign security-based swap dealer arranges,
negotiates, or executes using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, even if
the counterparty is also a non-U.S. person. Are the external business conduct
rules appropriately applied in this release? Should the external business conduct
rules be expanded to cover other transactions discussed in this release? Should
some or all of the external business conduct standards not apply to these
activities? Why or why not? Please be specific in identifying why the concerns
addressed by the external business conduct requirements do not arise in this
context.

•

The re-proposed rule would not apply the external business conduct standards to
the foreign business of any registered security-based swap dealer. Should some
or all of the external business conduct standards apply to the foreign business of
these registered entities? Why or why not? Please be specific as to what policy
objectives would be advanced by subjecting transactions resulting from the
foreign business of a registered security-based swap dealer to the external
business conduct requirement.

112

•

The re-proposed rule would not apply the external business conduct standards to a
transaction of a registered U.S. security-based swap dealer that is a transaction
conducted through a foreign branch (assuming that the counterparty is a non-U.S.
person or is a U.S. person for whom the transaction is also a transaction
conducted through a foreign branch). Should some or all of the external business
conduct standards apply to these transactions? Why or why not?

•

What types of controls would be necessary to identify foreign business and U.S.
business and ensure that the registered security-based swap dealer complies with
the external business conduct standards with respect to its U.S. business? How
would this work as an operational matter? Should U.S. business be generally
defined with reference to the type of activity that, if performed in a dealing
capacity, triggers the registration requirement?

•

Should some or all of the external business conduct rules apply in transactions
between a registered foreign security-based swap dealer and a foreign branch of a
U.S. bank? Why or why not?

•

Should some or all of the external business conduct rules apply in transactions
between a registered non-U.S. security-based swap dealer and a non-U.S. person
whose obligations under a security-based swap are guaranteed by a U.S. person
that is conducted outside the United States? Why or why not?

•

What would be the market impact of the re-proposed approach to application of
the customer protection requirements? Would non-U.S. persons that engage in
dealing activities seek to relocate to locations outside the United States personnel
who currently arrange, negotiate, and execute transactions from locations within

113

the United States? Would the potential benefits of applying external business
conduct requirements to transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by
a registered foreign security-based swap dealer in the United States reduce any
incentives to relocate to locations outside the United States? What are the costs of
such relocation? What factors would weigh against relocation in spite of those
costs?
•

How would the proposed application of the requirements affect the
competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United
States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place
any market participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? Why or why
not? What other measures should we consider to implement the transaction-level
requirements?

V. Application of Other Requirements to Cross-Border Security-Based Swap
Activity
A. Overview
In light of our proposed amendment to Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b), which would apply
the de minimis exception to transactions of a non-U.S. person that are arranged, negotiated, or
executed by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office in connection with the non-U.S.
person’s dealing activity, we have determined also to propose certain amendments to Regulation
SBSR to address the applicability of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements to such transactions. 259 However, we are not proposing to subject transactions
between two non-U.S. persons that are arranged, negotiated, or executed in the United States to
259

We also are soliciting comment on whether certain transactions of non-U.S. persons whose
obligations under a security-based swap are guaranteed by a U.S. person should be exempt from
the public dissemination requirement. See Section V.E.3, infra.

114

mandatory clearing or trade execution.
B. Previously Proposed and Adopted Rules Relating to Application of Clearing, Trade
Execution, Regulatory Reporting, and Public Dissemination Requirements
1. Mandatory clearing and trade execution
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we proposed to impose both mandatory clearing
and trade execution on “transactions conducted within the United States,” subject to certain
exceptions. Proposed rules 3Ca-3 and 3Ch-1 would have subjected such transactions to
mandatory clearing (provided that we had issued a mandatory clearing determination with
respect to the security-based swap) and mandatory trade execution (provided that the transaction
had been made available to trade) if a person engaged in a security-based swap transaction that is
a “transaction conducted within the United States,” as defined in initially proposed Exchange Act
rule 3a71-3(a)(5). 260 We also proposed an exception to this general requirement, under which a
“transaction conducted within the United States” would not have been subject to the clearing or
trade execution requirements if (i) neither counterparty to the transaction was a U.S. person; (ii)
neither counterparty’s performance under the security-based swap was guaranteed by a U.S.
person; and (iii) neither counterparty to the transaction was a foreign security-based swap dealer.
We proposed that the clearing and trade execution requirements would not apply to transactions
that did not involve any of these three types of counterparties due to our preliminary view that,
although such transactions conducted within the United States may give rise to operational risks

260

In addition, the proposed rules generally would have imposed these requirements on a securitybased swap transaction if a counterparty to the transaction is a U.S. person or a non-U.S. person
whose counterparty has a right of recourse against a U.S. person. See Cross-Border Proposing
Release, 78 FR 31078, 31083. We also proposed an approach to substituted compliance with
respect to each requirement. See id. at 31098, 31099-100. Although these provisions of the
initial proposal are outside the scope of this release, we received comments on these provisions of
the proposed rules, which we continue to consider and anticipate addressing in the context of our
consideration of final rules regarding each requirement.

115

in the United States, the financial risk of such transactions would reside outside the United
States. 261
2. Regulatory reporting and public dissemination
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we re-proposed the entirety of Regulation SBSR,
including rule 908(a) thereof, which, among other things, would have specified when a securitybased swap was subject to the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements of
Regulation SBSR. 262 Security-based swaps that fell within the proposed definition of
“transaction conducted within the United States” would have been among the security-based
swaps subjected both to regulatory reporting and to public dissemination under rule 908(a), as reproposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release. 263
We recently adopted rule 908(a)(1), which requires regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swap transactions that (i) have a direct or indirect
counterparty 264 that is a U.S. person on either or both sides of the transaction, or (ii) are accepted

261

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31080, 31084.

262

Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, would have required regulatory reporting of any security-based
swap that is “executed in the United States or through any means of interstate commerce.” See
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR 75287. When we re-proposed rule 908(a)(1)(i) in
the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we expressed concern that the language in the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release could have unduly required a security-based swap to be reported if it
had only the slightest connection with the United States. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78
FR 31061.

263

Rule 900(ii), as re-proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, would have defined
“transaction conducted within the United States” to have the meaning as given in the definition of
the term under previously proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(5)(i).

264

Rule 900(hh) of Regulation SBSR defines “side” to mean “a direct counterparty and any
guarantor of that direct counterparty’s performance who meets the definition of indirect
counterparty in connection with the security-based swap.” Rule 900(p) of Regulation SBSR
defines “indirect counterparty” to mean “a guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance of
any obligation under a security-based swap such that the direct counterparty on the other side can
exercise a right of recourse against the indirect counterparty in connection with the security-based
swap; for these purposes a direct counterparty has a right of recourse against a guarantor on the
other side if the direct counterparty has a conditional or unconditional legally enforceable right, in

116

for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States. In
addition, rule 908(a)(2), as adopted, requires regulatory reporting but not public dissemination of
transactions that have a direct or indirect counterparty that is a registered security-based swap
dealer or registered major security-based swap participant on either or both sides of the
transaction but do not otherwise fall within rule 908(a)(1). 265 We did not, however, include in
that final rule a provision addressing a security-based swap transaction that is a “transaction
conducted within the United States,” noting that commenters had expressed divergent views on
this particular element of the re-proposed rule. We also noted that we anticipated seeking
additional public comment on whether and, if so, how regulatory reporting and public
dissemination requirements should be applied to transactions involving non-U.S. persons when
they carry out relevant activities in the United States. 266
We also previously proposed rule 908(b), which would have provided that,
notwithstanding any other provision of Regulation SBSR, a person would not incur any
obligation under Regulation SBSR unless the person is:
(1) a U.S. person;
(2) a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant; or
(3) a counterparty to a transaction conducted within the United States. 267

whole or in part, to receive payments from, or otherwise collect from, the guarantor in connection
with the security-based swap.” A “direct counterparty” is a person that is a primary obligor on a
security-based swap. See Exchange Act rule 900(k) (defining “direct counterparty”).
265

See rule 908(a). We also simultaneously proposed certain amendments to Regulation SBSR. See
Regulation SBSR—Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information; Proposed
Rule (“Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release”), Exchange Act Release No. 74245
(February 11, 2015), 80 FR 14739 (March 19, 2015). These proposed amendments generally
address issues separate from those being addressed in this release.

Our recently adopted rule 908(b) included only the first two of these prongs, and the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release clarified that a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant that is not a U.S. person would incur an obligation under Regulation SBSR only if it
is registered. 268 We noted that we anticipated soliciting additional public comment on whether
regulatory reporting and/or public dissemination requirements should be extended to transactions
occurring within the United States between non-U.S. persons and, if so, which non-U.S. persons
should incur reporting duties under Regulation SBSR. 269
Finally, in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we re-proposed rule 901(a), which set
forth a reporting hierarchy for identifying which side has a duty to report in a variety of
transactions. This rule would have provided, among other things, that, in a transaction in which
neither side included a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, if
one side included a U.S. person while the other side did not, the side with the U.S. person would
have been the reporting side; if both sides in such transaction included a U.S. person or neither
side included a U.S. person, the sides would have been required to select the reporting side. 270 In
the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we adopted rules establishing the reporting hierarchy
for a range of transactions, including a provision that, in a transaction in which neither side
includes a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major security-based swap
participant but both sides include a U.S. person, the sides shall select the reporting side. 271 We
noted in that release that we anticipated soliciting additional comment about how to apply
Regulation SBSR, including which side should incur the reporting duty, in transactions between

C. Commenters’ Views
1. General comments on application of clearing, trade execution, regulatory
reporting, and public dissemination requirements
One commenter generally supported our proposed territorial approach to applying these
requirements, noting that the requirements “would encompass any transaction with a U.S. person
or within the U.S.” 273 Similarly, another market participant agreed with our proposed
application of these requirements to security-based swaps entered into by offshore funds that
have a U.S. nexus, arguing that a failure to apply such requirements would undermine central
objectives of the Dodd-Frank Act, create opportunities for regulatory arbitrage, and risk
fragmenting the security-based swap market. 274
At the same time, other commenters raised concerns about our proposed approach. 275
Some commenters explained that applying mandatory clearing, mandatory trading, regulatory
reporting, and public dissemination requirements to transactions between non-U.S. branches of
two U.S. persons would lead to duplication of, and conflicts with, foreign requirements. 276
Another commenter criticized the proposed approach to categorization of these requirements,
stating that the proposal did not classify regulatory reporting, public dissemination, mandatory

should not apply to transactions of non-U.S. persons with foreign security-based swap dealers
based on conduct in the United States when neither counterparty’s obligations under the securitybased swap are guaranteed by a U.S. person, because such an application would create “serious
operational, legal and economic difficulties for foreign security-based swap market participants”).

clearing, or mandatory trade execution as either entity-level requirements or transaction-level
requirements but as a distinct category of “transactional requirements” that apply to persons
regardless of their registration status. 277 This commenter argued that multiple categories of
requirements make it more difficult for market participants to determine which requirements
apply and whether substituted compliance is available. 278 The commenter contended that it
would be simpler and more rational to apply the clearing, trade execution, regulatory reporting,
and public dissemination requirements in the same way that we proposed to apply the external
business conduct requirements. 279
2. Comments on mandatory clearing and mandatory trade execution
Market participants expressed a range of views regarding the application of mandatory
clearing and mandatory trade execution to transactions of non-U.S. persons conducted within the
United States. One commenter supported our proposed definition of “transaction conducted
within the United States” together with our proposal to impose the clearing requirement on such
transactions because this approach would help ensure that the security-based swap activity of
offshore funds managed by U.S.-based investment managers is subject to our clearing
requirements. 280 Two commenters specifically argued that the proposed exceptions from the
application of mandatory clearing should be eliminated, 281 and one commenter urged the same

See AFR Letter at 10 (arguing that the exceptions were unreasonable because “no provision of

regulatory requirements”); Better Markets Letter at 22 (arguing that the exception for the clearing
requirement conflicts with the Commission’s territorial approach). Cf. Letter from AFR to CFTC
and SEC, dated November 25, 2014 (arguing that foreign subsidiaries of U.S. firms without
guarantees may present risk to the United States).

with respect to mandatory trade execution. 282 One of these commenters suggested that, at most,
we should permit substituted compliance for the transactions rather than excepting them from
any application of the clearing requirement. 283
Other commenters opposed an activity-based application of mandatory clearing or trade
execution. One market participant argued that conduct in the United States should not trigger the
application of the clearing requirement because the test “is impractical, cannot be justified by
cost-benefit analysis and exceeds the Commission’s SBS authority under the Exchange Act.” 284
Another commenter opposed applying regulatory requirements, including clearing and trade
execution, to transactions between two unguaranteed non-U.S. persons that involve activity in
the United States, regardless of their status as registered security-based swap dealers. 285
3. Comments on regulatory reporting and public dissemination
Commenters expressed divergent views regarding application of Regulation SBSR to
transactions involving the conduct of non-U.S. persons within the United States. 286 Noting its

execution).

285

See ICI Letter at 8-10 n.23 (explaining that the risk in such transactions is outside the United
States, that the counterparties would have no expectation that the requirements would apply, and
that U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons that use U.S. asset managers would be placed at a
competitive disadvantage); EC Letter at 2 (submitting that the Commission’s rules should not
apply to a transaction where the legal counterparty is a non-U.S. person, on the basis that there is
no counterparty risk to a U.S. person in such a transaction).

term may result in duplicative and conflicting regulation); EC Letter at 2 (explaining that the

general opposition to the proposed “transaction conducted within the United States” concept, one
commenter argued that the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements should
not apply to transactions conducted within the United States between two non-U.S.-person
counterparties because the proposed requirement would likely result in “duplicative reporting
requirements.” 287 Another commenter argued that it would be “unnecessary and unworkable” to
require transactions that are between non-U.S. persons and are executed but not cleared in the
United States to be reported, noting that such transactions would generally be subject to
reporting in the counterparties’ jurisdictions and additional reporting to a U.S. SDR would
impose additional significant costs. 288 Another commenter argued that applying Regulation
SBSR on the basis of conduct in the United States would not be workable because it would
require a trade-by-trade analysis rather than “party level static data,” for which system
architecture does not currently exist. 289 This commenter also stated that market participants do

minimal nexus to the United States); JFMC Letter at 4-5 (requesting that the Commission not
apply its rules to such transactions based on its belief that such an approach would conflict with

See Letter from ISDA to SEC dated November 14, 2014 (“ISDA Letter”) at 18 (urging us not to

4. The CFTC Staff Advisory and responses to the CFTC Request for Comment
As noted above, in response to the solicitation of comment on the CFTC Staff Advisory,
commenters raised concerns specifically with respect to the application of the approach in that
document to the CFTC’s transaction-level requirements.
Some commenters suggested that only those CFTC transaction-level requirements
directly relevant to the specific activities that the swap dealer carries out from a U.S. location
should apply to the transaction, generally taking the view that the CFTC’s regulatory interest
extends only to counterparty-facing activities and not, for example, to the risk-mitigation aspects
of Title VII. 291 One commenter suggested, however, that certain counterparty-facing
communications raise no concerns relevant to Title VII and therefore should not trigger
application of transaction-level requirements, even if a swap dealer engages in such

290

See ISDA Letter at 18. This commenter also argued that, because in its view a security-based
swap involving only non-U.S. persons that are not registered as a security-based swap dealer or as
a major security-based swap participant should not be required to be reported, the reporting
hierarchy need not address the reporting obligations arising from such security-based swap
transactions. See id. at 19.

291

See IIB Letter to CFTC at 8-10 (arguing that, if the CFTC adopts the CFTC Staff Advisory, it
should apply only the transaction-level requirements relevant to the activity that occurs within the
United States); SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter to CFTC at A-9 to A-11 (any approach adopted by the
CFTC that is based on the use of personnel located in the United States should trigger only
requirements that relate to concerns raised by the conduct that triggered the requirements);
Barclays Letter to CFTC at 3 (arguing that the only transaction-level requirements whose
objectives are implicated by activity in which the “sole nexus to the U.S. is the participation of
U.S.-based personnel of a non-U.S. swap dealer” are requirements related to “sales practices” and
that, therefore, the only relevant transaction-level requirements that should apply to such
transactions, should the CFTC adopt an approach that is based on the use of personnel located in
the United States, are pre-trade disclosure requirements); ISDA Letter to CFTC at 9 (suggesting
that, should the CFTC adopt the approach in the CFTC Staff Advisory, only those transactionlevel requirements that are transaction-specific and that relate to the triggering communication—
transaction specific disclosure and communications—should apply to the transaction).

123

communications within the United States. 292 Another commenter noted that this approach would
help ensure that costs and benefits of such an approach were commensurate. 293
Commenters also noted that a non-U.S.-person swap dealer using personnel or agents
located in the United States to arrange, negotiate, or execute swap transactions generally would
already be subject to regulation in its home jurisdiction. 294 In their view, adoption of the CFTC
Staff Advisory would raise the possibility of conflicting and duplicative regulation of such nonU.S.-person swap dealers and reflected a lack of comity on the CFTC’s part toward regulators in
other jurisdictions. 295
292

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter at A-11 to A-12 (stating that “arranging and negotiating trading
relationships and legal documentation and providing legal advice as well as providing credit
terms and technical terms, market color, market research or a general discussion of the swap
transaction” have no relation to any concerns of the Dodd-Frank Act in transactions between two
non-U.S. persons).

293

See Barclays Letter to CFTC at 3.

294

See CDEU Letter to CFTC at 2, 3 (arguing that the approach in the CFTC Staff Advisory
represents a departure from the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance in that a transaction between two
entities organized under German law would be subject to the Title VII requirements and the
EMIR requirements, which would be duplicative and unnecessary, without any ability for
substituted compliance); IIB Letter to CFTC at 5 (explaining that “[i]t would stand international
comity on its head for the [CFTC]” to adopt the CFTC Staff Advisory’s approach of imposing
regulatory requirements on non-U.S. firms on the basis of “limited activities” of their U.S.
personnel or agents when the foreign jurisdiction has strong supervisory interests in the risks
arising from the transactions); JFMC Letter to CFTC at 1 (explaining that the CFTC Staff
Advisory’s approach to applying transaction-level requirements does not account for the
application of foreign regimes to the transaction).

295

See SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter to CFTC at A-6 (explaining that the CFTC Staff Advisory fails to
respect comity principles because it would not “give due recognition to the compelling
supervisory interests of home regulators in the jurisdictions in which these transactions occur”).
See also IIB Letter to CFTC at 6 (arguing that Dodd-Frank incorporates mechanism for
addressing competition concerns: a “mandate” for international harmonization). Accordingly,
they urged the CFTC to make substituted compliance available in such transactions. See CDEU
Letter to CFTC at 5 (urging the CFTC to make substituted compliance determinations with
respect to the transaction-level requirements and to defer to foreign regulators to regulate entities
that are organized under the laws of their jurisdiction); ISDA Letter to CFTC at 4 (arguing that
substituted compliance should be available for transactions between a non-U.S. swap dealer and a
non-U.S. counterparty if the CFTC adopts the approach in the CFTC Staff Advisory);
SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter to CFTC at A-13 (suggesting that substituted compliance be available for
the transaction-level requirements).

124

Some commenters suggested that adoption of the CFTC Staff Advisory could present
difficulties for, and impose costs on, non-U.S.-person counterparties of dealers, as such
counterparties may not currently have systems in place for complying with certain CFTC
requirements, particularly if they are imposed only because the swap dealer (and not the
counterparty) happens to have carried out certain activities using personnel or agents located in
the United States. 296 As a result, commenters argued that non-U.S. swap dealers may no longer
be able to service non-U.S.-person counterparties from U.S. locations. 297 Some commenters
noted possible competitive effects of imposing, or not imposing, transaction-level requirements
on such transactions. One commenter supported the CFTC Staff Advisory, arguing that without
it, U.S. firms would be at a competitive disadvantage compared to non-U.S. firms operating in
the United States, because U.S. firms would be subject to different rules for the same
transactions. 298
Some commenters indicated that adoption of the CFTC Staff Advisory would also
disadvantage non-dealing counterparties. For example, one commenter argued that, were the
CFTC Staff Advisory adopted, end users that trade with non-U.S. swap dealers might face
competitive disadvantages. 299 Other commenters noted that the application of transaction-level

296

See, e.g., SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter to CFTC at A-4 (explaining that certain non-U.S.-person
counterparties may not have clearing relationships with FCMs, and requiring them to clear
through an FCM simply because the dealer happens to use personnel within the United States in
the transaction would be costly).

297

See, e.g., ISDA Letter to CFTC at 4.

298

See AFR Letter to CFTC at 3 (explaining that “any weakening of [the] advisory would open the
door to regular and significant levels of swaps activities being performed within the U.S. by
nominally foreign entities under foreign rules, or in some cases no rules at all,” whereas U.S.
firms operating in the United States would be subject to different rules for the same transactions
operating in the same market).

299

See CDEU Letter to CFTC at 2 (urging the CFTC not to adopt the Staff Advisory because it
would lead to competitive disadvantages for certain non-U.S. end-user affiliates that had relied on

125

requirements to such transactions could put foreign swap dealers at a competitive disadvantage
because it would be overly burdensome for them to use U.S.-based personnel or agents to
perform certain function in connection with their dealing activity, particularly with respect to
transactions with foreign counterparties that may oppose being subject to transaction-level
requirements, and that the adoption of the CFTC Staff Advisory would therefore encourage
dealers not to use their U.S.-based personnel. 300
D. Mandatory Clearing and Trade Execution
After careful consideration of concerns raised by commenters and our further
consideration of policy concerns relevant to the security-based swap market, we are not
proposing to subject transactions between two non-U.S. persons to the clearing requirement (and,
by extension, to the trade execution requirement 301) on the basis of dealing activity in the United
States, including transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in a
U.S. branch or office.

trading with non-U.S. swap dealers compared to other non-U.S. end users in the same markets
that currently hedge with unregistered counterparties). This commenter also expressed concern
that applying the transaction-level requirements to such transactions would disadvantage nonU.S.-person non-dealers that choose to hedge with non-U.S. swap dealers using personnel or
agents in the United States, as compared to non-U.S. persons that choose to hedge with
unregistered counterparties or dealers that do not use personnel or agents in the United States.
See CDEU Letter to CFTC at 1-2.
300

See ISDA Letter to CFTC at 4 (noting that non-U.S. counterparties have insisted that a swap
dealer not use its U.S.-based personnel so as to avoid being subject to transaction-level
requirements). See also JFMC Letter to CFTC at 1 (explaining that adoption of the CFTC Staff
Advisory would create regulatory uncertainty and disrupt the planning of firms’ systems and put
Asia-based swap dealers at a disadvantage if they want to use U.S.-based personnel or agents).

301

We continue to believe that, under the statutory framework, a security-based swap transaction is
potentially subject to the trade execution requirement only if it is first subject to the clearing
requirement. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31082. Accordingly, to the extent that
the clearing requirement does not apply to a particular security-based swap transaction, the trade
execution requirement also would not apply. See id. (noting that, to the extent that we are
proposing not to apply the clearing requirement to a particular transaction, the trade execution
requirement would not apply to such transaction).

126

As we noted in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, because the financial risks of such a
transaction reside outside the United States, “it is not necessary to apply the mandatory clearing
requirement to a transaction between two non-U.S. persons solely” because the transaction
involves activity in the United States. 302 However, the proposed approach would have subjected
a “transaction conducted within the United States” involving at least one registered foreign
security-based swap dealer to the clearing requirement (and, as noted, to the trade execution
requirement). We proposed this approach because we preliminarily believed that registered
foreign security-based swap dealers would have a more significant connection to the United
States and to minimize potential competitive disparities between U.S. persons and non-U.S.
persons. 303
On further consideration, however, we now preliminarily believe that we should not
impose the clearing requirement on a security-based swap transaction between two non-U.S.
persons where neither counterparty’s obligations under the security-based swap are guaranteed
by a U.S. person, even if the transaction involves one or more registered foreign security-based
swap dealers. In our view, a key objective of the clearing requirement is to mitigate systemic
and operational risk in the United States, but the counterparty credit risk and operational risk of
such transactions reside primarily outside the United States. 304 Accordingly, we preliminarily
302

303

See id. at 31080.

304

See id. at 31077; note 285, supra (citing EC Letter arguing that activity between two non-U.S.
persons in the United States does not create counterparty credit risk in the United States). We
recognize that even if a transaction involving one or more registered foreign security-based swap
dealers that is arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in the United States does
not create financial or counterparty credit risk that resides in the United States, it may create
operational risks associated, for example, with the processing of the transaction. See id.
However, such risks are borne primarily by the counterparties to the transaction, both of whom
are by definition—in the transactions being addressed in this release—non-U.S. persons (because
they are incorporated outside the United States and do not have their principal place of business

127

believe that subjecting such security-based swaps to the clearing requirement would not
significantly advance what we view as a key policy objective of the clearing requirement
applicable to security-based swaps under the Dodd-Frank Act. 305
We recognize that, to the extent that a non-U.S. person using personnel located in a U.S.
branch or office to arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swap transactions in connection
with its dealing activity is affiliated with a U.S. financial firm, the non-U.S. person’s securitybased swap exposures may pose risk to its U.S. affiliates in the United States, as U.S. entities that
are affiliated with non-U.S. persons may determine for reputational reasons that they must

in the United States). Accordingly, any reduction of operational risks in the U.S. financial market
that would be produced by requiring these transactions to be cleared by a U.S.-registered clearing
agency would likely be insignificant. On the other hand, imposing the clearing requirement on a
transaction between two non-U.S. persons involving at least one registered foreign security-based
swap dealer because the transaction was arranged, negotiated, or executed in the United States to
be cleared by a U.S.-registered clearing agency would directly expose that clearing agency and,
through it, the U.S. financial system to the counterparty credit risk of the transaction.
305

For these reasons, we disagree with commenters that characterized any exception from the
clearing requirement as “indefensible” or “unreasonable.” See note 281, supra.
We recognize that another commenter suggested that our initially proposed approach, which
would have required a “transaction conducted within the United States” to be cleared, subject to
certain exceptions, would help ensure that transactions of non-U.S.-person funds that are
managed by U.S.-based investment managers are subject to the Title VII clearing requirement.
See note 280, supra (citing Citadel Letter). Under the approach set forth in this release, the
transactions of such funds may not be subject to the clearing requirement when the counterparty
is not a U.S. person, but, as already noted, the risks of such transactions reside primarily outside
the United States, and we preliminarily do not believe that requiring such transactions to be
cleared would further the purposes of the clearing requirement. To the extent that the fund has its
principal place of business in the United States, of course, it would be a U.S. person and, under
the approach set forth in our Cross-Border Proposing Release, would be subject to the clearing
requirement. See Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(B) (defining “U.S. person” to include, among
other things, an investment vehicle “having its principal place of business in the United States”);
Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31078 (describing applicability of clearing requirement
to U.S. persons under that proposal). Cf. note 285, supra (citing ICI Letter noting that mere
presence of an investment manager in the United States does not necessarily create risk in the
United States).

128

support their non-U.S. affiliates at times of crisis. 306 However, as we noted in the Cross-Border
Adopting Release, Congress has established other regulatory tools that are specifically intended,
and better suited, to address risks to bank holding companies and financial holding companies,
arising from the financial services activities of a foreign affiliate of those holding companies
where the foreign affiliate does not engage in security-based swap activity in the United
States, 307 and we preliminarily believe the same principle applies here. Moreover, we note that it
is likely that such a non-U.S. person engaged in significant security-based swap dealing activity
would be a registered security-based swap dealer under our proposed approach and subject to
Title VII capital and margin requirements, which we preliminarily believe would be a more
narrowly tailored and appropriate way of mitigating any such risk in this context.308 Under
proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C), the non-U.S. person would be required to include in its dealer
de minimis threshold calculations any security-based swap transaction that it arranged,
negotiated, or executed in connection with its dealing activity using personnel located in a U.S.
branch or office. Any non-U.S. person engaged in significant activity in the United States,
including a non-U.S.-person affiliate of a U.S. financial firm whose obligations under a securitybased swap are not guaranteed by its U.S. parent, would be required to register as a securitybased swap dealer and comply with Title VII capital and margin requirements (along with other
entity-level requirements). Whereas the clearing requirement would have applied only to certain
306

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47318. As we noted in the Cross-Border Adopting
Release, however, any U.S. person that is subject to the reporting requirements of section 13(a) or
section 15(d) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(a) or 15 U.S.C. 78o(d) respectively, regardless
of whether that person provides a recourse guarantee relating to its non-U.S. affiliates’
obligations, must consider whether there are disclosures that must be made in its periodic reports

We also note in this regard the relatively low liquidity of the security-based swap market in
general, even for the most liquid products. See Section II.B.3, supra.

transactions of registered foreign security-based swap dealers, capital and margin requirements
would apply to all of their security-based swap transactions, including those that do not involve
personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. 309
We also preliminarily believe that requiring such security-based swap transactions to be
cleared (and executed on a platform) would impose a significant burden on certain market
participants. Some non-U.S. person counterparties may not currently have a direct or indirect
relationship with a U.S.-registered clearing agency, and the burdens of establishing such a
relationship may deter these non-U.S. persons—particularly those not engaged in dealing
activity—from entering into security-based swap transactions with non-U.S. persons that, in
connection with their dealing activity arrange, negotiate, or execute such transactions using
personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. 310 Given that, under our proposed approach, a nonU.S. person that engages in significant security-based swap activity using personnel located in a
U.S. branch or office is likely to be required to register and be subject to Title VII capital and
margin requirements with respect to all of its transactions, we preliminarily do not believe that
subjecting a subset of these persons’ activities to the clearing requirement is likely to provide a
significant additional reduction in counterparty credit risk in the United States. Consistent with
customary Commission practice, we expect that Commission staff will monitor developments in
the security-based swap market, including changes in liquidity or market fragmentation, that may

309

See, e.g., Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31011-12 (proposing to treat margin as an
entity-level requirement).

310

See notes 296-297, supra. Establishing a direct relationship with a clearing agency may entail
upfront costs that include, among other things, meeting minimum capital requirements and
making minimum clearing fund contributions. See, e.g., ICE Clear Credit Clearing Rules at 12
and 90 (available at:
https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/clear_credit/ICE_Clear_Credit_Rules.pdf, last visited April
15, 2015).

warrant reconsideration of this proposed approach and, if necessary and appropriate, make
recommendations to address such developments.
Because such security-based swap transactions would not be subject to the clearing
requirement, under our proposed approach they would also not be subject to mandatory trade
execution. While we acknowledge that trading between two non-U.S. persons in the OTC
market may indirectly affect liquidity available to market participants subject to mandatory trade
execution, 311 we preliminarily do not believe that it is appropriate to require such non-U.S.
persons to shift their non-U.S. business to trading platforms merely because one of the
counterparties to the transaction uses personnel located in a U.S. branch or office to arrange,
negotiate, or execute the transaction. 312 As with the clearing requirement, and consistent with
customary Commission practice, we expect that Commission staff will monitor developments in
the security-based swap market, including changes in liquidity or market fragmentation, that may
warrant reconsideration of this proposed approach and, if necessary and appropriate, make
recommendations to address such developments.
E. Regulation SBSR
We are proposing amendments to Regulation SBSR to address the application of the
regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to certain transactions not addressed
in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release or the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments
Release.

See Section VI.C.4, infra.

See note 308, supra.

1. Statutory framework
Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 313 provides that “[e]ach security-based swap that
is not accepted for clearing by any clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization shall be
reported to—(A) a registered security-based swap data repository described in section 13(n); or
(B) in the case in which there is no security-based swap data repository that would accept the
security-based swap, to the Commission.” Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act 314 provides
that “[e]ach security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be reported to a registered
security-based swap data repository.”
Section 13(m)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act 315 directs the Commission “to make securitybased swap transaction and pricing data available to the public in such form and at such times as
the Commission determines appropriate to enhance price discovery.” Section 13(m)(1)(C) of the
Exchange Act 316 authorizes the Commission to provide by rule for the public availability of
security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing data. Furthermore, section 13(m)(1)(D) of
the Exchange Act 317 authorizes the Commission to require registered entities (such as registered
SDRs) to publicly disseminate the security-based swap transaction and pricing data required to
be reported under section 13(m) of the Exchange Act. Finally, section 13(n)(5)(D)(ii) of the
Exchange Act 318 requires SDRs to provide security-based swap information “in such form and at

313

15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(1).

such frequency as the Commission may require to comply with the public reporting
requirements.”
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we interpreted the regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements to apply to security-based swaps that “exist, at least in part,
within the United States” 319 and noted that a security-based swap with a direct or indirect
counterparty that is a U.S. person necessarily would exist within the United States. 320 This view
is consistent with a territorial approach to the statutory language requiring the reporting of
“[e]ach security-based swap,” and with the statutory requirement that security-based swaps that
are reported must be publicly disseminated, unless an exception applies. 321 In our view, it is also
consistent with a territorial approach to these statutory provisions to require each security-based
swap that is otherwise subject to regulatory requirements under Title VII (as implemented under
our territorial approach to implementing those requirements) to be reported and publicly
disseminated pursuant to Regulation SBSR.
2. Proposed amendments regarding application of Regulation SBSR to certain
security-based swap transactions
(a) Security-based swap transactions that a non-U.S. person, in connection
with its dealing activity, arranges, negotiates, or executes using
personnel located in a U.S. branch or office
We propose to amend rule 908(a)(1) of Regulation SBSR to include a provision that
would require any security-based swap transaction connected with a person’s security-based
swap dealing activity that is arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel of such non-U.S.
person located in a U.S. branch or office—or by personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch

319

See, e.g., Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14651.

133

or office—to be reported to a registered SDR and publicly disseminated pursuant to Regulation
SBSR. 322 This proposed amendment generally reflects the approach described in our CrossBorder Proposing Release, which would have subjected “transactions conducted within the
United States” to both regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements. 323 Consistent
with that approach, it would expand the scope of Regulation SBSR in two ways. First, it would
require the security-based swaps that a registered foreign security-based swap dealer arranges,
negotiates, or executes using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office to be publicly
disseminated, even if the counterparty to such transaction is another non-U.S. person whose

322

See proposed rule 908(a)(1)(v). We intend the proposed rule to indicate the same type of activity
by personnel located in the United States as described in Section III.B.5, supra. Moreover, for
purposes of proposed rule 908(a)(1)(v), we would interpret the term “personnel” in a manner
consistent with the definition of “associated person of a security-based swap dealer” contained in
section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(70), regardless of whether such non-U.S.
person or such non-U.S. person’s agent is itself a security-based swap dealer. See note 193, supra
(discussing the Commission’s proposed interpretation of the term “personnel” for purposes of
proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C)).

323

We preliminarily believe that the approach reflected in this release, which focuses only on
whether a counterparty in connection with its dealing activity has arranged, negotiated, or
executed the security-based swap transaction using personnel located in the United States, should
mitigate many of the concerns raised by commenters. See note 286, supra (citing several
comment letters arguing, among other things, that requirements, including Regulation SBSR,
should not apply to transactions with only a minimal connection to the United States). See also
notes 289-290, supra (citing comment letters arguing that looking to activity in the United States
as a trigger for Regulation SBSR would not be practicable); note 292, supra (citing
SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter).
We recognize that some commenters suggested that certain Title VII requirements, including the
regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements implemented by Regulation SBSR,
should not apply to transactions between two non-U.S. persons even if they involve activity in the
United States because of operational complications or potential regulatory overlap or duplication.
See note 275-276, 286-287, and 294-295, supra. We do not believe, however, that reporting a
security-based swap to a registered SDR is likely to pose significant challenges, as the burden is
borne under our rules only by one side of the transaction, and at least one counterparty to any
transaction arranged, negotiated, or executed by a non-U.S. person, in connection with its dealing
activity, using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office is already likely to have infrastructure
in place to report transactions to a registered SDR.

134

obligations under the security-based swap are not guaranteed by a U.S. person. 324 Second, it
would require that a transaction of a non-U.S. person that is not a registered security-based swap
dealer be subject to both regulatory reporting and public dissemination under Regulation SBSR
if that non-U.S. person would be required to include the transaction in its de minimis threshold
calculations under proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C), as described above.
Requiring these transactions to be reported to a registered SDR should enhance our
ability to oversee relevant activity related to security-based swap dealing occurring within the
United States as well as to monitor market participants for compliance with specific Title VII
requirements (including the requirement that a person register with the Commission as a
security-based swap dealer if it exceeds the de minimis threshold). We preliminarily believe it
would also likely enhance our ability to monitor for manipulative and abusive practices
involving security-based swap transactions or transactions in related underlying assets, such as
corporate bonds or other securities transactions that result from dealing activity, or other relevant
activity, in the U.S. market.
Subjecting these transactions to the public dissemination requirements of Regulation
SBSR should enhance the level of transparency in the U.S. security-based swap market,
potentially reducing implicit transaction costs 325 and promoting greater price efficiency. As we

324

Under Exchange Act rule 3a71-1(c), absent a limitation by the Commission, a security-based
swap dealer is deemed to be a security-based swap dealer with respect to each security-based
swap it enters into, regardless of the type, class, or category of the security-based swap or the
person’s activities in connection with the security-based swap. Accordingly, for purposes of this
proposed amendment, any transaction that a registered security-based swap dealer arranged,
negotiated, or executed using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office would be “in
connection with its dealing activity” and subject to both regulatory reporting and public
dissemination.

325

As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, dealing activity in the single-name CDS
market is concentrated among a small number of firms that each enjoy informational advantages
as a result of the large quantity of order flow they privately observe. Implicit transaction costs are

135

noted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, the current market for security-based swaps is
opaque. 326 Dealers can observe order flow submitted to them by customers and other potential
counterparties and know about their own executions, and may know about other dealers’
transactions in certain instances, but information about executed transactions is not widespread.
Market participants—particularly non-dealers—have to arrive at a price at which they would be
willing to assume risk with little or no knowledge of how other market participants would or
have arrived at prices at which they have assumed or would be willing to assume risk. We
preliminarily believe that, by reducing information asymmetries between non-dealers and
persons acting in a dealing capacity and providing more equal access to post-trade information in
the security-based swap market, implicit transaction costs could be reduced, which could in turn
promote greater price efficiency. 327 Ensuring that post-trade information encompasses
transactions involving a non-U.S. person that arranged, negotiated, or executed the securitybased swap in connection with its dealing activity using personnel located in a U.S. branch or
the difference between the transaction price and the fundamental value, which could reflect
adverse selection or could reflect compensation for inventory risk. In addition to these implicit
transaction costs, security-based swap market participants may face explicit transaction costs such
as commissions and other fees that dealers might charge non-dealers for access to the market.
See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14704 n.1254.
326

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14605.

327

Security-based swaps are complex derivative products, and there is no single accepted way to
model a security-based swap for pricing purposes. As we noted in the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, making post-trade pricing and volume information publicly available should
allow valuation models to be adjusted to reflect how other market participants have valued a
security-based swap product at a specific moment in time. Public dissemination of last-sale
information also should aid persons engaged in dealing activity in deriving better quotations,
because they will know the prices at which other market participants have traded. Last-sale
information also should aid end users and other non-dealing entities in evaluating current
quotations, by allowing them to question why a dealer’s quote differs from the prices of the most
recent transactions. Furthermore, smaller market participants that view last-sale information
should be able to test whether quotations offered by dealers before the last sale were close to the
price at which the last sale was executed. In this manner, post-trade transparency should promote
price competition and more efficient price discovery in the security-based swap market. See
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14606.

136

office could increase price competition and price efficiency in the security-based swap market
and should enable all market participants to have more comprehensive information with which to
make trading and valuation determinations. 328
(b) Security-based swaps executed on a platform having its principal place
of business in the United States
We also are proposing to amend rule 908(a)(1) of Regulation SBSR by adding a
provision that would require any security-based swap transaction that is executed on a
platform 329 having its principal place of business in the United States both to be reported to a
registered SDR and to be publicly disseminated pursuant to Regulation SBSR. 330 Under our
previously re-proposed rule, such transactions generally would have been subjected to
Regulation SBSR as “transactions conducted within the United States” under the proposed
definition of that term.
As noted above, our proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR focus on transactions
that a non-U.S. person, in connection with its dealing activity, arranges, negotiates, or executes
using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office rather than on the broader range of activity
reflected in our proposed definition of “transaction conducted in the United States.” We
preliminarily continue to believe, however, that a transaction executed on a platform that has its
principal place of business in the United States also should be subject to Regulation SBSR, even
when the transaction involves two non-U.S. persons that are not engaged in dealing activity in
connection with the transaction. Transactions executed on a platform having its principal place
of business in the United States are consummated within the United States and therefore exist, at
328

See id.

329

Regulation SBSR defines “platform” to mean “a national securities exchange or security-based
swap execution facility that is registered or exempt from registration.” Rule 900(v).

330

See proposed rule 908(a)(1)(iii).

137

least in part, in the United States. 331 Requiring these security-based swaps to be reported to a
registered SDR will permit the Commission and other relevant authorities to observe, in a
registered SDR, all transactions executed on such a platform and to carry out oversight of such
security-based swaps. Furthermore, we preliminarily believe that public dissemination of such
transactions would have value to participants in the U.S. security-based swap market, who are
likely to trade the same or similar products, as these products will have been listed by a platform
having its principal place of business in the United States.
(c) Security-based swaps effected by or through a registered broker-dealer
We are also proposing to amend rule 901(a) of Regulation SBSR by adding a provision
that would require the reporting and public dissemination of any security-based swap transaction
that is effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF). 332 As
noted above, existing rule 908(a)(1) already provides that any transaction involving a U.S.
person, either directly or indirectly, on one or both sides of the transaction subjects that
transaction to both regulatory reporting and public dissemination; proposed rule 908(a)(1)(v)
would impose the same requirements with respect to any transaction that a non-U.S. person in
connection with its dealing activity arranges, negotiates, or executes using its personnel or the
331

Cf. Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14654 (noting that a security-based swap that is
accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United
States also exists, at least in part, within the United States).
Requiring these transactions to be reported should enable registered SDRs to have a complete
record of all security-based swaps that are executed on platforms that have their principal place of
business in the United States, which should enhance our ability to monitor these platforms, and
activity in the security-based swap market more generally, for manipulation and other abusive
practices. Cf. Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31040 (noting importance of having a
complete record of security-based swaps). Requiring these transactions to be reported should also
enhance our ability to monitor activity on these platforms for compliance with recordkeeping and
reporting and other requirements. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31183 (discussing
the market-wide benefits of enhanced transparency).

See proposed rule 908(a)(1)(iv).

138

personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. Given the limitation on reporting duties
set forth in rule 908(b) and in the proposed amendments to that rule, we expect that most, if not
all, registered broker-dealers required to report under this proposed amendment would be U.S.
persons intermediating security-based swap transactions between non-U.S. person counterparties
and that such persons would be effecting transactions in security-based swaps from their offices
in the United States. Moreover, under the proposed amendments to the reporting hierarchy
described below, a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) would be required to
report transactions effected by or through it only when neither side of that transaction includes a
U.S. person, neither side is a registered security-based swap dealer or registered major securitybased swap participant, and neither side of that transaction involves a non-U.S. person that has,
in connection with its dealing activity, arranged, negotiated, or executed the security-based swap
using its personnel or the personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. 333
To the extent that a registered broker-dealer intermediates a security-based swap
transaction, we preliminarily believe that the transaction should be both reported to a registered
SDR and publicly disseminated. Registered broker-dealers play a key role as intermediaries in
the U.S. financial markets. To improve integrity and transparency in those markets, we believe
that it is important that the Commission, and other relevant authorities, have ready access to

333

We acknowledge that some commenters urged us not to require SB SEFs to report transactions
under Regulation SBSR. See note 289, supra. We preliminarily believe, however, that a
registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) is likely to be better positioned to report
than either counterparty to a transaction described in proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). We note
that proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) applies only when two non-U.S. persons who are not
registered security-based swap dealers, registered major security-based swap participants, or nonU.S. persons that fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5) effect a security-based swap through a
registered broker-dealer. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we observed that nonregistered persons are less likely than Commission registrants to have systems in place to support
the reporting required by Regulation SBSR, and we preliminarily believe that the same applies
here. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14600.

139

detailed information about the security-based swap transactions that such persons intermediate.
Furthermore, we preliminarily believe that public dissemination of such transactions will have
value to participants in the U.S. security-based swap market, who are likely to trade the same or
similar products.
3. Application of the public dissemination requirement to certain transactions
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we adopted rule 908(a)(1)(i), which requires,
among other things, public dissemination of all security-based swap transactions having a U.S.person guarantor, including transactions in which the other side includes no counterparty that is a
U.S. person, registered security-based swap dealer, or registered major security-based swap
participant (a “covered cross-border transaction”). 334 This represented a departure from the reproposed approach described in the Cross-Border Proposing Release, which would have
excepted covered cross-border transactions from the public dissemination requirement. 335 We
noted, however, that we had determined to continue considering whether to except covered
cross-border transactions from the public dissemination requirement and that we would solicit
additional comment regarding whether such an exception would be appropriate. We solicit
comment on this approach in the request for comments below.
In light of our determination to require all security-based swap transactions of U.S.
persons, including all transactions conducted through a foreign branch, to be publicly

334

See rule 908(a)(1)(i); Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14652-53. As in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, a “covered cross-border transaction” refers to a transaction
that meets the description above and will not be submitted to clearing at a registered clearing
agency having its principal place of business in the United States. See Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, 80 FR 14653.

335

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31062; initially re-proposed rule 908(a)(2) (requiring
that security-based swaps be publicly disseminated if there is a direct or indirect counterparty that
is a U.S. person on each side of the transaction).

140

disseminated, we preliminarily do not think that it would be appropriate to exempt covered
cross-border transactions from the public dissemination requirement. As we have noted
elsewhere, the transactions of a guaranteed non-U.S. person exist, at least in part, within the
United States, and the economic reality of these transactions is substantially identical to
transactions entered into directly by a U.S. person (including through a foreign branch). 336
Failure to require such transactions to be publicly disseminated would treat these economically
substantially identical transactions differently, potentially creating competitive disparities
between U.S. persons, depending on how they have structured their business, as a guaranteed
non-U.S. person would be able to carry out an unlimited volume of covered cross-border
transactions without being subject to the public dissemination requirement. 337
4. Proposed amendments regarding limitations on reporting obligations of certain
persons engaged in security-based swaps subject to Regulation SBSR
Rule 908(b) of Regulation SBSR provides that, notwithstanding any other provision of
Regulation SBSR, a person shall not incur any obligation under Regulation SBSR unless it is a
U.S. person, a registered security-based swap dealer, or a registered major security-based swap
participant. 338 We noted that rule 908(b) is designed to specify the types of persons that will
incur duties under Regulation SBSR. If a person does not come within any of the categories

336

See note 319, supra.

337

However, if the transactions of a guaranteed non-U.S. person are subject to regulatory reporting
and public dissemination requirements in a foreign jurisdiction that are comparable to those
imposed by Regulation SBSR, such transactions could be eligible for substituted compliance.
See rule 908(c).

338

See rule 908(b). In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, we proposed to amend
rule 908(b) by adding platforms and registered clearing agencies to the list of persons that might
incur obligations under Regulation SBSR. See Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments
Release, 80 FR 14759.

141

enumerated by rule 908(b), it would not incur any duties under Regulation SBSR. 339 Rule
908(b) was designed to reduce assessment costs and provide greater legal certainty to
counterparties engaging in cross-border security-based swaps, and we explained that we
anticipated soliciting additional public comment regarding whether regulatory reporting and/or
public dissemination requirements should be extended to transactions between non-U.S. persons
occurring within the United States and, if so, which non-U.S. persons should incur reporting
duties under Regulation SBSR. 340
Consistent with the proposed amendments described above, and so that at least one
counterparty to a transaction that is subject to Regulation SBSR has an obligation to report the
transaction to a registered SDR, we are proposing to add subparagraph (5) to rule 908(b) to
include a non-U.S. person that, in connection with such person’s security-based swap dealing
activity, arranged, negotiated, or executed the security-based swap using its personnel located in
a U.S. branch or office, or using personnel of its agent located in a U.S. branch or office. 341
Because existing rule 908(b)(2) already covers a non-U.S. person that is registered as a securitybased swap dealer, the effect of proposed rule 908(b)(5) would be to cover a non-U.S. person
that engages in dealing activity in the United States but that does not meet the de minimis
threshold and thus would not be registered as a security-based swap dealer.

339

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14656.

340

See id.

341

See proposed rule 908(b)(5). We intend the proposed rule to indicate the same type of activity by
personnel located in the United States as described in Section III.B.5, supra. Moreover, for
purposes of proposed rule 908(b)(5), we would interpret the term “personnel” in a manner
consistent with the definition of “associated person of a security-based swap dealer” contained in
section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(70), regardless of whether such non-U.S.
person or such non-U.S. person’s agent is itself a security-based swap dealer. See note 193, supra
(discussing the Commission’s proposed interpretation of the term “personnel” for purposes of
proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii)(C)).

142

5. Proposed amendment regarding reporting duties of certain persons that are not
registered security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based swap
participants
Rule 901(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR establishes a reporting hierarchy that specifies the
side that has the duty to report a security-based swap, taking into account the types of entities
present on each side of the transaction. 342 The reporting side, as determined by the reporting
hierarchy, is required to submit the information required by rule 901 of Regulation SBSR to a
registered SDR. 343 The reporting side may select the registered SDR to which it makes the
required report.
Rule 901(a)(2) of Regulation SBSR does not assign reporting obligations for certain
transactions having only unregistered entities on both sides of the transaction. In the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, we specifically noted that we anticipated soliciting further comment
regarding the duty to report a security-based swap where neither side includes a registered
security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap participant and neither side
includes a U.S. person or only one side includes a U.S. person. 344 In this release we are
proposing additional provisions setting forth which sides would have the duty to report such
transactions.
As noted above, and as discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, one
commenter raised concerns about burdens that the previously re-proposed reporting hierarchy
might place on U.S. persons in transactions with certain non-U.S.-person counterparties. 345
342

See rule 901(a).

343

Rule 900(gg) defines “reporting side” to mean “the side of a security-based swap identified by §
242.901(a)(2).” As noted above, rule 901(a)(2) identifies the person that will be obligated to
report a security-based swap under various circumstances.

344

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14600, 14655.

345

See IIB Letter at 26; Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14600.

143

Under that approach, in a transaction between a non-U.S. person and a U.S. person, where
neither side included a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, the
U.S. person would have had the duty to report. The commenter noted that in such transactions
the non-U.S.-person counterparty might be engaged in dealing activity but at levels below the
security-based swap dealer de minimis threshold and the U.S. person may not be acting in a
dealing capacity in any of its security-based swap transactions. The commenter argued that, in
such cases, the non-U.S. person may be better equipped to report the transaction and accordingly
that, when two non-registered persons enter into a security-based swap, the counterparties should
be permitted to select which counterparty would report, even if one counterparty is a U.S.
person. 346
Proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) is intended in part to address this concern when the
non-U.S. person is engaged in dealing activity using personnel located in the United States.
Under the proposed rule, in a transaction between such a non-U.S. person and a U.S. person,
where neither side includes a registered security-based swap dealer or a registered major
security-based swap participant, the sides would be permitted to select which side has the duty to
report the transaction. 347 We preliminarily believe that this approach should facilitate efficient
allocation of reporting duties between the sides by permitting the counterparties to select the
reporting side.
For similar reasons, proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2) also provides that, in a transaction
between two non-U.S. persons in which both sides include a non-U.S. person that is carrying out

346

See IIB Letter at 26 (stating that, in such transactions, “it would be more efficient and fair for the
Commission to modify its rules to allow a De Minimis SBSD to agree with its counterparty to be
the reporting party when facing a U.S. non-registrant counterparty”).

347

See proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2).

144

relevant security-based swap dealing activity using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office,
as described in proposed rule 908(b)(5), the sides would be permitted to select which side has the
duty to report the transaction. We preliminarily believe that, because both sides of such a
transaction are engaging in dealing activity in the United States but both fall beneath the de
minimis thresholds, both sides are likely to have approximately equivalent levels of
infrastructure to support their U.S. business, including the infrastructure for reporting
transactions to a registered SDR. In such cases, we preliminarily believe that it would be
reasonable and appropriate to permit them to select which side will have the duty to report. 348
With respect to transactions in which one side includes only unregistered non-U.S.
persons that do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5) and the other side includes at least one
unregistered non-U.S. person that does fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5) or one unregistered
U.S. person, we preliminarily believe that it is appropriate to place the reporting duty on the side
that includes the unregistered non-U.S. person that falls within proposed rule 908(b)(5) or the
unregistered U.S. person. 349 We preliminarily believe that, in such a transaction, the U.S. person
or the non-U.S. person engaged in a security-based swap transaction, in connection with its
dealing activity, using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office may generally be more likely
than its counterparty to have the ability to report the transaction to a registered SDR given that it
has operations in the United States. We also note that, in a transaction where neither side
includes a registered security-based swap dealer or a registered major security-based swap
348

Similar considerations have informed our proposal to permit counterparties to a transaction where
both sides include only non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5) to select
the reporting side. See proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). Such a transaction would be subject to
Regulation SBSR because it has been accepted for clearing by a clearing agency that has its
principal place of business in the United States or because it has been executed on a platform that
has its principal place of business in the United States. See proposed rules 908(a)(ii) and (iii).

349

See proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3).

145

participant, placing the duty on the side that has a presence in the United States should better
enable us to monitor and enforce compliance with the reporting requirement.
Finally, we are proposing a rule that would provide that a registered broker-dealer
(including a registered SB SEF) shall report the information required by rules 901(c) and 901(d)
for any transaction in which neither side includes a U.S. person and neither side includes a nonU.S. person that falls within proposed rule 908(b)(5) but the security-based swap is effected by
or through the registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF). 350 We preliminarily
believe that, in such a transaction, the registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF)
may generally be more likely than the counterparties to the transaction (neither of which may
have any operations or presence in the United States) to have the ability to report the transaction
to a registered SDR given its presence in the United States and its familiarity with the
Commission’s regulatory requirements. 351
6. Proposed amendments to rules 900(u), 901(d)(9), 906(b), 906(c), and 907(a)
of Regulation SBSR to accommodate proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).
(a) Proposed amendment to rule 900(u)
Rule 900(u) defines a “participant” of a registered SDR as “a counterparty, that meets the
criteria of [rule 908(b) of Regulation SBSR], of a security-based swap that is reported to that
[registered SDR] to satisfy an obligation under [rule 901(a) of Regulation SBSR].” In the
Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, we proposed to expand the definition of

350

See proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).

351

Cf. Letter from ISDA to SEC, dated January 18, 2011 (“ISDA/SIFMA Letter”) at 17 (noting that
market participants, including brokers, may provide reporting services on behalf of their
customers).

146

“participant” to include registered clearing agencies and platforms. 352 This proposed definition
would not include a registered broker-dealer that incurs reporting obligations solely because it
effects a transaction between unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed rule
908(b)(5). We believe that such registered broker-dealers should be participants of any
registered SDR to which they are required to report security-based swap transaction information.
Imposing participant status on such registered broker-dealers would explicitly require those
entities to report security-based swap transaction information to a registered SDR in a format
required by that registered SDR under rule 901(h). If such registered broker-dealers were not
participants of the registered SDR and were permitted to report data in a format of their own
choosing, it could be difficult or impossible for the registered SDR to understand individual
transaction reports or aggregate them with other reports in a meaningful way. This could
adversely affect the ability of the Commission and other relevant authorities to carry out their
oversight responsibilities and could interfere with the ability of a registered SDR to publicly
disseminate security-based swap transaction information as required by rule 902 of Regulation
SBSR. Therefore, we are proposing to amend the definition of “participant” in rule 900(u) to
include a registered broker-dealer that is required to report a security-based swap by rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).
If we ultimately adopt both this amendment to rule 900(u) and the amendment proposed
in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, “participant” would mean: “with
respect to a registered security-based swap data repository, [] (1) a counterparty, that meets the
352

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14751. As proposed to be amended, rule 900(u)
would define “participant” to mean: (1) a person that is a counterparty to a security-based swap,
provided that the security-based swap is subject to regulatory reporting under Regulation SBSR
and is reported to a registered SDR pursuant to Regulation SBSR; (2) a platform that is required
to report a security-based swap pursuant to Rule 901(a)(1); or (3) a registered clearing agency
that is required to report a life cycle event pursuant to Rule 901(e).

147

criteria of § 242.908(b), of a security-based swap that is reported to that registered security-based
swap data repository to satisfy an obligation under § 242.901(a); (2) a platform that reports a
security-based swap to that registered security-based swap data repository to satisfy an obligation
under § 242.901(a); (3) a registered clearing agency that is required to report to that registered
security-based swap data repository whether or not it has accepted a security-based swap for
clearing pursuant to § 242.901(e)(1)(ii); or (4) a registered broker-dealer (including a registered
security-based swap execution facility) that is required to report a security-based swap to that
registered security-based swap data repository by § 242.901(a).”
(b) Proposed amendment to rule 901(d)(9)
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we noted the importance of identifying
whether a broker is involved in the execution of a security-based swap. Identifying the broker
for a security-based swap will provide regulators with a more complete understanding of the
transaction and could provide useful information for market surveillance purposes. 353 To obtain
information about brokers that facilitate security-based swap transactions—as well as other
persons involved in a security-based swap—existing rule 901(d)(2) requires the reporting side to
report, as applicable, the branch ID, broker ID, execution agent ID, trade ID, and trading desk ID
of the direct counterparty on the reporting side. In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we
also recognized the importance of identifying the venue on which a security-based swap is
executed, because this information should enhance the ability of relevant authorities to conduct
surveillance in the security-based swap market and understand developments in the security-

353

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14583.

148

based swap market generally. 354 Therefore, we adopted rule 901(d)(9), which requires reporting
of the platform ID, if applicable.
As described above, proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) would require a registered brokerdealer to report the information in rules 901(c) and 901(d) for any transaction between two
unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within rule 908(b)(5) where the transaction is
effected by or through the registered broker-dealer. Because a security-based swap reported
under rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) will not have a reporting side, no one would have the obligation to
report the information required by existing rule 901(d)(2). We preliminarily believe, however,
that being able to identify any registered broker-dealer that effects a security-based swap
transaction in the manner described in rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) would enhance our understanding
of the security-based swap market and would improve our ability, and the ability of other
relevant authorities, to conduct surveillance of security-based swap market activities. We
therefore propose to amend rule 901(d)(9) to assure that the identity of any such registered
broker-dealer is included in the report of a security-based swap transaction reported pursuant to
rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). As proposed to be amended, rule 901(d)(9) would require reporting of
“[t]he platform ID, if applicable, or if a registered broker-dealer (including a registered securitybased swap execution facility) is required to report the security based swap by §
242.901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), the broker ID of that registered broker-dealer (including a registered
security-based swap execution facility).”
(c) Proposed amendments to rules 906 and 907
Under the proposed amendment to rule 900(u) described above, 355 the definition of
“participant” would be expanded to include a registered broker-dealer that incurs reporting
354

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14589.

149

obligations solely because it effects a transaction between two unregistered non-U.S. persons that
do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5). Rule 906(b) of Regulation SBSR generally requires a
participant of a registered SDR to provide the identity of its ultimate parent and any affiliates that
also are participants of that registered SDR. In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments
Release, we proposed to except platforms and registered clearing agencies from rule 906(b). 356
We preliminarily believe that the purposes of rule 906(b)—namely, facilitating our ability to
measure derivatives exposure within the same ownership group—would not be advanced by
applying the requirement to a registered broker-dealer that incurs reporting obligations solely
because it effects a transaction between two unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within
proposed rule 908(b)(5) to report parent and affiliate information to a registered SDR. A
registered broker-dealer acting solely as a broker with respect to a security-based swap is not
taking a principal position in the security-based swap. To the extent that such a registered
broker-dealer has an affiliate that transacts in security-based swaps, such positions could be
derived from other transaction reports indicating that affiliate as a counterparty. Accordingly,
we propose to amend rule 906(b) to state that reporting obligations under rule 906(b) do not
apply to a registered broker-dealer that becomes a participant solely as a result of making a
report to satisfy an obligation under rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).
We propose to make a similar amendment to rule 907(a)(6). In the Regulation SBSR
Proposed Amendments Release, we proposed to amend this rule to require a registered SDR to
have policies and “[f]or periodically obtaining from each participant other than a platform or a
registered clearing agency information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any

355

See Section V.E.6, supra.

356

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14645-46.

150

participant(s) with which the participant is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty
IDs.” 357 We now propose to further amend rule 907(a)(6) and except from this requirement a
registered broker-dealer that incurs reporting obligations solely because it effects a transaction
between two unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5).
Thus, if we ultimately adopt both this amendment to rule 907(a)(6) and the amendment to rule
907(a)(6) proposed in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, rule 907(a)(6)
would require a registered SDR to have policies and procedures “[f]or periodically obtaining
from each participant other than a platform, a registered clearing agency, or a registered brokerdealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) that becomes a participant
solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under § 242.901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4)
information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any participant(s) with which
the participant is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and counterparty IDs.”
(d) Extending the applicability of rule 906(c)
Rule 906(c) requires certain participants of a registered SDR to establish, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that the
participant complies with any obligations to report information to a registered SDR in a manner
consistent with Regulation SBSR. Rule 906(c) also requires participants covered by the rule to
review and update their policies and procedures at least annually. In the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, we stated that the policies and procedures required by rule 906(c) are intended
to promote complete and accurate reporting of security-based swap information by SDR

357

Once a participant reports parent and affiliate information to a registered SDR, rule 906(b)
requires the participant to “promptly notify the registered [SDR] of any changes” to its parent and
affiliate information.

151

participants that are registered security-based swap dealers or registered major security-based
swap participants. 358
In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, we proposed to amend rule
906(c) by extending the requirement to have such policies and procedures to platforms and
registered clearing agencies. 359 In light of the proposed amendments to rule 901(a) relating to
registered broker-dealers, described above, we now preliminarily believe that a registered
broker-dealer that incurs reporting obligations solely because it effects transactions between two
unregistered non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5) also should be
required to establish, maintain, and enforce the policies and procedures required by rule
906(c). 360
We preliminarily believe that the proposed amendment to rule 906(c) should result in
greater accuracy and completeness of the security-based swap transaction data reported to
registered SDRs. Without written policies and procedures, compliance with reporting
obligations of such a registered broker-dealer might depend too heavily on key individuals or
unreliable processes. For example, if knowledge of the reporting function was not reflected in
written policies and procedures but existed solely in the memories of one or a few individuals,
compliance with applicable reporting requirements by the firm might suffer if these key
individuals depart the firm. We preliminarily believe, therefore, that requiring participants that

358

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14648.

359

See id. at 14758-59.

360

We are also proposing to revise the title of the rule. As adopted, the title of rule 906(c) was:
“Policies and procedures of registered security-based swap dealers and registered major securitybased swap participants.” In the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, we proposed
to add registered clearing agencies and platforms to the rule’s title. Rather than adding registered
broker-dealers to the entities delineated in the title to 906(c), we are proposing to revise the title
to “Policies and procedures to support reporting compliance.”

152

are registered broker-dealers that incur reporting obligations solely because they effect a
transaction between two non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5) to
establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures should promote clear, reliable
reporting that can continue independent of any specific individuals. We further believe that
requiring such a participant to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
relevant to its reporting responsibilities, as would be required by the proposed amendment to rule
906(c), would help to improve the degree and quality of overall compliance with the reporting
requirements of Regulation SBSR.
7. Availability of substituted compliance
Rule 908(c)(1) of Regulation SBSR describes the security-based swap transactions that
potentially would be eligible for substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swap transactions. Accordingly, substituted compliance
would potentially be available for transactions that would become subject to Regulation SBSR
pursuant to the proposed amendments described above, as the location of relevant dealing
activity or of execution of the transaction would continue to be irrelevant for purposes of rule
908(c). 361
Rule 908(c)(1) does not condition substituted compliance eligibility on where a particular
transaction was arranged, negotiated, or executed. 362 Under rule 908(c)(1), a security-based
swap is eligible for substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public
361

See note 295, supra.

362

Rule 908(c)(1) provides: “Compliance with the regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements in sections 13(m) and 13A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(m) and 78m-1), and the rules
and regulations thereunder, may be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction
that is the subject of a Commission order described in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, provided
that at least one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap is either a non-U.S. person
or a foreign branch.”

153

dissemination, provided that at least one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap is
either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch. Thus, rule 908(c)(1) permits a security-based swap
between a U.S. person and the New York branch of a foreign bank (i.e., a non-U.S. person with
operations inside the United States) to be eligible for substituted compliance, provided that such
compliance is with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that is the subject of a Commission
substituted compliance order.
In adopting rule 908(c)(1), we noted that the final rule was consistent with our decision to
solicit additional comments regarding whether to impose reporting or public dissemination
requirements based solely on whether a transaction is conducted within the United States. 363
Although we are now proposing an amendment that would impose these requirements on certain
transactions that a non-U.S. person arranges, negotiates, or executes using personnel located in a
U.S. branch or office, we are not proposing an amendment that would limit the availability of
substituted compliance for such transactions based on the location of this relevant activity.
Accordingly, under our proposed approach, and consistent with our final rule, counterparties to a
transaction that is required to be reported because a non-U.S.-person counterparty to the
transaction, in connection with its dealing activity, arranged, negotiated, or executed the
transaction using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office or because it was executed on a
platform or effected by or through a registered broker-dealer would be eligible for substituted
compliance, provided that such compliance is with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that is the
subject of a Commission order. 364

363

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14658.

364

A non-U.S. person engaged in relevant dealing activity using personnel located in a U.S. branch
or office may incur the duty to report a transaction under Exchange Act rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(A),
(B), (C), or (D), or under proposed rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(2), (3), or (4) of Regulation SBSR.

154

This approach would subject transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by
personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, in connection with a non-U.S. person’s dealing
activity, to regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements in a manner consistent
with Title VII, while mitigating the potential to duplicate compliance burdens. The proposed
approach is also consistent with the determination in our final rule that certain transactions
involving U.S.-person counterparties are eligible for substituted compliance (i.e., when the
transaction is through the foreign branch of the U.S. person) even if the non-U.S.-person
counterparty has engaged in dealing activity in connection with the transaction in the United
States. 365
F. Request for Comment
We invite comment regarding all aspects of the proposed approach to clearing, trade
execution, regulatory reporting, and public dissemination described here, as well as potential
alternative approaches. Data and comment from market participants and other interested parties
regarding the likely effect of the proposed approach and of potential alternative approaches will
be particularly useful to us in evaluating potential modifications to the re-proposal.
In addition, we specifically request comment with respect to each of the requirements
discussed above, as follows.
1. Mandatory clearing and trade execution
We seek comment on the re-proposed rule regarding application of mandatory clearing
and trade execution in all aspects, including the following:

365

See Exchange Act rule 908(c)(1) (permitting compliance with the regulatory reporting and public
dissemination requirements by complying with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction if at least one of
the direct counterparties to the security-based swap transaction is either a non-U.S. person or a
foreign branch).

155

•

Is it appropriate not to apply the clearing and trade execution requirements to
transactions that a non-U.S. person, in connection with its dealing activity,
arranges, negotiates, or executes using personnel located in a U.S. branch or
office? Why or why not?

•

What would be the likely market impact of our proposal not to subject such
transactions to the clearing and trade execution requirements? How would this
proposed approach affect the competitiveness of U.S. persons and other market
participants in the global marketplace (both in the United States as well as in
foreign jurisdictions)? How do you believe any competitive disparity that may
result under our proposed approach should be addressed by our rules?

•

Would there be any potential effect from our proposal on U.S. financial stability?
If so, how should any such effect be addressed?

•

Would there be any potential effect from our proposal on the liquidity available
on any SB SEFs? If so, how should any such effect be addressed?

•

To what extent do non-U.S. persons that are not engaged in security-based swap
dealing but do enter into security-based swaps with dealers that use personnel
located in the United States already have clearing relationships with clearing
agencies located in the United States or with entities that may qualify for a
substituted compliance determination? For such persons that do not already have
such relationships, what costs and other burdens would be involved with
establishing such relationships? To what extent would permitting substituted
compliance as proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing Release address these
concerns?

156

2. Regulation SBSR
We request comment on all aspects of the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR,
including the following:
•

Do you agree with the approach taken in the proposed amendments to rule 908(a)
that a security-based swap should be subject to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination regardless of the nationality or place of domicile of the
counterparties if it is a transaction connected with a person’s security-based swap
dealing activity that is arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in
the United States? Why or why not?

•

Do you agree with the approach taken in the proposed amendments to rule 908(a)
that a security-based swap executed on a platform having its principal place of
business in the United States should be subject to the regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements? Why or why not?

•

Do you agree with the approach taken in the proposed amendments to rule 908(a)
that would subject a security-based swap effected by or through a registered
broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap execution facility) to
the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements? Why or why
not? Should transactions that would be required to be reported under the
proposed amendments to rule 908(a) solely because they were effected by or
through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based swap
execution facility) be required to be reported by a counterparty to the transaction,
rather than by a registered broker-dealer (including a registered security-based
swap execution facility), as proposed?

157

•

Do you agree with the proposed amendment to the hierarchy of reporting
obligations in rule 901(a)? Why or why not? Are there any prongs where you
believe the result should be different? If so, which prong(s) and why?

•

Should we provide an exemption from Regulation SBSR’s public dissemination
requirement for transactions having a U.S. person guarantor in which the other
side includes no counterparty (direct or indirect) that is a U.S. person, registered
security-based swap dealer, or registered major security-based swap participant?
Why or why not?

•

What types of controls would be necessary to identify transactions required to be
reported under rule 908(a)(1)(v)? How would this work as an operational matter?
What are the costs and benefits associated with developing and maintaining such
controls?

•

As noted above, given the limitation on reporting duties set forth in rule 908(b)
and in the proposed amendments to that rule, we expect that most, if not all,
registered broker-dealers required to report under this proposed amendment
would be U.S. persons intermediating security-based swap transactions between
non-U.S. person counterparties and that such persons would be effecting
transactions in security-based swaps from their offices in the United States. Is
this expectation consistent with market practices by registered broker-dealers?

•

Should a registered broker-dealer that is required to report transactions pursuant
to rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) be a participant of the registered SDRs to which they
report? If not, how would a registered SDR ensure that such persons provide data
in a format required by the registered SDR? Would a registered broker-dealer

158

likely be required to be a participant of a registered SDR under existing rule
901(d) by virtue of its other security-based swap activity?
•

Do you agree that the Commission should require reporting of the identity of any
registered broker-dealer that effects a security-based swap for two non-U.S.
person that do not fall within rule 908(b)(5)? Why or why not? If so, do you
believe that the proposed amendment to rule 901(d)(9) is the appropriate way to
accomplish that goal? Why or why not?

•

Do you agree with the Commission’s proposal to exclude registered brokerdealers that incur reporting obligations solely because they effect a transaction
between two non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5)
from rule 906(b)? Why or why not?

•

Do you believe that rule 906(c) should be expanded to include registered brokerdealers that incur reporting obligations solely because they effect a transaction
between two non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5)?
Why or why not?

•

What would be the costs to registered broker-dealers that would be subject to rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) for establishing and maintaining policies and procedures under
rule 906(c) to support compliance with Regulation SBSR? Are these registered
broker-dealers likely to have affiliates that will become registered security-based
swap dealers, which are already subject to rule 906(c)? If so, would these
registered broker-dealers be able to reduce implementation burdens under rule
906(c) by adapting the policies and procedures of their affiliates for their own
usage?

159

VI. Economic Analysis of the Proposed Rules
The proposed amendments and proposed rule would determine when a non-U.S. person
whose obligations under a security-based swap are not guaranteed by a U.S. person and that is
not a conduit affiliate is required to include in its dealer de minimis calculation transactions with
another non-U.S. person and when transactions of a non-U.S. person whose obligations under a
security-based swap are not guaranteed by a U.S. person are subject to the external business
conduct requirements and to Regulation SBSR.
We are sensitive to the economic consequences and effects, including costs and benefits,
of our rules. The following economic analysis identifies and considers the costs and benefits—
including the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation—that may result from the
rules being proposed today. These costs and benefits are discussed below and have informed the
policy choices described throughout this release. Because of the attributes of the security-based
swap market, the market’s global nature, the concentration of dealing activity, and the ease with
which dealers can relocate their operations to different jurisdictions, we preliminarily believe
that the territorial approach to transactions proposed in these rules is consistent with the statutory
focus of the Title VII framework for security-based swaps. Below, we discuss the likely
economic effects of the proposed rules, including the assessment and programmatic costs and
benefits. We also discuss the potential economic effects of certain alternatives to the approach
taken by the proposed rules.
A. Assessment Costs
1. Discussion
Under the proposed rules we preliminarily believe that non-U.S. persons would incur
costs to assess whether their activities must be counted against de minimis thresholds and

160

subjected to Title VII requirements. 366 This section begins by considering the effect on
assessment costs of increasing the scope of transactions required to be counted towards de
minimis thresholds and proceeds to consider the effect on assessment costs of identifying
security-based swap activity that, under the proposed rules, would count towards de minimis
thresholds or become subject to external business conduct, regulatory reporting, and public
dissemination requirements.
Because the proposed amendment would expand the scope of security-based swap
transactions that non-U.S. persons would need to include in their de minimis calculations, we
preliminarily believe that the proposed amendment may result in an increase in the number of
non-U.S. persons exceeding $2 billion in transaction notional in a given year and incurring
assessment costs as a result of counting transactions against the de minimis threshold. 367
Estimating the number of additional non-U.S. persons that we expect to incur assessment
costs as a result of the proposed amendment would require adding transactions arranged,
negotiated, or executed by personnel located in the United States, including cleared anonymous
transactions subject to proposed rule 3a71-5(c), to the set of transactions that these non-U.S.
persons are currently required to count as a result of rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii) and computing the
total notional value of these transactions. We cannot determine, based on the TIW transactions

366

We refer to these costs as “Assessment Costs.” See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release,
77 FR 30722.

367

We preliminarily believe that it is likely that entities that exceed $2 billion in transaction notional
in a 12 month period are likely to incur assessment costs to determine whether they exceed the de
minimis threshold. Because the proposed rules add to the set of transactions that must be counted
towards the de minimis threshold, non-U.S. persons are more likely to exceed $2 billion in
transaction notional and incur these assessment costs. These non-U.S. persons would have to
assess not only transactions scoped in by the proposed rule, but also transactions with U.S.
persons against their de minimis threshold. See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 4733133.

data, whether particular transactions were arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located
in the United States. If we assume that all observable transactions of non-U.S. persons on U.S.
reference entities that are not already required to be applied towards the de minimis threshold as
a result of proposed rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(iii) are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office, we estimate that a total of approximately 15 non-U.S. persons
likely would incur assessment costs as a result of the proposed amendment based on 2014 TIW
transactions data. However, we note that this estimate may be overinclusive, as we do not
believe that all such transactions are likely to be arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office, and at the same time it may also be underinclusive because our
TIW data does not include single-name CDS transactions between two non-U.S. entities written
on non-U.S. underliers. 368
The additional 15 non-U.S. persons that are likely to incur assessment costs associated
with de minimis counting would join the 56 non-U.S. persons identified in the TIW 2014
transactions data as having relevant activity under rule 3a-71-3(b), 369 for a total of 71 persons
who would likely incur assessment costs under the proposed rules based on 2014 data. We
preliminarily believe it is reasonable to increase these estimates by a factor of two, to account for
any potential growth in the security-based swap market and to account for the fact that we are
limited to observing transaction records for activity between non-U.S. persons that reference
U.S. underliers. 370 As a result, we preliminarily believe that the assessment costs discussed
below apply to 142 entities.
368

We note that TIW’s definitions of U.S. and non-U.S. entities do not necessarily correspond to the
definition of U.S. person under Rule 3a71-3(a)(4).

162

Although foreign security-based swap dealers that are required to register under existing
Exchange Act rule 3a71-3 would not be likely to incur assessment costs as a result of 3a713(b)(1)(iii), as this proposed rule would not affect their need to register as security-based swap
dealers, they are included in our total estimate of 142 entities above. We have included them
because they likely would incur identical assessment costs in order to identify transactions
subject to those requirements under proposed Exchange Act rule 3a71-5(c), which imposes
external business conduct requirements on the U.S. business of registered security-based swap
dealers, and the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR.
As noted above, we preliminarily believe that, as a result of the proposed rules, non-U.S.
persons would incur costs to identify transaction activity that is relevant for de minimis counting
and subject to external business conduct, regulatory reporting, and public dissemination
requirements. We preliminarily believe that the business structures employed by non-U.S.
persons may determine the magnitude of these assessment costs, and that non-U.S. persons will
generally choose a business structure that considers its regulatory costs for both compliance and
assessment. The following section discusses the approaches that these market participants may
use to determine which transactions are subject to Title VII regulation under our proposed
approach and, to the extent possible, presents estimates of assessment costs on a per-entity basis.
First, non-U.S. persons may perform assessments on a per-transaction basis, which some
commenters have suggested could lead market participants to incur significant costs. 371 We
371

See note 289, supra (citing ISDA Letter); note 108, supra (citing SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter); note
109, supra (citing AFR Letter); notes 110 and 112, supra (citing IIB Letter). Other commenters
noted the additional cost burden that market participants would face if the definition diverged
from that of the CFTC. See note 111 (citing SIFMA/FIA/FSR Letter, Pensions Europe Letter,
IIB Letter, and JFMC Letter). Comments on the CFTC Cross-Border Guidance also identified
the issue of costs associated with an activity-based approach. See notes 131 and 133-134, supra
(citing letters raising this concern).

163

recognize that performing these assessments could involve one-time costs associated with
developing computer systems to capture information about the location of personnel involved
with each transaction in addition to ongoing costs of analyzing these data and modifying
classification of transaction activity as personnel or offices change locations over time.
However, we preliminarily believe that the approach we are proposing in this release should
considerably mitigate these costs. This proposed approach should be considerably easier than
the initially proposed approach for market participants to integrate into existing transaction
monitoring systems or order management systems given its focus on market-facing activity of
personnel of the entity (or personnel of the agent of the entity) engaged in dealing activity that is
located in the United States.
Accordingly, based on staff understanding regarding the development and modification
of information technology (IT) systems that track the location of firm inputs, we preliminarily
estimate the start-up costs associated with developing and modifying these systems to track the
location of persons with dealing activity will be $410,000 for the average non-U.S. entity. To
the extent that non-U.S. persons already employ such systems, the costs of modifying such IT
systems may be lower than our estimate.
In addition to the development or modification of IT systems, we preliminarily believe
that entities would incur the cost of $6500 per year on an ongoing basis for training, compliance,
and verification costs. 372
Second, non-U.S. firms might additionally restrict personnel located in the United States
from arranging, negotiating, or executing security-based swaps in connection with the non-U.S.

372

Calculated as Internal Cost, 90 hours x $50 per hour = $4,500 plus Consulting Costs, 10 hours x
$200 per hour = $2,000, for a total cost of $6,500.

164

firm’s dealing activity with non-U.S.-person counterparties. Such restrictions on communication
and staffing for the purposes of avoiding certain Title VII requirements would reduce the costs of
assessing the territorial status of each trade, and may entirely remove the need for a system that
assesses the location of personnel on a trade-by-trade basis. However, this reduction in
assessment costs may be offset by the additional costs of duplicating personnel in foreign and
U.S. locations.
While we do not currently have data necessary to precisely estimate these costs in total,
we can estimate the costs of establishing policies and procedures to restrict communication
between personnel located in the United States employed by non-U.S. persons (or their agents,)
and other personnel involved in dealing activity. Based on staff experience, we preliminarily
estimate that establishing policies would take a non-U.S. person approximately 100 hours and
would cost approximately $28,300 for each entity that chooses this approach. 373 Further, we
preliminarily believe that the total costs incurred by entities that choose to restrict
communication between personnel would be determined by the number of entities that choose
such an approach as well as the number of additional personnel that these entities must hire as a
result of restricted communication.

373

Calculated as Compliance Manager, 100 hours x $283 per hour = $28,300. We use salary figures
from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified
by SEC staff to account for an 1,800-hour work-week and multiplied by 5.35 to account for
bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead.
The costs of policies and procedures are based on burden estimates in the recent Nationally
Recognized Statistical Rating Organizations; Final Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 72936
(August 27, 2014), 79 FR 55078 (September 15, 2015) (“NRSRO Adopting Release”).
Specifically, we assume that the policies and procedures required to restrict communication
between U.S. and non-U.S. personnel are similar to policies and procedures required to eliminate
conflicts of interest under Rule 17g-5(c)(8). See NRSRO Adopting Release, 79 FR 55239,
55249.

165

We preliminarily believe that non-U.S. persons that primarily trade with non-U.S.
persons on non-U.S. reference entities may be most likely to undertake this approach. However,
because our access to TIW transactions data is limited to transactions in which at least one
counterparty is U.S.-domiciled or the reference entity is a U.S. entity, we cannot at this time
estimate the size of this set of participants.
Third, a dealer may choose to comply with applicable Title VII requirements, regardless
of whether they in fact apply, to avoid assessing the locations of personnel involved with each
transaction. This strategy may be preferred by a non-U.S. person engaged in dealing activity that
expects few transactions involving other non-U.S. persons to be arranged, negotiated, and
executed by personnel located outside the United States, such as a non-U.S. person that primarily
trades in U.S. reference entities and generally relies on personnel located in the United States to
perform market-facing activities. For these participants, the savings from not following policies
and procedures developed for Title VII compliance purposes for the few transactions that do not
involve dealing activity by personnel from a location in the United States might be less costly
than the costs of implementing a system to track the locations of personnel on a trade-by-trade
basis. Similarly, registered foreign security-based swap dealers may also prefer this approach, as
they would only be required to comply with Title VII external business conduct requirements,
and their security-based swap transactions, which would already be required to be reported under
Regulation SBSR, also would be publicly disseminated.
We preliminarily believe that the same principles apply to non-U.S. persons that rely on
agents to arrange, negotiate, or execute security-based swaps on their behalf. We anticipate that
these agents of non-U.S. persons may employ any of the strategies above to comply with the
proposed rules. Non-U.S. persons may rely on representations from their agents about whether

166

transactions conducted on its behalf contained dealing activity by personnel from a location in
the United States. This may occur on a transaction-by-transaction basis, or, if the agent complies
with Title VII requirements by default, via a representation about the entirety of the agent’s
business.
We preliminarily believe that all the methods described above are likely to involve an
initial one-time review of security-based swap business lines to help each entity determine which
of the business structures outlined above is optimal. This review would encompass both
employees of potential registrants as well as employees of agents used by potential registrants
and would identify whether these personnel are involved in arranging, negotiating, or executing
security-based swaps. The information gathered as a result of this review would allow a foreign
security-based swap dealer to assess the revenues it expects to flow from transaction activity
performed by personnel located in the United States. This information would also help these
market participants form preliminary estimates about the costs associated with various
alternative structures, including the trade-by-trade analysis outlined below. This initial review
may be followed with reassessment at regular intervals or subsequent to major changes in the
market participant’s security-based swap business, such as acquisition or divestiture of business
units. We preliminarily believe that this type of review of business lines would be similar in
nature to the analysis needed to produce financial statements for a large financial institution.
However, we acknowledge that evaluating alternative structures to determine costs associated
with assessment and compliance may require additional legal analysis. We preliminarily
estimate that the per-entity initial costs of a review of business lines would be approximately

167

$102,000. 374 Further, we preliminarily believe that periodic reassessment of business lines
would cost, on average, $52,000 per year, per entity. 375
Additionally, we preliminarily believe that our proposed approach may impose certain
costs on U.S. security-based swap dealers conducting business through a foreign branch, and
registered broker-dealers (including registered SB SEFs) that intermediate trade in the securitybased swap market. First, under the proposed approach, U.S. security-based swap dealers
conducting business through a foreign branch will also need to classify their counterparties and
transactions in order to determine what activity constitutes their foreign business. Based on
analysis of 2014 TIW transactions data, we continue to estimate that no more than five securitybased swap dealers will conduct dealing activity through foreign branches. Assuming that all
such entities elect to establish a system to identify their foreign business, we preliminarily
estimate the total assessment costs associated with the proposed approach to be approximately
$75,000, with ongoing, annual costs of approximately $84,000. 376
Second, registered broker-dealers (including registered SB SEFs) may incur assessment
costs in connection with proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). Under the proposed rule, these
entities would be required to report security-based swap transactions that they intermediate if
neither side includes a U.S. person; a registered security-based swap dealer or major security-

374

Calculated as (Senior Accountant, 500 hours x $198 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney, 2 hours x
$334 per hour) + (Compliance Manager, 8 hours x $283 per hour) = $101,932.

375

Calculated as (Senior Accountant, 250 hours x $198 per hour) + (Compliance Attorney, 4 hours x
$334 per hour) + (Compliance Manager, 4 hours x $283 per hour) = $51,968. We use salary
figures from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013,
modified by SEC staff to account for a 1,800-hour work-week and multiplied by 5.35 to account
for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead.

376

These figures correspond to estimates provided initially in the Cross-Border Proposing Release
and updated in the Cross-Border Adopting Release. See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR
31153. See also Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47332.

168

based swap participant; or a non-U.S. person that arranged, negotiated, or executed the securitybased swap using its personnel, or using personnel of its agent, in a U.S. branch or office. As a
result, we preliminarily believe that these entities would be required to assess the nature of
transactions they intermediate.
We preliminarily believe that assessment by registered broker-dealers (including
registered SB SEFs) would require an analysis of their clients (in the case of registered-broker
dealers that are not registered SB SEFs) and members (in the case of registered SB SEFs). We
preliminarily believe that registered broker-dealers and SB SEFs are likely to collect information
about the counterparties they serve and maintain these records as part of their existing business.
On the basis of these existing data, registered broker-dealers and SB SEFs would be able to
determine the U.S. person status, registration status, and the location of personnel of their clients
and members (or the personnel of agents of their clients and members) that submit orders.
Further, we preliminarily believe that registered broker-dealers and SB SEFs may be able
to determine, on the basis of their own business models or on the basis of activity they support,
whether their unregistered non-U.S. clients’ and members’ transactions are a result of dealing
activity, and so would be able to identify which transactions of unregistered non-U.S. persons
would need to be reported. For example, a registered broker-dealer that operates as an
interdealer broker can likely expect that unregistered non-U.S. person clients are engaging in
dealing activity.
As a result, we preliminarily believe that the assessment costs incurred by registered
broker-dealer (including registered SB SEFs) are likely limited to an analysis of clients and
members to identify the subset of clients and members whose trades they are obligated to report
under the proposed rules, supported by systems that would record and maintain this information

169

over time. We preliminarily believe that these costs are similar in nature to legal costs related to
systems and analysis, as well as the direct costs of systems and analysis, discussed in the CrossBorder Proposing Release. We estimate that, as a result of the proposed rules imposing reporting
obligations on registered broker-dealers (including SB SEFs), each of these entities would incur
upfront costs of $45,304, 377 and ongoing costs of $16,612 per year. 378 We note that registered
broker-dealers and SB SEFs may, like counterparties, choose alternative business structures to
mitigate these costs, as discussed above. For example, they may offer transaction reporting
services to their clients for a fee and report all transactions they intermediate, thus precluding the
need to assess their clients’ and members’ activity.
Finally, we preliminarily believe that this proposed approach mitigates the concerns of
some commenters regarding the costs associated with the use of the defined term “transactions
conducted within the United States” as originally proposed in the Cross-Border Proposing
Release. 379 In particular, by focusing on dealing activity, the proposed approach should
eliminate the need for non-U.S. persons that do not engage in dealing activity to assess whether
they or their counterparties engage in relevant activity in the United States. 380

377

This estimate is calculated as the sum of (Attorney at $380 per hour x 80 hours) = $30,400, and
the upfront costs of systems as calculated in the Cross-Border Adopting Release. See CrossBorder Adopting Release, 79 FR 47332. We use salary figures from SIFMA’s Management &
Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by SEC staff to account for an
1800-hour work-week and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits and overhead.

2. Request for comment
We request comment on all aspects of the re-proposed rule regarding its economic
analysis of the application of the de minimis exception to non-U.S. persons arranging,
negotiating, or executing security-based swaps using personnel located in the United States, as
well as the application of external business conduct requirements for registered security-based
swap dealers, associated with such transactions, including the following:
•

We have preliminarily estimated assessment costs associated with determining
whether transaction activity is arranged, negotiated, or executed using personnel,
or the personnel of agents, located in a U.S. branch or office on a transaction-bytransaction basis, by identifying market-facing personnel involved in each
transaction. Are these estimates reasonable with respect to both the use of a nonU.S. person’s personnel and of its agent’s personnel? Please provide data that
would assist us in making more accurate estimates of these assessment costs.

•

We have preliminarily suggested that some non-U.S. persons might comply with
Title VII by default to reduce assessment costs. Is this suggestion reasonable?
Please provide data that would assist us in making more accurate estimates of the
assessment costs in these situations.

•

We have preliminarily suggested that non-U.S. market participants would review
business lines to determine which compliance and assessment program is optimal.
Are non-U.S. market participants likely to carry out such reviews under the
proposed rules? Please provide data that would assist us in computing estimates
of the costs of these reviews on an ongoing basis.

171

•

Are there alternative methods that market participants may use to comply with the
proposed rules other than those described above? If so, please describe the
method and the costs of such method.

•

Under the proposed rules, registered brokers-dealers (including registered SB
SEFs) would be required to report certain transactions to a registered SDR.
Please provide any additional information or data that would assist us in
estimating the assessment costs such registered broker-dealers (including
registered SB SEFs) may incur in determining their obligation to report.

•

We have preliminarily suggested that registered broker-dealers (including
registered SB SEFs) would require an analysis of their clients (in the case of
registered broker-dealers) and members (in the case of registered SB SEFs), for
purposes of reporting transactions pursuant to proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).
We stated that we preliminarily believe that registered broker-dealers and SB
SEFs are likely to collect information about the counterparties they serve and
maintain these records as part of their existing business and that registered brokerdealers and SB SEFs would be able to determine the U.S.-person status,
registration status, and the location of personnel of their clients and members (or
the personnel of agents of their clients and members) that submit orders. Please
provide comments as to whether registered broker-dealers and SB SEFs will be
able to determine the U.S.-person status, registration status, and location of
personnel of their clients and members (or the personnel of agents of their clients
and members) that submit orders. Please explain why or why not.

172

•

We have stated that we preliminarily believe that registered broker-dealers and
SB SEFs may be able to determine, on the basis of their own business models or
on the basis of activity they support, whether their unregistered non-U.S. clients’
and members’ transactions are a result of dealing activity, enabling them to
identify which transactions of unregistered non-U.S. persons are connected with
that non-U.S. person’s dealing activity and should be reported. Please provide
comments as to whether registered broker-dealers and SB SEFs may be able to
make this determination. Please explain why or why not.

B. Programmatic Costs and Benefits
Programmatic costs and benefits arise from applying substantive regulation to those
transactions and entities that fall within the scope of the Title VII regulatory regime. 381 In the
following sections, we discuss the costs and benefits of each of the Title VII requirements that
the proposed rule would apply to transactions with dealing activity by personnel from a location
in the United States.
1. De minimis exception
Under our proposed amendment, a non-U.S. person that, in connection with its dealing
activity, enters into a transaction with another non-U.S. person would be required to include the
transaction in its de minimis calculation if it arranges, negotiates, or executes the transaction
using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. This requirement would also apply to cleared
anonymous transactions that are currently exempt from application of the de minimis thresholds
under rule 3a71-5. We are proposing rules that require the dealing counterparty to look only at
the location of dealing activity of its own personnel or of its agent’s personnel rather than require
381

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30722.

173

the dealer to look at the location of both its own activity and that of its counterparty in
connection with the transaction, as was originally proposed. 382 This approach is designed to
address concerns expressed by some commenters that they would, under the test proposed in the
Cross-Border Proposing Release, need to track, on a trade-by-trade basis, where their
counterparties are carrying out activities with respect to each transaction. 383
Because the set of market participants that are subject to dealer regulation, including
entity-level requirements under Title VII, will determine the allocation and flow of
programmatic costs and benefits arising from these Title VII requirements, the inclusion of these
transactions would affect the ultimate costs and benefits of our transaction-level and entity-level
rules. At this time, we are unable to precisely estimate the number of potential new dealers that
would be required to register because we cannot observe in the data the location of entities’
dealing activity. If we assume that all security-based swap dealing activity takes place in the
United States, then we currently estimate that no additional entities would be required to register
as a result of this proposed rule. 384 However, we believe it is important to acknowledge the
potential for additional registrants as a result of the proposed rules as the market evolves.
If these proposed rules regarding the de minimis exception result in an increased number
of non-U.S. persons that eventually register as security-based swap dealers, a larger number of
dealers would become subject to requirements applicable to registered dealers under Title VII,

382

See initially proposed Exchange Act rules 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii) and 3a71-3(a)(5); Cross-Border
Proposing Release, 78 FR 30999.

383

See note 110, supra.

384

In Section VI.A.1, supra, we estimate that 15 entities would exceeded the $2 billion threshold in
2014 as a result of this rule and thus would assess their transactions to determine whether they are
required to register as a dealer. Of these 15 entities, we preliminarily believe that none would
exceed the $3 billion dealer de minimis threshold and thus be required to register as securitybased swap dealers.

174

including, among others, capital requirements, recordkeeping requirements, and designation of a
chief compliance officer. Additionally, an increase in the number of registered dealers would
also mean that external business conduct requirements and Regulation SBSR also apply to larger
number of transactions, as well as a larger notional volume of transactions. 385 If the proposed
rules and amendments result in an increased volume of transaction activity carried out by
registered security-based swap dealers, then U.S. financial markets should benefit from more
consistent application of Title VII rules designed to mitigate the risk of financial contagion and
enhance transparency and counterparty protections, as addressed by regulatory reporting and
external business conduct requirements. Our proposed approach to determining which
transactions are counted toward a non-U.S. person’s de minimis threshold would also bring
persons engaged in significant levels of dealing activity using personnel located in in the United
States within the Title VII regulatory framework.
Furthermore, status as a security-based swap dealer brings with it specific responsibilities
that are categorized as programmatic costs with respect to certain other Title VII requirements.
For example, Regulation SBSR places registered security-based swap dealers at the top of the
reporting hierarchy for uncleared transactions. 386 Within this hierarchy, if a registered dealer

385

Under rule 901(a)(2)(ii), all transactions that include a registered security-based swap dealer on a
transaction side are subject to regulatory reporting requirements. We note that our conclusion
that the proposed approach will result in these requirements being applied to a larger number of
transaction and notional volume of transactions requires the assumption that the demand for
liquidity from security-based dealers is not very sensitive to price. Put another way, so long as
market participants’ demand for risk sharing opportunities provided by security-based swap
transactions is relatively inelastic, any reduction in transaction volume due to the costs of Title
VII regulation is unlikely to fully offset the increase in the scope of security-based swap
transactions subject to Title VII regulation under the proposed rules. If, on the other hand,
demand for liquidity is elastic, then the effects of higher costs may dominate any increase in the
scope of external business conduct and regulatory reporting requirements, resulting in these
requirements applied to a smaller number and lower notional value of transactions.

386

See Exchange Act rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(A); Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14596.

175

transacts with an unregistered person, the registered dealer is obligated to report. 387 Thus, as a
result of being classified as a dealer, a market participant that may have previously negotiated to
place regulatory reporting responsibilities on its counterparties might incur the obligation to
report instead.
Finally, certain elements of the Title VII regulatory regime may apply to the existing
business of entities that are regulated as security-based swap dealers because they apply not only
to transaction activity that cause an entity to meet the definition of a security-based swap dealer,
but also to other transaction activity in which the entity participates. Entities that are required to
register as security-based swap dealers under rule 3a71-3(b) incur, for example, not only the
programmatic costs of external business conduct requirements for their transactions arranged,
negotiated, or executed by personnel located in the United States in connection with their dealing
activity, but would also be required to comply with external business conduct requirements with
respect to all transactions that would be “U.S. business” under the proposed rules. As a result,
they may need to develop systems or personnel, such as the designation of a chief compliance
officer or the development of recordkeeping and reporting systems, for compliance purposes
with respect to their U.S. business.
2. External business conduct requirements
Registered security-based swap dealers must comply with external business conduct
requirements. Proposed rule 3a71-3(c) would limit application of these external business
conduct requirements to the U.S. business both of registered foreign security-based swap dealers

387

See Exchange Act rules 901(a)(2)(ii)(A) and 901(a)(2)(ii)(B); Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, 80 FR 14596.

176

and of registered U.S. security-based swap dealers, rather than applying the requirements to all
transactions of such dealers. 388
Requiring registered security-based swap dealers to comply with external business
conduct requirements with respect to their U.S. business would have two major benefits. First,
this requirement would apply to all transactions that constitute U.S. business, as defined under
the proposed amendment, requirements that would reduce information asymmetries between
security-based swap entities and their counterparties in the security-based swap market in the
United States, which should reduce the incidence of fraudulent or misleading representations. 389
Second, requiring registered foreign security-based swap dealers to comply with external
business conduct requirements with respect to their U.S. business should facilitate more uniform
regulatory treatment of the security-based swap activity of registered security-based swap dealers
operating in the United States. 390 As we discussed above, although other business conduct
frameworks (such as broker-dealer regulation) may achieve similar regulatory goals, the
availability of exceptions may mean that alternative frameworks may not apply to certain

388

The proposed rules address only the scope of transactions that are subject to the external business
conduct requirements; they would not change the substance of those requirements.

389

See Business Conduct Proposal, 76 FR 42452.

390

As discussed above, we recognize that, depending on the business structure that a registered U.S.
or foreign security-based swap dealer employs, an intermediary (such as an agent that is a
registered broker-dealer) may already be subject to certain business conduct requirements with
respect to the registered security-based swap dealer’s counterparty in the transaction. See Section
IV.E, supra. However, as we also noted above, we think it important that the registered securitybased swap dealer itself be subject to Title VII external business conduct requirements with
respect to security-based swap transactions that are part of its U.S. business. See id. Because the
security-based swap dealer and its agent may allocate between themselves specific
responsibilities in connection with these external business conduct requirements, to the extent that
these requirements overlap with requirements applicable directly to the agent (for example, in its
capacity as a broker), and the dealer allocates responsibility for complying with relevant
requirements to its agent, we expect any increase in costs arising from the proposed rules to be
mitigated.

177

business structures used by registered security-based swap dealers to carry out their business in
the United States. 391 Our proposed rules would subject all registered security-based swap dealers
engaged in U.S. business to the same external business conduct framework, rather than
encouraging a patchwork of business conduct protections under U.S. law that may offer
counterparties varying levels of protection with respect to their transactions with different
registered security-based swap dealers depending on the business model (or models) that each
registered security-based swap dealer has chosen to use in its U.S. business.
We recognize that adjusting the scope of transactions subject to external business conduct
requirements may affect the programmatic costs incurred by participants in the security-based
swap market. For entities already required to register as security-based swap dealers under
current rules, the proposed rules adjust the set of transactions and counterparties to which they
must apply external business conduct requirements. To the extent that the proposed rules add
counterparties and their transactions to this set, registered security-based swap dealers will incur
additional costs for each additional transaction. 392 However, we preliminarily believe that the
approach taken in this proposal mitigates some of the commenter concerns with the originally
proposed definition of “transactions conducted within the United States” by focusing only on the
location of the non-U.S. dealer’s market-facing personnel and the personnel of the non-U.S.
dealer’s agents, and not the location of its counterparties’ activity.

391

See note 202, supra (noting exception from broker-dealer definition for banks).

392

See note 275, supra (citing IIB Letter stating that the application of certain Title VII
requirements, including external business conduct standards on the transactions of non-U.S.
persons with foreign security-based swap dealers based on activity in the United States when
neither counterparty is guaranteed would create “serious operational, legal, and economic
difficulties for foreign security-based swap market participants.”).

178

3. Regulatory reporting and public dissemination
Proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR would require certain transactions in
connection with a person’s dealing activity, where that person arranged, negotiated, or executed
the transaction using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office, to be reported to a registered
SDR and publicly disseminated. The proposed amendments would also assign reporting duties
in certain transactions and further delineate limitations on reporting obligations of non-registered
persons engaged in security-based swaps subject to Regulation SBSR. Additionally, the
proposed amendments add provisions that would require any security-based swap transaction
that is either executed on a platform having its principal place of business in the United States or
effected by or through a registered broker-dealer both to be reported to a registered SDR and to
be publicly disseminated pursuant to Regulation SBSR. 393
Public dissemination of security-based swap transaction data may result in several
programmatic benefits for the security-based swap market, such as improvements to liquidity
and risk allocation by reducing the information asymmetries in a security-based swap market
where activity is concentrated among a small number of dealers. 394 Additionally, as noted in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, participants in the security-based swap market with better
information about the risk characteristics of their security-based swaps will be able to make more
efficient investment decisions. 395 To the extent that the provision of security-based swap trade
information enables participants in the security-based swap market to make privately optimal
decisions, the transaction-level reporting and dissemination requirements will provide

394

395

See id.

179

programmatic benefits in the form of improved liquidity and risk allocation. 396 We preliminarily
believe that the proposed amendments would extend these effects by applying post-trade
transparency to additional transactions and transaction notional.
Regulatory reporting of transaction data to registered SDRs should enable us to gain a
better understanding of the security-based swap market, including the size and scope of that
market. This data should enable us to identify exposure to risks undertaken by individual market
participants or at various levels of aggregation, as well as credit exposures that arise between
counterparties. Additionally, regulatory reporting will help the Commission in the valuation of
security-based swaps. Taken together, regulatory data will enable us to conduct robust
monitoring of the security-based swap market for potential risks to financial stability.
Regulatory reporting of security-based swap transactions should also improve our ability
to oversee the security-based swap market and to detect and deter market abuse. We will be
able, for example, to observe trading activity at the level of both trading desk and individual
trader, using trading desk IDs and trader IDs, respectively. This ability to aggregate the
information contained in registered SDRs using Unique Identification Codes facilitates our
ability to examine for noncompliance and pursue enforcement actions as appropriate.
On the other hand, as discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, other
jurisdictions continue to develop rules related to post-trade transparency of security-based swaps
at a different pace, and we are aware that the rules of these other regimes may result in
increasing incentives for non-U.S. market participants to avoid contact with U.S. counterparties
to avoid effecting transactions by or through registered broker-dealers in an effort to avoid public

Public transaction data can improve the efficiency of private decisions but there may still remain
financial network externalities as discussed in the Cross-Border Adopting Release. See CrossBorder Adopting Release, 79 FR 47284.

180

dissemination. 397 Responses to these incentives could reduce liquidity for U.S. market
participants. 398 We cannot readily quantify the costs that might result from reduced market
access for U.S. persons. 399 Moreover, we do not know definitively what rules other jurisdictions
may implement or at which time they may implement their rules. In light of these limitations,
we have analyzed them qualitatively, and this analysis has informed our formulation of the
proposed rules and amendments contained in this release. 400
Application of regulatory reporting requirements under the proposed amendments to rules
901 and 908 would likely impose costs on non-U.S. persons while providing benefits to the
security-based swap market more generally. We preliminarily believe that the approach
proposed in this release is responsive to the views of commenters. 401 Under the proposed
approach, and in contrast to the original proposal based on “transactions conducted within the
United States,” non-U.S. persons would not be required to understand or capture whether their
non-U.S.-person counterparties use personnel located in the United States, or agents with
personnel located in the United States, to determine whether regulatory reporting and public
397

398

See id.

399

We noted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release that lack of robust data and lack of
experimental conditions make the costs associated with market exit or reduced liquidity that
might result from post-trade transparency unquantifiable. The same limitations make the costs of
reduced access to liquidity by U.S. persons as a result of public dissemination requirements under
the proposed rules and amendments unquantifiable. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80
FR 14706.

401

See note 275, supra (citing IIB Letter stating that the application of certain Title VII
requirements, including the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements, on the
transactions of non-U.S. persons with foreign security-based swap dealers based on activity in the

and economic difficulties for foreign security-based swap market participants”); note 288, supra
(citing Cleary Letter). See also note 289, supra (citing ISDA Letter, urging us to not apply
Regulation SBSR on the basis of conduct within the United States as it would be impracticable).

181

dissemination requirements are applicable to transaction activity. This modified approach
focuses on the location of a non-U.S. dealer’s market-facing personnel in determining whether
regulatory reporting requirements apply to transaction activity.
Nevertheless, we acknowledge that under the proposed rules and amendments, non-U.S.
persons would bear costs of reporting insofar as they are allocated reporting responsibilities
within the hierarchy laid out in proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E), and if they fall within the set of
non-U.S. persons whose transactions are required to be reported under rule 908(a). Additionally,
registered broker-dealers would incur reporting costs when they are involved in transactions
between non-U.S. persons that do not fall within proposed rule 908(b)(5). In the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release, we estimated that 300 parties would incur costs associated with
reporting transactions to registered SDRs. 402
As noted above, we currently lack data necessary to estimate with precision the number
of non-U.S. persons that, in connection with their dealing activity, arrange, negotiate, or execute
security-based swaps using personnel located in the United States or execute security-based
swaps on a platform with its principal place of business in the United States, or the number of
registered broker-dealers that intermediate security-based swap transactions, and, as a result,
cannot precisely estimate the number of additional non-U.S. persons that might incur reporting
obligations under this proposal. However, assuming that all observable transaction activity is
arranged, negotiated, or executed using personnel located in the United States, we estimate that
90 persons would become subject to regulatory reporting requirements under the proposed rules,

402

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14701.

182

involving approximately 2,700 transactions and $18.5 billion in notional value. 403 Additionally,
we preliminarily estimate approximately 30 registered-broker dealers may be involved in
effecting transactions between non-U.S. persons that would not incur any reporting duties under
Regulation SBSR.
We preliminarily believe that regulatory reporting of transactions that are arranged,
negotiated, or executed using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office or effected through a
registered broker-dealer would have benefits for the security-based swap market. Increasing the
scope of security-based swap transactions subject to regulatory reporting would likely extend the
programmatic benefits of regulatory reporting discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting

403

Commission staff arrived at these estimates by constructing a sample of TIW transaction records
for activity between two counterparties in 2014, removing those records that involve
counterparties that appear likely to register as security-based swap dealers, to isolate activity that
would likely fall within the scope of proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(3). Staff arrived at numerical
estimates by counting unique TIW accounts, transaction counts, and transaction notional
represented in this sample. This revealed approximately 45 accounts and approximately 1,650
transactions, involving $8.3 billion in notional value. As in prior releases, we preliminarily
believe it is appropriate to take a conservative approach and estimate an upper bound of 90
affected persons to account for growth in security-based swap participation. See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30725 n.1457.
Further, we preliminarily believe it is reasonable to increase our estimates of transaction counts
and notional volume by a factor of 1.6 to account for data limitations. First, our access to singlename CDS data is limited to activity involving one U.S. counterparty or involving CDS written
on U.S. reference entities. We estimated that this limitation prevents us from observing
approximately 23% of transactions. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14689
n.1183. Second, as we note in Section II.B.1, when measured in terms of notional outstanding,
the single-name CDS market accounts for approximately 80% of the overall security-based swap
market. As a result, we scale up the number of observed transactions first by 1/(1-0.23) and then
by 1/0.80, or to approximately 1650 x 1/0.77 x 1/0.80 = 2679 transactions, and our estimate of
notional volume to approximately $8.3 billion x 1/0.77 x 1/0.80 = $13.5 billion. We
acknowledge that this scaling rests on an implicit assumption that transactions we do not observe
are similar in nature to the single-name CDS transaction we do observe.
Further we assume that 20% of these transactions would be reported by registered-broker dealers
pursuant to 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) and so no reporting of life-cycle events would be required. We
use data in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release to develop our estimate of the number of
events that are not life-cycle events. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14702.

183

Release by giving us a more complete view of transactions activity within the United States. 404
Moreover, in the context of market surveillance, regulatory reporting of these transactions may
be particularly valuable. For example, these regulatory data would allow us to sequence all
security-based swap transaction activity involving U.S. personnel. This potentially allows
detection of cases in which U.S. personnel could exploit their private information about the order
flow of their clients by placing proprietary orders ahead of clients’ orders as an employee of a
non-U.S. affiliate, avoiding regulatory reporting requirements under Regulation SBSR. Such a
strategy could involve front-running orders in an opaque part of the security-based swap market
at the expense of participants in a more transparent market. Monitoring for these types of
activities would be more difficult in the absence of the proposed amendments to Rule 908.
Finally, by requiring registered broker-dealers to report transactions in which they are involved,
we preliminarily believe that our proposed approach to regulatory reporting would enable us to
improve oversight of registered broker-dealers.
Regulatory reporting and public dissemination of transaction data may entail two types of
costs for security-based swap market participants. First, as detailed below, requiring non-U.S.
persons with dealing activity in the United States to comply with the Title VII reporting
requirements even if they are not registered security-based swap dealers may entail additional
costs for recordkeeping, supervision, and compliance. As some portion of these costs may be
fixed, security-based swap market participants with smaller volume may be more adversely
affected than larger ones. A second type of cost may fall on non-U.S. persons, including
registered foreign security-based swap dealers, that wish to execute large orders or execute
orders in particularly illiquid contracts. Public dissemination of these types of transactions,
404

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14700.

184

either because they involve security-based swap dealing activity in the United States or because
they are effected through a registered broker-dealer, may increase the costs of hedging the
inventory risk generated by such transactions because it may signal the direction of future order
flow to potential counterparties to hedging transactions. As we noted in the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release, staff analysis of recent transactions in single-name CDS suggests that the
impact of public dissemination on large transactions may be limited in light of the interim
approach to public dissemination that allows up to a 24-hour delay before transactions data is
made public. 405
The proposed amendments to Rule 901 would assign reporting duties in certain
transactions and we preliminarily believe that these duties would result in costs for U.S. and nonU.S. persons and registered broker-dealers (including registered SB SEFs) that incur a duty to
report. We estimated the costs of reporting on a per-entity basis in the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release and we preliminarily believe that these proposed rules would not affect these
costs. We preliminarily believe that additional persons required to report by the proposed
amendments would incur costs associated with establishing internal order management systems
of approximately $102,000. These entities with reporting duties would also have to establish and
maintain connectivity to a registered SDR at a cost (initial and ongoing) of approximately
$200,000. We preliminarily believe that these persons would incur costs associated with
establishing a reporting mechanism for security-based swaps of approximately $49,000. We
preliminarily estimate that the ongoing costs of internal order management would be $77,000 per
year, per reporting side, and the annual and ongoing costs of storage of $1,000 per year, per
405

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14709. See also “Inventory risk management by
dealers in the single-name credit default swap market” (October 17, 2014, available at:

185

reporting side. The Commission preliminarily believes that under the proposed amendments,
entities with reporting duties would incur costs of approximately $54,000 per reporting side to
establish an appropriate compliance and support program for regulatory reporting. We further
estimate that such a program would require approximately $38,500 per year in annual spending
by each reporting side. In aggregate, the costs of rule 901 for persons required to report under
the proposed amendments in the first year would be approximately $521,500 and the annual
ongoing costs would be approximately $316,500. 406 In aggregate, this suggests first-year costs
of approximately $62.5 million and ongoing costs of approximately $38 million.407
As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we preliminarily estimated and
continue to believe that the burden of reporting additional transactions once a respondent’s
reporting infrastructure and compliance systems are in place would be minimal when compared
to the costs of putting those systems in place and maintaining them over time. 408 If firms have
order management systems in place and currently utilize them, the costs of reporting an
additional individual transaction would be entering the required data elements into the firm’s
order management system, which could subsequently determine whether regulatory reporting
requirements apply to the transaction, and deliver the required transaction information to a
registered SDR if required. 409

406

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14702.

407

First-year costs of $521,500 x 120 entities with reporting duties = $61,580,000; ongoing costs of
$316,500 x 120 entities with reporting duties = $37,980,000. These costs may be mitigated to the
extent that a registered broker-dealer may use the infrastructure separately established by an
affiliate that already incurs reporting obligations under Regulation SBSR.

186

Besides incurring costs in connection with reporting responsibilities under rule 901, we
preliminarily believe that the proposed rules would also require certain non-U.S. persons and
registered broker-dealers to incur costs associated with error reporting under rule 905. As we
noted in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, requiring participants to promptly correct
erroneous transaction information should help ensure that the Commission and other relevant
authorities have an accurate view of the risks in the security-based swap market. We
preliminarily believe that non-U.S. persons that incur reporting obligations under the proposed
amendments would incur an initial cost of $11,825 per reporting side and an ongoing cost of
$4,000 per reporting side. 410
These figures suggest aggregate initial costs of $1,419,000 and ongoing costs of
$480,000. 411 As with rule 901, as adopted, we do not believe that the additional amendments
made to rule 901 in this release would have any measurable impact on the costs previously
discussed in both the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and the Cross-Border Proposing
Release. 412
We preliminarily believe that, in addition, the 540 additional transactions effected by or
through registered broker-dealers may impose costs on participants that are associated with
notifying registered broker-dealers after discovery of an error as required under rule 905(a)(1).

410

See id. at 14778. Note that we preliminarily believe that this proposal does not alter the number
of participants that are not reporting sides who, under rule 905(a)(1), are required to notify the
relevant reporting side after discovery of an error.

411

Initial costs of $11,825 x 120 entities with reporting duties = $1,419,000; ongoing costs of $4,000
x 120 entities with reporting duties = $480,000.

412

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14702. See also Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release, 75 FR 75261; Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31192.

187

We preliminarily estimate an annual cost associated with this obligation of approximately
$17,280, which corresponds to roughly $576 per participant. 413
Finally, the proposed amendments to rule 906 may impose costs on registered brokerdealers that must report transactions to satisfy an obligation under proposed rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). Under proposed amendments to rule 906(c), these registered broker-dealers
would be required to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures that are reasonably
designed to ensure that it complies with any obligations to report information to a registered
SDR in a manner consistent with Regulation SBSR. Further, these registered broker-dealers
would be required to review these policies and procedures at least annually. We preliminarily
estimate that the cost associated with establishing such policies and procedures would be
approximately $58,000 and the cost associated with annual updates would be approximately
$34,000, for each registered broker-dealer that incurs an obligation to report transactions under
our proposed approach. 414
4. Efficiency, competition, and capital formation
Our analysis of the proposed rules’ potential impacts on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation begins by considering the effects the proposed rules may have on the scope of
participants subject to dealer requirements under Title VII. Following this discussion, we

413

These figures are based on the assumption that approximately 540 additional trades per year
would have to be reported by registered broker-dealers pursuant to proposed rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) and that these trades involve 30 entities with reporting duties. Using cost
estimated provided in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, if each trade is reported in error,
then the aggregate annual cost of error notification is 540 errors x Compliance Clerk at $64 per
hour x 0.5 hours per report = $17,280, or $576 per participant. See Regulation SBSR Adopting
Release, 80 FR 14714. We use salary figures from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013, modified by SEC staff to account for a 1800-hour workweek and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead.

examine potential effects of the proposed rules related to their effect on the application of
Regulation SBSR.
We note that the proposed rules and amendments would, if adopted, affect the securitybased swap market in a number of ways, many of which are difficult to quantify, if not
unquantifiable. In particular, a number of the potential effects that we discuss below are related
to price efficiency, liquidity and risk sharing. These effects are difficult to quantify for a number
of reasons. First, in many cases the effects are contingent upon strategic responses of market
participants. For instance, we note in Section VI.B.4(b)i, infra, that, under our proposed
approach, non-U.S. persons may choose to relocate personnel making it difficult for U.S.
counterparties to access liquidity in security-based swaps. The magnitude of these effects on
liquidity and on risk sharing depend upon a number of factors that we cannot estimate, including
the likelihood of relocation, the availability of substitute liquidity suppliers and the availability of
substitute hedging assets. Therefore, much of the discussion below is qualitative in nature,
although we try to describe, where possible, the direction of these effects.
Not only can some of these effects be difficult to quantify, but there are many cases
where a rule will have two opposing effects, making it difficult to estimate a net impact on
efficiency, competition, or capital formation. For example, in our discussion of the net effect of
the proposed application of Regulation SBSR requirements on efficiency, we expect that posttrade transparency may have a positive effect on price efficiency, while it may negatively affect
liquidity by providing incentives for non-U.S. persons to avoid contact with U.S. persons. The
magnitude of these two opposing effects will depend on factors such as the sensitivity of traders
to information about order flow, the impact of public dissemination of transaction information on
the execution costs of large orders, and the ease with which non-U.S. persons can find substitutes

189

that avoid contact with U.S. personnel. Each of these factors is difficult to quantify individually,
which makes the net impact on efficiency equally difficult to quantify.
(a) De minimis calculations
The proposed rules and amendments related to the treatment of transactions arranged,
negotiated, or executed by personnel located in the United States for the purposes of de minimis
calculations likely broadens the scope of security-based swap transactions and entities to which
the Title VII regulatory regime for security-based swap dealers applies. As a result, the proposal
may increase the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation of rules already
adopted as well as of future substantive rulemakings that place responsibilities on registered
security-based swap dealers to carry out entity- or transaction-level requirements applicable to
security-based swap dealers under Title VII. 415
The proposed rules and amendments may directly affect efficiency, competition, and
capital formation because the requirement that non-U.S. persons include in their de minimis
threshold calculations security-based swaps in connection with their dealing activity that they
arrange, negotiate, or execute using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office may increase the
likelihood that certain non-U.S. dealers would exceed de minimis levels of dealing activity and
be required to register with the Commission. Registration would cause these dealers to incur
registration costs as well as the costs of dealer requirements under the Title VII regulatory
regime.
These costs may represent barriers to entry for non-U.S. persons that contemplate
engaging in dealing activity using their own personnel or personnel of their agents located in a
U.S. branch or office or provide incentives for non-U.S. persons that currently engage in relevant
415

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47361.

190

activity using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office to restructure their business and move
operations abroad or use agents with personnel outside of the U.S. 416 These costs may
additionally provide direct incentives for non-U.S. persons to avoid using personnel of agents
located in a U.S. branch or office (or agents with such personnel) to arrange, negotiate or execute
security-based swaps on their behalf. By reducing the ability of these agents to compete for
business from non-U.S. persons, the proposed rules may reduce entry by potential agents because
of this competitive disadvantage, or cause existing agents to relocate or restructure their business
to minimize contact with the United States. 417
We acknowledge that, to the extent that it occurs solely for the purposes of avoiding Title
VII regulation, reduced market entry or restructuring by non-U.S. persons responding to our
proposed approach, or by agents unable to compete for business from non-U.S. persons, may be
inefficient, raise costs to market participants and reduce the level of participation by personnel of
non-U.S. persons located in the United States, or personnel of their agents located in the United
States. 418 Our proposed approach reflects consideration of the potentially inefficient
restructuring and reduced access to the security-based swap market by U.S. persons on the one
hand, and addressing the concerns of Title VII on the other. In particular, this proposed
approach potentially reduces the risk of financial contagion and fraudulent or manipulative
conduct by ensuring that security-based swap dealer regulation is applied to the appropriate set
of entities whose activities raise these concerns.

416

See id. at 47362.

417

We also note that, under the proposed rules, non-U.S. persons may be willing to pay higher prices
for higher quality services provided by non-U.S.-person counterparties that use personnel or
agents located in the United States because the ability of these counterparties to meet the
standards set by Title VII may be a credible signal of high quality. See id. at 47362 n.762.

418

See id. at 47364.

191

We also preliminarily believe that the proposed rules and amendments would affect
competition among security-based swap dealers. Under proposed Exchange Act rule 3a713(b)(iii)(C), U.S. persons would have to count their dealing activity towards their de minimis
thresholds while their non-U.S. competitors would not. As noted in Section II.A, supra, in the
absence of the proposal, a U.S. person engaged in dealing activity and facing a non-U.S.-person
counterparty or its agent would face different regulatory treatment from a non-U.S. person
engaged in the same activity with the same counterparty or its agent, even if both are arranging,
negotiating, or executing the security-based swap using personnel located in a U.S. branch or
office. As a result, and as noted by commenters, 419 current rules may introduce different costs
for U.S. security-based swap dealers and foreign security-based swap dealers and their agents
that seek to supply liquidity to non-U.S. persons as a result of Title VII regulation, introducing
competitive disparities even if the U.S. person and the non-U.S. person or their agents are both,
in connection with their dealing activity, using personnel located in the United States. Under the
current rules, non-U.S. persons seeking or supplying liquidity may also be reluctant to transact
with a U.S. person because of the additional expected costs of dealer regulation and of future
substantive regulations under Title VII that rest on the U.S.-person status of counterparties. We
preliminarily believe that many of the costs of these frictions would be borne by U.S. securitybased swap dealers. The proposed rules and amendments may mitigate these competitive
frictions because non-U.S. persons would be required to count transactions arranged, negotiated,
419

proposed rule could put U.S. brokers and investment managers at a competitive disadvantage).

or executed by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office towards their de minimis thresholds
in a way that is identical to their U.S.-person competitors. 420
As with the proposed amendment that would require non-U.S. persons to count
transactions arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in a U.S. branch or office
towards de minimis thresholds, the proposal does not retain an exception for cleared, anonymous
transactions and thus should reduce the competitive frictions that would exist if the proposal
retained the exception. Such an exception would provide non-U.S.-person dealers that arrange,
negotiate, or execute cleared, anonymous transactions using personnel located in a U.S. branch
or office or using agents with personnel in a U.S. branch or office a potential competitive
advantage relative to U.S. persons, as the non-U.S. persons would be able to avoid including
these transactions in their de minimis calculations, while U.S. persons would be required to
count all such transactions towards their de minimis thresholds. However, we also note that, to
the extent that non-U.S. persons otherwise would have relied upon this exception to engage in
cleared, anonymous transactions, our proposed approach may impair efficiency and capital
formation by reducing liquidity in anonymous markets, increasing transaction costs, and
reducing opportunities for risk-sharing among security-based swap market participants. 421
Alternatively, the proposed rule may result in inefficient restructuring to move the
arrangement, negotiation, and execution of cleared, anonymous transactions abroad, in order to
avoid activities that would require counting towards de minimis thresholds. This may have
adverse consequences for the availability of liquidity and the amount of transaction costs for U.S.
persons seeking to hedge risk using security-based swaps. If non-U.S. persons relocate their

dealing activity abroad in ways that make it difficult for U.S. persons to find liquidity in the
United States, those U.S. persons that might otherwise use security-based swaps to hedge
financial and commercial risks may reduce their hedging activity and assume an inefficient
amount of risk, or engage in precautionary savings that inhibits capital formation. 422 To the
extent that non-U.S. persons use U.S. personnel to engage in dealing activity only in a subset of
security-based swaps, such as those involving certain reference entities, we preliminarily believe
that the potential consequences of relocation on liquidity and risk sharing would be most
concentrated in this subset.
(b) Other Title VII requirements
The proposed rules regarding the regulatory reporting, public dissemination and external
business conduct requirements for transactions arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel
located in a U.S. branch or office would have several effects on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation in the U.S. financial market. These effects implicate common economic
themes and warrant a consolidated discussion.
i.

Efficiency

The application of public dissemination as set forth in the proposed rule may improve the
efficiency of the price discovery process and improve the liquidity of traded security-based
swaps. Market participants with more information about the history of prices due to enhanced
post-trade transparency will be better able to price security-based swaps, and as a result make
better trading decisions. Market observers will be able to incorporate information from the
security-based swap market to derive valuations for other assets that are more accurate. 423

422

See note 143, supra (citing CDEU Letter to CFTC).

423

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14720.

194

We preliminarily believe that the magnitude of these efficiency improvements is related
to the number of transactions subject to public dissemination. Data from more transactions may
allow market participants and observers to derive more precise estimates of fundamental value.
As a result, to the extent that the proposed rules increase the scope of security-based swap
transactions subject to public dissemination, they may result in more efficient pricing and
valuation within and without the security-based swap market. 424
At the same time, we recognize that particular Title VII requirements may affect
efficiency through their effects on the ability of security-based swap market participants to
access liquidity. We preliminarily believe that certain aspects of our proposal should reduce the
likelihood of market fragmentation. For example, the proposed rules and amendments, by
reducing the likelihood that transactions arranged, negotiated, or executed within the United
States are subject to disparate levels of regulation under Title VII depending on counterparty
identity, the proposed rules may allow U.S. persons to more freely access liquidity made
available through dealing activity within the United States and may discourage the formation of a
two-tier market in which U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons are offered liquidity on very
different terms.
However, we also acknowledge that the proposed rules may provide incentives for nonU.S. persons to move their operations and personnel abroad to avoid external business conduct,
regulatory reporting, and public dissemination requirements. If, under the proposed rules, non424

See Gjergji Cici, Scott Gibson, and John J. Merrick, Jr., “Missing the Marks? Dispersion in
Corporate Bond Valuations Across Mutual Funds,” Journal of Financial Economics, Volume 101,
Issue 1 (July 2011), at 206-26 (providing evidence that the implementation of post-trade
transparency in the corporate bond market could have contributed to a reduction in the dispersion
of mutual fund valuations during the study’s sample period). See also Sugato Chakravarty,
Huseyin Gulen, and Stewart Mayhew, “Informed Trading in Stock and Option Markets,” Journal
of Finance, Vol. 59, No. 3 (2004) (estimating that the proportion of information about underlying
stocks revealed first in option markets ranges from 10% to 20%).

195

U.S. security-based swap market participants relocate their sales forces and trading desks to
other jurisdictions, less liquidity may be available within the United States, reducing the
efficiency of prices and risk sharing. U.S. counterparties may find it difficult to take desired
positions in security-based swaps if their access to non-U.S. liquidity providers is limited or
more costly. For example, if U.S. persons seeking to hedge risk using security-based swaps have
difficulty obtaining liquidity solely from U.S. providers, they may reduce their hedging activity
in the security-based swap market, seek substitutes in other asset markets, or assume an
inefficient amount of risk. 425 We note that the incentive to relocate personnel may grow to the
extent that there is a substantial disparity in regulatory requirements applicable to those
transactions that are arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel from a location within the
United States and those transactions that are not.
As an alternative to relocating personnel, we acknowledge that participants may
implement or adapt existing controls or conventions that restrict communication between nonU.S. trading personnel and persons located in the United States to avoid triggering certain Title
VII requirements. For example, firms may adopt policies restricting personnel located outside
the United States from communicating with personnel located in the United States when
engaging in dealing activity with non-U.S.-person counterparties. Non-U.S. firms might
additionally restrict personnel located in the United States from arranging, negotiating, or
executing security-based swaps in connection with the non-U.S. firm’s dealing activity with nonU.S.-person counterparties.
Although non-U.S. persons may voluntarily impose internal conventions and controls on
their own personnel to avoid triggering certain Title VII requirements, these conventions and
425

See note 143, supra (citing CDEU Letter to CFTC).

196

controls may result in inefficient duplication of personnel or expertise in foreign and U.S.
locations. Non-U.S. persons may choose to impose controls on personnel if the costs of
duplication are below the costs of applying Title VII to relevant activity, 426 but we preliminarily
believe that such a strategic choice may not take into account the programmatic benefits of Title
VII regulation. For example, public dissemination requirements under Title VII improve the
transparency of the security-based swap market while causing market participants and SDRs to
incur costs. Other portions of the Title VII regulatory framework, such as capital and margin
requirements yield programmatic benefits by reducing the risk of sequential counterparty default,
but security-based swap dealers may consider the impact of such requirements on their own
costs, without considering impacts on aggregate financial sector risk. 427 Thus, although internal
personnel controls may be privately optimal for firms that choose to implement them, their net
impact on efficiency will depend on how the costs of personnel duplication compare to the
overall costs and benefits of the Title VII dealer regulation, external business conduct, regulatory
reporting, and public dissemination requirements.
Similarly, we preliminarily believe that our proposed approach more consistently applies

426

See Section VI.A (discussing the estimated per-entity costs of these controls).

See e.g. Daron Acemoglu, Asuman Ozdaglar & Alireza Tahbaz-Salehi, Systemic Risk and
Stability in Financial Networks (NBER Working Paper No. 18727, Jan. 2013), available at:
http://www.nber.org/papers/w18727 (showing the emergence of financial network externalities in
a theoretical model of banks, in which banks may take into account the effect of their own risk
taking on their creditors, but may fail to internalize the effects of their own risk taking on their
creditors’ creditors).

“Measuring Systemic Risk” (May 2010), available at: http://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/public/static/SRv3.pdf. (using a theoretical model of the banking sector to show that, unless the external costs of
their trades are considered, financial institutions will have an incentive to take risks that are borne
by the aggregate financial sector). Under this theory, in the context of Title VII, the relevant
external cost is the potential for risk spillovers and sequential counterparty failure, leading to an
aggregate capital shortfall and breakdown of financial intermediation in the financial sector.

197

regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to transactions effected by or through
trading platforms and registered broker-dealers, including registered SB SEFs. Both trading
platforms and registered broker-dealers may intermediate transactions in the security-based swap
market. By ensuring that both types of intermediation are subject to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination requirements, the proposed approach reduces the risk that, as a result of
disparate treatment, liquidity migrates from trading platforms to registered broker-dealers or
from registered broker-dealers to trading platforms. However, at the same time, we acknowledge
the risk that, in response to the proposed rules and amendments, trading platforms may choose to
move their principal place of business offshore and registered broker-dealers may move their
security-based swap businesses into unregistered entities to avoid regulatory reporting
requirements.
Attempts to restructure by counterparties, trading platforms and registered broker-dealers
could have an adverse effect on the efficiency of the security-based swap market by fragmenting
liquidity between a U.S. security-based swap market, occupied by U.S. persons and non-U.S.
persons willing to participate within the Title VII regulatory framework, with intermediation
services provided by registered broker-dealers and U.S.-based trading platforms, and an offshore
market whose participants seek to avoid any activity that could trigger application of Title VII to
their security-based swap activity. 428 Such market fragmentation could reduce the amount of
liquidity available to market participants whose activity is regulated by Title VII and
significantly erode any gains in price efficiency and allocative efficiency that might result from
pre- and post-trade transparency.

428

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47364.

198

ii.

Competition

We preliminarily believe that our proposed approach would have implications for
competition among market participants that intermediate transactions in security-based swaps as
well as counterparties to security-based swaps. First, the proposed rules and amendments to
rules 901 and 908 would apply consistent regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements to transactions between non-U.S. persons that are platform-executed or effected
through registered broker-dealers. We preliminarily believe that our proposed application of
regulatory requirements is unlikely to generate competitive frictions between these different
types of providers of intermediation services. At the same time, we acknowledge that proposed
rule 908(a)(1)(iv) may make it difficult for suppliers of intermediation services (i.e., trading
platforms and broker-dealers) effecting or executing transactions within the United States, to
compete to serve non-U.S. persons. Nonetheless, we preliminarily believe that our proposed
approach would appropriately reflect the transparency focus of Title VII and would promote a
robust regulatory regime for registered broker-dealers.
Applying external business conduct requirements and Regulation SBSR to transactions in
connection with a non-U.S. person’s dealing activity that the non-U.S. person arranges,
negotiates, or executes using personnel located in the United States would mitigate competitive
frictions between U.S. and non-U.S. persons 429 by providing for a generally consistent
application of these requirements to U.S.-person dealers and non-U.S.-person dealers or their
agents to the extent that the latter arrange, negotiate, or execute a security-based swap transaction
429

Competitive effects would flow from each of the relevant Title VII requirements. For instance,
post-trade transparency may increase competition between dealers by reducing the level of
private information that large dealers have relative to smaller dealers and by improving the ability
of non-dealers to negotiate with dealers on prices. See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80
FR 14704.

199

in connection with their dealing activity using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. 430 If
only U.S. dealers and their agents were subject to disclosure requirements with respect to their
security-based swap transactions, the costs of such disclosures would primarily affect U.S.
dealers, their agents, and their counterparties. In contrast, non-U.S. dealers and their agents, who
may not necessarily be subject to comparable disclosure requirements, could have a competitive
advantage over U.S. dealers in serving non-U.S.-person counterparties using personnel located in
a U.S. branch or office, were their activities not subject to the same requirements. 431
Furthermore, we preliminarily believe the ability to meet certain Title VII regulatory
requirements under the proposed rules may allow non-U.S. persons who use personnel or
personnel of agents located in the United States to engage in dealing activity to credibly signal
high quality and better counterparty protection relative to other non-U.S. persons that compete
for the same order flow from weaker regulatory environments. 432 Non-U.S. persons that choose
to use personnel or personnel of agents for dealing activity from a location within the United
States may find fraud or abusive behavior more costly and difficult to conduct, which may signal
to other non-U.S. persons that such fraud or abusive behavior is unlikely to occur.
We are not proposing, however, to apply the clearing and trade execution requirements to
security-based swap transactions that a non-U.S. person, in connection with its dealing activity,
arranges, negotiates, or executes using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. This aspect

430

See Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR 31127; Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR
47327 (providing earlier discussions of these issues).

431

See, e.g., Arnoud W.A. Boot, Silva Dezelan, and Todd T. Milbourn, “Regulatory Distortions in a
Competitive Financial Services Industry,” Journal of Financial Services Research, Vol. 17, No. 1
(2000) (showing that, in a simple industrial organization model of bank lending, a change in the
cost of capital resulting from regulation results in a greater loss of profits when regulated banks
face competition from unregulated banks than when regulations apply equally to all competitors).

432

200

of our proposal may contribute to a disparity in the regulatory treatment of U.S. persons and nonU.S. persons in the security-based swap market, as non-U.S. persons that engage in dealing
activity using personnel located in the United States would only be subject to Title VII dealer
regulation and Regulation SBSR, while U.S. persons would also be required to comply with the
clearing and trade execution requirements. If clearing and trade execution requirements
comprise a large portion of the Title VII compliance costs, then a competitive disparity between
U.S. and non-U.S. participants in the security-based swap market may remain, even with the
addition of the proposed rules. However, to the extent that U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons
whose obligations under a security-based swap are guaranteed by U.S. persons must increase the
price of the liquidity they supply in response to this disparity in regulatory treatment, we
preliminarily believe that these higher prices reflect an efficient allocation of the costs their
activity may impose on the U.S. financial system, given that the counterparty credit risk of such
security-based swap transactions resides primarily in the United States.
iii.

Capital Formation

The proposed rules may affect capital formation in the security-based swap and securities
market by affecting the transparency, liquidity, and stability of the market. Requiring
transactions by non-U.S. persons, in connection with their dealing activity, with relevant activity
in the United States to be reported and publicly disseminated should facilitate monitoring of the
security-based swap market and improve the price discovery process and the liquidity of
security-based swaps. 433 These improvements may lead to more efficient allocation of capital by
market participants and market observers, facilitating capital formation.

433

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14719-722.

201

We recognize that the effects of the proposed rule on market fragmentation may affect
capital formation. If the proposed rules reduce the likelihood of fragmentation of the securitybased swap market, then they may promote capital formation. Under a regulatory environment
that facilitates U.S. persons’ access to the global security-based swap market, U.S. market
participants will be able to more efficiently hedge financial and commercial risks, reducing the
level of precautionary savings they choose to hold and instead investing resources in more
productive assets. However, if the proposed rules cause non-U.S. persons to move personnel and
operations abroad or use agents operating outside the United States, the costs of the move
represent resources that could have been invested in productive assets. Furthermore, to the
extent that such restructuring results in a fragmented market with reduced liquidity for securitybased swaps and related assets within the United States, the result could be less risk sharing and
impaired capital formation. 434
5. Request for comment

concerning programmatic costs and benefits, and potential impacts, of the proposed rule on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation, including the following:

negotiates, or executes the security-based swap using personnel located in the
United States? Please explain and provide information that would be helpful in
performing further analysis.

C. Alternatives Considered
In developing these proposed rules and amendments we considered a number of
alternative approaches. This section outlines these alternatives and discusses the potential
economic effects of each.
1. Retention of the definition of “transaction conducted within the United
States”
In the Cross-Border Proposing Release, we originally proposed the definition
“transaction conducted within the United States” and used it to identify (i) transactions that
should be included in an entity’s de minimis threshold calculations, and (ii) transactions that,
subject to certain exceptions, would be subject to the set of Title VII requirements for business
203

conduct, clearing, trade execution, regulatory reporting, and public dissemination. The original
objective of the initial definition was identical to this proposed rule—to capture relevant dealing
activity within the United States in order to mitigate competitive frictions and prevent a non-U.S.
person from shifting its security-based swap dealing activity to a non-U.S. person and continue
to carry out this dealing activity in the United States while avoiding application of the Title VII
requirements by using personnel of the non-U.S. person located in the United States or personnel
of its agent located in the United States.
We have determined to propose a different approach in part because we preliminarily
agree with commenters that the initial approach likely would have increased assessment costs
significantly. 435 That initial approach would have looked to whether dealing activity involved a
“transaction conducted within the United States,” which, as defined in that proposal, turned on
the location of personnel on both sides of the transaction. Accordingly, under the rule as initially
proposed, an entity would have been required to include a transaction in its de minimis threshold
calculations based on the location of its counterparty’s personnel. Gathering such information,
communicating it to relevant counterparties, and keeping records of this information on a pertransaction basis could be costly. We preliminarily believe that our re-proposed approach, which
focuses only on whether the non-U.S. person is arranging, negotiating, or executing a securitybased swap, in connection with its dealing activity, using personnel located in a U.S. branch or
office, achieves many of the same programmatic benefits, while resulting in in lower assessment
costs. 436

435

See, e.g., note 289, supra (citing ISDA Letter).

436

As we noted in Section III.B.2, supra, some commenters urged that an activity-based test should
look only to where the relevant transaction was executed or where the dealer’s personnel
committed the dealer to that trade. Although we acknowledge that such an alternative may result

204

2. Limited exception from Title VII requirements for transactions arranged,
negotiated, and executed by associated persons of broker-dealers
We also considered not requiring a non-U.S. person to include a transaction in its de
minimis threshold calculations if the security-based swap dealing activity was arranged,
negotiated, or executed in the United States solely by personnel of a registered broker-dealer that
were acting in their capacity as associated persons of that broker-dealer. One commenter
suggested such an approach. 437 Although this approach could reduce costs associated with
engaging in customer-facing activity in connection with dealing activity in security-based swaps
in the United States, it would, as described in more detail above, 438 create potentially significant
compliance gaps in our Title VII framework, potentially impeding our effective enforcement of
Title VII and other federal securities laws by reducing the number of transactions carried out by
registered security-based swap dealers and thus limiting our access to the books and records that
are necessary for effective enforcement.
3. Exclusion of security-based swap transactions that do not involve a U.S.person counterparty, a counterparty whose obligations under the securitybased swap are guaranteed by a U.S. person, or a conduit affiliate from the
de minimis threshold requirements
Although the Cross-Border Adopting Release stated that we contemplated considering
whether to subject certain security-based swap transactions involving activity in the United
States to certain Title VII requirements, one alternative to the proposed rules would be not to
require any transactions other than those required in rule 3a71-3 to be counted toward a person’s
in costs that are meaningfully lower than the costs of our proposed approach, because we do not
believe that such an alternative would adequately capture the range of market-facing activities
that appear likely to raise the types of concerns addressed by security-based swap dealer
regulation, we do not believe that this approach reflects a reasonable alternative to the proposed
approach.
437

205

dealer de minimis threshold. However, in our preliminary view, in the absence of some form of
activity-based test, the current scope of rules may not adequately address fraud and competitive
fragmentation concerns. Further, personnel located in a U.S. branch or office may be employed
by both U.S. and non-U.S. persons. Absent an activity-based test, our ability to enforce relevant
regulations may be hindered by our inability to monitor the activity of such personnel carried out
in their role as employee of the non-U.S. person.
The absence of an activity-based test may also adversely affect competition between U.S.
and non-U.S. persons. Under current rules, the disparity in regulatory treatment means U.S. and
non-U.S. persons will face disparate regulatory costs even if both engage in dealing activity
using personnel located in a U.S. office. Non-U.S. persons or their agents transacting with other
non-U.S. persons or their agents in the United States would potentially be able to provide
liquidity at lower cost than U.S. persons because of differing regulatory treatment in other
jurisdictions. As a result, non-U.S. persons could prefer to transact with non-U.S. persons or
their agents, and a substantial portion of liquidity from non-U.S. persons may become
unavailable to U.S. persons.
4. Extension of the activity-based test to the clearing and execution
requirements
As we discuss above in Section V.D, we are not proposing to require mandatory clearing
or mandatory trade execution for security-based swap transactions that are arranged, negotiated,
or executed using personnel located in a U.S. branch or office. 439 Under this alternative, we
would subject all transactions arranged, negotiated, or executed by personnel located in a U.S.
branch or office to the clearing and trade execution requirements. Non-U.S. entities that are
439

Because we have not yet issued any clearing determinations, no security-based swaps are
currently subject to mandatory clearing. See Section II.B.3, supra.

206

required to determine whether a transaction must be included in their dealer de minimis threshold
calculations, or whether they are subject to the external business conduct rules or Regulation
SBSR would be able to use the same assessment in determining whether such a transaction
would be subject to the clearing and trade execution requirements. Further, transactions that
were arranged, negotiated, or executed by non-U.S. persons using personnel located in a U.S.
branch or office would be subject to clearing and trade execution requirements identical to those
faced by U.S. persons and counterparties to U.S. persons. Such consistency in regulatory
treatment could reduce competitive disparities between U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons that
operate in the United States. This alternative may reduce the likelihood that a two-tier securitybased swap market emerges as a result of differences in regulatory requirements across
jurisdictions.
However, we preliminarily believe that this policy choice would adversely affect
efficiency and increase the risk of market fragmentation. We preliminarily believe that imposing
the clearing and execution requirements may impose unnecessary costs on certain non-U.S.
market participants in relation to the risks posed by their activity to the United States. For
example, these requirements may require non-U.S. persons and their agents to form new
relationships with clearing agencies and trading platforms in the United States. Given that the
risk to the U.S. financial system in the security-based swap transactions at issue in this release
resides with non-U.S. persons with no recourse guarantee against U.S. persons, we preliminarily
believe that any potential risk posed to the U.S. financial system does not warrant imposing
clearing and trade execution requirements on these security-based swap transactions. In
particular, we preliminarily believe that the margin requirements for foreign security-based swap
dealers, which we have proposed to apply on an entity-level basis, would be sufficient to address

207

the risk to the U.S. from non-U.S. persons with no recourse guarantee against U.S. persons and
that the costs of the margin requirement would be commensurate to the risks involved.
VII. Paperwork Reduction Act
A. Introduction
Certain provisions of our proposal contain “collection of information” 440 requirements
within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1955 (“PRA”) and we are submitting the
proposed collections of information to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”) for
review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR 1320.11. An agency may not conduct or
sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless it displays
a currently valid OMB control number.
We are proposing amendments to previously adopted Regulation SBSR, which contained
12 collections of information. 441 The proposed amendments amend the “reporting hierarchy”
adopted in Regulation SBSR that specifies the side that has the duty to report a security-based
swap that is a “covered transaction” 442 and provides for public dissemination of security-based
swap transaction information (except as provided in rule 902(c)) for certain transactions. 443 As
provided in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, registered SDRs are required to establish
and maintain certain policies and procedures regarding how transaction data are reported and

440

44 U.S.C. 3502(3).

441

See SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14673.

442

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 14567, (describing “covered transaction” as “all
security-based swaps except: (1) clearing transactions; (2) security-based swaps that are executed
on a platform and that will be submitted to clearing; (3) transactions where there is no U.S.
person, registered security-based swap dealer, or registered major security-based swap participant
on either side; and (4) transactions where there is no registered security-based swap dealer or
registered major security-based swap participant on either side and there is a U.S. person on only
one side”).

443

See proposed rules 908(a)(1)(iii), (iv) and (v).

208

disseminated, and participants of registered SDRs that are registered security-based swap dealers
or registered major security-based swap participants are required to establish and maintain
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure that they comply with applicable
reporting obligations.
The hours and costs associated with complying with Regulation SBSR constitute
reporting and cost burdens imposed by each collection of information. We preliminarily believe
that the methodology used for calculating the paperwork burdens set forth in the Regulation
SBSR Adopting Release is appropriate for calculating the paperwork burdens associated with the
amendments proposed here.
The proposed amendments containing these specific collections of information are
discussed further below.
B. Reporting Obligations—Rule 901
Rule 901 sets forth various requirements relating to the reporting of covered transactions.
The title of this collection is “Rule 901—Reporting Obligations.”
1. Summary of collection of information
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to require the reporting of
security-based swap transactions. Accordingly, we adopted rule 901 of Regulation SBSR under
the Exchange Act to implement this requirement. Rule 901 specifies, with respect to each
reportable event pertaining to covered transactions, who is required to report, what data must be
reported, when it must be reported, where it must be reported, and how it must be reported. Rule
901(a), as adopted, established a “reporting hierarchy” that specifies the side that has the duty to
report a security-based swap that is a covered transaction. 444 The reporting side, as determined
444

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14674 (citing notes 11-12).

209

by the reporting hierarchy, is required to submit the information required by Regulation SBSR to
a registered SDR. The reporting side may select the registered SDR to which it makes the
required report. Pursuant to rule 901(b), as adopted, if there is no registered SDR that will accept
the report required by rule 901(a), the person required to make the report must report the
transaction to the Commission. Rule 901(c) sets forth the primary trade information and rule
901(d) sets forth the secondary trade information that must be reported. Under the final rules,
covered transactions—regardless of their notional amount—must be reported to a registered
SDR at any point up to 24 hours after the time of execution, or, in the case of a security-based
swap that is subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination solely by operation of rule
908(a)(1)(ii), within 24 hours after the time of acceptance for clearing. 445 Except as required by
rule 902(c), the information reported pursuant to rule 901(c) must be publicly disseminated.
Information reported pursuant to rule 901(d) is for regulatory purposes only and will not be
publicly disseminated.
Rule 901(e) requires the reporting of life cycle events, and adjustments due to life cycle
events, within 24 hours of the time of occurrence, to the entity to which the original transaction
was reported. Reports of life cycle events must contain the transaction ID of the original
transaction.
In addition to assigning reporting duties, rule 901 also imposes certain duties on a
registered SDR that receives security-based swap transaction data. Rule 901(f) requires a
445

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, Section VII(B)(1) (discussing rule 901(j) and the
rationale for 24-hour reporting timeframe). Rule 901(j) provides that, if 24 hours after the time of
execution would fall on a non-business day (i.e., a Saturday, Sunday, or U.S. federal holiday),
reporting is required by the same time on the next business day. Rule 908(a)(1)(ii), as adopted,
provides that a security-based swap that is subject to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination solely by operation of rule 908(a)(1)(ii)—i.e., because the security-based swap has
been accepted for clearing by a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the
United States—must be reported within 24 hours of acceptance for clearing.

210

registered SDR to timestamp, to the second, any information submitted to it pursuant to rule 901,
and rule 901(g) requires a registered SDR to assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap,
or establish or endorse a methodology for transaction IDs to be assigned by third parties. Rule
901(h) requires that all information required by rule 901 be transmitted electronically in a format
required by the registered SDR.
Rule 901(i) requires reporting of pre-enactment security-based swaps and transitional
security-based swaps to the extent that information about such transactions is available.
2. Use of information
The security-based swap transaction information required to be reported pursuant to rule
901 will be used by registered SDRs, market participants, the Commission, and other relevant
authorities. The information reported pursuant to rule 901 will be used by registered SDRs to
publicly disseminate reports of security-based swap transactions, as well as to offer a resource
for us and other relevant authorities to obtain detailed information about the security-based swap
market. Market participants will use the public market data feed, among other things, to assess
the current market for security-based swaps and to assist in the valuation of their own positions.
We and other relevant authorities will use information about security-based swap transactions
reported to and held by registered SDRs to monitor and assess systemic risks, as well as for
market surveillance purposes.
3. Respondents
Rule 901(a) assigns reporting duties for covered transactions. In the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release we maintained our preliminary estimate of 300 respondents. 446 Based on an

446

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14674; Cross-Border Proposing Release, 78 FR
31113 (lowering estimate of respondents from 1,000 to 300).

211

analysis of the TIW data, we estimate that the proposed amendments set forth in this release
would result in an additional 120 respondents that would be required to report transactions under
the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR that are not already required to report under the
Regulation SBSR as adopted. Per estimates discussed above regarding the programmatic costs
and benefits of regulatory reporting and public dissemination, we estimated that these 120 new
respondents will be made up of 90 persons and approximately 30 other persons that are
registered broker-dealers (including registered SB SEFs). 447
4. Total initial and annual reporting and recordkeeping burdens of rule 901 of
Regulation SBSR
Pursuant to rule 901, covered transactions must be reported to a registered SDR or to the
Commission. Together, sections (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (h), and (j) of rule 901 set forth the
parameters that govern how covered transactions are reported. Rule 901(i) addresses the
reporting of pre-enactment and transitional security-based swaps. These reporting requirements
impose initial and ongoing burdens on respondents. We preliminarily believe that these burdens
would be a function of, among other things, the number of reportable events and the data
elements required to be reported for each such event. Rule 901(f) requires a registered SDR to
time stamp, to the second, all reported information, and rule 901(g) requires a registered SDR to
assign a transaction ID to each security-based swap, or establish or endorse a methodology for
transaction IDs to be assigned by third parties. These requirements impose initial and ongoing
burdens on registered SDRs. We preliminarily believe that the proposed amendments addressed
in this release would not impact the cost burdens resulting from rules 901(f) and 901(g) on

447

See section VI.B.3 and n.403, supra.

212

registered SDRs because the number of respondents does not impact our calculation of these
costs. 448 Therefore we do not address the costs associated with these provisions.
For Respondents. The reporting hierarchy set forth in rule 901(a) is designed to place the
duty to report covered transactions on counterparties who are most likely to have the resources
and who are best able to support the reporting function.
Respondents that fall under the reporting hierarchy in rule 901(a)(2)(ii) incur certain
burdens as a result thereof with respect to their reporting of covered transactions. As stated
above, we preliminarily believe that an estimate of 120 additional respondents that would incur
the duty to report under Regulation SBSR is reasonable for estimating collection of information
burdens. This estimate includes all persons that would incur a reporting duty under proposed
amendments to Regulation SBSR, that are not already subject to burdens under current rule 901.
In the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we estimated that there were likely to be
approximately 3 million reportable events per year under rule 901. 449 We further estimated that
approximately 2 million of these reportable events would consist of uncleared transactions. We
estimated that 2 million of the 3 million total reportable events would consist of the initial
reporting of security-based swaps as well as the reporting of any life cycle events. We also
estimated that of the 2 million reportable events, approximately 900,000 would involve the
reporting of new security-based swap transactions, and approximately 1,100,000 would involve
the reporting of life cycle events under rule 901(e).
Based on our assessment of the effect of the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR,
we estimate that they would result in approximately 2,700 additional reportable events per year

448

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14676-77.

449

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14675.

213

under rule 901. Taking a similar approach to the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release but also
accounting for security-based swaps that would be reported by a registered broker-dealer, we
estimate that, of the 2,700 new reportable events, 1,512 would involve the reporting of new
security-based swap transactions, and approximately 1,188 would involve the reporting of life
cycle events under rule 901(e). 450 Based on these estimates, we preliminarily believe that rule
901(a) would result in respondents having a total burden of 7.6 hours attributable to the initial
reporting of security-based swaps by respondents to registered SDRs under rules 901(c) and
901(d) over the course of a year. 451 We further estimate that respondents would have a total
burden of 5.9 hours attributable to the reporting of life cycle events under rule 901(e) over the
course of a year. 452 Therefore, we preliminarily believe that the proposed amendments to
Regulation SBSR would result in a total reporting burden for respondents under rules 901(c) and
901(d) along with the reporting of life cycle events under rule 901(e) of 13.5 burden hours per
year. We continue to believe that many reportable events would be reported through electronic
means and that the ratio of electronic reporting to manual reporting is likely to increase over
450

As noted above, we expect that 20% of the new reportable events would be reported by registered
broker-dealers pursuant to 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) and thus would involve the reporting only of new
security-based swap transactions and not of life-cycle events. See note 403, supra. Under this
assumption, we would expect 540 reportable events (2,700 * 0.2) to be new security-based swap
transactions reported by registered broker-dealers, and 972 reportable events to be other new
security-based swap transactions that would be required to be reported under the proposed rule
((2,700 - 540) * 0.45), for a total of 1,512 reportable events that are new security-based swap
transactions. The remaining 1,188 reportable events ((2,700 - 540) * 0.55) would be life-cycle
events reportable under rule 901(e). Cf. Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14676.

451

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, we estimated that it would take approximately 0.005
hours for each security-based swap transaction to be reported. See 75 FR at 75249 n.195. We
calculate the following: ((1,512* 0.005) / (120 respondents)) = 0.06 burden hours per respondent
or 7.6 total burden hours attributable to the initial reporting of security-based swaps.

452

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, we estimated that it would take approximately 0.005
hours for each security-based swap transaction to be reported. See 75 FR at 75249 n.195. We
calculate the following: ((1,188 * 0.005) / (120 respondents)) = 0.05 burden hours per reporting
side or 5.9 total burden hours attributable to the reporting of life cycle events under rule 901(e).

214

time. We continue to believe that the bulk of the burden hours estimated above would be
attributable to manually reported transactions. 453 Thus, respondents that capture and report
transactions electronically would likely incur fewer burden hours than those respondents that
capture and report transactions manually.
Based on the foregoing and applying the same calculation methods used in the
Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, we estimate that rule 901, as proposed in this release,
would impose an estimated total first-year burden of approximately 1,361 hours 454 per
respondent for a total first-year burden of 163,320 hours for all respondents that would incur the
duty to report under the proposed amendments to rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E). 455 We estimate that rule
901, when applied to new respondents resulting from the proposed amendments to rule 901(a),
would impose ongoing annualized aggregate burdens of approximately 654 hours 456 per
respondent for a total aggregate annualized burden of 78,480 hours for all new respondents. 457
We further estimate that rule 901 would impose initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost

453

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14676.

454

We derived our estimate from the following: (355 hours (one-time hourly burden for establishing
an OMS) + 172 hours (one-time hourly burden for establishing security-based swap reporting
mechanisms) + 180 hours (one-time hourly burden for compliance and ongoing support) = 707
hours (one-time total hourly burden). See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR 75248-50
nn.186, 194, and 201. (436 hours (annual-ongoing hourly burden for internal order management)
+ 0.11 hours (revised annual-ongoing hourly burden for security-based swap reporting
mechanisms) + 218 hours (annual-ongoing hourly burden for compliance and ongoing support) =
654 hours (one-time total hourly burden. See id. 75248-50 nn.187 and 201 (707 one-time hourly
burden + 654 revised annual-ongoing hourly burden = 1,361 total first-year hourly burden).

455

We derived our estimate from the following: (1,361 hours per respondent * 120 respondents) =
163,320 hours.

78,480 hours.

burdens of $201,000 per respondent, for total aggregate initial and ongoing annualized dollar
cost burdens of $24,120,000. 458
C. Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information—Rule 905
Rule 905, as adopted, establishes procedures for correcting errors in reported and
disseminated security-based swap information. The title of this collection is “Rule 905—
Correction of Errors in Security-Based Swap Information.”
1. Summary of collection of information
Rule 905 establishes duties for security-based swap counterparties and registered SDRs
to correct errors in information that previously has been reported.
Counterparty Reporting Error. Under rule 905(a)(1), where a side that was not the
respondent for a security-based swap transaction discovers an error in the information reported
with respect to such security-based swap, the counterparty must promptly notify the respondent
of the error. Under rule 905(a)(2), where a respondent for a security-based swap transaction
discovers an error in the information reported with respect to a security-based swap, or receives
notification from its counterparty of an error, the respondent must promptly submit to the entity
to which the security-based swap was originally reported an amended report pertaining to the
original transaction. The amended report must be submitted to the registered SDR in a manner
consistent with the policies and procedures of the registered SDR required pursuant to rule
907(a)(3).
Duty of Registered SDR to Correct. Rule 905(b) sets forth the duties of a registered SDR
relating to corrections. If the registered SDR either discovers an error in a transaction on its
system or receives notice of an error from a respondent, rule 905(b)(1) requires the registered
458

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14676 nn.1066 and 1078. We derived our
estimate from the following: ($201,000 per respondent * 120 respondents) = $24,120,000.

216

SDR to verify the accuracy of the terms of the security-based swap and, following such
verification, promptly correct the erroneous information contained in its system. Rule 905(b)(2)
further requires that, if such erroneous information relates to a security-based swap that the
registered SDR previously disseminated and falls into any of the categories of information
enumerated in rule 901(c), the registered SDR must publicly disseminate a corrected transaction
report of the security-based swap promptly following verification of the trade by the
counterparties to the security-based swap, with an indication that the report relates to a
previously disseminated transaction.
2. Use of information
The security-based swap transaction information required to be reported pursuant to rule
905 will be used by registered SDRs, participants of those SDRs, the Commission, and other
relevant authorities. Participants will be able to use such information to evaluate and manage
their own risk positions and satisfy their duties to report corrected information to a registered
SDR. A registered SDR will need the required information to correct security-based swap
transaction records, in order to maintain an accurate record of a participant’s positions as well as
to disseminate corrected information. The Commission and other relevant authorities will need
the corrected information to have an accurate understanding of the market for surveillance and
oversight purposes.
3.

Respondents

Rule 905 applies to all participants of registered SDRs. As noted above, we estimated
that there would be approximately 300 respondents that incur the duty to report security-based
swap transactions pursuant to current rule 901. As noted above, we preliminarily estimate that
an additional 120 respondents would incur the duty to report under the proposed amendments to
Regulation SBSR. Because any of these additional participants could become aware of errors in
217

their reported transaction data, we estimate that there may be 120 respondents for purposes of the
proposed amendments.
4. Total initial and annual reporting and recordkeeping burdens
The duty to promptly submit amended transaction reports to the appropriate registered
SDR after discovery of an error, as required under rule 905(a)(2), will impose burdens on
respondents. The duty to promptly notify the relevant respondent after discovery of an error, as
required under rule 905(a)(1), will impose burdens on non-reporting participants.
With respect to respondents, we preliminarily believe that rule 905(a) will impose an
initial, one-time burden associated with designing and building the respondent’s reporting system
to be capable of submitting amended security-based swap transactions to a registered SDR. We
continue to believe that designing and building appropriate reporting system functionality to
comply with rule 905(a)(2) would be a component of, and represent an incremental “add-on” to,
the cost to build a reporting system and develop a compliance function as required under existing
rule 901. Based on discussions with industry participants, we previously estimated this
incremental burden to be equal to 5% of the one-time and annual burdens associated with
designing and building a reporting system that is in compliance with rule 901, plus 10% of the
corresponding one-time and annual burdens associated with developing the respondent’s overall
compliance program required under rule 901. 459 This estimate was based on similar calculations
contained in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 460 updated to reflect new estimates
relating to the number of reportable events and the number of entities with reporting duties.
Taking a similar approach with respect to the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR, we

459

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14682.

460

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR 75254.

218

estimate that the new respondents would incur, as a result of rule 905(a), an initial (first-year)
aggregate burden of 5,808.7 hours, which is 48.4 burden hours per respondent, 461 and an ongoing
aggregate annualized burden of 2,616.7 hours, which is 21.8 burden hours per respondent. 462
We preliminarily believe that the actual submission of amended transaction reports
required under rule 905(a)(2) would not result in a material burden because this would be done
electronically though the reporting system that the respondent must develop and maintain to
comply with rule 901. The overall burdens associated with such a reporting system are
addressed in our analysis of rule 901. 463
D. Policies and Procedures for Registered Broker-Dealers—Rule 906(c)
1. Summary of collection of information
The proposed amendments to rule 906(c) would require each participant that is a
registered broker-dealer that becomes a participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy
an obligation under proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable
security-based swap transaction reporting obligations. Each such participant also would be
required to review and update its policies and procedures at least annually.

461

This figure is calculated as follows: [(((172 burden hours for one-time development of reporting
system) x (0.05)) + ((0.11 burden hours annual maintenance of reporting system) x (0.05)) +
((180 burden hours one-time compliance program development) x (0.1)) + ((218 burden hours
annual support of compliance program) x (0.1))) x (120 respondents)] = 5,808.7 burden hours,
which is 48.4 burden hours per respondent.

462

This figure is calculated as follows: [(((0.11 burden hours annual maintenance of reporting
system) x (0.05)) + ((218 burden hours annual support of compliance program) x (0.1))) x (120
respondents)] = 2,616.7 burden hours, which is 21.8 burden hours per respondent.

463

See Section VII.B, supra.

219

2. Use of information
The policies and procedures required under the proposed amendments to rule 906(c)
would be used by participants to aid in their compliance with Regulation SBSR, and also used by
the Commission as part of its ongoing efforts to monitor and enforce compliance with the federal
securities laws, including Regulation SBSR, through, among other things, examinations and
inspections.
3.

Respondents

The proposed amendments to rule 906(c) would result in the rule applying to
registered broker-dealers that are likely to become participants solely as a result of making a
report to satisfy an obligation under proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). The Commission
estimates that there would be 30 such registered broker-dealers.
4. Total initial and annual reporting and recordkeeping burdens
The proposed amendment to rule 906(c) would require each registered broker-dealer
that is likely to become a participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation
under proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4) to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable security-based
swap transaction reporting obligations. The proposed amendment to rule 906(c) also would
require each such registered broker-dealer to review and update such policies and procedures at
least annually. We estimate that the one-time, initial burden for each such registered brokerdealer to adopt written policies and procedures as required under the proposed amendments to
rule 906(c) would be similar to the rule 906(c) burdens discussed in the Regulation SBSR
Adopting Release for covered participants, and would be approximately 216 burden hours per

220

registered broker-dealer. 464 As discussed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 465 this
figure is based on the estimated number of hours to develop a set of written policies and
procedures, program systems, implement controls and oversight, train relevant employees, and
perform necessary testing. In addition, we estimate the burden of maintaining such policies and
procedures, including a full review at least annually would be approximately 120 burden hours
for each registered broker-dealer that is likely to become a participant solely as a result of
making a report to satisfy an obligation under proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). 466 This figure
includes an estimate of hours related to reviewing existing policies and procedures, making
necessary updates, conducting ongoing training, maintaining controls systems, and performing
necessary testing. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the initial aggregate annualized
burden associated with the proposed amendments to rule 906(c) would be 10,080 burden hours,
which corresponds to 336 burden hours per registered broker-dealer that is likely to become a
participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under proposed rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). 467 The Commission estimates that the ongoing aggregate annualized burden
associated with the proposed amendments to rule 906(c) would be 3,600 burden hours, which

464

See Regulation SBSR Adopting Release, 80 FR 14684. This figure is based on the following:
[(Sr. Programmer at 40 hours) + (Compliance Manager at 40 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at
40 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 40 hours) + (Sr. Systems Analyst at 32 hours) + (Director of
Compliance at 24 hours)] = 216 burden hours per registered broker-dealer that is likely to become
a participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under proposed rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4).

465

See id.

466

See id. This figure is based on the following: [(Sr. Programmer at 8 hours) + (Compliance
Manager at 24 hours) + (Compliance Attorney at 24 hours) + (Compliance Clerk at 24 hours) +
(Sr. Systems Analyst at 16 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 24 hours)] = 120 burden hours
per registered clearing agency or platform.

467

This figure is based on the following: [(216 + 120 burden hours) x (30 registered broker-dealers
that are likely to become a participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation
under proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4))] = 10,080 burden hours.

221

corresponds to 120 burden hours per registered broker-dealer that is likely to become a
participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under proposed rule
901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4). 468
E. Collection of Information is Mandatory
Each collection of information discussed above is mandatory.
F. Confidentiality of Responses to Collection of Information
Information collected pursuant to rule 905 would be widely available to the extent that it
corrects information previously reported pursuant to rule 901(c) and incorporated into securitybased swap transaction reports that are publicly disseminated by a registered SDR pursuant to
rule 902. Most of the information required under rule 902 would be widely available to the
public to the extent it is incorporated into security-based swap transaction reports that are
publicly disseminated by a registered SDR pursuant to rule 902. However, rule 902(c) prohibits
public dissemination of certain kinds of transactions and certain kinds of transaction information.
An SDR, pursuant to section 13(n)(5) of the Exchange Act and rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9
thereunder is required to maintain the privacy of this security-based swap information. To the
extent that we receive confidential information pursuant to this collection of information, we
anticipate that we will keep such information confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable
law. The proposed amendments to rule 906(c) would require certain registered broker-dealers to
establish, maintain, and enforce certain written policies and procedures. The collection of
information required by rule 906(c) would not be widely available. To the extent that the

468

This figure is based on the following: [(120 burden hours) x (30 registered broker-dealers that are
likely to become a participant solely as a result of making a report to satisfy an obligation under
proposed rule 901(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4))] = 3,600 burden hours.

222

Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this collection of information, we
anticipate that we would keep such information confidential, subject to applicable law.
G. Request for comment
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits comment to:
•

Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper
performance of our functions, including whether the information shall have practical
utility;

•

Evaluate the accuracy of our estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of
information;
Determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected; and

•

Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of collection of information on
those who are to respond, including through the use of automated
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements should direct

them to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503,
and should also send a copy of their comments to Brent J. Fields, Secretary, Securities and
Exchange Commission, 100 F Street NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090, with reference to File
Number S7-06-15. Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to
this collection of information should be in writing, with reference to File Number S7-06-15 and
be submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA/PA Services, 100 F
Street NE., Washington, DC 20549-2736. As OMB is required to make a decision concerning

223

the collections of information between 30 and 60 days after publication, a comment to OMB is
best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.
VIII. Consideration of Impact on the Economy
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(“SBREFA”) 469 the Commission requests comment on the potential effect of these proposed
amendments on the United States economy on an annual basis. The Commission also requests
comment on any potential increases in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries, and
any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation. Commenters are requested to
provide empirical data and other factual support for their views to the extent possible.
IX. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
A. Certification for Proposed Rule and Proposed Amendments to Exchange Act
Rules 3a71-3 and 3a71-5
Section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 (“RFA”) 470 requires the
Commission to undertake an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the impact of the proposed
rule amendments on small entities unless the Commission certifies that the rule, if adopted,
would not have a significant impact on a substantial number of “small entities.” 471
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, 472 a small entity
includes: (1) when used with reference to an “issuer” or a “person,” other than an investment
469

Public Law 104–121, Title II, 110 Stat. 857 (1996) (codified in various sections of 5 U.S.C., 15
U.S.C. and as a note to 5 U.S.C. 601).

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

471

5 U.S.C. 605(b)

472

Although section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits agencies
to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small
entity” for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. Those
definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10 under the Exchange
Act, 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Exchange Act Release No. 18451 (January, 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215
(February, 4, 1982) (File No. AS-305).

assets of $5 million or less; 473 or (2) a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its
audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d) under the Exchange Act, 474
or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or in
the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated with any person (other than a
natural person) that is not a small business or small organization. 475 Under the standards adopted
by the Small Business Administration, small entities in the finance and insurance industry
include the following: (i) for entities engaged in credit intermediation and related activities,
entities with $175 million or less in assets; 476 (ii) for entities engaged in non-depository credit
intermediation and certain other activities, entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts; 477
(iii) for entities engaged in financial investments and related activities, entities with $7 million or
less in annual receipts; 478 (iv) for insurance carriers and entities engaged in related activities,
entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts; 479 and (v) for funds, trusts, and other financial
vehicles, entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts. 480

As we stated in the Cross-Border Adopting Release, we continue to believe that the types
of entities that would engage in more than a de minimis amount of dealing activity involving
security-based swaps would not be “small entities” for purposes of the RFA. 481 Based on
feedback from market participants and our information about the security-based swap markets,
we believe that firms that are likely to engage in security-based swap dealing activity at levels
that may lead them to perform de minimis calculations under the “security-based swap dealer”
definition are large financial institutions that exceed the thresholds defining “small entities” as
set forth above. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is unlikely that the
proposed amendments regarding the registration of security-based swap dealers would have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission certifies that the proposed rule and
amendments to Exchange Act 3a71-3 and 3a71-5 would not have a significant economic impact
on a substantial number of small entities for purposes of the RFA. We encourage written
comments regarding this certification. We request that commenters describe the nature of any
impact on small entities and provide empirical data to illustrate the extent of the impact.
B. Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis for Proposed Amendments to Regulation
SBSR
The Commission has prepared this Initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis in
accordance with 5 U.S.C. 603. This initial Regulatory Flexibility Act Analysis relates to the
proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR under the Exchange Act, specifically rules 900, 901,
906, 907, and 908 under the Exchange Act.

481

See Cross-Border Adopting Release, 79 FR 47368.

226

1. Reasons for, and Objectives of, the Proposed Action and Legal Basis
The primary reason for, and objective of, the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR
is to address the application of the regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements to
certain transactions not addressed in the Regulation SBSR Adopting Release or the Regulation
SBSR Proposed Amendments Release and to incorporate our revised approach to transactions of
non-U.S. persons who are engaged in dealing activity from a location in the United States into
Regulation SBSR. Pursuant to Exchange Act sections 13A(a)(1), 13(m)(1)(G), 13(m)(1)(B)-(D),
and 13(n)(5)(D)(ii), the Commission is proposing amendments to Regulation SBSR regarding
the reporting and public dissemination of certain security-based swap transactions. 482
Proposed rule 908(a)(1)(v) would require a security-based swap transaction connected
with a non-U.S. person’s security-based swap dealing activity that is arranged, negotiated, or
executed by personnel of such non-U.S. person located in a U.S. branch or office, or by
personnel of such non-U.S. person’s agent located in a U.S. branch or office, to be reported to a
registered SDR and publicly disseminated. Requiring these transactions to be reported to a
registered SDR should enhance our ability to oversee relevant activity related to security-based
swap dealing occurring within the United States as well as our ability to monitor market
participants for compliance with specific Title VII requirements. 483 It should also improve our
ability to monitor for manipulative and abusive practices involving security-based swap
transactions or transactions in related underlying assets, such as corporate bonds or other
securities transactions that result from dealing activity, or other relevant activity, in the U.S.

482

See Section V.E, supra.

483

See section V.E.2(a), supra.

227

market. 484 Subjecting these transactions to the public dissemination requirements of Regulation
SBSR should enhance the level of transparency in the U.S. security-based swap market,
potentially reducing implicit transaction costs and promoting greater price efficiency. 485
Ensuring that post-trade information encompasses transactions involving a non-U.S. person that
arranged, negotiated, or executed the security-based swap in connection with its dealing activity
using personnel (personnel of an agent) located in a U.S. branch or office, could increase price
competition and price efficiency in the security-based swap market and should enable all market
participants to have more comprehensive information with which to make trading and valuation
determinations. 486
Proposed rule 908(a)(1)(iii) would require a security-based swap transaction that is
executed on a platform having its principal place of business in the United States to be reported
to a registered SDR and publicly disseminated pursuant to Regulation SBSR. Requiring these
security-based swaps to be reported to a registered SDR would permit the Commission and other
relevant authorities to observe, in a registered SDR, all transactions executed on such a platform
and to carry out oversight of such security-based swaps. Furthermore, we preliminarily believe
that public dissemination of such transactions would have value to participants in the U.S.
security-based swap market, who are likely to trade the same or similar products, as these
products would have been listed by a platform having its principal place of business in the
United States. 487

228

Proposed rule 908(a)(1)(iv) would require a security-based swap transaction that is
effected by or through a registered broker-dealer (including a registered SB SEF) to be reported
to a registered SDR and publicly disseminated pursuant to Regulation SBSR. Under proposed
rule 908(a)(2)(ii)(E)(4), the registered broker-dealer would be required to report the transaction if
neither side includes a U.S. person, a registered security-based swap dealer, a registered major
security-based swap participant, or a non-U.S. person who arranged, negotiated, or executed the
security-based swap from a location in the United States. Registered broker-dealers play a key
role as intermediaries in the U.S. financial markets. To improve integrity and transparency in
those markets, we believe that it is important that the Commission, and other relevant authorities,
have ready access to detailed information about the security-based swap transactions that such
persons intermediate. Furthermore, we preliminarily believe that public dissemination of such
transactions would have value to participants in the U.S. security-based swap market, who are
likely to trade the same or similar products. 488
2.

Small Entities Subject to the Proposed Rules

For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a small entity
includes: (1) when used with reference to an “issuer” or a “person,” other than an investment
company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its most recent fiscal year, had total
assets of $5 million or less; 489 or (2) a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its
audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Exchange Act rule 17a-5(d), 490 or, if not
required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus subordinated

See section V.E.2(c), supra.

489

See 17 CFR 240.0-10(a).

490

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5(d).

229

liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it
has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural
person) that is not a small business or small organization. 491 Under the standards adopted by the
Small Business Administration, small entities in the finance and insurance industry include the
following: (i) for entities engaged in credit intermediation and related activities, entities with
$175 million or less in assets; 492 (ii) for entities engaged in non-depository credit intermediation
and certain other activities, entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts; 493 (iii) for entities
engaged in financial investments and related activities, entities with $7 million or less in annual
receipts; 494 (iv) for insurance carriers and entities engaged in related activities, entities with $7
million or less in annual receipts; 495 and (v) for funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles, entities
with $7 million or less in annual receipts. 496
As noted in the Regulation SBSR Proposed Amendments Release, we believe, based on
input from security-based swap market participants, that the majority of security-based swap
transactions have at least one counterparty that is either a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant, and that these entities—whether registered broker-dealers or
not—would exceed the thresholds defining “small entities” set out above. 497 For this reason, we
continue to believe that the majority of proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR would not

230

have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for purposes of the
RFA. However, the proposed amendments would require registered broker-dealers (including a
registered SB SEF) to report a security-based swap transaction that is effected by or through it.
As noted above, we estimate that 30 registered broker-dealers (including registered SB SEFs)
may be required to report such transactions, 498 though we are not able to estimate the number of
these registered broker-dealers that would be “small entities.” Given the nature of the securitybased swap market, we preliminarily believe that it is unlikely that these registered brokerdealers would be small entities, though we request comment on the number of registered brokerdealers that are small entities that would be impacted by our proposed amendments, including
any available empirical data.
3. Projected Reporting, Recordkeeping and Other Compliance Requirements
As discussed above, the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR would require a
security-based swap transaction that is effected by or through a registered broker-dealer
(including a registered SB SEF) to be reported to a registered SDR by the registered brokerdealer if neither side of the security-based swap transaction includes a U.S. person, a registered
security-based swap dealer, a registered major security-based swap participant, or a non-U.S.
person who arranged, negotiated, or executed the security-based swap from a location in the
United States. We preliminarily believe, as discussed above, that registered broker-dealers
(including registered SB SEFs) would incur certain assessment costs associated with performing
an analysis of their clients (in the case of registered-broker dealers) and members (in the case of
registered SB SEFs) 499 to determine whose trades they are obligated to report under the proposed

498

See section VII.B.3, supra.

499

See section VI.A.1, supra.

231

rules, which would be supported by systems that would record and maintain this information
over time. 500
Additionally, under the proposed amendments to rule 906(c), these registered brokerdealers would be required to establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to ensure that the registered broker-dealer complies with any obligations to
report information to a registered security-based swap data repository in a manner consistent
with Regulation SBSR. Further, these registered broker-dealers would be required to review
these policies and procedures at least annually. 501
4. Duplicative, Overlapping or Conflicting Federal Rules
The Commission believes there are no rules that duplicate, overlap, or conflict with the
proposed amendments.
5.

Significant Alternatives

Pursuant to section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, 502 the Commission must
consider certain types of alternatives, including: (1) The establishment of differing compliance or
reporting requirements or timetables that take into account the resources available to small
entities; (2) the clarification, consolidation or simplification of compliance and reporting
requirements under the rule for small entities; (3) the use of performance rather than design
standards; and (4) an exemption from coverage of the rule, or any part of the rule, for small
entities.
We are proposing to require registered broker-dealers (including registered SB SEFs) to
report security-based swap transactions that are effected by or through it if neither side of the
500

Id.

501

See section VI.B.3, supra.

502

5 U.S.C. 603(c)

232

security-based swap transaction includes a U.S. person, a registered security-based swap dealer,
a registered major security-based swap participant, or a non-U.S. person who arranged,
negotiated, or executed the security-based swap from a location in the United States. The
proposed amendments would enable the Commission to gain a better understanding of the
security-based swap market, including the size and scope that market, and should enable us to
identify exposure to risks undertaken by individual market participants or at various levels of
aggregation, as well as credit exposures that arise between counterparties. 503 The regulatory data
collected as a result of the proposed amendments would enable us to conduct robust monitoring
of the security-based swap market for potential risks to financial stability. 504 The Commission
considered whether it is necessary or appropriate to establish different compliance and reporting
requirements under the rule; or clarify, consolidate, or simplify the compliance and reporting
requirements for small entities under the rule. Because the proposed rule amendments would
enhance the Commission’s ability to oversee relevant activity related to security-based swap
dealing occurring within the United States, our ability to monitor market participants for
compliance with specific Title VII requirements, and our ability to monitor for manipulative and
abusive practices involving security-based swap transactions, we preliminarily believe that small
entities should be covered by the proposed amendments to Regulation SBSR. We preliminarily
believe that establishing different compliance or reporting requirements for small entities, or
exempting small entities from the proposed amendments could complicate the rules and
potentially create gaps in the regulatory data that is reported and publicly disseminated that
would be inconsistent with the goals of Title VII and the proposed amendments. Additionally,

503

See Section VI.B.3, supra.

504

See Section VI.B.3, supra.

233

we do not consider performance rather than design standards to be consistent with the statutory
mandate requiring reporting of security-based swaps to registered SDRs and the public
dissemination of transaction and pricing data to enhance price discovery of security-based
swaps. 505
6. Solicitation of Comment
We are soliciting comments regarding this analysis. We request comment on the number
of small entities that would be subject to the amendments and whether the proposed amendments
would have any effects that have not been discussed. We request that commenters describe the
nature of any effects on small entities subject to the amendments and provide empirical data to
support the nature and extent of the effects.
