ORDER SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE AND
SETTING BRIEFING SCHEDULE

On December 15, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents Deven Sellers and Roland Barrera. On
January 22, 2016, the parties submitted a joint prehearing conference statement summarizing the
results of their recent conferral regarding this matter. The statement proposes a schedule for
filing motions for summary disposition, which I adopt as follows:
February 29, 2016:
March 15, 2016:
March 25, 2016:

Motions for summary disposition are due.
Oppositions are due.
Replies are due.

The statement also contains Respondent Barrera’s request that I convene a prehearing
conference to discuss certain aspects and consequences of this proceeding. Accordingly, a
telephonic prehearing conference will be held on February 4, 2016, at 1:00 p.m. EST. The
Division of Enforcement is asked to arrange a court reporter for the conference, and provide dialin instructions to all conference participants.
The parties stipulate in the statement that Respondents were served with the OIP by
December 26, 2015, making Respondents’ answers due by January 19, 2016. See OIP at 2; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). To date, no answers have been filed. In light of the stipulations
reflected in the statement, the necessity, if any, of filing answers will be discussed at the
February 4 prehearing conference.
SO ORDERED.
