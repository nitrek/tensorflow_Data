In the Matter of
RONALD MUSICH

ORDER VACATING NATIONALLY RECOGNIZED STATISTICAL RATING
ORGANIZATION AND MUNICIPAL ADVISOR BARS
Ronald Musich seeks to vacate an administrative bar order dated August 2, 2013 (“bar
order”) to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization (“NRSRO”) and as a municipal advisor.1 The NRSRO and municipal advisor
bars imposed on Ronald Musich were based solely on the conduct occurring prior to July 22,
2010, the effective date of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.2
Accordingly, in our discretion, we vacate the bar order to the extent that it prohibits Ronald
Musich from associating with any NRSRO and as a municipal advisor, but otherwise leave the
bar unchanged.
By the Commission.
