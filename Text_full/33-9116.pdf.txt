C.

THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
Overview

11.
During various periods between at least January 2007 and July 2007, the daily net
asset value3 (“NAV”) of each of the Funds was materially inflated as a result of the fraudulent
conduct of Respondents. Kelsoe, an employee of Morgan Asset and Morgan Keegan, was the
portfolio manager for the Funds. Weller was an officer and treasurer of the Funds and signed and
certified their periodic reports to the Commission.
12.
Respondent Morgan Keegan, a registered broker-dealer and registered investment
adviser, was the principal underwriter and exclusive distributor of the Funds’ shares. Morgan
Keegan was designated in each of the Funds’ prospectuses as authorized to consummate
transactions in the securities of the respective Fund. The Funds’ Boards of Directors were
responsible for pricing the Funds’ securities in accordance with the Funds’ valuation policies and
procedures. Each Fund’s Board of Directors delegated this pricing responsibility to Morgan
Keegan, by contract. Morgan Keegan priced each portfolio’s securities and calculated its daily
NAV through its Fund Accounting Department (“Fund Accounting”). Weller, Morgan Keegan’s
Controller and Head of Fund Accounting, along with other Morgan Keegan personnel, staffed a
“Valuation Committee” that purportedly oversaw Fund Accounting’s processes and evaluated the
prices assigned to securities. Morgan Keegan and Weller failed, despite multiple red flags, to
adequately fulfill Morgan Keegan’s responsibilities, as delegated to it by the Funds’ Boards of
Directors, to price the Funds’ securities in accordance with their valuation policies and procedures
regarding valuation. For example, Fund Accounting accepted unsubstantiated “price adjustments”
submitted by Kelsoe that inaccurately inflated the price of certain securities, contrary to the Funds’
policies and procedures. Fund Accounting failed to document justifications for such pricing
adjustments.
13.
The Funds’ valuation policies and procedures required that dealer quotes be
obtained for certain securities. Unbeknownst to Fund Accounting and the Funds’ independent
auditor (“Independent Auditor”), Kelsoe actively screened and manipulated the dealer quotes that
Fund Accounting and the Independent Auditor obtained from at least one broker-dealer. Kelsoe
also failed to advise Fund Accounting or the Funds’ Boards of Directors when he received
information indicating that the Funds’ prices for certain securities should be reduced.
14.
Each Fund held securities backed by subprime mortgages, and the market for such
securities deteriorated in the first half of 2007. Kelsoe’s actions fraudulently forestalled declines in
the NAVs of the Funds that would have occurred as a result of the deteriorating market, absent his
intervention. Morgan Keegan fraudulently published NAVs for the Funds without following
procedures reasonably designed to determine that the NAVs were accurate.
3

The “net asset value” or “NAV” of an investment company is the company’s total assets
minus its total liabilities. An investment company calculates the NAV of a single share (or the
“per share NAV”) by dividing its NAV by the number of shares that are outstanding.
4


Acting Contrary to Disclosures
15.
Each Fund held, in varying amounts, securities backed by subprime mortgages.
Many of these securities lacked readily available market quotations and, as a result, were to be
internally priced by the Funds’ Boards of Directors, using “fair value” methods. Under Section
2(a)(41)(B) of the Investment Company Act, the Funds must use market values for portfolio
securities with readily available market quotations and determine fair value for all other portfolio
assets. The fair value of securities for which market quotations are not readily available is the
price the Funds would reasonably expect to receive on a current sale of the security.4
16.
The Funds adopted valuation procedures for pricing the Funds’ portfolio securities
and, by contract, assigned the task of following those procedures to Morgan Keegan. The Funds’
valuation procedures for fair-valued securities mandated that such securities should be valued in
“good faith” by the Valuation Committee, considering a series of general and specific factors
including “fundamental analytical data relating to the investment,” “an evaluation of the forces
which influence the market in which the securities are purchased or sold” and “events affecting the
security.” The procedures, as set forth in the prospectus, required the Valuation Committee to
maintain a written report “documenting the manner in which the fair value of a security was
determined and the accuracy of the valuation made based on the next reliable public price
quotation for that security.” The procedures also required that prices assigned to securities be
periodically validated through, among other means, broker-dealer quotes. The procedures
specified that prices obtained from a broker-dealer could only be overridden when there was “a
reasonable basis to believe that the price provided [did] not accurately reflect the fair value of the
portfolio security.” Whenever a price was overridden, the procedures mandated the basis for
overriding the price to be “documented and provided to the Valuation Committee for its review.”
17.
In filings with the Commission, the Funds stated that the fair value of securities
would be determined by Morgan Asset’s Valuation Committee using procedures adopted by the
Funds. In fact, the responsibility was delegated to Morgan Keegan, which primarily staffed the
Valuation Committee. Morgan Keegan and the Valuation Committee failed to comply with the
Funds’ procedures in several ways. Among other things: (1) the Valuation Committee left pricing
decisions to lower level employees in Fund Accounting who did not have the training or
qualifications to make fair value pricing determinations; (ii) Fund Accounting personnel relied on
Kelsoe’s “price adjustments” to determine the prices assigned to portfolio assets, without obtaining
any basis for or documentation supporting the price adjustments or applying the factors set forth in
the procedures; (iii) Fund Accounting personnel gave Kelsoe excessive discretion in validating the
prices of portfolio securities by allowing him to determine which dealer quotes to use and which to
ignore, without obtaining documentation to support his adjustments; and (iv) the Valuation

incorporates Accounting Series Release No. 118 (“ASR 118”). The Commission has provided
interpretative guidance related to financial reporting in the Accounting Series Releases, which is
included in the Codification of Financial Reporting Policies. Thus, conformity with the ASR 118
is required by Commission rules and complies with GAAP. See also Articles 1-01(a) and 6.03 of
Regulation S-X.

Committee and Fund Accounting did not ensure that the fair value prices assigned to many of the
portfolio securities were periodically re-evaluated, allowing them to be carried at stale values for
many months at a time.
18.
Morgan Asset adopted its own procedures to determine the actual fair value to
assign to portfolio securities and to “validate” those values “periodically.” Among other things,
those procedures provided that “[q]uarterly reports listing all securities held by the Funds that
were fair valued during the quarter under review, along with explanatory notes for the fair values
assigned to the securities, shall be presented to the Board for its review.” Morgan Asset failed to
fully implement this provision of its pricing policy.
19.
Between at least January 2007 and July 2007, Kelsoe had his assistant send
approximately 262 “price adjustments” to Fund Accounting. These adjustments were contained in
approximately 40 emails sent by the assistant to a staff accountant in Fund Accounting who
calculated the Funds’ NAVs. The adjustments were communications by Kelsoe to Fund
Accounting concerning the price of specific portfolio securities. In many instances, these
adjustments were arbitrary and did not reflect fair value.
20.
Kelsoe’s price adjustments were routinely entered upon receipt by the staff
accountant into a spreadsheet used to calculate the NAVs of the Funds.
21.
Kelsoe knew his prices were being used to compute the Funds’ NAVs. Among
other things, he received bi-weekly reports on the Funds’ holdings and their prices which, by
comparison with previous reports, indicated that his price adjustments were being used and were
directly affecting the NAVs.
22.
Fund Accounting did not request, and Kelsoe did not supply, supporting
documentation for his price adjustments. Fund Accounting and the Funds did not record which
securities had been assigned prices by Kelsoe.
23.
As part of the Funds’ valuation procedures, Fund Accounting sometimes requested
third party broker-dealer quotes as a means to validate the prices it had assigned to the Funds’
securities. The Funds’ Independent Auditor used similar requests for third party broker-dealer
quotes as part of its annual year-end audits of the Funds. Fund Accounting or the Independent
Auditor would periodically send such requests to broker-dealers asking them to provide quotations
for various portfolio securities.
24.
When month-end dealer quotes were received by Fund Accounting, an employee of
Fund Accounting performed a cursory review to estimate whether they contained any securities
prices that varied from current portfolio prices by more than five percent. If so, then Kelsoe
determined whether the current price should be maintained or a new price—which may or may not
have been the price given by the broker-dealer—should be assigned to the security. Thus, Fund
Accounting routinely allowed Kelsoe to determine whether dealer quotes were used or ignored.

6


25.
Fund Accounting did not record which dealer quotes had been overridden at
Kelsoe’s instruction.
26.
Weller was the head of Fund Accounting and a member of the Valuation
Committee. He knew, or was highly reckless in not knowing, of the deficiencies in the
implementation of valuation procedures set forth above, and did nothing to remedy them or
otherwise to make sure fair-valued securities were accurately priced and the Funds’ NAVs were
accurately calculated. Among other things, Weller knew that: (i) the Valuation Committee did not
supervise Fund Accounting’s application of the valuation factors; (ii) Kelsoe was supplying fair
value price adjustments for specific securities to Fund Accounting; (iii) the members of the
Valuation Committee did not know which securities Kelsoe supplied fair values for or what those
fair values were, and did not receive supporting documentation for those values; and (iv) the only
pricing test regularly applied by the Valuation Committee was the “look back” test, which
compared the sales price of any security sold by a Fund to the valuation of that security used in the
NAV calculation for the five business days preceding the sale. The test only covered securities
after they were sold; thus, at any given time, the Valuation Committee never knew how many
securities’ prices could ultimately be validated by it. Weller nevertheless signed the Funds’
annual and semi-annual financial reports on Forms N-CSR, filed with the Commission, including
certifications pursuant to Sections 302 and 906 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.
27.
Morgan Keegan, acting through Weller and Fund Accounting, failed to employ
reasonable procedures to price the Funds’ portfolio securities and, as a result of that failure, did not
calculate accurate NAVs for the Funds. Despite these failures, Morgan Keegan recklessly
published daily NAVs of the Funds which it could not know were accurate and, as distributor of
the Funds’ shares, sold shares to investors based on those NAVs.
Kelsoe’s Fraudulent Manipulation of the Funds’ Securities Prices
28.
Between at least January 2007 and July 2007, Kelsoe manipulated the dealer quotes
obtained from at least one broker-dealer (“the Submitting Firm”). At about the time Fund
Accounting or the Independent Auditor sent requests for dealer quotes to the Submitting Firm,
Kelsoe would confer by e-mail or phone with his contact there (the “Salesman”) regarding the
quotes. Among other times, Kelsoe had such conversations concerning the month-end quotes for
December 31, 2006, February 28, 2007, and March 31, 2007.
29.
In some instances, even after causing the Submitting Firm to increase its quotes,
Kelsoe subsequently provided price adjustments to Fund Accounting that were higher than even
the Submitting Firm’s increased quotes. These adjustments were not consistent with the Funds’
procedures. Kelsoe and the Salesman also discussed, and the Submitting Firm frequently
provided, interim quotes that were lower than the prices at which the Funds were valuing certain
bonds, but higher than the initial quotes that the Submitting Firm had intended to provide. The
interim quotes were accommodations to Kelsoe to enable him to avoid marking down the securities
to the fair value in one adjustment. Kelsoe knew that the interim quotes did not reflect fair value,
that the Submitting Firm would provide lower quotes in response to future pricing validation
requests, and that he would be required to mark down the securities over time, but he did not
7


disclose that information to Fund Accounting, the Funds’ Boards of Directors or the Independent
Auditor.
30.
For example, on April 25, 2007, the Salesman and Kelsoe spoke by phone about
dealer quotes that would be submitted in connection with the March 31, 2007 audit by the
Independent Auditor. The Salesman then told Kelsoe that the Submitting Firm’s trading desk had
priced down many of the bonds in the Funds. Kelsoe asked the Salesman not to provide low dealer
quotes that reflected actual bid prices.
31.
As a result of the conversation, on April 30, 2007, the Submitting Firm provided
quotes to the Independent Auditor reflecting interim prices for certain bonds, which were higher
than the quotes the Submitting Firm originally intended to supply, but lower than the Funds’ then
current values. For example, the Submitting Firm priced down one bond (“the Long Beach bond”)
from the previous confirmation price of $81 to $65 as an “interim” step. This interim reduction to
$65 was approximately half of the mark-down to $50 that the Submitting Firm’s trading desk
initially had told the Salesman to communicate to the Independent Auditor for the Long Beach
bond. On April 26, 2007, Kelsoe sent a price adjustment to Fund Accounting marking down the
price of the Long Beach bond from $78, the price at which the Funds’ were valuing the bond at
that time, to $72. Fund Accounting promptly entered the $72 price, which was substantially higher
than fair value, into the spreadsheet used to calculate the Funds’ NAV.
32.
The Submitting Firm also refrained from submitting certain quotes to Fund
Accounting, where the quotes would have been lower than the current valuations being used by the
Funds, as the result of conversations between Kelsoe and the Salesman.
33.
Kelsoe did not disclose to Fund Accounting or the Funds’ Boards that he had
received quotes from the Submitting Firm which were lower than the current valuations recorded
by the Funds, and that the Submitting Firm had refrained from submitting quotes to Fund
Accounting or had submitted quotes at higher prices than it had originally planned. Kelsoe also
did not disclose that he caused the Submitting Firm to alter or withhold quotes.
The Knollwood Bonds
34.
In July 2006, Kelsoe purchased from the Submitting Firm, for one or more of the
Funds, a Knollwood Collateralized Debt Obligation (“Knollwood bond”), with the guarantee that
the Submitting Firm would make a “locked market” and buy it back in six months at the same
price, less two coupon payments that the Funds were to receive in the interim. In January 2007,
Kelsoe agreed with the Submitting Firm to continue holding the Knollwood bond. On March 30,
2007, the Independent Auditor requested quotes from the Submitting Firm on a number of the
Funds’ bonds, including the Knollwood bond, for its year-end audit. On April 30, 2007, the
Submitting Firm returned the requested quotes to both the Independent Auditor and Kelsoe;
however, it did not provide a quote for the Knollwood bond. Consequently, the Knollwood bond
continued to be maintained at $92, a price higher than fair value, in the NAV of the relevant Funds.

8


35.
On May 16, 2007, when Morgan Keegan was still valuing the Knollwood bond at
$92, Kelsoe and the Salesman discussed the fact that Morgan Keegan would be requesting another
quote for it from the Submitting Firm. Kelsoe told the Salesman not to provide a quote to Morgan
Keegan unless it was $87.50 or higher. On May 18, 2007, the Salesman advised Kelsoe that he
had obtained a $65 quote from the Submitting Firm’s trading desk for the Knollwood bond. On
June 5, 2007, Kelsoe communicated his unhappiness about the $65 quote to the Submitting Firm,
and threatened to stop doing business with it. On June 7, Kelsoe provided a price adjustment for
the Knollwood bond at $88, which was not consistent with fair value. On June 22, as a result of
Kelsoe’s comments, the Submitting firm provided a list of requested quotes to Morgan Keegan, but
left the space for the Knollwood quote blank. As a result, the Funds continued to price the
Knollwood bond at $88, substantially higher than fair value. Kelsoe did not advise Fund
Accounting, the Independent Auditor or the Funds’ Boards of Directors that the Submitting Firm
had provided to Kelsoe a quote lower than the price at which the Funds were holding the bonds, or
that he had prevailed upon the Submitting Firm not to supply the quotes to Fund Accounting or the
Independent Auditor.
The Terwin Bonds
36.
In addition to engaging in affirmative misconduct to inflate the NAVs of the Funds,
Kelsoe also failed to inform Fund Accounting in March 2007—in breach of his fiduciary duty as
portfolio manager to the Funds—that he had become aware that seven Terwin Mortgage Trust
bonds (“Terwin bonds”) held by the Funds had declined substantially in value.
37.
On or about March 15, 2007, Kelsoe placed a call to a broker-dealer that was the
issuer, distributor, and market maker for the Terwin bonds, to discuss a swap transaction. In
discussing the terms of the swap, Kelsoe learned that the values of the Terwin bonds had decreased
substantially and that the Submitting Firm would be lowering its dealer quotes in response to a
request that would shortly be sent out by Fund Accounting in connection with the Funds’ audit, for
prices as of March 31, 2007.
38.
Despite receiving this news in mid-March 2007, Kelsoe’s first communication with
Fund Accounting concerning reducing the price of certain Terwin bonds came in the form of a
price adjustment submitted to Fund Accounting by Kelsoe’s assistant via e-mail on Thursday,
March 29, 2007. Over the next day and weekend, Kelsoe informed Fund Accounting of the news
he had heard two weeks earlier. On April 2, 2007, before the market opened, Fund Accounting
lowered the value of all seven of the Terwin bonds effective as of March 31, 2007.
39.
As the result of Kelsoe’s delay, the bonds were materially overvalued by the Funds
during the last two weeks of March 2007.
Misrepresentations to Investors and the Funds’ Boards of Directors
40.
Kelsoe also made fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions of material fact
directly to the Funds’ investors concerning the Funds’ performance. Specifically, in each of the
Funds annual and semi-annual reports filed with the Commission on Forms N-CSR during the
9


relevant period (including, among others, the Annual Report for the Morgan Keegan Select Fund,
Inc. for the year-ended June 30, 2007 filed with the Commission on October 4, 2007), Kelsoe
included a signed letter to investors reporting on the Funds’ performance “based on net asset
value.” Given his actions to manipulate the Funds’ NAVs, Kelsoe knew the performance he
reported was materially misstated. Kelsoe and, through him, Morgan Asset made untrue
statements of material fact concerning the Funds’ performance in the Funds’ annual and semiannual reports filed with the Commission on Forms N-CSR. Morgan Asset, through Kelsoe, also
defrauded the Funds by providing a quarterly valuation packet reflecting inflated prices for certain
securities to the Funds’ Boards, failing to disclose to the Funds’ Boards information indicating that
the Funds’ NAVs were inflated, and that Kelsoe was actively screening and manipulating dealer
quotes and providing Fund Accounting with unsubstantiated price adjustments. In addition, the
prospectuses described Morgan Asset as responsible for fair valuation of the Funds’ portfolios.
