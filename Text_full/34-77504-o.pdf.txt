It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of Go EZ Corp. (“GEZC”) (CIK No. 314197)

listed as 6782 Collins Ave., Miami Beach, Florida. GEZC’s common stock is quoted on OTC

The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT, on April 4, 2016 through 11:59 p.m. EDT, on April 15, 2016.
