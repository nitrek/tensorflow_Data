RESPONDENT

David A. Aronson, CPA, age 56, of North Miami, Florida, is a certified public accountant
licensed in the state of Florida. Aronson has functioned as an accountant to Company A and
Company B, from at least October 2, 2015 to approximately February 2016. From March 2005
through October 2, 2015, Aronson was the sole proprietor of a Public Company Accounting
Oversight Board (“PCAOB”)-registered public accounting firm and was engaged as Company A’s
auditor from 2013 through July 2015, and as Company B’s auditor from 2011 through June 2015.
Aronson consented to a PCAOB order dated October 2, 2015 pursuant to which he was barred
from being an associated person of a registered public accounting firm.
B.

FACTS
1.

ARONSON’S UNLAWFUL ASSOCIATION
a. Section 105(c)(7)(B) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 (“Sarbanes-Oxley”)
states that it is “unlawful for any person that is ... barred from being associated
with a registered public accounting firm [...] willfully to become or remain
associated with any issuer […] in an accountancy or financial management
capacity [...] without the consent of the [PCAOB] or the Commission.”
b. On October 2, 2015, the PCAOB filed a settled action against Aronson and his
firm, David A. Aronson, CPA, for multiple deficiencies in audit work
performed between 2011 and 2015 on several public company engagements,
including Company B (the “PCAOB Order”). The PCAOB Order, which was
and is available on its website, revoked the registration of his accounting firm
and barred Aronson from being an associated person of a registered public
accounting firm.
c. Company A is a Delaware corporation and at all relevant times its common
stock was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the
Exchange Act.
d. Company B is a Nevada corporation and at all relevant times its common stock
was registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange
Act.
e. Aronson continued to perform accountancy or financial management services
after the PCAOB Order for Company A until February 2016, including, but not
limited to, preparing Company A’s financial statements, and the notes to the
financial statements, and preparation of the company’s Management Discussion
& Analysis section for its Form 10-Q for the period ended November 30, 2015.
f. Additionally, after the PCAOB Order was issued, Aronson continued to
perform accountancy or financial management services for Company B until
February 2016, including, but not limited to, preparing Company B’s financial
statements and the notes to the financial statements for its Form 10-Q for the

2

period ended September 30, 2015 and preparation of the financial statements for
Company B’s Form 10-K for the period ended December 31, 2015.3
g. Aronson received payment for accountancy or financial management work he
performed despite having been barred by the PCAOB.
h. Aronson never requested or received consent from the PCAOB or the
Commission to remain associated with Company A or Company B in this
accountancy or financial management capacity.
2.

VIOLATION

As a result of the conduct described above, Aronson willfully violated Section 105(c)(7)(B)
of Sarbanes-Oxley, which prohibits a person barred from associating with a registered public
accounting firm from willfully becoming or remaining associated with an issuer in an accountancy
or financial management capacity without consent of the PCAOB or the Commission.

therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
Whether, pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondent should be
ordered to cease and desist from committing or causing any violation and any future violation of
Section 105(c)(7)(B) of Sarbanes-Oxley.
C.
Whether, pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Aronson should be censured or denied, temporarily or
permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant;
D.
Whether, pursuant to Section 21B of the Exchange Act, civil penalties should be
levied against Respondent; and
E.
Whether, pursuant to Sections 21B and 21C of the Exchange Act, Aronson should
be subject to disgorgement with prejudgment interest.

IV.

forth in Section III hereof shall be convened not earlier than 30 days and not later than 60 days from

under Rule 155 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.155 and no hearing is
necessary.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
