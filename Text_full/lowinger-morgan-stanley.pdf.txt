UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS
FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT
ROBERT LOWINGER,
Plaintiff-Appellant,
v.
MORGAN STANLEY & CO. LLC, GOLDMAN SACHS & CO., FACEBOOK,
INC., a Delaware Corporation, and J.P. MORGAN SECURITIES LLC,
Defendants-Appellees
On Appeal from the United States District Court
for the Southern District of New York
BRIEF OF THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION,
AMICUS CURIAE
INTEREST OF THE COMMISSION
The Securities and Exchange Commission submits this brief as amicus
curiae in response to the invitation of the Court. The Commission has a strong
interest in ensuring that the rule determining beneficial ownership under Section
13(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C.
78m(d), and the rules governing short-swing profits under Section 16(b) of that
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78p(b), are properly interpreted and that their objectives are carried
out. The parties assert conflicting interpretations of those provisions, and the
Commission submits this brief setting forth its views.

1

STATEMENT OF THE CASE
Robert Lowinger appeals the district court’s dismissal of his complaint in
this matter arising out of the events surrounding Facebook, Inc.’s initial public
offering (“IPO”). Lowinger seeks to hold the IPO’s lead underwriters—Morgan
Stanley and Company LLC, J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, and Goldman Sachs and
Company (collectively, “the Underwriters”)—liable under Section 16(b) of the
Exchange Act for short-swing profits they allegedly received in connection with
their sales and purchases of shares in the offering. Section 16(b) provides for the
recovery by the issuer, in an action brought by the issuer or by a security holder of
the issuer, of profits realized by a statutory insider (an officer, director, or more
than ten percent beneficial owner) from the sale and purchase, or the purchase and
sale, of the securities of the issuer when both transactions take place within six
months.
The complaint alleges that the Underwriters were “beneficial owners” of
shares held by certain Facebook shareholders who were selling shares in the IPO
(the “Selling Shareholders”) because those shareholders and the Underwriters were
part of a “group” that was created by lock-up agreements entered into by the
Selling Shareholders and the Underwriters. The lock-up agreements prevented the
Selling Shareholders from selling additional shares for a period of time following
the IPO. Because the Selling Shareholders were beneficial owners of more than
2

ten percent of Facebook’s stock, the complaint asserts that the members of the
alleged group, including the Underwriters, were statutory insiders, and that the
Underwriters were, thus, subject to Section 16(b).
In order to prevail under this theory, Lowinger must establish that the lockup agreements, which are a standard feature of IPOs, were, on their own, sufficient
to create a group that would make the Underwriters beneficial owners of the shares
that are subject to the lock-up and, as a result, subject to Section 16(b). And even
if such standard lock-up agreements, on their own, could have that effect,
Lowinger would also have to establish that the Underwriters were ineligible for
certain exemptions from Section 16(b) for trades made by underwriters in
connection with a bona fide underwriting.
The district court addressed only the first issue and dismissed the complaint
on the grounds that the lock-up agreements did not make the Underwriters
beneficial owners of the shares held by the Selling Shareholders. Lowinger
appealed and, following briefing and oral argument, this Court invited the
Commission to address two questions touching on both issues:
(1) “[w]hether, in the context of an IPO, a ‘lock-up’ agreement between an
underwriter and shareholders to restrict the sale of an issuer’s stock
immediately following the initial public offering constitutes an agreement
‘to act together for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of
equity securities,’ [Exchange Act Rule 13d-5(b)(1),] 17 C.F.R. § 240.13d5(b)(1), such that the parties to the agreement may” be treated as members
of a group for purposes of determining beneficial ownership of the securities
under Exchange Act Sections 13(d) and 16(b); and
3

(2) “[w]hether an underwriter who, in connection with an initial public
offering, (a) obtains but does not disclose material non-public information
about an issuer and (b) profits based on open-market trades in the stock of
the issuer before and after that information becomes public, has not
‘acquire[d] securities through his participation in good faith in a firm
commitment underwriting,’ [Exchange Act Rule 13d-3(d)(4),] 17 C.F.R.§
240.13d-3(d)(4), or has not ‘participat[ed] in good faith’ in the business of
distributing securities, [Exchange Act Rule 16a-7, 17 C.F.R.] § 240.16a7[.]”
As discussed below, the Commission believes that:
(1) although the creation of a “group” for purposes of Sections 13(d) and
16(b) depends on the specific facts and circumstances of any given case, a
typical lock-up agreement executed between shareholders and underwriters
as part of an underwritten public offering, standing alone, would not be
sufficient to establish such a group; and
(2) an underwriter is entitled to rely on the exemptions provided by
Exchange Act Rules 13d-3(d)(4) and 16a-7, even though the underwriter has
obtained material non-public information, so long as the underwriter’s
purchases and sales are made in connection with the underwriter’s
participation in a bona fide underwritten public offering.
A.

Statutory and Regulatory Scheme

“Section 16 of the Exchange Act was designed both to provide the public
with information on securities transactions and holdings of corporate officers,
directors, and principal shareholders, and to deter those individuals from profiting
on short-term trading in the securities of their corporations while in possession of
material, non-public information.” Ownership Reports & Trading by Officers,

4

Directors, and Principal Stockholders, Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-26333, 53 Fed.
Reg. 49997, 49998 (Dec. 13, 1988) (“Proposing Release”).
Section 16(a) requires officers, directors, and “beneficial owner[s] of more
than 10 percent of any class of” registered securities to file disclosure statements
with the Commission. 15 U.S.C. 78p(a)(1).
Section 16(b) provides for the recovery by the issuer, in an action brought by
the issuer or on behalf of the issuer by a security holder, of profits realized by those
same individuals from the sale and purchase, or the purchase and sale, of the
securities of the issuer when both the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase,
take place within a period of less than six months. 1 Congress intended that section
to “prevent[] the unfair use of information which may have been obtained by [an
insider] by reason of his relationship to the issuer.” 15 U.S.C. 78p(b). And it
classifies “directors, officers and beneficial owners as those presumed to have
access to inside information.” Foremost-McKesson, Inc. v. Provident Secs. Co.,
423 U.S. 232, 243 (1976); accord Morales v. Quintel Entm’t, Inc., 249 F.3d 115,
121 (2d Cir. 2001) (Section 16(b) reaches those “presumed to have access to
confidential corporate information not generally available to other participants in
the public market”); Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors and

1

Section 16(b) does not “cover any transaction where such beneficial owner was
not such both at the time of the purchase and sale, or the sale and purchase, of the
security . . . involved.”
5

Principal Security Holders, Exchange Act Rel. No. 34-28869, 56 Fed. Reg. 7242,
7244 (Feb. 21, 1991) (“Adopting Release”) (“Section 16, as applied to ten percent
holders, is intended to reach those persons who can be presumed to have access to
inside information because they can influence or control the issuer as a result of
their equity ownership.”); see also S. Rep. No. 73-1455, at 55 (1934) (“beneficial
owners” language prevents “the unscrupulous employment of inside information
by large stockholders who, while not directors and officers, exercised sufficient
control over the destinies of their companies to enable them to acquire and profit
by information not available to others”).
To prevent insiders from abusing their position, Section 16(b) “imposes a
form of strict liability . . . rendering them liable to suits requiring them to disgorge
their profits even if they did not trade on inside information or intend to profit on
the basis of such information.” Gollust v. Mendell, 501 U.S. 115, 122 (1991);
accord Gibbons v. Malone, 703 F.3d 595, 599 (2d Cir. 2013) (Section 16(b)
“operates mechanically, with no required showing of intent to profit” but “offers
merely the prophylactic remedy of disgorgement.” (internal quotation marks
omitted)). In fact, as the Supreme Court has observed, “the only method Congress
deemed effective to curb the evils of insider trading was a flat rule taking the
profits out of a class of transactions in which the possibility of abuse was believed
to be intolerably great.” Reliance Electric Co. v. Emerson Electric Co., 404 U.S.
6

418, 422 (1972); see also Thomas Lee Hazen, 4 Treatise on the Law of Securities
Regulation, §13.2 (“The legislative history reveals congressional recognition of
such a great potential for abuse of inside information so as to warrant the
imposition of strict liability.”).
Although beneficial owners of more than ten percent of an issuer’s stock are
subject to Section 16(b), Congress did not define beneficial owner. See Levy v.
Southbrook Int’l Invs., Ltd., 263 F.3d 10, 14 (2d Cir. 2001). Instead, Congress left
that task to the Commission, which adopted Exchange Act Rule 16a-1, 17 C.F.R.
240.16a-1. Under that provision, the term means “any person who is deemed a
beneficial owner pursuant to section 13(d) of the [Exchange] Act and the rules
thereunder.” 17 C.F.R. 240.16a-1(a); see also Adopting Release, 56 Fed. Reg. at
7244.
Section 13(d) requires any person acquiring beneficial ownership of five
percent or more of a corporation’s common stock to disclose certain information.
See 15 U.S.C. 78m(d). Exchange Act Rule 13d-3(a) thereunder describes a
“beneficial owner” as “any person who, directly or indirectly, through any
contract, arrangement, understanding, relationship, or otherwise has or shares: (1)
Voting power . . . ; and/or (2) Investment power which includes the power to
dispose, or to direct the disposition of, such security.” 17 C.F.R. 240.13d-3(a).
Further, under Section 13(d)(3), “[w]hen two or more persons act as a partnership,
7

limited partnership, syndicate, or other group for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
or disposing of securities of an issuer,” that group is deemed a single person for
purposes of Section 13(d). 15 U.S.C. 78m(d)(3); see also Hazen, 4 Treatise on the
Law of Securities Regulation, §13.1 (“Under section 13(d), a group of persons
acting together will count as one person for the purpose of computing the
ownership threshold.”). Thus, “[w]hen two or more persons agree to act together
for the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of equity securities of an
issuer, the group formed thereby shall be deemed to have acquired beneficial
ownership, for purposes of Sections 13(d) . . . of all equity securities of that issuer
beneficially owned by any such persons.” Exchange Act Rule 13d-5(b)(1), 17
C.F.R. 240.13d-5(b)(1). For purposes of Section 16, the group itself would not be
a separate person, but in determining status as a ten percent holder, the securities
beneficially owned by the group must be included in the calculation by each
individual member of the group. See Adopting Release, 56 Fed. Reg. at 7245 n.
54.
Commission rules implementing Sections 13 and 16 also contain exceptions
to the beneficial ownership requirements for good-faith underwriting. Rule 13d3(d)(4) provides that “[a] person engaged in business as an underwriter of
securities who acquires securities through his participation in good faith in a firm
commitment underwriting . . . shall not be deemed to be the beneficial owner of
8

such securities until” forty days after it is acquired. 17 C.F.R. 240.13d-3(d)(4).
And under Rule 16a-7 (together with Rule 16a-10), purchases and sales “made in
connection with the distribution of a substantial block of securities” are exempt
from Section 16(b) liability when “[t]he person effecting the transaction is engaged
in the business of distributing securities and is participating in good faith, in the
ordinary course of such business” and the security involved is “purchased in good
faith . . . for the purpose of stabilizing the market price of securities . . . being
distributed or to cover an over-allotment or other short position created in
connection with such distribution.” 17 C.F.R. 240.16a-7; see 17 C.F.R. 240.16a10 (making securities transactions exempted from Section 16(a) reporting by Rule

Other regulations also “permit underwriters and syndicate members to
conduct [certain] stabilizing transactions” designed to “prevent[ ] or retard[] a
decline in the market price of a security to facilitate an offering.” AntiManipulation Rules Concerning Securities Offerings, Rel. Nos. 33-7375 & 3438067, 62 Fed. Reg. 520, 535 (Jan. 3, 1997); accord Amendments to Regulation

typically “allow[] the managing underwriter to ‘oversell’ the offering, i.e.,
9

establish a short position beyond the number of shares to which the underwriting
commitment relates.” Id. at 75780. To cover the syndicate short positions,
underwriters may exercise what is commonly called an overallotment or “Green
Shoe” option that allows them to purchase additional shares from the issuer at the
public offering price, or they may cover “by purchasing shares in the market once
secondary trading begins.” Id. Such activities “facilitate public offerings and do
not lend themselves to the speculative abuse Section 16 was designed to prevent.”

Facts 2
1. To facilitate Facebook’s IPO, the Selling Shareholders and the
Underwriters executed typical lock-up agreements.

Facebook’s May 18, 2012 IPO was underwritten by a syndicate of “more
than two dozen banks and investment firms” led by the Underwriters. Complaint,
¶ 14 (A-18). 3 Before the IPO, the Selling Shareholders—who in the aggregate
owned more than 10 percent of Facebook’s common stock—executed so-called
2

Because this appeal concerns a motion to dismiss, the facts alleged in the
complaint are assumed to be true.

10

lock-up agreements with the Underwriters. Id. at ¶¶ 16-17 (A-19). Such
agreements are common because they prevent pre-IPO shares from flooding and
destabilizing the market for newly issued shares. See Initial Public Offerings:
Lockup Agreements, Fast Answers, U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission,
available at http://www.sec.gov/answers/lockup.htm (June 26, 2015).
The lock-up agreements here were likewise intended “to control the supply
of Facebook shares available to the market, which, in turn was expected to provide
support for the trading price of Facebook common stock.” Complaint, ¶ 16 (A-19).
Specifically, the agreements prohibited the Selling Shareholders from “sell[ing] or
otherwise dispos[ing] of any Common Stock or securities convertible into or
exchangeable into Common Stock” for a specified period without co-lead
underwriter Morgan Stanley’s consent. Id. at ¶¶ 15, 17 (A-19). The agreements
were disclosed in Facebook’s Prospectus and Registration Statement. See
Facebook Prospectus, Form 424 B4, pg. 163 (A-46); Amend. No. 5 to Form S-1
Registration Statement, pg. A-1 to B-5) (May 3, 2012) (A-73-82); see also In re
Facebook, Inc., IPO Secs. & Derivative Litig., 986 F. Supp.2d 544, 548-49
(S.D.N.Y. 2014).
2. The Underwriters advised investors that they might execute
transactions designed to facilitate Facebook’s IPO.
Facebook’s Prospectus and Registration Statement additionally advised that,
“[i]n order to facilitate [the IPO], the underwriters may engage in transactions that
11

stabilize, maintain or otherwise affect the price of the Class A common stock.”
Amend. No. 8 to Form S-1, pg. 166 (May 16, 2012) (A-43). As noted above, such
underwriter transactions are permissible. See supra at pp. 9-10. Also consistent
with market practices, Facebook advised investors that “the underwriters may sell
more shares than they are obligated to purchase under the underwriting agreement,
creating a short position” and cover those positions by exercising a Green Shoe
option or “by purchasing shares in the open market.” Amend. No. 8 to Form S-1,
pg. 166 (A-43). The offering documents also disclosed that the Underwriters’
transactions might “raise or maintain the market price of the . . . stock above
independent market levels or prevent or retard a decline in [the] market price.”
Amend. No. 8 to Form S-1, pg. 166 (A-43).
3. Before the IPO, the Underwriters received nonpublic information
concerning Facebook’s revenue projections.
In connection with the IPO, the Underwriters had access to nonpublic
information concerning Facebook. See Complaint, ¶¶ 19, 22-32 (A-20-23). In
March and April 2012, Facebook shared with the Underwriters its “internal
revenue forecasts of $1.1 to 1.2 billion for 2Q12 and $5 billion for fiscal year
2012.” Id. at ¶ 20 (A-20). That information was “incorporated into materials used
by the Underwriters to market the Facebook IPO to investors in a road show
commenced on May 7, 2012.” Id. at ¶¶ 20-21 (A-20).

12

That same day, due to increased mobile usage and “‘certain product
decisions’ made by Facebook,” the company “revised its revenue estimates
downward” to the “low end of the $1.1 to $1.2 billion range” and projected that the
2012 estimate would “be 3% to 3.5% lower than the previously forecasted $5
billion.” Complaint, ¶ 22 (A-20-21). Facebook immediately shared those
concerns with Morgan Stanley. Id. at ¶¶ 22-24. (A-20-21).
On May 9, Facebook amended its Registration Statement, advising potential
investors as follows:
Based upon our experience in the second quarter of 2012 to
date, the trend we saw in the first quarter of [daily active users]
increasing more rapidly than the increase in number of ads
delivered has continued. We believe this trend is driven in part
by increasing usage of Facebook on mobile devices where we
have only recently begun showing an immaterial number of
sponsored stories in News Feed, and in part due to certain pages
having fewer ads per page as a result of product decisions.
Complaint, ¶ 25 (A-20-21). As the district court explained, “[s]imilar to the
consolidated complaint filed in the securities class action” before that court, the
complaint here “alleges this disclosure was false and misleading because it failed
to sufficiently disclose ‘that these factors had already materially impaired
Facebook’s revenue.’” In re Facebook, Inc., IPO Secs. & Derivative Litig., 986 F.
Supp.2d at 547 (quoting Complaint, ¶ 26 (A-22)).
“[I]mmediately after” filing that amendment, Facebook called “select
investment bankers and their securities analysts, including the Underwriters” and
13

advised them that Facebook believed it was “going to come in the lower end of
[the] $1.1 to $1.2 [billion] range for Q2 based upon the trends we described in the
disclosure.” Complaint, ¶¶ 27, 30 (internal quotation marks and emphasis omitted)
(A-22-23). Thereafter, the Underwriters “revised their Facebook 2Q12 estimates,”
and according to a report cited in the complaint, shared that information with “only
a few ‘major clients[.]’” Id. at ¶¶ 31, 38 (A-23, 25). Others—including retail
investors—did not learn those facts until the market closed on the day of the IPO.
Id. at ¶¶ 33-34, 36 (A-24-25).
4. The Underwriters oversold Facebook’s IPO.
Due to significant retail investor demand, between “May 17 and 18, 2012,
the underwriters sold 484,418,657 shares of Common Stock to the public at prices
ranging from $38 to $42.05 per share, including 63 million shares in short sales
pursuant to their over-allotment or [Green Shoe] option.” Complaint, ¶¶ 33-34 (A24).
After trading closed on May 18, “[r]eports of the decline in Facebook’s
expected revenues began to emerge” and investors became aware that the
Underwriters “had cut their revenue estimates in advance of the IPO.” Complaint,
¶ 36 (A-25). On May 21, the first trading day thereafter, Facebook’s stock price
declined to “$34.03 on extremely high volume reflecting a decline of more than
10% from the” IPO price. Id. at ¶ 37 (A-25). The next day, the decline continued
14

and Facebook’s stock “closed at $31 per share, again on extremely high volume.”
Id. at ¶ 39 (A-26).
During that period, the Underwriters declined to exercise their Green Shoe
option to cover their short positions. See Complaint, ¶¶ 37, 41-42 (A-25-26).
Instead, the Underwriters purchased shares on the secondary market “at prices
lower than $38.00 per share.” Id. at ¶ 41 (A-26). As a result, the Underwriters
“made a profit of about $100 million with the bulk of that profit being made on”
May 21. Id. at ¶ 42 (A-26).
C.

Procedural History

The events surrounding the Facebook IPO have spawned multiple lawsuits
that have been consolidated in the district court. See In re Facebook, Inc., 986 F.
Supp.2d at 547.
This action was filed on June 12, 2013, after Facebook declined to seek
recovery under Section 16(b) of the Underwriter’s alleged short-swing profits.
Complaint, ¶ 49 (A-28). The complaint alleges that through the lock-up
agreements, the Underwriters and Selling Shareholders agreed “to act together for
the purpose of acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of [Facebook’s] Common
Stock.” Id. at ¶ 18 (A-19). As a result, the complaint claims, the Underwriters and
Selling Shareholders became a group, with each member deemed to beneficially
own each other member’s Facebook stock and rendering them all insiders subject
15

to Section 16(b)’s short-swing profits rule. Id. at ¶¶ 15-18 (A-19-20). It further
alleges that the Underwriters were not engaged in a good-faith underwriting
because, among other things, they possessed material inside information. See id. at
¶¶ 19-35 (A-20-24). The complaint seeks to require the Underwriters to disgorge
to Facebook “about $100 million” in short-swing profits. See id. at ¶ 42 (A-26).
The Underwriters moved to dismiss the complaint for failure to state a claim.
See In re Facebook, Inc., 986 F. Supp.2d at 546. They argued that they did not
form a group and, in any event, were exempt from Section 16(b) liability because
their purchases and sales were in connection with a good-faith underwriting.
On May 2, 2014, the district court granted the motion to dismiss on the
grounds that the complaint failed to sufficiently allege that the Underwriters and
Selling Shareholders formed a group. Id. at 555. The group allegation rested
entirely on the lock-up agreements, and the district court found those agreements
insufficient to establish a group because the Selling Shareholders and Underwriters
had not agreed to jointly acquire, hold, vote, or dispose of stock. Id. at 552-54. To
the contrary, the district court observed, while the agreements committed the
Selling Shareholders to abstain from selling shares, the Underwriters “were under
no reciprocal agreement.” Id. at 552. Indeed, the Underwriters were obliged to—
and did—sell Facebook stock. See id. The district court also found that “[b]ecause
lock-up agreements are standard industry practice,” on their own they are
16

“insufficient to establish a Section 16(b) group.” Id. at 553. The district court
declined to reach the alternative argument that the Underwriters’ transactions were
exempt as part of a good-faith underwriting. Id. at 554. Later, the district court
denied Lowinger’s motion for reconsideration. See In re Facebook, Inc., IPO Secs.
& Derivative Litig., 43 F. Supp.3d 369 (S.D.N.Y. 2014).
On October 1, 2014, Lowinger appealed the district court’s decisions
dismissing the complaint and denying reconsideration. The parties subsequently
filed briefs, and this Court heard oral argument.
DISCUSSION
I.

A Typical Lock-Up Agreement, Standing Alone, is Insufficient to
Establish a Group for Section 13(d) or Section 16(b) Purposes.
Although the creation of a “group” for purposes of Sections 13(d) and 16(b)

depends on the specific facts and circumstances of any given case, a typical lockup agreement executed by shareholders for the benefit of the underwriters as part
of an underwritten public offering, standing alone, is not sufficient to establish
such a group. Lock-up agreements are common in connection with underwritten
public offerings, and they do not present the kinds of risks that Sections 13(d) and
16(b) are intended to address.
As noted, when two or more persons “act as” a group for the purpose of
acquiring, holding, or disposing of equity securities of an issuer, the group is
17

deemed a “person” under Section 13(d)(3). Similarly, in determining status as a
more-than-ten-percent holder for Section 16 purposes, the securities beneficially
owned by the group must be included in the calculation by each individual member
of the group. A group is deemed to acquire beneficial ownership as of the date that
the group members “agree to act together for the purpose of acquiring, holding,
voting or disposing of equity securities of an issuer.” Rule 13d-5(b)(1). An
agreement does not have to “be expressly memorialized in writing.” Wellman v.
Dickinson, 682 F.2d 355, 363 (2d Cir. 1982). Instead, there must be “‘sufficient
direct or circumstantial evidence to support the inference of a formal or informal
understanding between [the parties]’ for the purpose of acquiring, holding, or
disposing of securities.” Hallwood Realty Partners, L.P. v. Gotham Partners, L.P.,
286 F.3d 613, 617 (2d Cir. 2002) (quoting Wellman, 682 F.2d at 363).
Applying that standard, this Court has held that while a lock-up agreement
“may bear upon” the question of whether a group exists, evidence of coordination
and testimony demonstrating that parties joined together to acquire, hold, or
dispose of securities are more likely to demonstrate the existence of a group.
Quintel Entm’t, 249 F.3d at 127; see also Hallwood Realty Partners, 286 F.3d at
618 (affirming decision finding no group based on record that included evidence of
prior relationships between parties, trading patterns, discussions, and other
circumstantial factors). That approach is consistent with the Commission’s long
18

established position that a lock-up agreement may help evidence the existence of a
group. Cf. Brief of Securities and Exchange Commission, Amicus Curiae, Morales
v. Quintel Entm’t, Inc., No. 99-9374 (2d Cir.) (March 2000), at p. 27 (“Whether a
lock-up provision constitutes an agreement for the purposes of creating a Section
13(d) group depends on the facts and circumstances of any given case.”).
At the same time, the Commission does not believe that a typical lock-up
agreement executed between shareholders and underwriters as part of an
underwritten public offering, standing alone, is sufficient to demonstrate the
existence of a group for purposes of Sections 13(d) or 16(b). As the district court
correctly concluded, lock-up agreements are a common fixture of the IPO process.

NYSE/NASD IPO Advisory Comm., Report & Recommendations of a committee
convened by the NYSE, Inc. & NASD at the request of the U.S. Securities and
19

Exchange Commission (May 2003), at p. 16, available at http://www.finra.org/
sites/default/ files/Industry/p010373.pdf (“Underwriters routinely require directors,
officers and certain pre-IPO shareholders of an issuer to enter into lock-up
agreements that restrict their sale of company shares for a specified period,
typically six months”). Indeed, the Commission’s website advises investors that,
“[b]efore a company goes public, the company and its underwriter typically enter
into a lockup agreement to ensure that shares owned by these insiders don’t enter
the public market too soon after the offering.” Initial Public Offerings: Lockup
Agreements, Fast Answers, U.S. Securities & Exchange Commission, available at
http://www.sec.gov/answers/lockup.htm (last checked June 26, 2015).
Such lock-up agreements do not raise Section 13(d) or Section 16(b)
concerns. Section 13(d) is intended to “alert investors in securities markets to
potential changes in corporate control and . . . provide them with an opportunity to
evaluate the effect of these potential changes.” Wellman, 682 F.2d at 365; accord
Quintel Entm’t., Inc., 249 F.3d at 124-25 (actual control purpose not required to
trigger Section 13(d), but that section is intended “to alert the market to large
acquisitions that threaten potential shifts in corporate control” (internal quotation
marks omitted) (emphasis in original); see also Brief of the SEC, Amicus Curiae,
Morales v. Quintel Entm’t, Inc., at p. 20 (“There is no doubt that the purpose of
Section 13(d) is to require disclosure of information by persons who have acquired
20

a substantial interest, or increased their interest in equity securities of a company
by a substantial amount . . . so that investors might assess the potential for changes
in corporate control and adequately evaluate the company’s worth.” (internal
quotation marks omitted)). And the corresponding beneficial ownership rule
“prevent[s] a group of persons who seek to pool their voting or other interests . . .
from evading” Section 13(d)’s disclosure regime. Wellman, 682 F.2d at 366
(quoting S. Rep. No. 550, 90th Cong., 1st Sess. 8 (1967)).
Typical lock-up agreements between shareholders and underwriters have
nothing to do with potential control, long-term ownership, or evading disclosure
rules. Rather, they facilitate the offering process by “maintain[ing] an orderly
market” and preventing a rush of pre-IPO shares from “exerting substantial
downward pressure on the market price of the newly issued shares.” Westenberg,
Initial Public Offerings: A Practical Guide to Going Public § 18:12; see Jenkins,
Recirculation of a Preliminary Prospectus: Statutory & Basic Analytical
Techniques for Resolving Recirculation Issues, 55 BUS. L.J. at 171 n.163
(agreements “promote an orderly market for a new issue and to guard against
insider sales shortly after an offering”). Such agreements, like the ones here, are
also publicly disclosed. See Facebook Prospectus, Form 424 B4, pg. 163 (A-46);
Amend. No. 5 to Form S-1 Registration Statement, pg. A-1 to B-5) (A-73-82).

21

Further, as explained in greater detail below, because underwriters merely
act as short-term conduits for the distribution of securities, temporary lock-up
agreements between underwriters and shareholders do not lend themselves to the
type of abuse that Section 16 was designed to prevent. See infra at pp. 24-25.
Thus, the Commission believes that, standing alone, typical lock-up
agreements between shareholders and underwriters executed in connection with an
underwritten public offering are not sufficient to establish a group for purposes of
Section 13(d) or 16(b). That does not mean, however, that a lock-up agreement
will never itself establish or constitute supporting evidence of the establishment of
a group. Atypical language in the lock-up agreement, or other facts and
circumstances outside of the lock-up agreement, could demonstrate that the parties
to an agreement share a common purpose sufficient to establish a group. See, e.g.,
Brief of the SEC, Amicus Curiae, Morales v. Quintel Entm’t, Inc., at p. 27
(recognizing that lock-up agreements that “have the effect of making shares
unavailable for sale to those who might seek to compete for or to influence
corporate control” might form the basis for a group). Instead, as the Commission
previously explained, “whether a lock-up provision creates a Section 13(d) group
depends on the specific facts and circumstances of any given case.” Id. at 26.

22

II.

Section 16(b)’s Short-Swing Profit Rule Does Not Apply to Sales and
Purchases Made Pursuant to a Bona Fide Underwriting.
An underwriter is entitled to rely on the exemptions provided by Exchange

Act Rules 13d-3(d)(4) and 16a-7, even though the underwriter has obtained
material non-public information, so long as the underwriter’s purchases and sales
are made in connection with the underwriter’s participation in a bona fide
underwritten public offering.
As noted above, Rule 16a-7 (together with Rule 16a-10) exempt from
Section 16(b) liability any purchases and sales in connection with an offering
where “[t]he person effecting the transaction is engaged in the business of
distributing securities and is participating in good faith” in such a distribution and
the security is “purchased in good faith” as part of that business. Similarly, Rule
13d-3(d)(4) temporarily exempts from the beneficial ownership calculation
securities that an underwriter acquires “through his participation in good faith in a
firm commitment underwriting.”
Together, those rules provide that “an underwriter’s purchase and sale of
securities pursuant to an underwriting will be exempt from Section 16 in all but the
most unusual circumstances.” Peter J. Romeo and Alan L. Dye, Section 16
Treatise & Reporting Guide, § 7.14 (4th ed. 2012). When it proposed Rule 16a-7,
the Commission explained that such unusual circumstances do not include bona

23

fide—or good-faith—underwriting activity. Specifically, the proposing release
stated:
Distributions by underwriters and selling group dealers would be excluded
for reasons similar to those supporting exclusion of transactions by
liquidating agents. Underwriters and selling group dealers are conduits for
securities in a distribution and their ownership is generally brief. Although
they may have access to inside information in some cases, their market
activity generally is constrained by other rules. As long as they act in those
capacities, rather than as investors, there is no need for a [Section 16(a)]
report.
Proposing Release, 53 Fed. Reg. at 50004 (footnote omitted). The same standard
applies to transactions exempted from Section 16(b). See 17 C.F.R. 240.16a-10
(“[A]ny transaction exempted from . . . section 16(a) . . . shall be likewise exempt
from section 16(b).”); Hazen, 4 Treatise on the Law of Securities Regulation, §13.2
(Section 16(b)’s reach parallels Section 16(a)’s coverage). As the proposing
release indicates, an underwriter’s transactions are exempt from Section 16 liability
as long as the underwriter acts as a conduit—that is, as a bona fide underwriter—
rather than as an investor. Proposing Release, 53 Fed. Reg. at 50004. Further,
even when so exempt, as the release explains, an underwriter remains “constrained
by other rules,” id., meaning that an underwriter could simultaneously be exempt
from Section 16(b) and liable for violating other rules. By contrast, sham
transactions, where an underwriter is simply a disguised investor or engages in
purchases and sales for a purpose other than to conduct an orderly underwriting,
are not exempted. See id.
24

An underwriter’s access to material non-public information does not affect
eligibility for the Rule 16a-7 exemption. To the contrary, that rule is explicitly
framed as an exemption from a short-swing profit regime that would otherwise
apply to underwriters and other “insiders, who are presumed to possess material
information about the issuer.” Gwozdzinsky v. Zell/Chilmark Fund, L.P., 156 F.3d
305, 308 (2d Cir. 1998) (internal quotation marks and footnote omitted); accord
Foremost-McKesson, Inc., 423 U.S. at 243; see also Adopting Release, 56 Fed.
Reg. at 7244 (explaining that “Section 16, as applied to ten percent holders, is
intended to reach those persons who can be presumed to have access to inside
information”). The above-quoted proposing release also notes that the underwriter
exemption was being adopted even though underwriters “may have access to inside
information in some cases.” Proposing Release, 53 Fed. Reg. at 50004.
That judgment rests on the Commission’s assessment that, despite potential
access to inside information, an underwriter’s sales and purchases—including the
common practice of overselling an offering and engaging in permitted syndicate
covering transactions in the secondary market—“do not lend themselves to the
speculative abuse Section 16 was designed to prevent.” Amending Release, 61
Fed. Reg. at 30383; see also Romeo & Dye, Section 16 Treatise & Reporting
Guide, § 6.03 (an underwriter’s “involvement in the distribution of securities is
unlikely to be motivated by, or to present an opportunity for, speculative abuse”).
25

To the contrary, as discussed above, such activities are designed to “facilitate
public offerings.” Amending Release, 61 Fed. Reg. at 30383; see also Regulation
M Release, 69 Fed. Reg. 75774, 75779-80 (discussing common underwriting
practices designed to facilitate offerings). And consistent with that policy and
despite presumed access to inside information, Rule 16a-7 broadly “exempts an
underwriter’s transactions in the secondary market that are intended to stabilize the
market price in connection with a distribution.” Romeo & Dye, Section 16
Treatise & Reporting Guide, § 7.14.
The complaint here does not appear to allege that the underwriting itself was
a sham or that the Underwriters entered into it for a purpose other than the orderly
distribution of Facebook stock. Rather, the complaint essentially alleges that the
Underwriters may have violated the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and,
therefore, should be considered not to have been acting in good faith. See In re
Facebook, Inc., IPO Secs. & Derivative Litig., 986 F. Supp.2d at 547 (“Similar to
the consolidated complaint filed in the securities class action,” the complaint here
alleges that Facebook’s amended registration statement earnings disclosure “was
false and misleading[.]”). But that would disregard the fact that, “Congress . . . has
left some problems of the abuse of inside information to other remedies,” such as
“general antifraud statutes that proscribe fraudulent practices by insiders.”
Foremost-McKesson, Inc., 423 U.S. at 255; see also Perine v. William Norton &
26

Co., Inc., 509 F.2d 114, 120-21 (2d Cir. 1974) (noting that, “[o]ther provisions of
the securities laws provide adequate protection against the underwriter’s misuse of
information obtained as a result of the underwriting relationship itself.”). It would
likewise conflict with the language in the Rule 16a-7 proposing release, which
expresses an intent to exempt bona fide underwriting activities from Section 16
liability while leaving underwriters “constrained by” and potentially liable for
violations of “other rules.” Proposing Release, 53 Fed. Reg. at 50004.

27

CONCLUSION
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission urges the Court to conclude that:
(1) typical lock-up agreements entered into with underwriters in connection with
an offering are not sufficient, on their own, to establish a group for purposes of
Section 13(d) or Section 16(b); and (2) an underwriter is entitled to rely on the
exemptions provided by Exchange Act Rules 13d-3(d)(4) and 16a-7, even though
the underwriter has obtained material non-public information, so long as the
underwriter’s purchases and sales are made in connection with the underwriter’s
participation in a bona fide underwritten public offering.
