ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3622/February 18, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17070
In the Matter of
3C ADVISORS & ASSOCIATES, INC.,
STEPHEN JONES, AND
DAVID PROLMAN

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On January 27, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A hearing is currently scheduled for March 7, 2016.
On February 17, the Division of Enforcement, 3C Advisors & Associates, Inc., and
Stephen Jones filed a proposed protective order as well as a joint request to postpone the hearing
and schedule a prehearing conference. In their joint request, the parties stipulated that 3C
Advisors and Jones were served with the OIP by February 10, 2016, and that their answers are
due March 1, 2016. Although tracking information available from the Office of the Secretary
appears to indicate that David Prolman was served with the OIP by U.S. Postal Service certified
mail on February 2, 2016, the joint request states that the Division has been unable to confirm
service on Prolman.
The joint request is GRANTED. The hearing is POSTPONED and a telephonic
prehearing conference will be held on March 7, 2016, at 1:30 p.m. EST. At the conference, the
parties should be prepared to discuss the proposed protective order as well as each numbered
item in Rule of Practice 221(c), 17 C.F.R. § 201.221(c), and proposed dates by which those items
will be accomplished, where applicable. Unless 3C Advisors and Jones indicate otherwise,
I construe their consent to the hearing date’s postponement as a waiver of their right to a hearing
within thirty to sixty days of service of the OIP. See 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(b); OIP at 6. The
Division is ORDERED to file a declaration providing an update on the status of service as to
Prolman by March 2, 2016. Counsel for 3C Advisors and Jones is ORDERED to file a notice of
appearance by March 4, 2016. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(d)(2).
