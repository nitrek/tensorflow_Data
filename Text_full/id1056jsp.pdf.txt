INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
AS TO TWO RESPONDENTS

APPEARANCE:

Kevin P. O’Rourke, Beth Groves, and Patricia Jo for the Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of the registered securities of Respondents
Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., and Powder River Coal Corp. (the Two Respondents) due to their
failure to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission.1
INTRODUCTION
On August 9, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP
alleges that the Two Respondents have securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g), have repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the
Commission, and failed to timely report the termination of the auditor-client relationship in
violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13. The Two
1

Respondents Chang-On International, Inc., and Computer Graphics International Inc., have not
yet been served. See Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 4100,
2016 SEC LEXIS 3088, at *1 n.1 (ALJ Aug. 29, 2016). The proceeding has ended as to
Respondent Legal Life Plans, Inc. Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., Exchange Act Release No
78810, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3398 (Sept. 12, 2016). The proceeding is stayed as to Respondent
John D. Oil and Gas Company. Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release
No. 4133, 2016 SEC LEXIS 3360 (ALJ Sept. 7, 2016).

Respondents were served with the OIP by August 11 and their answers were due by August 24,
2016. Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., 2016 SEC LEXIS 3088. When the Two Respondents
failed to file answers, I ordered them to show cause by September 8, 2016, why the registrations
of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failure to file answers or
otherwise defend the proceeding. Id. To date, the Two Respondents have not filed answers,
responded to the show cause order, or otherwise defended this proceeding.
FINDINGS OF FACT
The Two Respondents are in default for failing to file answers or otherwise defend the
proceeding. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, I find the following
allegations in the OIP to be true. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a).
Capitol City Bancshares, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1070295, is a Georgia
corporation located in Atlanta, Georgia, with a class of securities registered with the Commission
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company failed to timely report the termination of
the auditor-client relationship, as required by Item 304 of Regulation S-K, and is delinquent in its
periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form
10-Q for the period ended March 31, 2014. As of May 31, 2016, the company’s common stock
(symbol “CPTY”) was traded on the over-the-counter markets.
Powder River Coal Corp., CIK No. 1499197, is a Florida corporation located in Casper,
Wyoming, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). The company failed to timely report the termination of the auditor-client
relationship, as required by Item 304 of Regulation S-K, and is delinquent in its periodic filings
with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the
period ended September 30, 2013. As of May 31, 2016, the company’s common stock (symbol
“POWD”) was traded on the over-the-counter markets.
In addition to their repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, the Two Respondents
failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation
Finance requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations or, through their failure to
maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not
receive such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers of
securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports, Rule 13a-11 requires issuers to file current reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires
domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-11, .13a-13. Item
304 of Regulation S-K requires issuers to report the termination of the auditor-client relationship.
17 C.F.R. § 229.304. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be subject
to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release No.
55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act Release
2

No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules thereunder. See SEC v. McNulty, 137
F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). The
Two Respondents failed to file timely current and periodic reports and as a result violated
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1, 13a-11, and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
The Two Respondents’ failure to file required periodic reports is serious because the
failure constitutes a violation of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of
periodic reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about
an issuer so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *26. The seriousness of these violations is underscored by the fact
that the Two Respondents failed to report the termination of the auditor-client relationship.
The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned for the
protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the sale of
securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). The Two
Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that they repeatedly failed to file periodic reports.
See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at
*20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS
1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008). The Two Respondents are also culpable because they failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance, and were therefore
on notice, even before the OIP issued, of their obligations to file periodic reports. See ChinaBiotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4,
2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted even without proof that a respondent was aware
of its reporting obligations). Finally, the Two Respondents have not answered the OIP,
responded to the show cause order, or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address
whether they have made any efforts to remedy their past violations. They have also made no
assurances against further violations.
For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke
the registrations of each class of the Two Respondents’ registered securities.

ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of Respondents Capitol City Bancshares,
Inc., and Powder River Coal Corp. are REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Commission Rule of Practice 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of
the initial decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the initial decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct
a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a
petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a
manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
