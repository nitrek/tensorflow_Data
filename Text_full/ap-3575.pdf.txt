In the Matter of
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
WAYNE L. PALMER

On January 6, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. On January 21, 2016, I postponed the hearing in this matter and scheduled a prehearing
conference for February 9, 2016. Wayne L. Palmer, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3526,
2016 LEXIS 212.
On February 1, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondent was served with the OIP on January 11, 2016. Accordingly,
Respondent’s answer was due by February 3, 2016. OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160, .220(b). To
date, Respondent has not filed an answer.
Therefore, I ORDER that by February 15, 2016, Respondent shall SHOW CAUSE why
this proceeding should not be determined against him due to his failure to file an answer or
otherwise defend this proceeding. If Respondent fails to respond to this order, he shall be
deemed in default and the proceeding will be determined against him. See OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
All filings shall be made with the Commission’s Office of the Secretary, pursuant to
Rules of Practice 151 and 152. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.151, .152. In addition to the required filing
with the Office of the Secretary, electronic courtesy copies of filings should be emailed to
alj@sec.gov in both PDF text-searchable format and, when possible, Microsoft Word format.
