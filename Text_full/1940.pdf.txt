SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECURITIES AND
EXCHANGE COMMISSION
WASHINGTON,

D. C.

INTRODUCTION
When the Securities and Exchange Commission was organized in
July of 1934, it was charged with administering two Acts, namely, the
Securities Act of 1933, which had previously been administered by
the Federal Trade Commission, and the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.
During the six years which have followed, the scope of the Commission's work has expanded substantially.
At the present time the
Commission administers six separate Acts, and has certain duties to
perform under another Act.1 Legislation adopted since the organization of the Commission provides for regulation or supervision of public
utility holding company systems, trust indentures, investment trusts,
and investment advisers, and permits the Commission to participate
in corporate reorganizations by preparing advisory reports on plans of
reorganization for the courts and investors. In addition to this legislation, the two original Acts under the jurisdiction of the Commission
have been amended on several occasions."
The laws administered by the Commission represent a comprehensive program for regulation and supervision of the Nation's
securities markets. The legislation establishes substantial safeguards
for the investor by protecting him against fraud and requiring disclosure of essential financial data, and safeguards the general public
from the results of undue speculation and other unhealthy financial
conditions.
While in this report, as in previous reports, it is necessary to review
the details of the Commission's work in terms of accomplishments in
the administration of each separate Act, the comprehensive pattern
which the legislation assigned to the Commission presents in its
entirety, and the inter-dependence of the Acts, must not be overlooked.
For this reason it may be well to review briefly at this time the
general scope and character of the Commission's work.
• SecurIties Act 011933; SecurIties Exchange Act of 1934;Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
Chapter X, National BankruptcY Act; Trust Indenture Act of 1939;Investment Company Act of 1940;
Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Administratively, the Maloney Act is considered as an amendment to
the Securities Exchange Act 011934• The SecurIties Act of 1933-amendments approved lune 6, 1934,August 9, 1935, and August 22, 1940.
Securities Exchange Act or lll34-amendments approved May Zl, 1936,and lune 25, 1938.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, corporations which
sell new security issues publicly are required to file with the Commission full and complete information concerning the nature of their
business, their financial condition, and the uses to which the proceeds
from the sale of the securities are to be put. The Commission cannot prevent the sale of any security effectively registered with it as
long as there is adequate disclosure of all material facts.
In the case of security issues offered by public utility holding companies or their _subsidiaries, the Commission's powers are more
substantial. Due to the necessity of providing machinery for eliminating the serious abuses which developed in the public utility holding
company field, Congress passed the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935. Under this Act the Commission may require that the
securities be reasonably adapted to the security structure of the company and to the earning power of the issuer; that the financing be
appropriate to the economical and efficient operation of the business;
that fees, commissions, and other remuneration paid in connection
with the sale of the securities be reasonable and competitive conditions maintained; and that the terms of the sale be not detrimental
to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.
In addition to this supervision of new security issues, the Commission
is given power under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to regulate
certain transactions in outstanding securities in order that the interests
of investors be protected and the conduct of those who deal in such
securities be fair, equitable, and free from fraud. Many securities
are listed on stock exchanges. The Commission has power to require
that complete and current information concerning the companies
whose securities are so traded be kept on file with the Commission and
available for public inspection. Furthermore, the Commission supervises the trading activities of brokers and dealers who transact their
business across the stock exchanges in order to prevent manipulation
of market prices and misrepresentation.
The stock exchanges themselves must also register with the Commission and various rules and
regulations governing the activities of member firms and their partners
have been worked out in cooperation with the exchanges to give added
protection for investors.
With respect to securities which are traded in the over-the-counter
markets, i, e., not on stock exchanges, no filing of information concerning the financial condition and business of the issuers is generally
required under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under authority
contained in the Maloney Act, an amendment to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, however, an organization consisting of over
3,000 brokers and dealers who trade in the over-the-counter markets
has been formed. This organization, which is known as the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., has established machinery

SIXTH

designed to supervise and discipline its own members and has promulgated rules for fair conduct. The Commission exercises a general
supervision over the activities of the association. In addition, the
Commission supervises over-the-counter brokers and dealers through
a simple registration system .
.Aspart of its general program, the Commission has supervision over
the type of proxies sent to security-holders by utilities and by corporations with securities listed on stock exchanges and its regulations
in this connection are designed to assure full disclosure and to assist
in giving scattered investors a genuine opportunity to participate in
the affairs of their companies. The Commission also requires reports
which reflect trading by members of stock exchanges and partners of
member firms for their own account and obtains reports of security
trading from large stockholders and officers of corporations whose
securities are listed on stock exchanges in order that the market
activities of "insiders" may be known to the general public at all times.
The Commission's powers with respect to new security issues in the
field of public utility companies has already been indicated. In addition, the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 are designed to eliminate improper security transactions by
holding companies and their subsidiaries, to make certain that their
acquisitions of securities and utility assets are in the public interest,
and that dividend practices, the form of proxies issued, inter-company
loans, and service, sales, and construction contracts are supervised.
The basic purpose of this utility legislation is to eliminate or simplify
uneconomic holding company structures and to return the operating
companies to local control. The Commission's approval of the
reorganization plan is required for all utility holding companies
reorganized.
Under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy .Act, the Commission participates in certain types of reorganization proceedings and provides independent expert assistance on matters arising in such proceedings. It
is empowered to prepare for the benefit of the court and investors
advisory reports on such plans of reorganization. It also is influential
in making certain that various procedural and technical steps in the
reorganization designed to protect investors are closely adhered to.
Closely related to its work in the reorganization field is the Commission's regulation of trust indentures through which it may act to
protect investors from losses resulting from unfair or loosely drawn
indentures and to assure appointment of truly independent trustees
under such indentures.
Practically all of the regulatory powers and duties outlined above
are made effective through criminal, civil, or administrative sanctions.
No criminal prosecutions can be instituted by the Commission itself,
but the statutes provide that the Commission may transmit evidence

4

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of criminal acts to the Attorney General who may, in his discretion,
institute the necessary criminal proceedings. Civil remedies for
enforcement of the statutes are vigorously sought by the Commission
by means of suits for injunction instituted in the United States district
courts, in which the Commission itself participates as plaintiff.
Administrative sanctions are exercised by means of final orders of the
Commission, entered only after appropriate notice and opportunity
for formal hearing, appealable under each of the statutes to the proper
United States circuit court of appeals or to the Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia,"
As an aid to its regulatory and administrative functions, the Commission is empowered under many provisions of the statutes to promulgate general rules and regulations. These are both implementing
and interpretative in character and include: (a) regulatory rules
-
which impose duties and obligations upon classes of persons or classes
of transactions; (b) exemption rules which relieve classes of persons
or classes of transactions from duties and obligations; (c) procedural
rules which set out procedural steps to be taken by persons outside
the Commission and by the Commission itself or its employees; and
(d) rules defining technical, trade, and accounting terms used in the
statutes or in the rules and regulations issued thereunder. From the
earliest days of the Commission, its policy has been to seek and to
give careful consideration to the suggestions and advice of persons
outside the Commission as to the form and content of proposed rules
and regulations. With few exceptions, the regulatory and procedural
rules and rules of definition that have been promulgated have first
been submitted to expert representative groups and individual concerns affected by or directly interested in the subject matter thereof,
and have been extensively amended and modified in the light of the
suggestions and advice received. Exemption rules have usually been
submitted to smaller groups, since fewer persons have a legitimate
interest in them. It is the firm conviction of the Commission that
this policy of consultation with informed members of industry and
the public, in the formulation of ru1es and regulations, is an essential
feature of sound administration-a
feature that has gone far toward
placing regulation on a basis of cooperation between the regulator
and the regulated. The consultative process operates through
personal conferences in different parts of the country and through
correspondence over a course of weeks and, in some instances, many
months. It provides an informal hearing which, in the Commission's
opinion, is best adapted to bring about the constructive and thorough

consideration required for the formulation of technical and often
complex regulations.
During the fiscal year the Commission took several significant
steps to perfect the administration of the various Acts under its
jurisdiction. Ingeneral, these efforts were directed toward a simplification of the Commission's procedure, forms, and regulations. In
order to expedite the handling of applications and declarations
involving financial transactions under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935, for example, the Commission adopted a new
procedure which made formal hearings and findings of fact unnecessary
on the majority of such applications and declarations, there being no
controversy of any kind involved.' Substantial savings of time and
expense have resulted for the utility industry. Hereafter, formal
administrative hearings on such transactions will be necessary only
where a hearing is requested or where, from a review of the application
or declaration by the staff, it is apparent that substantial difficulties
are presented.
The Commission also took the first public move in a program to
regionalize the handling of registration statements filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 and supplemental material to these registration
statements required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. To
date, the activities of the regional offices have been confined almost
entirely to enforcement work. Experience with Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act has demonstrated the practicality of using the facilities of the regional offices to a wider extent. Business men, investment bankers, and others who are in daily contact with the Commission's work have encouraged such a development and have even
urged that the Commission provide facilities in its regional offices for
the filing of registration statements and other forms. Many technical
matters are involved and the Commission must move cautiously for
any regionalization of its activities. In order to get practical experience in this field, it was decided to set up a special unit in the Commission's San Francisco Regional Office to determine to what extent
the handling of registration statements and similar material could
be regionalized. The San Francisco unit was set up and staffed to
give both legal and accounting assistance to persons registering
securities or filing supplemental material under the Acts indicated.
The success of this experiment has been such that the Commission now
anticipates that during the next fiscal year it will greatly expand its experimentations in this field and th8;t it will authorize registration
statements and supplemental material to be filed in at least two of its
regional officeson a trial basis. As a result of this additional emphasis
upon the activities of the regional offices, the annual report for this
, Commissioner Healy dissented !rom the adoption ofthis new procedure.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

fiscal year contains for the first time a special section on the work of
such offices.
During the fiscal year the Commission gave particular emphasis
to the administration of the integration and corporate simplification
provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. Mter
elaborate negotiations with the industry in an effort to encourage the
filing of voluntary plans for integration and simplification proved unsuccessful, the Commission issued orders instituting formal proceedings
in order to carry out the purposes of the Act in these respects. Integration proceedings were commenced with respect to nine major
utility systems which comprised, roughly, 58 percent of the total consolidated assets of all systems registered under the Act. Simplification proceedings were also commenced in three instances. As a result
of these orders, definite progress has been made toward integration and
simplification. Furthermore, in the day to day handling of applications and other matters arising in connection with the Act, simplification has been encouraged in every possible way and the several
major systems have taken steps, such as the elimination of intermediate holding companies and the regrouping or sale of properties, which
have definitely advanced the broad program contemplated by Congress
in the enactment of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
During the year the program for the regulation of the over-thecounter markets envisioned by the Maloney Act became an actuality,
with the effective registration, following a hearing before the Commission, of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., on
July 20, 1939. The Commission is in constant contact with the
association's representatives, and there is a continual interchange of
information and ideas to the end that the association will operate with
maximum efficiency in accomplishing the purposes of the Maloney
Act. The Commission has great hopes that the membership of the
association will expand until eventually it includes all important
brokers and dealers operating in the over-the-counter markets.
The soundness of market prices for securities traded on national
securities exchanges which had been established while these exchanges
were under the Commission's supervision met a severe test when the
German war machine invaded the Lowlands. This startling event
and subsequent activities on the European scene were certain to influence American securities markets. The Commission was alert to
prevent any serious dislocation of normal trading activities and, if
necessary, was ready to recommend the closing of the exchanges
should trading show signs of panic. Fortunately, no drastic steps
were required. Securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange
and other exchanges responded with little extreme fluctuation in
price, and no trading was characterized by abnormal thinness or
unhealthy spreads between the prices buyers were willing to pay

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

7

and the prices for which sellers were willing to sell. The comparative absence of manipulative activities and the virtual elimination
of pools undoubtedly contributed to this wholesome result. In
the general field of the administration of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the Commission tightened its regulatory program by the
revision and modification of various rules and regulations, and of
course continued its vigilant scrutiny of trading activities. In its
relations with the N ew York Stock Exchange, the Commission pursued
its policy of cooperative regulation and continued to urge upon the
exchanges the adoption of rules and regulations which have been
under discussion since the Richard Whitney case and are designed to
give greater protection to customers of member firms.
In the field of enforcement the Commission obtained indictments
against 232 individuals and corporations and injunctions against 118
individuals and corporations. One of the most striking criminal
prosecutions resulted from the Commission's investigations, under
Section 12 (h) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
into the political activities of certain officials of the Union Electric
Company of Missouri, a registered holding company. Three former
officials of that company were indicted for perjury in connection with
the Commission's investigation. Two of those indicted pleaded
guilty, while the third stood trial and was convicted. Evidence
developed by the Commission's investigators and presented during
the perjury trial showed that over a period of years the Union Electric
Company had made political contributions from a slush fund of over
a half a million dollars built up from kick-backs or rebates received
from attorneys and contractors, cash refunds on insurance policies,
and padded expense accounts of certain employees.
Another striking enforcement activity was the Commission's work
undertaken in cooperation with the Post Officeauthorities and directed
toward the elimination of the "front money" or "advanced fee"
racket. From time to time information had come to the Commission
indicating that unscrupulous operators had been obtaining money on
false pretenses from a wide variety of small business on the representation that they were qualified to successfully float securities for such
businesses. The investigation disclosed that over the past six years
hundreds of small concerns had been induced to pay money to these
"front money" operators, aggregating hundreds of thousands of dollars,
on the representation that the operators would be able to sell securities
for them. The investigation also showed, however, that there was
not a single instance where the operators had actually sold shares of
stock for the businesses victimized. The Commission's investigations
resulted in 13 indictments on which several convictions have already
been obtained.

8

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Commission also conducted several special studies during the
fiscal year which have contributed to a better understanding of
financial problems and aided in the protection of investors. Further
reports were submitted to the Congress on the study of investment
trusts and investment companies conducted under express authority
contained in the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. These
and previous reports led to the unanimous enactment by both houses
of Congress of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, which were signed by President Roosevelt
on August 22, 1940. In addition, hearings held on special studies of
legal reserve life insurance companies and investment banking activities, undertaken in cooperation with the Temporary National Economic Committee pursuant to Public Resolution No. 113 of the 75th
Congress, were completed and the special unit set up to carry out this
work was discontinued. Testimony in the accounting study of the
McKesson & Robbins matter was published during the fiscal year and
in December of 1940 the Commission's report on its findings was
released. During the year convictions of several defendants were
obtained in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York for violations of the mail fraud statute disclosed as a
result of the inquest into the McKesson matter which the Commission
made in cooperation with other authorities.
Significant statistics concerning the work of the Commission and
its activities during the fiscal year are set forth on the opposite page.
On July 3, 1940, Commissioner Jerome N. Frank was reelected
Chairman of the Commission for the period ending June 30, 1941.
Commissioner Edward C. Eicher, of Iowa, was reappointed Commissioner on June 11, 1940, for the term ending June 5, 1945. Commissioner Eicher was originally appointed Commissioner on December
1, 1939, for the term ended June 5, 1940.
Sumner T. Pike, of Maine, was appointed Commissioner on June 1,
1940, for the term ending June 5, 1943, vice George C. Mathews, who
resigned as Commissioner on April 15, 1940.
On May 31, 1940, the S. E. C. Monopoly Study Division was dissolved; and the Investment Trust Study Division was abolished on
June 30, 1940.

Part I
THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 deals with holding companies having subsidiaries which are electric utility companies
or which are engaged in the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The Act was passed for the express purpose of eliminating certain evils and abuses which the Congress had found to exist
in connection with the activities of such companies, and was intended for the protection of both investors and consumers. It provides for the registration of holding companies; elimination of uneconomic holding company structures; supervision of security transactions of holding companies and their subsidiaries; supervision of
acquisitions of securities and utility assets by holding companies
and their subsidiaries; and the supervision of payment of dividends,
solicitation of proxies, inter-company loans, and service, sales, and
construction contracts.
The Commission must pass upon plans for
the reorganization of registered holding companies or their subsidiaries, and must require the geographic and corporate simplification
of public utility holding company systems. The Commission does
not have the power to regulate public utility rates.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITffiS

Pursuant to the provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, there were registered with the Commission as of June 30,
1940, 144 public utility holding companies, the total consolidated
assets of which amount to nearly 14~ billions of dollars. These 144
registered holding companies 1 constitute 55 public utility holding
company systems, which include 1493 holding, subholding, and operating companies.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission concentrated on the
administration of the integration and simplification provisions of the
Act. Efforts to encourage the filing of voluntary plans for compliance with these provisions were unsuccessful, and the Commission
found it necessary to begin formal proceedings in order to carry out
the administration of the law. Integration proceedings were launched
with respect to nine major utility systems, comprising, roughly, 58
percent of the total consolidated assets of all the systems registered
under the Act. Simplification proceedings were begun in three
instances.

Appendix VII, page 329,contains a complete list of the registered public utility holding companies, as of

lune

12

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Several of the holding companies requested a tentative outline of
the Commission's views as to what steps would be necessary in order
to comply with the integration requirements set forth in the Act.
These views were in the process of preparation at the end of the fiscal
year. Several others took a contrary position. Other cases were
delayed by petitions for additional time to prepare evidence or by
motions for dismissal. Such motions were denied. Despite the delays resulting from these motions and petitions, the Commission feels
that definite progress has been made in carrying out the integration
and simplification provisions of the statute.
Every effort is being
made to expedite the proceedings.
Of particular importance to the industry and to the Commission
were steps taken during the year to save time and expense in the
handling of declarations and applications involving financial transactions. This was accomplished through the adoption by the Commission of a new procedure making hearings and findings unnecessary on
the majority of such applications and declarations filed under the Act
except in cases where substantial difficulties are presented."
Three former officials of the Union Electric Company were indicted
for having testified falsely before an officer of the Commission, in connection with the Commission's inquiry into business practices and the
financial condition of Union Electric and certain associated companies.
Two of those indicted pleaded guilty, while the third stood trial and
was convicted. Evidence developed by the Commission's investigators and produced during the trial tended to show that over a period
of years the company had built up a cash fund of more than half a
million dollars by means of "kick-backs" or rebates from attorneys and
contractors, cash refunds on insurance policies, and fictitious or
"padded" expense accounts of employees. Following the disclosures
at the trial the matter was referred to the Department of Justice.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the Department of Justice
announced the institution of a grand jury proceeding to investigate
information that these companies had violated Federal statutes in making political contributions from this cash fund.
The Commission continued its scrutiny of the financial structure of
utility companies floating new issues of securities in its endeavor to
insure the development of sound capital structures based upon a substantial amount of common stock equity. Wherever the existence of
special conditions precluded the raising of new capital through the sale
of common stock, the Commission insisted that the issuers of senior
securities include provisions designed to increase the protective fea• Commissioner Healy opposed this procedure on both legal and policy grounds. He proposed an alternative procedure which he argued would be equally saving of time and expense and more closely related to
good procedure. His views and those of a majority of the CommissIoners to the contrary are set forth In
detallin public memoranda dated April 1 and lune 24, 1940.respectively.

tures of the securities and the amount of common stock equity or
cushion.
The Commission gave increased attention to the adequacy of annual
charges for depreciation, since that question is so closely allied to the
problem of improving the capital structures of public utility holding
companies and their subsidiaries. In the furtherance of this work,
analyses are being made of the depreciation policies of all public utility
companies subject to the Act.
The problem of maintaining arm's-length bargaining and competitive conditions in the underwriting and distribution of public utility
securities was re-examined during the year. In existence was a rule
designed to control the payment of fees to underwriters and "finders"
who may be in a position, by reason of stock ownership or other relationship, to gain an unfair advantage in bargaining. By the terms of
the rule no fee can be paid, except on the basis of competitive bidding,
to underwriters and finders found to be within the scope of the rule,
unless justification is clear or unless such underwriter merely has a
participation of not more than 5 percent and the fee is the same as that
paid to nonaffiliated underwriters. Alternative techniques, including
some form of competitive bidding, are now under consideration in an
endeavor to establish a procedure less burdensome to issuers and underwriters and more effective from the Commission's standpoint in enforcing the requirements of the Act.
The filing of forms was simplified during the year by the adoption
of a single form to replace five outstanding ones for applications and
declarations.
SIMPLIFICATION OF HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS UNDER SECTION
11 OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935

Section 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company of 1935 relates
to the geographical and corporate simplification of holding company
systems. Specifically, Section 11 (b) (1) directs the Commission to
require that action be taken to limit the operations of each holding
company system to a single integrated system as defined in the Act,
together with such incidental businesses and additional systems as
may be retained within specified limitations. Section 11 (b) (2)
directs the Commission to require registered holding companies and
their subsidiaries to take such steps as are necessary to remove
needless complications from corporate structures and to distribute
voting power fairly and equitably among security holders.
The Commission is authorized to approve voluntary simplification
plans submitted by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, provided that the plans meet the geographical and corporate
simplification requirements set forth in the Act.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Commission commenced proceedings under Section 11 (b) (1)
early in 1940 by the institution of proceedings with respect to nine
major public utility holding company systems with aggregate consolidated assets of approximately $8,359,519,000, or about 58 percent
of the total consolidated assets of all the systems registered under
the Act. None of the public hearings in connection with these proceedings had been concluded at the end of the :fiscal year. The
systems involved in these proceedings may be briefly described as

The United Lighi and Power Oompany.12-The United Light and
Power Company controls 25 utility subsidiaries, which operate electric
facilities in 11 States and gas facilities in 12 States, and 20 non-utility
subsidiaries. Its consolidated assets as of December 31, 1939, aggregated approximately $586,787,000 and the total consolidated
operating revenues of its system for the year 1939 aggregated approximately $91,141,700. Its principal offices are located in Chicago,
Illinois.
In the case of certain other large systems, action did not appear
appropriate at the time the foregoing proceedings were commenced.
For example, Associated Gas and Electric Oompany is the subject of
reorganization proceedings pending in the District Court of the
United States for the Southern District of New York, which proceedings are more fully described elsewhere in this report. Oolumbia Gas
&; Electric Oorporation, another large holding company system, had
filed a voluntary plan under Section 11 (e) which, among other things,
included a request for an over-all finding that certain of its properties
met the requirements of Section 11 (b) and which was pending before
the Commission as of the end of the fiscal year. Shortly thereafter,
reargument was scheduled on the question whether, in view of the
exclusion of certain companies and the pending litigation under the
antitrust acts, the Commission may properly consider the merits of
that portion of the application which seeks a determination that the
system (less the excepted companies) conforms to the standards of
Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act.
In addition to the foregoing cases looking to the enforcement of
Section 11 (b) (1), the Commission has instituted proceedings pursuant to Section 11 (b) (2) with respect to International HydroElectric System," Standard Power & Light Corporation," and Electric
Bond and Share Company."

During the fiscal year the Commission gave consideration to several
voluntary proceedings submitted by registered holding companies
under the provisions of Section 11 (e). Of these cases, particular
mention should be made of the following:
Oommunity Power and Light Oompany.-fu August 1939, Community Power and Light Company, a registered holding company, filed an
application under Section 11 (e) for approval of a plan to simplify its
corporate structure and to redistribute its voting power in conformity
with Section 11 (b) (2) of the Act. At that time, dividend arrearages
on the company's preferred stock had accumulated to the extent of
$46 per share. The company's corporate structure was complicated
by these arrearages and by certain obligations redeemable only after
payment of such arrearages. The preferred stock, despite the arrearages, had only 68,962 votes, while 10,000 shares of common stock
had 250,000 votes. Under the plan, preferred dividend arrearages
were eliminated and one class of stock, with one vote per share, was
authorized. Approximately 95 percent of the new stock went to the
old preferred stockholders and the remainder to the old common
stockholders.
The Commission gave notice of and held a hearing on the proposed
plan. On the basis of the record, the Commission issued its findings
and opinion finding the plan to be fair and equitable and necessary
to effectuate the provisions of Section 11 (b) (2).16 Thereafter, the
plan, in accordance with its terms, was submitted to the company's
stockholders and received the approval of more than two-thirds of
the preferred stock and of more than a majority of the common stock.
Community Power and Light Company, pursuant to the provisions
of Section 11 (e), requested the Commission to apply to a Federal
court to enforce and carry out its terms. This request was the :first
one made by a registered holding company for such enforcement.
The Commission granted the request and made application for such
approval to the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York. After hearings on the plan, and after considering and
sustaining the constitutionality of the applicable provisions of Section
11, the court found the plan to be fair and equitable and appropriate
to effectuate Section 11, and entered a decree enforcing its terms.'?
American Gas and Electric Oompany.-During the latter part of
1939, hearings were commenced on an application filed by American
Gas and Electric Company under Section 11 (e) for approval of a
simplification plan p~uant
to Sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2).

ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSALS OF SECURITIES, UTILITY ASSETS,
AND OTHER INTERESTS

During the past fiscal year, holding company systems subject
to the Act have continued to effect a gradual corporate and geographical simplification of their utility properties through the acquisition or
disposal of securities, utility assets, and other interests under the
supervision of the Commission. In passing on acquisitions, the Commission is guided by the standards set forth in Section 10 which, among
other matters, are designed to prevent undesirable corporate complexities and uneconomic and inefficient development of utility systems.
Thus, the Commission may not approve an acquisition unless it finds
that the transaction will serve the public interest by tending toward the
economical and efficient development of an integrated public utility
system. The Commission must also deny an application if it will tend
toward interlocking relations or the concentration of control of public
utility companies in a manner detrimental to the public interest or the
interest of investors or consumers if the consideration to be paid is
not reasonable; if the acquisition will unduly complicate the capital
structure of the system; or if it will otherwise be detrimental to the
public interest or the interest of investors or consumers or the proper
functioning of the system.
Among the types of transactions which may result in geographical
simplification is the sale of utility assets to operating companies having
the same or a contiguous service area. Corporate simplification may
be accomplished, among other ways, by the elimination of intermediate holding companies and the elimination of subsidiaries by the
sale of securities to associate companies or to interests outside the
particular holding company system.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

19

Many examples may be cited to illustrate this gradual regrouping
of utility properties in conformity with the integration and corporate
simplification principles of the Act.
The Electric Bond and Share System eliminated an intermediate
holding company, Lehigh Power Securities Oorporation, which had total
investments and advances of $103,338,000.18 The securities of Owego
Gas Oorporation (Associated Gas and Electric System) were sold to an
associate company, New York State Electric &: Gas Oorporation, for the
purpose of merger," and East Tennessee Light &: Power Oompany
(Oities Service Power &: Light System) filed a plan of reorganization to
result in a merger of three companies.P'
In a number of cases an associate company acquired the assets
of associate companies. Milwaukee Gas Light Company acquired the
assets of four associate gas utility companies, the four associate companies to be dissolved," and Ebasco Services Incorporated (Electric
Bond and Share System) acquired all the assets of a wholly-owned
subsidiary service company.P
The Kentucky
Utilities Oompany
(Middle West System) acquired the utility assets of its subsidiary,
Lexington Utilities Oompany, the service areas of which were contiguous
and interconnected."
The scattered and disconnected electric utility
properties of Traction Light and Power Oompany (Midland United
System) were acquired by Central Indiana Power Oompany and Public
Service Oompany of Indiana, associate companies."
In two cases subsidiaries were eliminated by the sale of the voting
securities to the public. Washington and Suburban Oompanies sold
the voting securities of Washington Gas Light Oompany to the public 25
and the voting stock of Indianapolis Power &: Light Oompany (Utilities
Power &: Light System) was sold to the public for $17,156,040.26
Prior to the sale to the public, Washington Gas Light Oompany acquired
substantially all the outstanding securities of two associate companies,
Alexandria Gas Oompany and Washington Suburban Gas Oompany.ZT
A number of subsidiary companies were sold to nonregistered
systems. Oonsolidated Electric and Gas Oompany sold all the securities
of two of its utility subsidiaries to nonaffiliated interests having no
present relations with other public utility companies 28 and Oentral
U. S. Utilities Oompany (Associated Gas and Electric System) sold its
subsidiary, Sioux Falls Gas Oompany, to a nonaffiliated operating

REORGANIZATION OF REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANIES

During the past fiscal year, the Commission passed on the plans
for the reorganization of the following companies: Utilities Power &:
Light OorporaJ,ion/7 National Public Utdinee OorporaJ,ion,48Inland
Power &: Light Oorporaiion and Oommonwealth Light &: Power Oompany,49 Oommunity Power and Light Oompany,50 and East Tennessee
Light &: Power Oompany.51
The plan of reorganization of Utilities Power &: Light Oorporation
(now the Ogden Oorporation), referred to in the Commission's Fifth
Annual Report, has been consummated following approval by the
Commission and confirmation by the United States District Court for
the Northern District of lllinois. The plan set forth a program for
conversion into an investment company through the disposal of
assets. In accordance with this program the corporation's investments in two of the utility subsidiaries, Indianapolis Power &: Light
Oompany and Newport Electric Oorporation, have been disposed of
already." Although the proceeding instituted by the Commission
under Section 11 (b) (1), referred to in the above-mentioned annual
report, is still pending, the progress made through voluntary compliance justifies the expectation that it will be unnecessary for such
proceeding to be pressed.
The National Public Utilities Oorporation reorganization 53 concerned an insolvent company with nominal income which had been
in reorganization since 1933. The plan as approved by the Commission provides for the distribution of only one class of securities,
common stock, which will be distributed to bondholders and other
creditors. The bondholders and other creditors will also receive
voting trust certificates of a subsidiary company, Great Lakes Utilities

The Commission denied as not feasible a plan of reorganization for
The OommonwealthPower &: Light Oorporation and its subsidiary Inland
Power &: Light Oorporation. The plan provided for the formation of
a new company and the liquidation of the properties within two years
and, in the event of failure to liquidate within that time, provided for
the appointment of a trustee.
The Commission noted the temporary
character of the new company and stated that it was unable to see
why the liquidation couId not be accomplished as effectively by the
present trustees as by a board of directors or by a new and perhaps
strange trustee 2 years hence."

amount, compared with $1,104,574,000 for the preceding year. This
brought the total of new securities issued since the effective date of
the Act, December 1, 1935, to $2,885,932,502. Fifty-one filings,
aggregating $274,200,818, were pending at the end of the year. These
figures do not include outstanding issues whose rights were altered
under Sections 6 (a) (2) and 7 (e), nor do they include the guarantee
of other issues.
The past year's effective filings, some of which covered more than
one security issue, consisted of the following:
49 mortgage bond issues aggregating $618,030,800
8 debenture issues aggregating $104,550,000
52 note issues aggregating $104,043,135
11 preferred stock issues aggregating $126,581,109
33 common stock issues aggregating $48,846,007
Mortgage and debenture bonds, most of which were refunding
issues, have represented 62.9 percent of all financing under the Act,
while notes, 13.3 percent i preferred stock, 12.5 percent; and common
stock, 11.3 percent, make up the remainder.
The recent flotation of $95,000,000 of 3~ percent bonds by the
Pennsylvania Power and Light Oompany was the second largest to
come under the Act.

Each security issue to be declared effective by the Oommission,
unless exempt, must meet the standards of Section 7. In addition
to other standards, the security must be reasonably adapted to the
earning power and the capital structure of the issuer; the financing
involved must be appropriate to the economical and efficient operation

nection with the issue or sale of the security must be reasonable; and
the terms and conditions of the issue or sale must not be detrimental
to the public interest or the interest of investors or consumers.
One of the things most closely scrutinized in passing upon applications and declarations to issue securities is the ratio of bonds or bonds
and preferred stock to total capitalization and to net tangible property.
Consideration, however, is also given to earning power. In the case
of a large issue by Public Service Oompany oj Colorado." a majority of
the Commission believed that the favorable earnings record of the
company justified permitting a refunding operation which would
effect substantial interest savings and result in future improvement
in the capital structure, through compulsory debt retirement, notwithstanding the fact that the existing capitalization was the result of
inflationary practices of an extreme character. The consolidated
property accounts of the declarant, aggregating $86,885,793, contained $23,424,418 of inflationary items; and it appears that the
parent holding company, Oities Service Oompany, through a complicated series of transactions, had obtained the entire common stock
of $20,800,000, par value, without cost to it, and had also received
$1,280,437 in cash in connection with the transactions. These shares
were exchanged along with others for the stock of Cities Service Power
and Light Oompany when the latter was organized in 1925. During
the last 15 years Oities Service Power and Light Oompany has received over $26,000,000 of dividends on its holdings of the common
stock of Public Service Oompany oj Colorado,
Although the proposed financing slightly increased the amount of
the already high funded debt, the Commission approved it because
the increase was to be but temporary, as the retirement of debt by
heavy sinking fund payments would rapidly improve the capital
structure of the company, and the earnings were adequate."
In its
final form, the trust indenture required rapid retirement of debt
through annual sinking fund payments of $300,000 for the bonds and
$800,000 for the debentures. In addition, the indenture prohibited
the payment of dividends from the then existing surplus and required
that $500,000 of earnings be set aside each year as not available for
dividends until the debentures had been retired. The annual credit
to a maintenance and replacement fund, equal to 15 percent and 10
percent of gross electric and gas revenues, respectively, required by
the indenture was also an improvement over previous conditions.
The dividend restriction, replacement and maintenance funds were
also made conditions of the Commission's order allowing the issue to
become effective. Furthermore, the corporate structure was simpli»Holding Company Act Release No. 1701.
If Although the amount of the debt was increased, the debt ralio was not increased, largely because of the
exchange of $2,190,000of notes held by the holding company, for common stock, thus increasing the common

fied by consolidating nine issues into two refunding issues and the conversion of the parent's open account into common stock.
Commissioner Healy dissented from the majority's disposition of
the case. Finding that the inflationary items totaled at least
$24,184,352 (principally profits made by Oities Service Company on
property conveyed to the company, a substantial part of which had
been bought with funds provided by the company), he demonstrated
that the company's common stock owned by Cities Service Power &:
Light Oompany not alone cost the latter's parent and assignor, Cities
Service Oompany, nothing, but cost it a minus quantity of $4,993,255.
In addition, it has received cash dividends of $26,910,567 in less than
fifteen years. In view of these circumstances, he considered it inconsistent with the applicable statutory standards to permit a financing
which would increase the publicly-contributed capital by $5,000,000
and increase the earnings distributable on the common stock which
represented no actual investment.
Commissioner Healy pointed
out that if the net assets were adjusted by subtracting therefrom
the amount of the inflationary items, the ratio of bonds and debentures to net assets so adjusted would be 90.5 percent, and the
ratio would be increased to 101.22 percent if publicly held preferred
stock were included. Accordingly, he concluded that the securities
proposed to be issued were not reasonably related to the security
structure of the company as required by Section 7 (d) (1) of the Act.
Commissioner Healy stated that he believed that section, when read
in light of the declaration of policy in Section 1 (b), makes clear that
securities were not to be issued against write-ups and intra-system
profits. He found that section excluded issues in excess of "actual
investment," a standard which rejects self-serving declarations of value
and arbitrary appraisals.
Although earnings may be substantial, the Commission believes
that a reasonable capital structure calls for a substantial amount of
common stock equity both as a protective cushion for the bonds and
preferred stock and to prevent temporary declines in earnings from
resulting in receiverships. To keep the financial structure of a
growing concern strong, a substantial proportion of the new investment should be represented by common stock equity. It may come
from earnings, from the parent corporation in the form of a capital
contribution, or from a public sale of additional stock.
The possibility of strengthening the financial structure of a par.
ticular company is frequently limited by practical considerations.
Despite a favorable market, equity financing may not be easily available to heavily bonded companies with inadequate depreciation and
accumulated preferred stock dividend arrearages. With respect to
the Ooneumers Power Company financing program, filed in December

1939,67 the majority of the Commission approved a refunding bond
issue of $18,000,000, and the sale of $3,524,188 of common stock
(125,000 shares) to its parent, The Oommonwealth &: Southern Oorporation, but refused to allow the company to issue $10,000,000 of
additional mortgage bonds."
In a separate opinion, Commissioners Healy and Mathews recorded
their disagreement with the majority's refusal to permit the company
to issue the full amount of the bonds it desired to issue. Agreeing
with the majority as to the need for a substantial amount of common
stock equity, they were not satisfied that issuing additional bonds
would render the capital structure disproportionate.
Conceding that
additional debt financing was not necessary, they were not prepared
to find that it was not" appropriate," in view of the fact that the terms
of the financing were very economical to the company and that the
parent was making an additional investment in common stock of the
company of $3,500,000. They pointed out that of the $13,500,000
new money proposed to be raised by Consumers Power Company,
over 25 percent represented common stock money.
The majority found that under Section 7 (d) (3), additional bonds
were neither "necessary or appropriate to the economical and efficient operation of the business of the applicant" because(1) common stock financing was readily available on favorable
terms to this company, judged by its earnings record and by the
market prices of other comparable common stocks;
(2) the common stock equity including surplus amounted to only
20 percent of total capitalization, a ratio considerably lower than
corresponding ratios in the case of other comparable operating
utilities; 69
(3) the balance of net property left for the common stock after
allowance for bonds and preferred stock was approximately 11 percent
of total depreciated property. This figure was likewise lower than
corresponding percentages for comparable operating utilities;
(4) the ratio of debt to depreciated property was relatively higher
than that of comparable companies.
The Commission does not consider it appropriate to permit companies to create large debt obligations whose rigid fixed charges may,
in the future, force receivership through inability to adapt itself to
IT Holding Company Act Release No. 1854.
II The Commission, in Its opinion, noted that the questions Involved had not been adequately argued and,
therefore, stated that as a matter of right it would, if requested, grant a rehearing and also, at the request of
the company, would re-open the hearing for the taking of further pertinent testimony. The company
SUbsequently asked for a rehearing, but before the date set therefor, withdrew its request.
lilt should be noted that in his subsequent concurring opinion in We81Penn Power Companu, Holding
Company Act Release No. 2009,Commissioner Healy expressed views in accordance with the principle that
the maintenance of proper ratios of senior secnrlties (debt and preferred stock) to net property as prerequisite
to the approval of an issue of securities "is neither an innovation caused by the language of Section 7 (d)
nor by the Commission," citing several State commission decisions. He regards this as consistent with the

that case was not out of line.

future changing economic conditions. This is especially so when a
more desirable alternative, such as common stock :financing, is
available.
In considering refunding issues, the Commission has taken into
consideration the fact that if too restrictive provisions are required
the financing may not be consummated and the company will not
secure the benefits of lower interest rates, extended maturities, and
simplified debt structure. The Commission, however, has always
insisted that the minimum standards of the Aot be adhered to. Where
this is impossible, recapitalization is recommended.P
The Commission is presently engaged in reexamining the extent to which it may
properly differentiate between refunding issues and new issues.
In February 1940, the Kentucky Ut?1ities Oompany, a subsidiary of
The Middle West Oorporation, :fileda declaration to issue $26,000,000
of :first mortgage bonds and $6,000,000 of serial notes." This plan
was amended to cover an issue of $20,000,000 of :firstmortgage bonds,
$6,000,000 of second mortgage sinking fund bonds, and $6,000,000 of
serial notes. The bonded indebtedness amounted to 64 percent
while the common stock equity equaled only 10 percent of the total
capitalization. At the suggestion of the Commission, The Middle
West Corporation agreed to contribute $500,000 to the company to
retire debt. The Commission then approved this refunding program,
because the heavy sinking fund provisions and serial retirements
would rapidly improve the :financial structure of the company. All
savings due to lower interest rates were also to be applied to debt
retirement.
In February 1940, the West Penn Power Oompany, a registered holding company and an indirect subsidiary of American Water Works and
Electric Oompany, filed an application for exemption, under Section 6
(b), of the issue and sale of $5,000,000 of bonds and 24,923 shares of
.. In his concurring opinion in Southwestem Gaa and Electric Company, Holding Company Act Release
No 1931,Ohamnan Frank said:
"This Commission has consistently drffcrentrated between (a) the sale of bonds, the proceeds of which
are to be used to refund or retire existing debt with a resultant decrease of fixed charges, and (b) new issues
of bonds which will add substantially to the existing corporate debt. The Commission has accordingly
permitted refunding bond issues to be sold where the ratio of debt to total capitalization was relatively high
and where the ratio of common stock and surplus (the common stock "cushion") to total capitalization was
relatively low. See, e. g., &publlC Service Corporation, 2 S. E. C. 44 (1937). In some few of such cases the
debt was mereased by a relatively small amount in order to enable the company to meet the expenses attendant on the refunding operations; but In those cases the increase was temporary, provision having been made
for a rapid retirement of the increased debt. See, e. g., Pennsyloanaa Power .to Light Company, Holding
Company Act Release No 1678(1939) Of course, there may be circumstances in which we could not
permit bonds to be issued even for purposes ofrefunding. Our decisions are not to be taken to mean, therefore, that refunding bond issues WIll always be authorized, if debt ratios are dangerously high, or if other
conditions exist which clearly transgress the applicable standards of the Act; indeed, adverse findings might
be required even if, in such cases, the company is unable to procure funds for refunding through the sale of
junior securities." Chairman Frank also observed: "Many cases of refunding issues have arisen under the
express statutory exemption created by Section 6 (b). Accordingly, the requirements of Section 7, IneludIng, of course, Section 7 (d) (3), were inapplicable. See Public Service Company of Indiana, Holding Company Act Release No. 1826(1939); Central IUinois Electric and Gaa Companll, Holding Company Act Release
No. 1591(1939);Northem Indiana Public SerrJice Company, Holding Company Act Release No. 1836(1939)."

4~ percent preferred stock." Subsequently, the applicant withdrew
its application and filed a declaration, under Section 7, to issue and
sell $3,500,000 of bonds and 160,000 shares of no par common stock
at an offering price of $27 per share. The proceeds of the sale were to
be used for the acquisition of improvements, additions, and betterments to its plant and property. Bonds and common stock equity
represented 48 and 29 percent, respectively, of total capitalization.
The ratio of debt and preferred stock to depreciated property and
investments on a pro forma basis was equal to 75 percent. But, after
eliminating large inflationary items, the ratio rose to 84 percent.
The company, however, has been earning its interest and preferred
dividends by a wide margin and has regularly paid common stock
dividends for the past 20 years.
The Commission considered the small amount of common stock
equity and the presence of inflationary items undesirable. It indicated that a program of financing entirely with senior securities,
when equity financing was available, would fall short of statutory
standards." Since the altered plan cut down the amount of bonds,
eliminated the preferred stock, and raised over half of its immediate
capital requirements by the public issue of common stock, no adverse
findings were made as in the earlier case of Oonsumers Power Oompany.
Because of the possible detriment to uninformed investors and the
fact that there were no quoted prices to guide them, the Commission
required that the offering prospectus include those parts of the opinion
which discussed investment and property write-ups, equity and bond
ratios, depreciation policies, and possibility of rate reductions. On
the basis of its earnings for the year 1939, the proposed offering price
of $27 per share amounted to 17.3 times the earnings applicable to the
common stock. Since the common stock was to be sold to the
public, the charter was amended to give it preemptive rights and to
require that prejudicial changes in the rights of common stockholders
must be approved by at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares.
Because the two parent companies, which owned all the outstanding
common stock, were not in a position to subscribe for 160,000 additional shares, they were offered to the public. This is one of the first
cases, since the passage of the Act, in which new money has been
secured from the public by means of the sale of common stock. Other
cases have been concerned principally with already outstanding shares
or with stock issued to the parent or issued for the exchange of property
or other securities. Pursuant to an approved plan of reorganization

through underwriters, 645,980 shares of the common stock of its operating subsidiary, the Indianapolis Power &: Light Company, at $24 per
share or 11.7 times earnings."
At the same time, the operating company sold, through these underwriters, 68,855 new shares, to raise
capital for plant expansion.
Also in furtherance of this reorganization
plan, the 11,910 one hundred dollar par value shares of the Newport
Electric Corporation were split 5 for 1 and offered to the public at
$29.50 per share, or 9.4 times earnings, by the trustee.55
Pursuant
to a plan to liquidate the Washington and Suburban Companies,
362,588 shares of its subsidiary, Washington Gas Light Company, were
offered to the public at $29.50, or 11.0 times earnings."
This block
included 35,000 new shares which were being sold to raise additional
capital for the operating company.
One of the objectives of the Act is to prevent an unfair or inequitable
distribution of voting power. In the Southwestern Gas and Electric
Company case, the Commission approved the alteration of the voting
power of the common stock which resulted from giving the right to
vote to the new preferred stock issued to replace one paying a higher
dividend.
The new preferred stock had the following voting rights:
1. One vote per share for the election of directors and upon
all other matters.
2. When one year's cumulative preferred dividends have
accrued, two additional directors elected by the preferred stock
shall be added to the board of directors, while the remaining
directors shall be elected by the common stock.
3. When three years' cumulative preferred dividends have
accrued and until all dividends in default shall have been paid,
the preferred stock, voting as a class, shall be entitled to elect a
bare majority of the full board of directors.
4. Without the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of preferred stock, or if one-third of the outstanding
shares of such stock shall vote negatively, the company shall not
(a) authorize any prior or parity stock; or
(b) change any of the terms or provisions of outstanding
shares of preferred stock so as to affect adversely the holders
thereof; or
(c) issue any shares of preferred stock in excess of 75,000

shall for a preceding twelve-month period have been at least
equal to twice the annual dividend requirement on all shares

other distribution, upon shares of common stock or any
other class of stock junior to the preferred stock, unless
immediately thereafter the sum of (i) the capital represented by all stock junior to the preferred stock and

capital and surplus of the company; or

under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.67
Frequently the companies with high dividend preferred stocks have
redeemed or exchanged them for new issues carrying lower dividend
rates. In carrying out this refinancing, it has been found to be a
convenient means of distribution to offer the old preferred shareholders
the opportunity to subscribe to the new shares. To this end, they
have been notified of the general plan several weeks in advance but
have been informed of the final terms, such as price and dividend rate,
only two or three days before exchanged documents must be in the

hands of the company or its underwriting agents." After investigation and observation of several cases, the Commission concluded that
this length of time was insufficient and in the Kansas Power and
Light Oompany opinion gave notice that thereafter any such exchange
period ought to be not less than five days." Immediately thereafter,
the Wisconsin Electric Power Oompany 70 provided a ten-day exchange
period for its old preferred stockholders.
The Commission has been giving increasing attention to the
provisions of trust indentures securing mortgage bonds of public
utility companies. The terms of these indentures relating to the
obligations and activities of the trustee must now conform to the
standards of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. Other provisions of
trust indentures also require examination to see that they in turn
provide adequate protection for the investor. The Commission is
making a general study of indenture procedures and provisions ~th
a view to developing appropriate standards for the future.
In addition to its other regulatory duties relative to the issuance or
sale of utility securities subject to its jursidiction, the Commission is
called upon to supervise the exercise of any privilege or right to alter
the priorities, preferences, voting power, or other rights of the holders
of outstanding securities. Under Section 7 (e), the Commission may
not permit the exercise of any such privilege or right where it would
result in unfair or inequitable distribution of the voting power or
would be otherwise detrimental to the public interest or the interest of
investors or consumers.
An important case illustrating the difficult problems that may arise
in connection with this phase of the Commission's work involved the
Philadelphia Oompany, a subsidiary of Standard Gas and Electric
Oompany and principal source of income of that company. The
Philadelphia Oompany filed a declaration with the Commission pursuant to Section 6 (a) (2) regarding a reduction in the stated value
of its common stock from approximately $48,000,000 to approximately
$34,800,000. The major investment of the Philadelphia Oompany is
its ownership of the entire common stock of Duquesne Light Oompany,
which operates in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The Philadelphia Company, however, also has a substantial investment in the street railway
system of Pittsburgh, carried on its books at more than $52,000,000.
The Philadelphia Oompany sought to create a reserve of $23,000,000 to
absorb an anticipated loss on its investment in the street railway
system which was being reorganized. The reserve was to be set up

by transferring $13,000,000 from existing surplus and a further
$10,000,000from capital surplus created by the proposed reduction of
the stated value of the company's common stock. The effect of these
transactions was to reduce the "cushion" or capital stock equity
beneath the company's debentures to slightly over $74,000,000.
Under the indenture securing the debentures, any further reduction
in such cushion might have necessitated cessation of dividends until
the full $74,000,000 of stock equity was restored. Standard Gas and
Electric Company depended on these dividends for the payment of
interest on its notes and debentures.
In its findings, the Commission seriously questioned the adequacy
of the $23,000,000 reserve for losses on the traction investments, but
permitted the declaration to become effective. The Commission
noted that the company was committed by its amended declaration
to a provision whereby the sum of $500,000 a year out of earnings
available for the payment of common stock dividends will be restricted
in earned surplus until the amount so restricted amounts to $2,500,000
and no subsequent declaration of common dividends will be made
which will impair this restricted surplus except with the consent of the
Commission. The Commission indicated the necessity of providing
for the contingency that the loss in the traction investments might
exceed $23,000,000 and reserved jurisdiction over dividend payments
under Section 12 (c) of the Act.
UNDERWRITERS'

AND FINDERS'

FEES

Under various provisions of the Act, the Commission is charged
with the "maintenance of competitive conditions," and under Section
1 of the Act is directed to interpret the provisions of the Act so as to
eliminate the enumerated evils including those "which result from an
absence of arm's-length bargaining or from restraint of free and
independent competition" in the transactions of public utility
companies.
Under Section 7, the Commission is directed to withhold permission
to issue or sell a security when it finds that the fees, commissions, or
other remuneration are not reasonable or the terms and conditions
are detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or
consumers.
To regulate the activities and transactions between issuers and
bankers where there may be an absence of free and untrammeled
bargaining, the Commission has adopted Rule U-12F-2 (based on
Section 12 (f) and other provisions of the Act) to control the payment
of fees to underwriters and "finders" who may be in a position, by
reason of stock ownership or other relationship, to gain an unfair
advantage in bargaining. Persons affected by the rule are (substan-

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tially) those falling within the statutory definition of "affiliate" in
Section 2 (a) (11) of the Act, which includes, in addition to officers,
directors, and persons having specified stock ownership, any person
whom the Commission finds to stand in such a relation to the issuing
company "that there is liable to be such an absence of arm's-length
bargaining in transactions between them as to make it necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors or
consumers that such person be subject to the obligations, duties, and
liabilities" imposed upon affiliates. The rule, like the statutory provision which it parallels, recognizes the impracticability of precisely
defining the facts which make for absence of arm's-length bargaining,
and permits the disposition of each case in the light of the evidence
therein developed. By the terms of the rule, no fee can be paid,
unless on the basis of competitive bidding, to underwriters or "finders"
subject to the rule, unless the justification is clear or unless such person
merely has a participation of not more than 5 percent and the fee is the
same as that paid to non-affiliated underwriters.
During the fiscal year, there were five proceedings under Section 12
(f) and Rule U-12F-2 relating to underwriters' and finders' fees:
Halsey, Stuart & 00., Inc., filed an application for determination of its
status under the rule as a possible or a prospective underwriter of
various securities proposed to be issued by Public Service Oompany
oj Oolorado, On the record presented, the Commission found that the
applicant did not bear to the company any of the relationships specified in subdivision (a) of the rule."
Morgan Stanley & 00., Incorporated and Bonbright & Oompany,
Incorporated filed an application for a determination of their status
under Rule U-12F-2 as participating underwriters for an issue of first
mortgage bonds of Consumers Power Oompany. It was stipulated that
those two underwriters would not receive any underwriting fees in
connection with the sale of the bonds in the event that they were found
to be affiliates of Ooneumere Power Oompany and The Oommonwealth &
Southern Oorporation within the meaning of the rule." At the close of
the fiscal year the case was pending.
The Commission instituted a proceeding under Rule U-12F-2 with
respect to The Dayton Power and Light Oompany and Morgan Stanley
& 00., Incorporated, in connection with the issuance and sale of first
mortgage bonds of The Dayton Power and Light Oompany. The
Commission accepted the suggestion of Morgan Stanley & Co.,
Incorporated that the financing be permitted to proceed as proposed on

suant to RuIe U-12F-2.73
At the close of the fiscal year the case was
pending.
Following a preliminary investigation, the Commission instituted a
proceeding pursuant to RuIe U-12F-2 with respect to Northern
Natural Gas Oompany and Dillon, Read &: 00., in connection with the
issue and sale of securities of Northern Natural Gas Company. Prior
to the hearing on the issues in this proceeding, Dillion, Read & Co.
agreed to waive its right to claim or receive its finder's fee, with the
reservation that the claim might be reasserted in the event that RuIe
U-12F-2 shouId be held invalid or that subdivision (a) (3) of the rule
shouId be repealed with retroactive effect.74
The Commission also instituted a proceeding under RuIe U-12F-2
with respect to Michigan Oonsolidated Gas Oompany and Dillon,
Read &: 00., in connection with the issue and private sale of bonds to
two insurance companies. The Commission agreed to the respondents' request to postpone consideration of the issues raised by this
proceeding on condition that no finder's fee in connection with the
proposed transaction shall be paid to Dillon, Read &: 00. pending
completion of the similar proceedings involving Dillon, Read &: 00. and
Northern Natural Gas 00mpany.76
In a number of other instances where the question of affiliation under
RuIe U-12F-2 existed, the investment banking firms concerned
limited themselves to an underwriting participation of not more than 5
percent, thereby avoiding the problems and issues involved in a
proceeding under the ruIe.
Since proceedings under RuIe U-12F-2 may involve lengthy hearings
on more or less intangible corporate relationships, the Commission
has been considering alternative techniques which may be less burdensome from the standpoint of the issuer and more effective from the
standpoint of the Commission in meeting the requirement of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 to preserve competition
and arm's-length bargaining in the distribution of utility securities.
As it has done in other instances, the Commission has solicited the
views of interested and informed members of the public as to a method
that wouId best insure the reasonableness of fees and commission, the
fairness of the terms and conditions of any proposed issue and sale of
utility securities, and the elimination of transactions in which evils
resuIt from an absence of arm's-length bargaining or from restraint of

redeemed in contravention of any rules or order which the Commission
has deemed necessary to protect the financial integrity, to safeguard
the working capital, to prevent the payment of dividends out of the
capital or unearned surplus of public utility companies, or to prevent
the circumvention thereof. Pursuant to this section, the Commission
has promulgated Rule U-12G-2 which, except by specific order, prohibits the payment of dividends out of capital or unearned surplus.
In the matter of the Securities Corporation General, a subsidiary of
International Utility Corporation,76 which had a deficit in the earned
surplus account (there was a capital surplus), the Commission has
permitted the payment of dividends out of current earnings when it
was for the purpose of making a distribution on preferred stock held
by the public and its financial integrity was not jeopardized. Similarly, the International Utilities Corporation, which also had a deficit
in the earned surplus account, was permitted to pay dividends out of
current earnings on its two classes of preferred stock on two occasions.
Subsequently, permission was granted to pay dividends only to the
senior issue because current earnings were inadequate to cover both
issues." The need of reorganization of both companies was noted.
The Commission, however, did not allow the payment of dividends
out of what was alleged to be earned surplus after an accounting
reorganization of the Associated Gas and Electric Corporation (hereinafter called AGECORP) because it was found to be, in fact, capital
surplus. The Associated Gas and Electric Company (hereinafter
called AGECO) is the top holding company in the Associated System
in which the public has an interest. AGECO owns all the stock of
AGECORP, which owns the stock of 5 subholding companies which
in turn, directly and indirectly, own the controlling stocks of 70
electric and gas utility companies and 85 miscellaneous companies.
The operating subsidiaries render services to a population of over
7,000,000 in more than 6,200 communities in some 20 States and the
Philippine Islands. The system was put together by H. C. Hopson
(now under indictment for alleged mail fraud and income tax violation)
and his associates. Acquisitions of properties were financed to a
large extent by the issuance of stock and debentures of Associated

Gas and Electric Company and subholding companies in the system,
over $1,000,000,000 of such securities having been issued in the
process. About $270,000,000 of this money was represented by
debentures of AGECO.
In 1933, AGECO found itself unable to meet the interest on these
debentures. A few years before, the underlying system properties
had been transferred to AGECORP. AGECO partially extricated
itself from its difficulties by persauding the holders of approximately
$200,000,000 of its debentures to accept therefor lesser principal
amounts of fixed interest and income debentures of AGECORP.
These conversions of AGECO debentures for AGECORP debentures
constituted a large-scale recapitalization plan, generally called the
Recap Plan." The exchange of AGECO debentures for AGECORP
debentures pursuant to the Recap Plan was induced in part by the
belief that the converters would thereby follow the system assets
downstream and obtain a more direct claim to the income of the
system. Holders of some $70,000,000 of AGECO debentures refused
to exchange and thus remained dependent for their interest upon
dividends paid by AGECORP up to AGECO. The interest of the
holders of AGECO debentures demanded a flow of dividends from
AGECORP irrespective of AGECORP's earnings. The interest of
the AGECORP debenture holders was, of course, opposed to this.
The interest of the management of the Associated System demanded
that sufficient funds be brought up to AGE CO to permit payment of
interest and retention of themselves in office. This situation resulted
in pressure upon the operating companies to pay up cash irrespective of its effects upon the operating properties and their consumers.
Simultaneously with the flow of cash upstream there was a steady
increase in bank loans throughout the System.
It was extremely doubtful whether the earnings and earned surplus
account of AGECORP were such as to permit future payments of
sufficient dividends to cover AGECO's interest requirements. Accordingly, on November 27, 1935, four days before the effective date of
the registration provisions of the Act, AGECORP declared a dividend
to AGECO consisting of $90,000,000 in notes. This dividend was
declared out of an alleged capital surplus, the laws of Delaware,
under which AGECORP was organized, permitting such dividends.
Thereafter, over $16,000,000 was paid by AGECORP to AGECO on
account of interest and principal on the above notes. This money
was used by AGECO to meet its own interest obligations.
AGE CO registered as a holding company on March 28, 1938, following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Electric Bond and Share

case. From this date to November 13, 1939, AGECORP declared
and paid no dividends, the payments on account of the above notes
being the sole source of AGECO'S revenue.
Effective January 1, 1937, the Commission, acting pursuant to
Section 12 (c) of the Act, adopted Rule U-12C-2 forbidding the payment of dividends out of capital or unearned surplus, except upon
application to, and approval by order of, the Commission. Effective
November 8, 1939, in order to prevent the circumvention of this rule,
it adopted Rule U-12C-3, which forbade, except upon application to
and order by the Commission, the payment of any indebtedness arising from a dividend declared out of capital or unearned surplus.
On November 13,1939, AGECORP declared a dividend of $600,000
and paid $510,000 of this amount to AGECO. On November 21,
1939, the Commission issued an order to show cause why an order
should not issue, pursuant to Section 12 (c) of the Act, forbidding
the payment of further dividends. On December 12, 1939, AGECORP filed an application, pursuant to Rule U-12C-3, for permission
to pay interest on the balance of $71,805,120 due on one of the notes
declared as a dividend out of capital surplus. The cases were consolidated and heard jointly. The Commission's decision 79 forbidding
the payment of dividends or interest was based upon its findings that
such payments would be in violation of the legislative standards set
forth in Section 12 (c) of the Act in the following respects:
1. Such payments would be made from capital or unearned surplus. It was found that on the application of proper accounting
standards AGECORP had, instead of an earned surplus credit balance
as represented, an earned surplus deficit of many millions of dollars.
In particular, it was found that the AGECORP "accounting reorganization" of March 31, 1938, whereby the earned surplus deficit was
charged off against capital surplus could not be given effect in determining whether AGECORP presently had an earned surplus. This
" accounting reorganization" was held to be not sufficiently thoroughgoing and, as a device for altering the earnings history of AGECORP,
it was found to be deceptive upon the security holders affected by the
Recap Plan.so
2. Such payments would impair the financial integrity of AGECORP. The impairment was particularly striking in view of the
approaching maturity, on March 15, 1940, of $8,589,980 of AGECORP'S 8 percent debentures which AGECORP professed to be
unable to pay at maturity."

The Commission concluded its opinion as follows:
"Counsel for the respondent argue that it is unnecessary for us to enter orders forbidding payments of
either dividends or Interest by AGECORP to AGECO In view olthe fact that all basis lor such action can
be removed by adoption of a plan of reorganization for the System under Section 11 (e) ofthe Public UtIlity

On January 10, 1940, AGECO filed its petition for reorganization
under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended. AGECORP
also filed a petition on account of its inability to meet its March 15th
maturity. The case was assigned to the Honorable Vincent L. Leibell,
District Judge in the Southern District of New York. Upon inquiry
of Judge Leibell whether the Commission would accept, pursuant to
the provisions of Section 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935, appointment as trustee of the estates of the two companies, the Commission responded that it did not desire such an
appointment. Thereafter, Judge Leibell appointed Walter H. Pollak
as Trustee of AGECO, and Willard L. Thorp and Dennis J. Driscoll
as Trustees of AGECORP.
Four subsidiaires of the Oolumbia Gas and Electric Oorporation were
allowed to pay interest on notes, the principal of which might be
construed to be dividends paid to the parent out of unearned surplus.
It was found that the financial integrity of these companies would not
be impaired by such a disbursement."
To protect the financial integrity of the companies and to maintain
adequate working capital, the Commission, when necessary, has imposed restrictions on the payment of dividends from earnings or surplus in connection with orders permitting the issuance of securities
under Sections 6 (b) and 7. A case in point involved The Toledo
Edison Oompany, an indirect subsidiary of Cities Service Power &
Light Oompany, which filed an application under Section 6 (b) for
exemption from the provisions of Sections 6 (a) and 7 with respect to
the issuance of additional bonds and debentures. During the preceding five years the company had paid out as dividends on its common
stock an amount which was $1,800,000 greater than its earnings for
the period. The Commission found 83 that the effect of this dividend
policy had been (1) to reduce the ratio of common stock and surplus
to total capitalization; and (2) to place the company in such a position
that when faced with an imperative need of cash for new construction
its only source of such funds was through increasing its debt.
clearing up of all the difficulties Involved In this situation, the execution of such a plan involving a system
as complicated as the Associated System is impossible In a period Ilf less than several years.
If we should
permit the payments now proposed and the multitude of additional payments which the respondent admits
would be necessary If AG ECO Is to meet Its obligations pending the consummation
of such a plan, we would
be permitting for a period of years repeated payments in the face of our finding that such payments contravene the provisions of the statute.
"The Commission recognizes that entering Its order at this time will give the respondent
scant opportunity to seek judicial review before AGECO must meet Its Interest obhgations on January 15. Because
of the serious consequences which may fiow from failure to meet the Interest date, this Commission might
be inclined to withhold an order forbidding the particular
payment from AGECORP
to AGECO proposed to be made on January 15. However, the president of the respondent
has indicated to us by letter
that, after consultation
with a majority oltha directors and officers of AGECORP
and AGECO, and upon
advice of counsel, he Is authorized to request that the order, even If unfavorable,
be issued immediately,
and to state that 'the Company has no Intention of seeking judicial review of the Commission's
decision
and, therefore, will not In any way be embarrassed even though the order will appear to be issued so closely
before the dividend date.'
We have therefore decided to issue the order at this time ..

COMMISSION

For the protection of present and prospective investors and to safeguard working capital, the Commission prohibited, until further order,
the payment of dividends from the earned surplus of $2,830,000
existing on December 31, 1939.84 It was further ordered that $362,500
must be annually set aside out of earnings and made non-available
for dividends. This amount was equal to the annual sinking fund
requirement of its 3%percent sinking fund bonds.
Policies with respect to the payment of dividends from surplus
created by a write-down of the par or stated value of a company's
stock are set forth in the matter of Oolumbia Gas &: Electric Oorporation
and reviewed in the Fifth Annual Report of this Oommission.v
General Public Utilities, Inc., a registered holding company and a
partially owned subsidiary of Oommunity Power and Light Oompany,
proposed a dividend payable in common stock or cash at the option
of the holder." Two earlier similar dividend proposals were sanctioned primarily because of the impact of the recently repealed undistributed profits tax provisions of the Revenue Act of 1936.87 The
Commission denied permission to issue stock since the stock did not
now meet the standards of Section 7. It was not claimed that the
issuance was for the purpose of financing the business of the declarant
as a public utility company. The Commission declared that the mere
distribution of additional stock certificates which did not affect the
corporation's assets or the stockholders' interest in them cannot be
said to represent an urgent or even necessary corporate purpose.
In addition to giving substantial voting rights to its preferred stock,
the East Tennessee Light &: Power Oompany, a registered holding
company subsidiary of Oities Service Power &: Light Oompany, in a
program of liquidating three operating subsidiaries, also consented to
an order of the Commission restricting dividends on its common stock.
As long as any shares of the $6 preferred stock are outstanding, the
company may not declare any dividends if thereafter the common
stock equity is less than an amount equal to the involuntary liquidating value of the preferred stock outstanding."
In permitting new security issues to become effective, the Commission regularly requires that substantial charges for depreciation
and maintenance be made before computation of earnings available
for dividends."
The Public Service Oompany oj Indiana had a deficit of over
$9,000,000, due primarily to losses on abandoned street railways .

Intangibles were not segregated and the property account included
substantial write-ups. The depreciation reserve amounted to only 4.8
percent of the utility plant. The Commission, as a condition to its
order exempting an issue of bonds and serial debentures, required the
company to charge annually to its depreciation expense account an
amount equal to $1,700,000, plus 3 percent of the book value of its
net depreciable property additions."
Similarly, in permitting the
declaration of the New Mexico Gas Company 91 to become effective,
the Commission imposed conditions requiring an annual charge for
depreciation of a lump sum plus 3}kpercent of the book value of net
property additions.
The Commission is now engaged in making an analysis of the
depreciation policies of companies under its jurisdiction to determine
their adequacy and to test the genuineness of earnings. During the
year, a study of the preferred stock dividend arrearages of registered
holding companies and their subsidiaries was made by the Public
Utilities Division. As of December 31, 1938, the companies included
in this report had outstanding preferred stocks whose involuntary
liquidating value totaled $4,206,365,075, of which $3,590,730,690 was
held by the public. Of the publicly held stock, $1,580,648,416, or 44
percent, was in arrears to the extent of $372,487,414, or 23.6 percent
of the liquidating value of the stocks in arrears.
Still referring to publicly held stock, holding company issues
amounted to $2,082,650,314 and those of operating companies to
$1,508,080,376. Holding company stocks in arrears totaled $1,168,911,229, or 56 percent of the preferred stock issued by such companies
as compared with a total of $411,737,187, or 27 percent, for the operating companies. The arrearages accumulated on holding and operating company issues were in amounts of $282,519,592 and $89,967,822,
respectively.
Of the 1,370,550 public investors in holding and operating company
preferred stocks, 733,308 held stocks not in arrears on which they
received an aggregate dividend of $110,806,340. There were 595,697
investors who held preferred stocks in arrears. Of these, 321,670
received dividends of $37,323,017 with respect to annual requirements
of $56,278,733, and 274,027 investors holding stocks with annual
requirements of $42,792,639 received no dividends. An additional
41,545 investors held noncumulative stocks on which no dividends
were paid in 1938.
The report of the Division concluded that:
"The problem of dividend arrearages is materially greater with
respect to the preferred stocks of the holding companies than with
respect to the preferred stocks of operating companies.

"There are a number of operating companies and some holding
companies which undoubtedly should be able to clear up their arrearages without recapitalization.
However, there are some operating companies, and to a greater extent holding companies, where the
arrearages are so great in relation to the earnings available for preferred stock dividends, that recapitalization is inevitable.
"This and other studies that we have made indicate that these are
at least 20 holding companies with consolidated assets aggregating
about $6,500,000,000 which must be recapitalized.
It must be concluded, therefore, that the financial reconstruction of companies with
unsound capital structures is one of the most pressing problems facing
some of the holding company managements and the Securities and
Exchange Commission."

OF COMPANIES FROM THE PUBLIC

-----------

UTILITY HOLDING

Sections 2 and 3 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
authorize the Commission to exempt by regulation or order certain
types of companies from the obligations, duties, and liabilities imposed
by the Act. The form of such exemption may vary considerably.
Pursuant to this power the Commission has exempted, by rule, all
companies in a system whose total annual gross revenues from utility
business are less than $350,000 or whose utility assets do not exceed
$1,000,000. In other cases, a more individualized consideration is
necessary and questions such as those of control, the predominant
nature of the company's business, whether or not it is a holding company only temporarily and how it came to be such, and similar factual
matters are decisive.
H. M. ByUesby & Company, which has as its primary business the
underwriting and distribution of security issues, and its parent,
ByUesby Corporation,' filed applications for orders declaring such
companies not to be holding companies pursuant to Section 2 (a) (7)

of the Act or in the alternative for exemption as holding companies
under Section 3 (a) (3) (A) of the Act. H. M. Byllesby &: Company
owned 75 percent of the common stock, series B, of Standard Power
and Light Corporation, a registered holding company, which in turn
owned a majority of the voting stock of Standard Gas and Electric
Oompany, also a registered holding company. The ownership of
this common stock, series B, entitled H. M. Byllesby &: Oompany to
elect a minority of the Board of Directors of Standard Power and
Light Corporation and further to influence the affairs of Standard
Power and Light Corporation in such a manner that a majority of the
Board of Directors of Standard Gas and Electric Oompany would be
persons who could fairly be said to be representatives or appointees
of H. M. Byllesby &: Oompany. The Commission held that the
ownership of the certificates in a voting trust formed just prior to the
filing of this application constituted ownership of "voting securities"
within the meaning of the Act. The Commission found that a
"controlling influence" over the affairs of Standard Power and Light
Oorporation had been exercised by H. M. Byllesby &: Company and
that the existence of such a controlling influence was not dependent
upon the possession of the majority of the voting stock of the company. It was further held that the existence of this controlling
influence was not affected by the creation of the voting trust.
H. M. Byllesby &: Oompany, however, would be entitled to an exemption under Section 3 (a) (3) if it could show that it was only incidentally a holding company being primarily engaged in a business
other than that of a public utility company and not deriving directly
or indirectly any material part of its income from one or more of its
public utility subsidiary companies. It was found in this connection
that from 1930 to 1937,46 percent of the investment banking business
of H. M. Byllesby &: Company had been received from companies in the
Standard Power and Light Oorporation system. Since the underwriting fees received therefrom represented a material part of its
income, the application for exemption under Section 3 (a) (3) (A) was
denied."
Another case, involving the question of control of one company over
another, was that of the application of Manchester Gas Company for
an order under Section 2 (a) (8) of the Act asking that it be declared
not a subsidiary of The United Gas Improvement Oompany. About 45
percent of the common stock of Manchester Gas Oompany was owned
by The United Gas Improvement Oompany at the time the application
was :filed,but, due to default in the payment of preferred stock dividends, exclusive voting rights were vested in the preferred stock of
which The United Gas Improvement Oompany owned about 9 percent.
This case was consolidated with a proceeding which the Commission
II Holding

Company

Act Release No. 1882.

44

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

had instituted pursuant to paragraph (B) of Section 2 (a) (8) to
determine whether or not the management and policies of the Manchester Gas Oompany were subject to a controlling influence by The
United Gas Improvement Oompany so as to make it necessary or appropriate that the Manchester Gas Oompany be subject to the provisions
of the Act. The record showed that although The United Gas Improvement Oompany owned but a small amount of the securities presently
entitled to vote, it had been instrumental in changing the manager
of the company from one who had been with the company since 1915
to a man whose sole operating experience had been with acknowledged
subsidiaries of The United Gas Improvement Oompany; that the minutes of the Board of Directors of Manchester Gas Oompany had always
been and were still being prepared by the secretarial department of
The United Gas Improvement Oompany; that the Tax Department of
The United Gas Improvement Oompany regularly prepared the various
tax returns of the Manchester Gas Oompany; that the plant of the
Manchester Oompany was regularly inspected by The United Gas
Improvement Oompany engineers in an exhaustive manner; and that
the reports of such engineers and their recommendations were followed
by the operating officers of the Manchester Gas Oompany. The Commission held in this case that it constituted a situation in which substantially every phase of the management and policies of the operating
company were subject to a controlling influence by a large proprietary
company and that, even though The United Gas Improvement Oompany
did not at that time own more than 10 percent of the voting securities
of the Manchester Gas Oompany presently entitled to vote, Manchester
Gas Oompany was subject to such a controlling influence that it was
in fact a subsidiary."
The Union Electric Oompany of Missouri, which owns substantially
all the voting securities of six public utility companies operating in
territory contiguous to its operating area in Missouri, Illinois, and
Iowa, filed an application for exemption as a holding company under
Section 3 (a) (2) of the Act claiming to be predominantly a public
utility company whose operations as such do not extend beyond the
State in which it is incorporated and States contiguous thereto. In
its opinion denying the application 95 on the ground that the company
is not "predominantly" an operating company, the majority of the
Commission emphasized the fact that the aggregate book value of the
company's subsidiaries was 85 percent of that of its directly owned
properties. The Commission further pointed to the substantial
amount and proportion of the assets and earnings of the holding
company system represented by the subsidiaries and the substantial
public holdings of the senior securities of the subsidiaries, and held

COMPANIES

An important phase of the Commission's duties is the regulation of
service, sales, and construction contracts pursuant to Section 13. The
primary purpose of this section of the Act is to prevent the charging
of excessive or unearned fees and other charges which holding companies or their controlled service companies have exacted in the past
from the controlled operating companies. Under Section 13 of the
Act, registered holding companies are prohibited from servicing for a
charge their associate public utility or service companies, except
under special or unusual circumstances, while subsidiary or mutual
service companies are required to perform service, sales, and construction contracts for associate companies so as to insure the efficient
and economical performance of such contracts for the benefit of the
serviced companies at cost fairly and equitably allocated.
The Commission has enforced these provisions by rules and regulations and by
proceedings pursuant to the statute.
Two types of system companies are engaged in the performance of
such contracts, namely, subsidiary and mutual service companies.
Both of these types of companies must operate at cost and the basic
requirements as to their standards for and method of operations are,
for all practical purposes, similar.
The program of the Commission in the administration of Section 13
tends to fall in two major parts. The first part may be termed organizational and involves the original qualification of the mutual and subsidiary service companies.
The second and perhaps more important
part involves the continuing office and field studies of these companies
which are operating under Commission jurisdiction.
Under the first part of the program, the Commission has passed on a
majority of the service companies which have filed. Prior to Commission action many changes have been required in the methods of

46

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

operation and functions of these companies in order to comply with
the standards of the Act and the rules and regulations issued thereunder. A reasonable amount of standardization has been accomplished, particularly with respect to accounting and the elimination
of investments and functions not related to the performance of service,
sales, and construction contracts. There are, however, two major
companies which the Commission has not passed on as yet with
respect to their organizational features, namely, Ebasco Services, Inc.,
in the Electric Bond and Share System and The Utility Management
Oorporation in the Associated Gas and Electric System. During the
past year, public proceedings have been conducted in connection with
these two cases and some improvement and progress has resulted. In
the case of The Utility Management Corporation, certain major
changes have already been effected in the operations of this company
during the past year, resulting in substantial savings in its cost of
performing contracts for associated companies.
Because, however, of the difficult problems encountered and the
apparent necessity for further material changes with respect to these
companies, they are still operating under the temporary exemption
provided for in the rules and regulations. This same general situation
also applies with respect to certain of the other service companies
whose applications or declarations are still pending. The procedure
followed by the Commission does not prejudice the rights of the
service companies which have filed with the Commission, since the
rules and regulations adopted by the Commission permit these
companies to continue operations under temporary exemption until
the Commission acts.
-
 The cumulative experience obtained over the past several years in
dealing with service companies has been very helpful in passing upon
the organizational features of service companies.
During the past year, progress has been made in the second and
perhaps the most important aspect of service company regulation,
namely, the continuing office and field studies of service companies
which have been previously passed upon by the Commission. Since
there is no real uniformity in the functions and activities of the various
service organizations, each case must be treated separately in order
to obtain an effective analysis of the functions performed and the
necessity for the services rendered. Such office and field studies
have resulted in the withdrawal of approval of two service companies
since the record indicated there appeared to be no further necessity
for the continuance of their operations. Office and field studies
have been undertaken in other situations which may result in further
action by the Commission in these cases. The Commission is also

SIXTH

engaged in determining whether some holding companies are directly
or indirectly shifting holding company expenses upon the operating
companies through the medium of controlled service companies or
otherwise.
The orders of the Commission have in many instances been conditioned to require, if necessary, a reallocation or reapportionment
of service company charges. One proceeding 96 was conducted during
the past year as a result of which a reallocation of past charges was
required.
The Commission also had the occasion in the Ebasco Services,
Inc. case to question the profits obtained from the servicing of foreign companies. These profits were drawn up to the top holding
company, Electric Bond and Share 00. As a result of the proceedings
all profits obtained through servicing foreign associate companies
must be turned back to the intermediate holding company, American
and Foreign Power Oompany, Inc.,97 for the benefit of all its security
holders.
The Commission, during the past year, amended its annual report
form to require departmental analyses in the salary account of
service companies. This information, contained for the first time in
the annual reports for 1939, will be very helpful in connection with
future studies of the functions and benefits of service companies.
Additional information has also been required in the Form U-5S,
Annual Supplement to Registration Statement, in order effectively
to appraise and analyze the necessity for further regulations of
service, sales, and construction contracts between the companies in
utility systems and outsiders so that the Commission may prescribe
such additional rules and regulations as may be necessary.
The Act, in its definition of service, sales, and construction contracts, gives the Commission complete jurisdiction over intercompany
transactions and covers necessarily many and varied activities in the
day-to-day operations of holding-company systems. The Commission's studies have brought to light certain methods and procedures
whereby companies have contended that the transactions involved
were beyond the sphere of Commission regulation. These and other
problems are carefully studied in the light of the present rules and
regulations in order to insure a more effective control of the transactions which appear to warrant regulation.

POLITICAL

CONTRIBUTIONS

During the past year, the Oommission carried on several investigations of alleged violations of Section 12 (h) of the Public Utility
Holding Oompany Act of 1935, which prohibits registered holding
companies and their subsidiaries from making any contributions to
political groups or in connection with any political office. The most
important of these investigations to date involved the Union Electric
Company of Missouri and other subsidiaries of The North American
Company. On May 6, 1940, the Oommission, acting upon the basis
of information which it had received from various sources, instituted
a public proceeding pursuant to its powers of investigation under the
Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the
Public Utility Holding Oompany Act of 1935. This information
tended to show that these companies had made substantial disbursements, purportedly for expenses and which were fictitious or "padded,"
to certain parties who rebated or "kicked-back" these sums to the
company; also that substantial contributions had been made by and
on behalf of these companies to political organizations and to influence
and entertain certain public officials, and that such payments were
not properly reflected on the books of the companies."
On November 11, 1939, Albert O. Laun, until recently a vice-president of Union Electric Company oj Missouri, and Frederick J. Martin,
a sales engineer employed by the same company, were indicted for
perjury alleged to have been committed while testifying before an
officer of the Oommission with respect to the conditions and practices
in question. On January 3, 1940, Martin was sentenced, on his plea
of guilty, to imprisonment of six months and. a fine of $501. On
March 13, 1940, Laun was again indicted, together with Frank J.
Boehm, also until recently a vice-president of Union Electric Company
oj Missouri, for perjury alleged to have been similarly committed.
Subsequently, Laun pleaded nolo contendere to the second indictment
and was sentenced to imprisonment of one year and one day on each
of three counts, the sentences to run concurrently, and fines aggre" At the request of the Department
of Justice, the Commission has deferred for the present its public
proceedings in connection with possible violations by The North American Company and Union Electric
Company of Missouri of these Acts, and has submitted to the Department
the results of its investigation.

RULES, REGULATIONS,

AND FORMS

The Commission is constantly studying the rules, regulations, and
forms adopted under the Act to achieve the simplest requirements
consistent with a vigorous administration thereof.
In February 1940 the Commission replaced all its outstanding
forms for applications and declarations under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 by a single form. The new form is
entitled Form U-l and takes the place of Forms U-6B7-1, U-I0-l,
U-ID-2, U-12D-l, and U-12D-2. Form U-I is used in connection
with applications and declarations concerning anyone or more of
the following transactions: the issue or sale of securities and acquisition and sale of securities and assets; change of rights of outstanding securities; guaranty or assumption of liability; retirement or
redemption of securities; declaration or payment of dividends; or
any other transaction subject to rules under Sections 12 (b) or 12 (c)
of the Act. In cases where a registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933 is filed as part of the transaction, the information
filed under Form U-1 is substantially reduced and the applicant
may omit answering any item concerning the financial conditions
when corresponding, though not necessarily identical, information is
given in the registration statement.
To expedite the administration of the Act and to save .time and
expense for the industry, the Commission drafted a rule to provide
that applications or declarations under Sections 6, 7, 10, and 12
(other than Section 12 (e)), will be granted or permitted to become
effective by order issuing as of course on the thirtieth day after filing
or the fifteenth day after the filing of the last amendment, whichever
is later, unless prior thereto the Commission shall have ordered a
hearing. The Commission may, at the request of the applicant or
declarant, advance or postpone the effective date. If the Commission deems that a hearing is appropriate in the public interest or the
interests of investors or consumers, it will issue an order for a hearing,
and in that event the declaration or application shall not become
effective or be granted except pursuant to further order of the Commission. To afford interested persons an opportunity to request a
hearing, the rule provides for the publishing of notices of the filing
of declarations or applications in the Federal Register. A draft of
the proposed rule was submitted to the industry and a conference
with representatives of the industry was held on June 17, 1940.
The representatives who attended indicated that they favored the
II On July 26,1940, Boehm was found guilty of perjury on two counts by a jury and was sentenced to five
years imprisonment on each count, sentenees to run concurrently, and fined $4,000. Witnesses, in the
Boehm trial, testified to "kick-backs" or rebates totaling approximately $580,000.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

new procedure and made a number of constructive suggestions.
The rule became effective July 9, 1940. 100
During the year the Commission amended its permanent registration form, Form U-5B, to require the filing of additional desirable
data for the information of the Commission and the general public.
In addition, the supplemental annual report form, Form U-5S, was
amended to clarify and simplify its preparation.
Rule U-12B-l was amended to substantially expand the Commission's review of intercompany open-account transactions.
During the past year, the Commission adopted 5 new rules and
repealed 2 rules. It also adopted 21 amendments to existing rules,
of which 7 concerned procedural changes necessary upon the adoption
of Form U-l. In addition, 5 forms were rescinded, 3 were adopted,
and 3 amended.
The annual report filed by each registered holding company and
the annual accounting report for service companies were revised.
The annual report of registered holding companies was simplified as
to the presentation of information and in some respects expanded to
call for more information. The revised report calls for information
in tabular form in order to simplify the work of reporting and increase
the usefulness of the report to the Commission and to the public.
Substantially more information was requested as to servicing contracts. The accounting report for service companies, which follows
the uniform system of accounting for service companies, was expanded
to secure' additional information as to the allocation of charges for
service, cost of construction work, and analyses of salaries. In
anticipation of the new procedure whereby applications and declarations become effective automatically, unless the Commission orders
a hearing, it was found necessary to ask for additional information in
the registration statements. A special supplemental report was
required calling for additional information as to revaluations, open
accounts, depreciation, and consideration for securities sold. An
annual statement was also required of companies claiming exemption
from the Act pursuant to an exemption rule of the Commission.
100 In dissenting from the adoption of this rule, Commissioner Healy in a public memorandum dated
April I, 1940,set forth in detail his reasons for believing that the rule provided for an invalid procedure
and that it was bad policy. He suggested an alternative procedure which he believed was better law and
better pOlicy and equally saving of time and money. The views of the majority of the CommissIon in
support of the rule were set forth in a memorandum of June 24. see also Holding Company Act Releases

Nos. 2161. 2164, and 2214.

PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1938, affords appropriate machinery for the reorganization of corporations (other
than railroads) in the Federal courts under the Bankruptcy Act.
The Commission's duties under Chapter X are, first, at the request
or with the approval of the court, to act as a participant in proceedings thereunder in order to provide, for the court and investors,
independent, expert assistance on matters arising in such proceedings, and second, to prepare, for the benefit of the courts and investors, formal advisory reports on plans of reorganization submitted to it by the court in such proceedings.

COMMISSION FUNCTIONS UNDER CHAPTER X

Under the provisions of Section 208 of the Bankruptcy Act, as
amended, the Commission is given power to participate in Chapter X
proceedings upon the request of the judge or upon its own motion if
approved by the judge. Upon filing its notice of appearance under
that section, the Commission is deemed to be a party in interest and
has a right to be heard on all matters arising in the proceeding, but
it may not appeal or file a petition for appeal in the proceeding.
The
Commission, however, appropriately appears before the appellate
courts when appeals are taken by other parties to proceedings in which
it is participating.
The Act also provides for the preparation by the Commission of
advisory reports on reorganization plans. Section 172 of the Act
provides that the judge shall, if the indebtedness of the debtor exceeds
$3,000,000, and may, if such indebtedness does not exceed that
amount, submit to the Commission for examination and report any
plan or plans of reorganization which the judge deems worthy of
consideration.
Under the provisions of Section 173 of the Act, the
judge may not approve a plan of reorganization in such a case until
the Commission has filed its report or has notified the judge that it
will not file a report or unless no report has been filed within the
period fixed by the judge. Section 175 provides that, upon the approval of any plan by the judge, the Commission's report, if one has
been filed, or a summary thereof prepared by the Commission, shall
be transmitted to creditors and stockholders who are being asked to
51

52

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

vote on the plan, along with certain other material.
The Commission has endeavored to exercise its functions in such a
manner as to expedite the work of the courts and of the parties to the
proceedings in which it participates.
Units of the Reorganization
Division have been established in the regional offices of the Commission. The attorneys in those offices, as representatives of the Commission, undertake the duties of attending hearings in proceedings,
of conferring with the parties, and, with the financial analysts and
accountants stationed in the regional offices, of gathering much of the
information necessary for the Commission to perform properly its
advisory functions under the Act.

UNDER

CHAPTER

X

in which the Commission Participated.

Since the intention of the provisions embodied in Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act is an assurance of greater protection for the interests
of the public investor, the Commission has concerned itself primarily
with those proceedings in which a definite public interest has been
involved. For practical purposes, proceedings are considered to
have a public interest sufficient to justify Commission participation
if they involve securities in the hands of the public amounting to
more than $250,000. The Commission may often enter smaller
cases upon the request of the judge or if it may perform a useful
service to a fairly sizeable group of public investors because of such
matters as the proposal of improper plans of reorganization or violations of different provisions of the Act.
During the period from September 22, 1938 (the date on which the
amended Bankruptcy Act became fully effective) to the beginning
of the fiscal year, the Commission had filed its notice of appearance
in 87 proceedings involving the reorganization of 105 corporations
(87 principal debtor corporations and 18 subsidiary debtors). During
the fiscal year, the Commission filed its notice of appearance in 47
additional proceedings involving the reorganization of 63 corporations
(47 principal debtor corporations and 16 subsidiary debtors). Of
these 47 proceedings, 33 were instituted under Chapter X and 14
under Section 77B. The Commission filed its notice of appearance
at the request of the judge in 20 proceedings, while in the remaining
27 the Commission entered its appearance upon approval by the judge
of its motion to participate.
The total assets and total indebtedness involved in these 47 proceedings were approximately $1,580,000,000 and $860,000,000, respectively. A classification of these cases by industry is given in the
following table:

AUReorganizations under Chapter X.

The Commission has continued to issue periodic statistical analyses
of proceedings under Chapter X. By virtue of Section 265a of the

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

55

Bankruptcy Act, which provides that the clerks of the various Federal
district courts shall transmit to the Commission copies of all petitions
for reorganization and other specified documents filed under Chapter
X, the Commission is enabled to make this information available for
public use.
A statistical analysis of Chapter X proceedings instituted during the
fiscal year is contained in Appendix IX, page 347 .
. CHAPTER

n

PROCEEDINGS

During the course of the past fiscal year there arose the possibility
that the investor safeguards of Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act
might be nullified by improper resort to proceedings under Chapter
XI of that Act. It was the Commission's opinion that only the provisions of Chapter X were properly available for the reorganization of
corporations with securities in the hands of the public, and that
Chapter XI was the proper medium for securing arrangements or
compositions of unsecured indebtedness by individuals or corporations
with no public investor interest.
In order to secure an adjudication
on this problem, the Commission in May 1939 intervened, with the
permission of the district court, in the proceeding for an "arrangement" under Chapter XI filed by the United States Realty and Improvement Oompany in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York.' In this case the Commission moved
to vacate the order approving the debtor's petition as properly filed,
to dismiss the proceeding under Chapter XI, and to deny confirmation
of the proposed arrangement.
Shortly after its intervention in the United States ReaUy and Improvement Oompany proceeding, the Commission filed a similar motion
in a proceeding for an arrangement under Chapter XI filed by Credit
Service, Incorporated, in the United States District Court for the
District of Maryland.
The arrangement there proposed would have
affected some $5,000,000 of debentures outstanding in the hands of
the public. The court reserved decision upon the Commission's
motion and, after the opinion of the Second Circuit Court of Appeals
in the United States ReaUy case, denied the Commission's motion to
dismiss the proceeding and also its petition for leave to intervene.
The Commission took an appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court of
Appeals, which appeal was pending at the time the United States
Supreme Court handed down its decision in the United States ReaUy
case. The appeal to the circuit court of appeals was thereafter dismissed by stipulation, after the district court had adjudicated the
debtor a bankrupt.
I Before the intervention of the Oommlsslon In the UIIUtd StoJu Blatt, proceedings, it had taken 8 similar
position inanother CllS8In the N orthem District of IIlinDis. In the latter, the district Judge snggested from
the bench that, to avoid controversy, a petition be filed under Chapter X. The dehtor thereupon filed snch
a petition, and the proceeding continued under Chapter X.

56

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the United States Realty and Improvement Oompany case, the
debtor had outstanding in the hands of the public 900,000 shares of
stock which were listed on the New York Stock Exchange and two
series of debentures aggregating over $2,300,000. The debtor was
also liable as a guarantor of payment of principal, interest, and sinking
fund payments upon a series of publicly held mortgage certificates in
the principal amount of $3,710,500 issued by a wholly owned subsidiary. These certificates, secured by a mortgage on two buildings
which constituted the subsidiary's only substantial assets, were in
default as to interest and sinking fund payments. The debtor, which
was unable to pay its debts as they matured at the time it instituted
the proceedings, had suffered large shrinkage in the value of its holdings
and had operated at a loss for several years.
It was the debtor's intention to have a proceeding instituted in a
State court for the subsidiary, to secure a modification of the latter's
mortgage certificates by the extension of their maturity, a reduction
in interest, and a modification of their sinking fund provisions. The
purpose of the Chapter XI proceeding was to effect a corresponding
modification of the debtor's guarantee, and this "arrangement" was
to stand regardless of the outcome of the State court proceedings.
None of the other securities of the debtor were to be affected. Assents
to this plan were obtained from more than half of the certificate
holders before tho Chapter XI proceeding was initiated.
Although the Commission was allowed to intervene, its motions
in the Chapter XI proceeding were denied by the district court.
Upon appeal, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
held that, since the debtor was literally within the jurisdictional
provisions of Chapter XI, the proceedings for an arrangement were
properly brought under that chapter, that the Commission's intervention in the proceedings was not authorized by any provisions of
the Bankruptcy Act, and that it was not an aggrieved party, because
it had no interest affected by the Chapter XI proceeding which would
entitle it to intervene under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure.
The circuit court therefore dismissed the appeal of the Commission
from the order of the district court denying its motions and, upon
appeal of the debtor, reversed the order of the district court allowing
the Commission to intervene,"
Upon petition by the Commission, the United States Supreme
Court granted certiorari and thereafter reversed the decision of the
circuit court of appeals. The Supreme Court held that since the
provisions of Chapter XI were not adequate to secure to public
investors the safeguards necessary for the consummation of a fair,
equitable and feasible plan of reorganization and since the provisions

of the Bankruptcy Act contemplated that the reorganization of such
debtors should take place under the terms of Chapter X rather than
Chapter XI, the district court, in the exercise of its sound discretion
as a court of equity, should have dismissed the petition, thus relegating the respondent, if it were so inclined, to the initiation of a proceeding under Chapter X "in which it may secure reorganization which,
after study and investigation appropriate to its corporate business
structure and ownership, is found to be fair, equitable and feasible,
and in the best interest of creditors."
The Supreme Court also held that the order permitting the Commission to intervene in a Chapter XI proceeding for the purpose of
moving its dismissal was properly entered. The Court, through
Mr. Justice Stone, stated that
"The Commission's duty and its interest extends not only to the performance
of its prescribed functions where a petition is filed under Chapter X, but to the
prevention, so far as the rules of procedure permit, of interferences with their
performance through improper resort to a Chapter XI proceeding in violation of
the public policy of the Act which it is the duty of the court to safeguard by relegating the respondent to a Chapter X proceeding * * *.
"If, as we have said, it was the duty of the court to dismiss the Chapter XI
proceeding because its maintenance there would defeat the public interest in
having any scheme of reorganization of respondent subjected to the scrutiny of the
Commission, we think it plain that the Commission has a sufficient interest in the
maintenance of its statutory authority and the performance of its public duties
to entitle it through intervention to prevent reorganizations, which should rightly
be subjected to its scrutiny, from proceeding without it." 3

It appears, therefore, to be finally settled that resort to the provisions of Chapter XI is not appropriate in the reorganization of
corporations with securities distributed in the hands of the public.
Thus, in a recent case, in the Southern District of New York, a
debtor which had originally filed under Chapter XI had the proceedings dismissed on its own motion after the Supreme Court's decision in
the United States Realty case and filed a voluntary petition under
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act.
STATUTORY

AMENDMENTS

During the fiscal year the Commission came to the conclusion that
the provisions of Section 270 of the Bankruptcy Act, with respect to
the basis of the debtor's property for income-tax purposes, were
demonstrably unfair to a substantial number of the debtor corporations theretofore reorganized or then in the process of reorganization
under Chapter X, and also that those provisions were frequently a
serious obstacle to the development of a fair and feasible plan in that
they provided argument for not reducing outstanding indebtedness
even where a failure to do so would result in an unsound capital struc• SemrUiu

ture. In the discharge of its advisory functions under Chapter X,
the Commission had, of course, an opportunity to observe the practical
consequences of Section 270 in cases in which it was participating as a
party pursuant to Section 208 of the Act.
The basis of property for income-tax purposes is important from at
least two points of view: (1) the amount of depreciation (or depletion)
which may be claimed annually in future income-tax returns, and (2)
the determination of gain or loss resulting from future sales or
exchanges of the property in question. Where a proceeding for "corporate reorganization" under Chapter X, for an "arrangement" under
Chapter XI, or for a "real-property arrangement" under Chapter XII
resulted in a cancelation or reduction of indebtedness, Section 270
under Chapter X and the corresponding sections under Chapters XI
and xn required (with limited exceptions) that the basis of the
debtor's property for income-tax purposes, State as well as Federal, be
decreased by an amount equal to the amount of such cancelation or
reduction.
The difficulty with Sections 270, 396, and 522 was that there was
nothing in any of the three sections to prevent their application from
resulting in a decrease of the basis of the debtor's property to a figure
substantially below its fair market value, or even to zero. Where
the basis was reduced to zero, the result was that (1) the reorganized
company could not take any deduction for depreciation or depletion
in future State or Federal income-tax returns, not even depreciation
or depletion based on the present fair market value of its property,
and (2) if the property should be sold, the entire proceeds would
constitute taxable income, even if the sale should be at a figure less
than its present fair market value and drastically less than its original
cost. Where the basis was reduced to any other figure below the
fair market value of the debtor's property, the onerous consequences
to the reorganized company were only comparatively less severe.
Discussions were had with representatives of the Treasury Department, and with members of the National Bankruptcy Conference
and the Committee on Bankruptcy and Reorganization of the New
York City Bar Association. The problem was then presented to the
Honorable Charles F. McLaughlin, Chairman of the Subcommittee
on Bankruptcy and Reorganization of the House of Representatives
and the Honorable Joseph C. O'Mahoney, Chairman of the corresponding subcommittee of the Senate. As a result, substantially
identical bills were introduced in the House and Senate, which proposed to remedy the situation by establishing a fair market value
"floor" below which the basis should not be reduced. The amendments
proposed were favorably reported by the Treasury Department and
the Commission, and all of the witnesses who testified at the hearings
on the House bill agreed that it was essential that the three sections

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

59

be amended at the earliest practicable date. The House bill was
unanimously passed on June 17, 1940, and on June 22, 1940, was
substituted for the Senate bill and unanimously passed by the Senate
on the same day. This legislation was approved by the President
on July 1, 1940 (Public, No. 699-76th
Congress-Chapter
5003d Session).
THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

The provisions of Section 208, in making the Commission a party
to proceedings, contemplate that it shall be prepared to participate
with regard to any problems arising in a proceeding. Consequently,
the Commission, immediately upon becoming a party to a case, proceeds to obtain and analyze all available information concerning the
debtor and its affairs. By acquiring such information at the outset,
the Commission is in a position not only to prepare expeditiously its
advisory reports on plans of reorganization but also to perform properly its functions as a party with regard to the other problems arising
in the proceeding, which may be many and complex.
The activities of the Commission as a participant in reorganization
proceedings are not limited to formal appearances or the filing of legal
or factual memoranda. In order to expedite the proceedings and to
avoid unnecessary delays and wasted effort, the Commission's attorneys and analysts frequently participate in informal conferences with
the parties concerning matters arising in connection with the formulation of a plan or the administration of the estate. By discussion
before formal action is taken upon such matters, the Commission has
often been able to bring facts, questions, or arguments to the attention
of the parties which they had not previously considered, and parties
have often been prompted thereafter to modify or alter their proposed
action before formal steps were taken. In this way there is frequently
avoided the delay incident to hearings on formal objections. It
should be noted, of course, that the parties are under no requirement
so to act and that modifications in advance of formal action are
undertaken only where such changes seem desirable to the parties
because of the validity of the suggestions made by the Commission
as an impartial party to the proceedings.
Through its Nation-wide activity in bankruptcy reorganizations,
the Commission has been in an advantageous position to encourage
the development of uniformity in the interpretation of Chapter X of
the Bankruptcy Act and in procedure thereunder. Thus, the Commission has often been called upon by parties, referees, and special
masters for advice and suggestions with regard to matters of procedure and the form and content of necessary orders in the proceedings.
In this, the Commission has been able to afford substantial aid out of
the store of experience accumulated through participation in many

60

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

reorganization cases. The Commission has also been able, in this
manner, to save the court officers and the parties much of the effort
that would have been entailed in handling such questions de novo, as
well as the time and expense involved in retracing steps improperly
taken. This work of the Commission has been of special value due
to the fact that the solutions of most procedural and interpretative
questions are not likely to find their way into the official or unofficial
reports and are, therefore, largely unavailable outside of the particular
district of their decision. The Commission has also proceeded,
primarily through the method of informal suggestion and conference,
to call to the attention of parties any violations of or lack of compliance with the procedural provisions of Chapter X. Where these
are the result of inadvertence or lack of precedent, such an informal
suggestion has usually proved sufficient to obtain a correction. In
other cases, it has been necessary for the Commission to :fileformal
motions in court to secure compliance with the Act.
It is not possible in the brief compass of this report to do more than
outline the full scope of the Commission's activities in a reorganization
proceeding. A few examples may serve, however, to indicate the
varied type of issues with which the Commission has been concerned.
Miscellaneous Issues in Proceedings.

The Commission has taken an active part in issues arising at the
very outset of a proceeding, and a few examples illustrative of such
activity may be outlined here. Thus, the Commission was instrumental in securing the transfer of the proceedings for the reorganization of the Associated Gas and Electric Company and the Associated
Gas and Electric Corporation from the district in which the debtors had
:filed the petition to a district in which the proceedings might be
handled with greater efficiency and economy, because the main offices
of the debtors and the sources of information necessary to an understanding of their problems were present in the latter district.
In the same case, the question of the impounding of lists of security
holders under Section 166 of the Bankruptcy Act was presented.
The problem here was to keep such lists accessible for bona fide ends,
so as not to impede the organization and activity of protective committees in the interests of the holders of the various issues of securities,
while at the same time preventing use of these lists for improper
purposes. The Commission took an active part in working out a
solution of this problem which, while providing for the impounding of
the lists, made them available for inspection by proper persons and
committees upon authorization of the court. It was also provided
that the trustees should, upon the tender to them of solicitation material with a payment of the costs of handling and mailing, send such
material to the security holders.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

61

In these cases the Commission has been alert to the possibility
that security holders may be imposed upon by persons seeking to
represent their interests. Thus, in the case of The Penfield Distilling
Company, the Commission ascertained upon becoming a party that
two persons, in the name of a committee, had been soliciting authorizations to represent stockholders in the proceeding. At the same time,
these persons solicited substantial deposits of funds by the stockholders to be represented. The" committee" secured such authorizations
and deposits by fraudulently representing to the stockholders of the
debtor that such action would enable them to obtain 70 percent to
100 percent of the par value of their stock while stockholders not
represented by the "committee" would receive little or nothing.
Payments were solicited as compensation for the expenses and services
of the "committee."
The Commission petitioned the district court
for an injunction against further solicitation and an accounting of all
funds obtained from the stockholders. An injunction and a decree
for an accounting were entered by the district court. Upon an appeal
to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit,
the decree of the district court was affirmed without opinion.'
Problems in Administration of Estate.

In proceedings under Chapter X, the independent trustee has the
duty of examining into the history of the debtor, ascertaining its
financial and managerial problems and future prospects, and formulating the plan of reorganization. In addition, such trustees bear the
primary responsibility for the operation of the business. It is therefore apparent that the success with which the reorganization proceedings are carried through depends in substantial measure upon the
thoroughness and efficiency with which trustees perform their duties.
It has been found that early participation in a reorganization proceeding by the Commission has enabled it to aid the trustees with
suggestions and information, especially when the trustees and their
counsel have not had previous experience in Chapter X reorganizations. In addition, the Commission's presence has emphasized for
trustees and their counsel the importance of their functions and the
necessity that their duties be performed with thoroughness, independence, and efficiency. In the last respect, for example, the Commission in one case was instructed by the court to make an investigation with a view to securing a reduction in the costs of operation by
the trustee. Upon the suggestion of the Commission, the court
ordered the trustee to make a report containing information concerning the operation of the business. After a hearing at which the
Commission presented its views, the court ordered the trustee to
take the action necessary to secure a reduction in costs of operation .

62

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Commission has, at all times, insisted that trustees prepare
adequate reports to the security holders in fulfilling the requirements
of Section 167 (5) of the Act. It is felt that such reports are necessary
not only to enable the security holders to make suggestions for a
plan but also to give them the necessary information for determining
the desirability of accepting proposed plans. The Commission's
staff has always been prepared to consult and has often consulted
with trustees as to problems arising in connection with the preparation
of such reports. It should be noted, however, that suggestions from
the Commission have always been made in such fashion as to emphasize to the trustees the importance of their maintaining a proper
independence of all parties in interest. The Commission has not
attempted to usurp the functions of the independent trustee nor to
control his activities.
The Commission has often been able to provide trustees with information useful in carrying out their duties. In addition, as the result
of experience in corporate reorganizations, the Commission has been
in a position to offer advice to trustees and to courts on such matters,
for example, as the scope of the investigation to be made by accountants hired by independent trustees. Through its cooperation with
such accountants and advice to trustees and courts, the Commission
has been able to assist the trustee in obtaining the performance of a
thorough job. Furthermore, the wide experience of the Commission
has enabled it to aid the trustees and the court in determining the
reasonable value of services performed by accountants and other
experts in reorganization proceedings.
Activities with regard to Allowances.

The Commission has been concerned in every proceeding to which
it is a party with the problem of allowances to the various parties for
services rendered and expenses incurred in the proceeding. In. making allowances from the limited funds available for the payment of
reorganization expenses, the courts seek to protect the estate from
exorbitant charges, while at the same time providing equitable treatment to the applicants for allowances. The Commission has been
able to provide considerable assistance to the courts in dealing with
this problem.
.
The Commission itself receives no allowances from estates in reorganization and has no personal interest in the question of fees. It
is therefore able to present a wholly disinterested and impartial view
on the question. The Commission has constantly endeavored to
secure a limitation of the total compensation to an amount which the
estate can feasibly pay. In each case the Commission also makes a
careful study of the allowances requested by the various parties to
ascertain, first, that unnecessary duplication of services shall not be-

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

63

recompensed and, second, that compensation shall be allocated on the
basis of the work done by each claimant and his relative contribution
to the administration of the estate and the formulation of a plan.
Where reductions in requested compensation are necessary because of
the financial condition of the estate, the study and investigation by
the Commission has provided the courts with impartial advice upon
the basis of which a reduction may be ordered with regard to the
comparative values of the services performed, rather than by a general
reduction in requested fees which may be unjust to individual parties.
As the number of proceedings in which the Commission participates
increases, the Commission acquires increasing experience as to the
reasonable worth of the various services performed by the parties
in reorganization proceedings. That the courts have considered
the Commission's aid on the matter of allowances to be of value even
where it has not theretofore been a participant in a proceeding is
evidenced by the example of the proceeding for the reorganization of
the Postal Telegraph &: Gable Gorp. In that case, which had been in
reorganization under Section 77B for several years, the district court
judge requested the participation of the Commission after the confirmation of the plan in order that he might have the aid of its investigation and advice with regard to the question of allowances.
The Commission has been active both in court and in conferences
with parties in securing compliance with the requirements of the
statute and of local rules by parties requesting compensation. One
problem that has arisen in several cases has been that of interim allowances to trustees for their services in the operation of the business.
It is at times harsh to require a trustee to await the conclusion of the
proceedings before he may be compensated for his services. Nonetheless, the statute provides for allowances only for services already
rendered, and compliance with its requirements as to hearing and
notice on application for such allowances is necessary to avoid abuse.
It would often be an expensive matter, however, to comply with the
provisions of the Act regarding notice and hearing in the usual fashion
upon each application if a trustee requested interim allowances at
frequent intervals.
The Commission- has aided in the formulation of a practical procedure to hsndle such matters with fairness to the trustee and at
a minimum of expense. Under such procedure a notice is sent out
and a hearing is set early in the proceeding on the question of the
interim allowances for the trustee. This notice also sets a hearing on
interim allowances before a master or referee for a certain day in
each month or quarter thereafter. No further notices are sent unless
the trustee in a subsequent monthly or quarterly petition seeks compensation in a greater amount than that set forth in the first notice.
In this fashion the requirements of the statute are met without an

64

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

undue burden upon the estate and an opportunity is afforded all
parties, the security holders, and the court, for a periodic scrutiny
of the value of the services being rendered. At the same time, the
trustee is enabled to receive regular compensation for his work in the
operation of the business. Of course, the trustee may in his final
allowance, on proper notice, receive additional compensation for his
services in the formulation of a plan or for special services in the
administration of the estate,
Of particular importance has been compliance with Section 249 of
the Bankruptcy Act, which provides generally that no committee or
attorney, or other person acting in a representative or fiduciary capacity in reorganization proceedings, may receive allowances for services
if such parties purchased or sold securities of the debtor while acting
in the proceedings. The requirements of fiduciary responsibility make
it necessary that the rule be inflexibly enforced, lest the standard itself
be impaired. This position, advocated by the Commission, was unequivocally upheld by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the First Circuit in the case of Otis &: Oompany v. Insurance Building
Oorporaiion."
The court held that Section 249 bars the compensation
of a person acting in a representative capacity in a reorganization proceeding who had bought and sold securities of the debtor during the
pendency of the proceeding, regardless of his good faith or his profit or
loss in the transactions.
The argument that purchases or sales could
be consented to or approved by the judge so as to remove the bar to
compensation, as is permitted in the proviso of Section 249 with regard
to other acquisitions or transfers, was rejected.
PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

UNDER CHAPTER X

The ultimate objective of a reorganization under Chapter X is the
formulation, acceptance, and consummation of a fair and equitable and
feasible plan of reorganization.
As a basis for its study of reorganization plans, the Commission, in each case in which it participates,
assembles essential information concerning the physical and financial
condition of the company, the cause of its financial collapse, the quality of its management, its past operating performance, and the reasonable value of its properties. Such information is usually obtained
through the voluntary cooperation of trustees and parties to the reorganization, through examination by the Commission's accountants
of the books and records of the debtor, and through the examination
of witnesses in court. This information is also complemented by the
independent research of the Commission's analytical staff into the
general economic factors affecting the particular debtor and the competitive conditions in the particular industry.
In connection with the
consummation of plans, the Commission also investigates the sug'110 F. (2<1) 333 (0. C. A. Ist., 1940)

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

65

gested personnel of the new management, upon whose qualifications
the court must pass under Chapter X, in order to be able to advise the
courts and the parties concerning their qualifications.
Feasibility of Plans.

As will be seen in the discussion below of the advisory reports prepared by it, the Commission has consistently objected to features of
plans of reorganization which render likely a return of the debtors to
the reorganization courts because of flaws inherent in the financial
structure proposed in the plan. This question of feasibility has been
presented to the Commission in some cases at the very outset of the
proceedings. In such cases, the Commission has been asked to examine and comment on the affairs of the debtor with a view to
determining whether any plan of reorganization would be feasible. In
cases in which the Commission has concluded that the condition of the
debtor was such that no feasible plan of reorganization could be hoped
for, it has submitted to the courts the bases for such belief. Much
time and expense may be saved by avoiding futile attempts at reorganization.
Fairness of Plans.

The Commission has consistently taken the position that the applicable standard of fairness in reorganization proceedings requires
that a plan, to be fair, must provide fully compensatory treatment
for claims in the order of their legal and contractual priority, either
in cash or new securities or both, and that the participation granted
to junior claims must be based either upon the existence of an equity
for them in the enterprise after the satisfaction of prior claims or
upon a fresh contribution in money or money's worth necessary to the
reorganization of the debtor. A valuation of the debtor is necessary
to provide the basis for judging the fairness and feasibility of proposed
plans of reorganization. In its advisory reports, in hearings before
courts, and in conferences with parties to proceedings, the Commission
has consistently taken the position that the proper method of valuation for reorganization purposes is primarily the capitalization of
reasonably prospective earnings.
Since the standard of fairness and equity which the Commission
must apply in evaluating a plan in any particular case is determined
by the courts, the Commission has participated as amicus curiae on
two recent occasions when that standard was under consideration.
The most significant of these cases was Oaee v. Los Angeles Lumber
Products 00., Ltd., decided by the Supreme Court on November 6,
1939.6 That case went to the Supreme Court upon a writ of certiorari,
sought by an objecting bondholder, to a decision of the Ninth Circuit
Court of Appeals affirming a district court order confirming a plan of
reorganization. The debtor, admittedly insolvent, had assets worth
• 308 U. S. 106.

66

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

some $840,000 on a going-concern basis. Its liabilities consisted of
$2,565,000 principal amount of first-mortgage bonds upon which no
interest had been paid since 1929. In January 1938, proceedings were
initiated under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act. The plan provided for the formation of a. new corporation with a capital structure
of 1,000,000 shares of authorized $1 par value voting stock, to acquire
the assets of the debtor. Of this stock, 811,375 shares were to be a
5 percent noncumulative preferred stock. The bondholders were to
receive 641,375 shares of this preferred stock on the basis o~ 250 shares
for each $1,000 bond and the remaining 170,000 shares were to be reserved for sale to raise working capital for the new company. The
188,625 shares of common stock were to be issued to the common
stockholders of the debtor. This plan was accepted by overwhelming
percentages of the bondholders and stockholders.
The Commission participated in the preparation of a brief and
argument presented to the Supreme Court by the United States as
amicus curiae on behalf of the Securities and Exchange Commission
and the Interstate
Commerce Commission.
The Supreme Court
unanimously sustained the position presented in that brief and
argument, reaffirming as applicable to bankruptcy reorganizations
the so-called doctrine of the Boyd case.! The Court held that a fair
and equitable plan of reorganization must provide full recognition
for senior claimants in the order of their legal and contractual priorities before junior classes may participate and that such junior classes
may participate only if there is an equity for them in the enterprise
or if they provide a fresh and adequate contribution in money or
money's worth necessary or desirable for the debtor's operations in
return for a reasonably equivalent participation under the plan.
The Supreme Court also held that courts must reach an independent
determination of the fairness of the plan without regard to the number of acceptances of a plan, the amount of the objector's holdings,
or similar circumstances.
Subsequently, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit granted a rehearing in the case of Dubois v. Oonsolidated Rock Products Oompany 8 for the purpose of considering the
effect of the Supreme Court's decision. The circuit court of appeals
had affirmed a district court order confirming a plan only a few days
before the Supreme Court's opinion was handed down. On the
rehearing, the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae upon the
issue of the fairness of the plan.
The Dubois case involved the reorganization of a parent corporation, Consolidated Rock Products Company, and its two whollyowned subsidiaries, Union Rock Company and Consumers Rock and
'Northern Pacific Railwa, Co. v. Bovd, 228 U. S. 452'107 F. (2d) 96 (Advance Sheets, not In permanent volume).

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

67

Gravel Company, ~nc. All the properties were operated as a single
enterprise by the parent under an operating agreement. Each of
the subsidiaries had outstanding an issue of bonds upon which there
were accrued interest claims when the reorganization petition was
filed; these bond issues aggregated $3,014,000 in principal amounts.
The subsidiaries had a claim of about $5,000,000 against the parent,
disputed in validity and amount, under the terms of the operating
agreement. The parent company had an issue of preferred stock
and an issue of common stock outstanding.
Although there were no
precise determinations of value, the district court found that the
properties under the lien of each indenture were not sufficient to
secure the bonds issued thereunder but that the value of the entire
enterprise was sufficient to cover the claims of the bondholders and
to leave some equity for the preferred stockholders of Consolidated
Rock Products Company.
The plan of reorganization provided that the bondholders were to
receive income bonds, secured by a mortgage covering all the properties of the enterprise, for 50 percent of the principal amount of their
claims, preferred stock for the remainder of the principal amount of
their claims, and warrants for the purchase of new common stock at
prices, on an ascending scale starting at par, depending upon the time
of exercise. The majority of the new common stock was to be issued
to the preferred stockholders of Consolidated. A portion of the
common stock was also reserved for issuance upon the exercise of stock
purchase warrants to be issued to the common stockholders of Consolidated.
In its brief, the Commission took the position that the priority
doctrine set forth in the Los Angeles Lumber case is applicable to
solvent debtors as well as to insolvent debtors. It also submitted
that the plan was unfair to the bondholders since the contract rights
of the bondholders to full priority were substantially impaired by the
cancellation of their secured interest, conversion of their fixed interest
obligation into income bonds and noncumulative stock, the loss of
their creditor status to the extent of one-half of their principal claim
and the extension of the maturity of the remaining half of that claim,
the reduction of the interest rate on their securities, and the elimination of their creditor protection for the benefit of the preferred
stockholders of the parent, whose claims were junior to those of the
bondholders. The Commission also indicated that there was no
justification for the participation of Consolidated's common stockholders, since they had no equity in the enterprise and made no fresh
contribution to it.
The circuit court of appeals, on the rehearing, altered its previous
decision and reversed the order of the district court confirming the

68

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

plan," The court held that the plan was unfair in depriving the
bondholders of their right to fully compensatory treatment prior to
the satisfaction of junior claims. The court also held that the priority doctrine of the Los Angeles Lumber case was the sole test of the
fairness of a plan of reorganization, regardless of the solvency or insolvency of the debtor. The court also indicated that since it must
of necessity pass independent judgment upon the fairness of the plan,
the question of the amount paid for his securities by the objecting
bondholder is immaterial upon consideration of the fairness and equity
of the plan.
In an appeal to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit in the matter of Oscar Nebel Oompany, Inc., questions were raised as to the correctness of the finding of the district
court that there was no value in the enterprise for the interests of the
common stockholders of the debtor and as to the right of a junior
class of stockholders whose interests are valueless to participate
under a plan of reorganization. Upon the Commission's investigation in this case in the district court, it had appeared that the value
of the debtor upon the basis of a capitalization of reasonably prospective earnings was insufficient to satisfy more than the claims of the
creditors and part of the interests of the preferred stockholders. A
plan was formulated which provided participation in the reorganized
company only for creditors and preferred stockholders. This plan
was approved by the district court. The chief holder of the common
stock of the debtor appealed from the order approving the plan.
In its brief upon the appeal, the Commission argued that a goingconcern value of the debtor obtained by a capitalization of reasonably
prospective earnings showed no value for the interests of the common
stockholders and that common stockholders of the debtor could not
therefore be included in a plan of reorganization. The order of the
district court approving the plan of reorganization was affirmed by
the circuit court of appeals without opinion.'?
The circumstances under which stockholders without an equity in
a debtor may participate under its reorganization plan by providing a
fresh contribution has also been considered. The Commission :fileda
supplemental memorandum in cases involving the Highland Towers
Oompany, the Whitmore Plaza Oorporation, and the Metropolitan
Holding Oompany in the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit, taking the position that a "need" must be shown
for the contribution of new consideration upon the basis of which
stockholder participation was permitted and that stockholders have
no vested right to participate in a reorganized debtor upon the basis

of a contribution which may not be necessary for the benefit of the
debtor and its senior security holders. The circuit court of appeals
held that the contributions of new consideration, in each case the
cancellation of bonds of the debtor purchased by the stockholders,
were inadequate to meet the requirements of the rule stated in the
Los Angeles Lumber case."
A memorandum similar to the one outlined above was also filed by
the Commission in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Wisconsin in the matter of Associated Oumers, Inc. In
that case, the court expressly held 12 that "in order for the stockholders to share in the new plan, they must not only make an adequate
contribution, but it must be shown that there was need for such
contribution. "
ADVISORY REPORTS

ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

Under the terms of the Bankruptcy Act, the Commission submits
formal advisory reports on plans of reorganization submitted to it by
the courts. The primary purpose of an advisory report is to provide
an impartial survey and critique of a plan for the use of the judge
in determining whether or not to approve a plan. If the judge
approves the plan, copies of the Commission's advisory report, or
summaries thereof prepared by the Commission, are submitted to all
creditors and stockholders of the debtor who are affected by the plan.
Thus, the advisory report also serves the function of aiding security
holders in reaching their decision with regard to the acceptance or
rej ection of the plan.
Although the advisory report bulks largest in the public consideration of the Commission's work under the Bankruptcy Act, because of
the fact that it is usually widely distributed, it by no means represents
the major part of the Commission's activities in any particular case.
As has been noted, the Commission in its capacity as a party to a
proceeding may be, and usually is, actively interested in the solution
of every major issue arising therein. Throughout a reorganization
proceeding the Commission lends its assistance and advice as to legal
and financial matters to the court and to the trustee and other parties.
In order to enable the Commission to perform its duties as a party to

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the proceeding conscientiously, it is necessary to undertake in every
case in which it participates the same intensive legal and financial
studies as are necessary for the preparation of a formal advisory report.
In every case in which it is expected that plans will be referred to it
for advisory reports, the Oommission seeks to become a party as
early as possible in the proceedings, in order to be certain that its
advisory reports represent matured and informed consideration.
Furthermore, as has been indicated, the Oommission undertakes the
same burden of study and analysis respecting plans in cases in which
plans are not likely to be submitted to it for a formal advisory report.
In such cases, it is necessary for the Oommission to be prepared to
comment in court upon the plans of reorganization and to discuss
proposals with the parties while the plans are in a formative stage.
During the past fiscal year, the Oommission submitted seven
advisory reports on plans of reorganization. In addition, five supplemental advisory reports were filed in proceedings where advisory
reports had already been submitted and one other supplemental
advisory report was in the course of preparation at the end of the
fiscal year. In twenty-seven other cases in which no plan of reorganization had as yet been approved and in which the indebtedness
involved exceeded $3,000,000, plans will be referred to the Oommission
automatically for advisory reports before approval by the judge.
Of the seven proceedings in which the Commission filed advisory
reports, three were instituted under Chapter X, while the remaining
four were Section 77B proceedings in which the judge deemed it
practicable to apply the provisions of Ohapter X. In six of these
seven cases, the indebtedness involved was in excess of $3,000,000
and reference of plans of reorganization to the Oommission for advisory
reports was mandatory.
In the remaining case, instituted under
Section 77B, the Commission was requested to file an advisory report.
A brief discussion of these advisory reports follows:

LaFrance Ind'U8tries, Debtor, and Pendleton Manufacturing Oompany,
SubBidiary.-Prior to the Commission's participation in this proceeding, three plans had been proposed but had failed of acceptance.
After the Oommission became a party, a further plan was filed which
provided for a 6 percent first mortgage loan of $600,000 from the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation; the issuance to the holders of
$1,462,500 principal amount of 5 percent first mortgage bonds outstanding, on which $292,500 of interest had accrued, of 4 percent
second mortgage bonds in the principal amount of $731,250 (half of
the principal of the outstanding first mortgage bonds) and 6 percent
cumulative preferred stock in the principal amount of $877,500 (half
of the principal of the outstanding first mortgage bonds plus half of
the accrued interest); the issuance of $173,735 of certificates of indebtedness in exchange for 50 percent of unsecured claims outstanding

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

71

against the debtor and its subsidiary, and payment of the other
50 percent of such claims in cash; and the retention by the holders
thereof of the 164,918 shares of debtor's common stock outstanding.
The plan was later amended to provide also for the allocation of
15 percent of the common stock to the holders of the first mortgage bonds outstanding and, as so amended, was referred to the
Commission.
The Commission concluded in its advisory report that the amended
plan was not fair in that it required the first mortgage bondholders to
relinquish contractual rights and priorities without adequately compensating them for their sacrifices. The Commission also concluded
that the plan was not feasible, principally because dividends on the
new cumulative preferred stock could not be paid and large arrearages would accumulate while the Reconstruction Finance Corporation
loan was outstanding.
Following submission of the Commission's report, the plan was
further amended to provide for issuance to the first mortgage bondholders of additional 6 percent cumulative preferred stock in the
principal amount of $146,250, representing the remaining half of the
accrued interest on the bonds, and as so amended the plan was again
referred to the Commission. In its supplemental advisory report,
the Commission concluded that while this amendment eliminated one
important element of unfairness in the plan, the debtor failed to meet
the objections to fairness set forth in its advisory report and, furthermore, that the issuance of additional cumulative preferred stock
rendered more acute the problem of feasibility. The amended plan
was approved by the court.
Reynolds Investing Oompany, Inc.-The debtor is an investment
company with $3,439,900 of publicly held debentures and two classes
of stock outstanding.
As of December 31, 1939, its assets consisted
of about $200,000 of cash and approximately $2,800,000 estimated
value of securities in its portfolio. In addition, the Chapter X
trustees reported that substantial causes of action existed against
former officers and directors of the company, the face amount of such
actions being in excess of $3,000,000.
After an extensive investigation of the company's affairs, the
trustees determined that the company should be gradually liquidated,
this decision being based largely on the fact that a disproportionately
large part of the company's portfolio was concentrated in so-called
"special situations" rather than income-producing securities. Accordingly, the trustees filed a plan which, as later amended, was
referred to the Commission for examination and report under ChapterX.
The plan contemplated the gradual liquidation of the company
over a maximum period of eight years. It provided that the assets

72

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the company (exclusive of causes of action, which were to be
prosecuted by the trustees) would be taken over by a new company
to be called Reynolds Realization Corporation. The new company
was to issue to the debenture holders new debentures in the same
face amount and having the same interest rate as the outstanding
debentures, Class A voting trust certificates representing ownership
interests in new preferred stock, share for share for the outstanding
preferred stock and Class B voting trust certificates representing
ownership interests in the new common stock, at the rate of one share
for each ten shares of outstanding common stock.
The plan, based on the assumption that the company would liquidate its assets and retire the debentures with all reasonable expedition,
provided specifically that securities in the portfolio must be sold upon
reaching certain prices, prohibited reinvestment of the proceeds, and
prescribed a certain rate of retirement for the debentures during the
8-year period. It was provided that no distribution could be made
to the stockholders until complete retirement of the debentures and
that all preferred stock must be retired before any distribution on the
common. The plan permitted retirement of the debentures through
tenders, open market purchases, and redemption by lot. The plan
provided that the company should be managed by a board of five
directors, three of whom were to be elected by debenture holders so
long as any debentures were outstanding and the asset value of the
debentures remained less than 200 percent of par.
In its report, the Commission qualified its approval of the plan by
suggestions for its modification in certain particulars with a view to
making the plan more consistent with liquidation principles. It was
suggested that the plan provide for a speedier rate of liquidation in
order that the senior security holders would not be subjected to risks
of market depreciation beyond those necessarily incident to an orderly
liquidation, that further consideration be given to the advisability of
providing for retirement of the debentures by pro rata distribution,
and that the debenture holders be represented by a majority of the
board until all debentures had been retired, irrespective of the asset
value of such debentures at any given time. It was further suggested
that the new securities plainly indicate on their face that they represented interests in a liquidating rather than a continuing enterprise.
After the submission of the Commission's advisory report, the
trustees filed an amended plan designed to meet the Commission's
criticism of the original plan. This amended plan was referred to the
Commission, which issued a supplemental advisory report finding the
plan fair and feasible and recommending its approval by the court,
The plan was thereafter approved by the district court, accepted by
the security holders, and confirmed by the court.
San Francisco Bay ToU-Bridge Oompany.-The
plan originally filed

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

73

by the trustee in this case provided for participation by bondholders,
debenture holders, and two classes of stockholders, but, as a result of
hearings at which representatives of the Commission developed
testimony indicating that the value of the bridge did not justify
participation by junior interests, this plan was amended to eliminate
stockholders. As submitted to the Commission, it provided for the
issuance of $4,303,000 of 6~ percent income bonds and a Class A
preferred stock to present bondholders, and for the issuance of Class
B stock to debenture holders. The Commission's report concluded
that the plan was not feasible because prospective earnings of the
debtor's property would not be sufficient to meet the interest charges
on the bonds, so that there was no reasonable prospect of paying the
bonds in accordance with their terms prior to the expiration of the
company's 37-year bridge franchise, and that the Class A and Class B
stocks would be worthless for all practical purposes. The report also
concluded that the plan, which was based on the assumption that all
the debtor's assets were subject to the lien of the indenture securing
the bonds, was unfair in recognizing debenture holders because the
value of the assets was less than the bondholders' claims. At the
time of filing the report, however, representatives of the Commission
pointed out to the court and thereafter discussed with the parties the
possibility that certain assets were not subject to the lien of the bond
indenture and that consequently debenture holders might be entitled
to participation under the plan on the basis of such free assets.
Subsequent to the filing of the Commission's report, further hearings were held as a result of which an amended plan was filed and
referred to the Commission. It provided for the issuance of $4,303,000
of 3 percent income bonds and all of the common stock of the reorganized company to bondholders. Debenture holders were offered, by
reason of their claim to free assets, a cash payment of 1~ percent of
the face amount of their debentures. In its supplemental report, the
Commission concluded that, subject to the determination of a legal
question affecting the amount of participation by debenture holders,
the amended plan was fair. The Commission further concluded,
however, that the plan remained unfeasible, although manifesting in
this regard a considerable improvement over the original plan. Basically, the Commission's criticisms of this aspect of the plan were
predicated on the excessive debt structure proposed, which would
cause the debtor to emerge from reorganization in an insolvent
condition.
At the hearing upon approval of the amended plan, the Commission's representatives pointed out that the principal justification urged
for retention of the excessive debt provided for by the plan, namely,
alleged unfavorable tax consequences which it was claimed would
ensue from reduction of such debt, had been eliminated by an amend-

74

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ment of Section 270 of the Bankruptcy Act.13 The plan was approved
by the court.
Flour Mills of America .....::....Twoplans were referred to the Commission for an advisory report in this proceeding. One, filed by the
trustee, provided for the issuance to the noteholders of 4 percent
20-year income notes in a face amount equivalent only to their claim
for principal. No provision was made for the accrued interest on the
notes. The preferred stockholders of the debtor were to receive all
the new common stock; no provision was made for the old common
stockholders since the value of the debtor was admittedly insufficient
to compensate prior claimants. This plan was predicated upon an
assumed valuation of some $3,200,000 which was in turn predicated
upon anticipated average earnings of $250,000 per year, capitalized
at 8 percent. From the Commission's investigation, it appeared that
there was no adequate support for the estimated annual earnings of
$250,000. The record of the debtor for the 5 preceding years had been
largely a succession of losses. Furthermore, as a matter of financial
judgment, it appeared that the risks of the enterprise were far greater
than would justify an 8 percent capitalization rate.
The Commission stated in the advisory report its belief that the
value of the enterprise did not equal the amount of the claims of the
noteholders. Consequently, it expressed the opinion that the trustee's
plan was unfair in allocating any participation to the preferred stockholders. The Commission further pointed out that even if the valuation sponsored by the trustee were used as a basis for judging the plan,
the plan was nonetheless unfair since the securities to be issued to the
noteholders did not have a value approaching even the principal
amount of their claim and no compensation was allocated to them
for their accrued interest. The Commission also indicated its belief
that the plan of reorganization was not feasible, because a corporation
such as the debtor, whose earning power was clouded with doubt,
should not be burdened with debt securities. The fact that, under
the terms of the notes, no default could occur until maturity, did not,
in the opinion of the Commission, remove the basic defect in the
structure. In any event, it was pointed out that the 'amount of debt
securities to be issued was excessive even on the valuation of the
debtor sponsored by the trustee.
.
The Commission was of the opinion that the plan filed by a noteholders' committee, which assumed that the debtor was insolvent and
which provided for an issue of common stock to the noteholders as the
only securities of the new company, was fair and feasible and should
have been approved. The court, however, in a memorandum opinion
indicated that it found the debtor to be solvent and that the trustee's
plan would be fair if provision were made for the noteholders' accrued

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

75

interest. The trustee's plan was amended to provide for the issuance
of non-interest-bearing certificates for such accrued interest, for the
issuance of some common stock to the noteholders, and for a more
valuable conversion privilege. On the court's finding that the debtor
was solvent, the plan, as amended, which allocated to the noteholders
the above-mentioned notes, non-interest-bearing certificates for their
accrued interest, common stock, and a conversion privilege that would
enable them to convert their notes into common stock and thereby
obtain a portion of the common stock roughly equivalent to the ratio
which their claims bore to the value assumed by the trustee, could be
considered fair. The Commission, however, in its supplemental
advisory report, also pointed out that in its opinion the plan, as
amended, appeared not feasible for the reasons set forth in its original
report. The plan, as amended, was approved by the court.
Deep Rock Oil Oorporation.-Prior to the Commission's participation
in this case, a minority committee for the preferred stockholders
appealed to the United States Supreme Court from the confirmation of
a plan of reorganization which allocated to the Standard Gas and
Electric Company, the parent company of the debtor, 73 percent of the
common stock of the new corporation in respect of its open account
claim against the debtor. The Supreme Court disapproved the plan
in an opinion which stated that Standard's participation must be in
subordination to the claims of the preferred stockholders of the debtor
because of its record of spoliation and mismanagement of the debtor. It
Upon the return of the case to the district court, it was proposed to file
a plan of reorganization which would provide for the issuance of
$11,000,000 of new notes to the old stockholders, $5,000,000 par value
of Class A stock, with certain preference provisions, to the preferred
stockholders, and an issue of common stock to be divided on the basis
of 25 percent to the noteholders, 12~ percent to the preferred stockholders, and 62~ percent to Standard.
Upon entering the proceeding,
the Commission took the position that such a plan was not feasible on
the basis of the past financial record -of the company and that the
Supreme Court's decision properly interpreted required the exclusion
of Standard from the reorganization, since the value of the debtor's
assets was insufficient to satisfy the prior claims of the noteholders and
preferred stockholders.
Subsequently, the Reorganization Committee filed a plan providing
for the issuance to the noteholders of $5,500,000 in new 6 percent notes
and 80 percent of the common stock after a distribution to them of
cash in partial compensation of accrued interest. The balance of the
common stock was to be issued to the preferred stockholders. No
participation was provided for Standard, since the district court had
decreed that the Supreme Court decision required that the claims of

76

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the noteholders and preferred stockholders should first be satisfied and
that thereafter there was no equity in the enterprise for Standard.
The Commission, in its advisory report, pointed out that the value of
the debtor was apparently less than the claim of the noteholders and
that the preferred stockholders were therefore entitled to no participation. The Commission also considered the proposed plan in the light
of the maximum value for the enterprise previously adopted by the
court. The Commission concluded that, on the basis of the latter
value, the proposed plan was fair. The Commission held that another
plan, offered by the Independent Preferred Stockholders' Committee,
which would have provided for $7,000,000 of new notes to the noteholders and a division of the common stock evenly between the noteholders and the preferred stockholders was unfair under either value.
At a hearing on the proposed plans, the district court reaffirmed its
earlier decision on the value of the debtor. The court indicated that
in its opinion a somewhat greater participation should be given to the
preferred stockholders. The Reorggnization Committee's plan was
thereupon amended to give 75 percent of the common stock to the
noteholders and 25 percent to the preferred stockholders. The Commission, in a supplemental advisory report, indicated its belief that
the new allocation of stock was not a change materially affecting its
prior conclusions on the fairness of the plan. The Reorganization
Committee's plan, as amended, was approved by the court; the plan
of the independent preferred stockholders was disapproved. The
plan approved by the court was accepted by the security holders and
confirmed by the court OnJuly 24,1940.
Standard Gas and Electric Company appealed from the order by
the district court determining that on the basis of the Supreme Court's
decision it had no right to participate under any reorganization plan.
The Commission filed a brief and participated in the argument of
the case before the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit, which in a unanimous opinion 15 upheld the interpretation sponsored by the Commission and adopted by the district court
that Standard had no right to participate under the plan until the
noteholders and preferred stockholders were fully compensated for
their claims. It has been indicated that a petition for certiorari from
this decision would be filed with the Supreme Court of the United
States. Standard has also appealed from the district court's orders
of approval and confirmation of the plan, but such appeals have not
yet been heard by the circuit court of appeals.
Penn Timber Oompany.-As stated in the Commission's previous
annual report," the Commission submitted an advisory report in
which it concluded that the debtor's plan filed in this proceeding was

neither fair nor feasible. As of the close of the 1939 fiscal year the
matter was still pending. The trustee had since filed a petition for
a hearing to consider whether the value of the debtor's assets warranted participation in any plan by interests junior to the first mortgage bondholders; the Commission also filed a petition for an order
disapproving the plan and declaring Section 169 of the Bankruptcy
Act applicable to the proceeding. At the hearings held on these
petitions, additional evidence was introduced with respect to the value
of the debtor's assets and, with the permission of the court, the Commission filed a supplemental advisory report on the basis of such additional evidence. In its supplemental report, the Commission concluded that the additional evidence did not warrant a finding of value
for the debtor's assets sufficient to entitle junior creditors to participate in the plan. The court disapproved the plan, found that the
value of the debtor's assets did not exceed the first mortgage debt,
declared Section 169 applicable to the proceeding, and directed the
trustee to file a new plan.
Porto Rican American Tobacco Oompany.-The
plan referred to the
Commission provided for the sale of the assets of the chief operating
subsidiary of the debtor to a competing company for some $4,000,000
in notes, A new corporation was to be organized to hold the balance
of the assets. Each bondholder of the debtor was to receive $940
principal amount of the notes for each $1,000 bond of the debtor or, at
his option, $846 in cash. In addition, the bondholders were to receive
78 percent of the common stock of the new corporation; the remaining
22 percent was to be issued to the Class A stockholders of the debtor.
The Class B stockholders of the debtor were found to have no equity
and were excluded from participation in the plan. The Commission,
in its advisory report, concluded that the plan, which provided for an
ultimate liquidation of all the assets of the debtor, was a reorganization
plan; that the sale of the subsidiary to a competing company was
reasonable and was being made at a reasonable price; and that the
value of the notes to be received by the debtor for its interest in the
subsidiary was such that the provisions for their issuance to the bondholders and for the division of the common stock of the new corporation were fair and equitable.
Upon an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, the order of the district court approving the plan was
affirmed.'? The court of appeals held that the plan was a reorganization plan and that the division of securities was fair. It also accepted
the going-concern value of the debtor's assets recommended by the
Commission in its advisory report and adopted by the district court,
which was based upon a capitalization of reasonably anticipated
earnings, for the purpose of determining the reasonableness of the sale

of the assets of the subsidiary, and indicated clearly that the strict
priority doctrine is applicable to plans of reorganization for solvent
corporations as well as for insolvent corporations. The requisite
percentage of the Class A stockholders, however, failed to accept the
plan and proceedings were instituted under Section 216 of the Bankruptcy Act to appraise their interest and to pay them for the value of
their equity in the debtor.
Minnesota and Ontario Paper Oompany.-The debtor is both an
operating and a holding company, engaged primarily in the production
and marketing of newsprint and specialty papers, insulating and
building material, and other timber products in the United States,
Canada, and Europe. These activities are carried on either directly
by the debtor or through eighteen subsidiary corporations, all of whose
securities are owned by the debtor or its subsidiaries. Seven of these
subsidiaries are organized under the laws of the State of Minnesota,
seven under the laws of the Province of Ontario or of the Dominion of
Canada, and four under the laws of other foreign countries.
The debtor went into an equity receivership in 1931, which was
superseded by a reorganization proceeding under Section 77B on
July 11, 1934. The Commission filed its notice of appearance in this
proceeding on February 10, 1939, pursuant to Section 208 of the
Bankruptcy Act. The debtor's liabilities, with accrued interest to
August 31, 1939, amounted to approximately $55,000,000, including
$24,400,000 of first mortgage bonds and approximately $13,000,000 of
accrued interest thereon. All but $950,000 principal amount of the
$23,950,000 aggregate principal amount of first mortgage bonds of the
debtor's subsidiaries and some of their stocks were directly or indirectly subject to the lien of the debtor's mortgage, and $22,500,000
of these bonds had the benefit of a floating charge which, under
Canadian law, subjects all of the mortgagor's assets to the lien of the
mortgage in the event of a default. In addition, the debtor had outstanding $4,036,000 par value of preferred stock and $10,092,000 par
value of common stock.
The trustees filed a proposed plan of reorganization dated October
16, 1939, and subsequently filed an amended plan dated December 4,
1939. The October 16 plan contemplated the issuance to the secured
creditors of $9,760,000 principal amount of new 4-percent income
bonds and 72.59 percent of the stock of the reorganized company.
The remaining 27.41 percent of the stock was to be issued to the unsecured creditors. The December 4 plan increased the principal amount
of the proposed bond issue from $9,760,000 to $12,200,000 and allocated the stock of the reorganized company between the secured and
unsecured creditors in the same percentages. After extensive hearings
on these plans and on objections and proposed amendments thereto
before the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota,

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

79

Fourth Division, the plans, objections, and proposed amendments
were referred to the Commission for examination and report pursuant
to the provisions of Section 172 of the Bankruptcy Act. The Commission's report was filed on June 24, 1940.
All of the plans and proposed amendments which were referred to
the Commission recognized the absence of any equity in the debtor's
assets and therefore properly accorded no participation for either
the preferred or the common stock. All of them also assumed that the
capitalization of the reorganized company would include both bonds
and stock. The basic questions were the principal amount of new
bonds to be issued to the old bondholders and the distribution of the
new stock between the secured and unsecured creditors. The solution
of these questions required a determination of the value of the debtor's
operating assets and the assets underlying its investments. The
major questions involved in this determination were as follows:
1. Whether the value of such assets should be based primarily
upon the reasonably prospective earnings derivable from the
utilization of those assets or upon "the original cost of fixed
assets, less accrued physical and functional depreciation," as
proposed by the trustee,
2. Whether the relative participations of the several classes
of claimants should be determined on the basis of the consolidated balance sheet or upon a valuation on an earnings basis
of individual companies or groups of companies, and
3. Whether accrued interest since the date of the receivership should be taken into account in measuring the secured
creditors' deficiency claim against" free" assets.

In its advisory report, the Commission took the position that it
was possible to arrive at a valuation on an earnings basis of groups
of companies which were functionally related; that such group
valuations provided a proper basis for the allocation of valuation
among the various classes of claimants; and that under the circumstances it was not necessary or proper to resort to a method of such
doubtful propriety as the original cost basis in determining goingconcern valuation or to determine the relative participations of the
several classes of claimants on the basis of the consolidated balance.
sheet. On this basis, the Commission arrived at a total maximum
going-concern value for the enterprise of approximately $25,594,000.
The Commission also concluded that accrued interest since the date
of the receivership should be taken into account in measuring the
secured creditors' deficiency claim against free assets and that therefore a maximum of $23,018,000, or 90 percent, of the total maximum
going-concern value of the enterprise was allocable to the claims of
the secured creditors and a minimum of $2,576,000, or 10 percent, to
the claims of the unsecured creditors.

80

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

On this basis, the Commission expressed its approval of the Trustees'
Amended Plan dated December 4, 1939, if amended to provide for a
5-percent rate of interest on the new bonds to be issued, as proposed
by the Bondholders' Protective Committee, and to include certain
other amendments proposed either by that committee or by certain
unsecured creditors or recommended in its report. Thereafter, the
trustees :filed an amended plan dated July 16, 1940, including those
amendments and certain other amendments. The Commission was
given an opportunity to :filea supplemental report on these amendments, but did not deem it necessary to do so because the amendments
which had not previously been referred to it and discussed in its
original report appeared to be of a minor nature and did not affect its
conclusion as to the fairness and feasibility of the plan. By order
entered August 14, 1940, the Trustees' Amended Plan dated July 16,
1940, was approved by the court as fair and feasible and equitable.
Thereafter, pursuant to Section 175 (3) of the Bankruptcy Act, the
Commission prepared and filed a summary, dated August 26, 1940, of
its advisory report for transmission to the creditors and stockholders
affected by the plan.

Part III

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to eliminate
manipulation and other abuses in the trading of securities both on
the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets
which together constitute the Nation's facilities for trading in
securities; to make available to the public information regarding
the condition of corporations whose securities are traded on any
national securities exchange; and to control the flow of the Nation's
credit resources into its securities markets.
NATIONAL SECURITIES

EXCHANGES

Relations with Exchanges,

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 contains outright statutory
prohibitions against many practices which the Congress found to be
clearly inimical to the investing public or to the public interest. In
addition, the statute marked out other areas within which the Commission is authorized to regulate the securities markets and the activities of their members by its own rules and regulations. Congress, in
dealing with the problem of relationships between the Commission
and the national securities exchanges, authorized the Commission,
in Section 19 of the statute, to exercise a residual rather than a
direct jurisdiction over many aspects of national securities exchanges
which impinge upon the public interest and the welfare of American
investors. 1 For instance, the Commission is vested with indirect
powers over matters such as the emergency suspension of trading
upon national securities exchanges, safeguards for the financial
responsibility of members, hours of trading, the manner, method, and
place of soliciting business, and the fixing of reasonable rates of commissions and other charges. These powers, whether they be direct
or indirect in their nature, and even though they must be exercised in
accordance with standards erected by Congress, are necessarily
somewhat discretionary in their scope and operation. This approach
to many of the more technical and complex problems of the securities
business was adopted at the suggestion of the representatives of that
business itself. As stated by the Committee on Interstate and
1 Under Section 19 (b) of the Act these residual powers may be exercised
by the Commission only after
the national secnritles exchange concerned has been formally requested to take certain action and has failed
to comply with the Commission's reqoest.

Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives which considered
the legislation"Representatives of the stock exchanges constantly urged a greater degree of
flexibility in the statute and insisted that the complicated nature of the problems
justified leaving much greater latitude of discretion with the administrative
agencies than would otherwise be the case." 2

The story of the Commission's relations with the securities exchanges and the over-the-counter markets during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1940, therefore, consists primarily of the action it has taken
within those areas over which Congress has given it these rule-making
powers.
The Commission's Program for Increasing Safeguards to Customers against
the Risks of Brokerage Insolvencies.

Public protection against 'the manifold dangers attendant upon
brokers' insolvencies, including the risk that their funds and securities
may be misappropriated, was one of the more important problems
which the Congress did not undertake to solve when it passed the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Instead, Congress, by virtue of
several sections of the Act, delegated the solution of these complicated problems, in large part at least, to the Commission.
The task of achieving adequate financial protection for brokerage
customers was, in part, also left by Congress to the brokerage and
stock exchange community. For the Commission, before adopting
its own rules and regulations under Section 19 (b) to safeguard the
financial responsibility of members of a national securities exchange,
must first seek the cooperation of that exchange. Only if the exchange refuses to comply with the Commission's request that it
amend or supplement its rules can the Commission adopt its own
rules under Section 19 (b) to achieve the requested objective. It
has, of course, been the consistent policy of the Commission to proceed as far as possible along the avenue of voluntary cooperation
with the industry before resorting to its formal powers of direct
regulation through the promulgation of rules under the Act.
In its Fifth Annual Report, covering the fiscal year ended June
30, 1939, the Commission discussed the steps wnicn, in accordance
with this policy, it had taken in the course of that year to bring
about, on the part of the financial community itself, a higher measure
of self-policing. Particular reference was there made to the proposal of "brokerage banks" as one method of removing the risks of
fluctuating security values from brokers' performance of the substantial banking and custodial business which they do for their customers. That annual report described in detail the financial and
economic importance of the, billion dollar banking and custodial
business which is now handled by brokers as an incident to the

brokerage functions. The sources of the present dangers to customers,
as they had been so tragically illustrated by the bankruptcy of Richard
Whitney & Company, were also pointed out in their relation to possible
solutions of the problem.
On June 23, 1939, Chairman Frank, still adhering to the policy
of mutual cooperation rather than direct regulatory; measures by the
Commission, publicly asked that immediate study be given to
"brokerage banks" or some other method either of eliminating or
of properly protecting the conduct of the brokers' banking and custodial business. The proposal for a "Central Trust Institution" or,
as it has since been called, a "brokerage bank" had been first advanced
by members of the financial community itself, later, in May 1938,
by William O. Douglas, then Chairman of the Commission, and,
most recently, by Jerome Frank, the present Chairman. Under this
suggestion, a so-called "brokerage bank" would take over and thus
safeguard all the banking and trustee functions of brokers. As a
result, the president of the New York Stock Exchange, ill July 1939,
appointed a committee of non-members referred to as a "Public
Examining Board". 3 This committee was authorized to study the
broad problem of adequate financial protection to customers, as well
as the narrower question of the feasibility of the suggestion for a
"brokerage bank." Meanwhile, the Commission withheld its own
direct action and refrained from promulgating any rules and regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 dealing with this
problem 'pending the "Public Examining Board's" study and the
effectuation of the detailed recommendations which ensued.
Under date of August 31, 1939, the New York Stock Exchange's
committee published its report. Although the report of this committee urged a number of detailed improvements in brokerage practice,
it expressed the view that certain objections to the suggestion for
"brokerage banks" made it "undesirable in the present situation."
On the whole, the 14 specific recommendations of the committee
seemed primarily designed to preserve, with some additional safeguards, the existing fusion of the brokerage with banking and trustee
functions of holding customers' funds and customers' securities.
The report of the New York Stock Exchange's committee summarized
its own affirmative recommendations as follows:
"FREE

CREDIT

BALANCES

"1. Customers' cash balances left in brokers' hands should either be segregated
from the broker's own funds in special earmarked deposits in commercial banks,
or the broker should receive from the customer specific authorization to use the
deposit in his business.
"2. We recommend that the Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange

Commission join in endeavoring to secure the adoption of amendments to the
federal bankruptcy act to make it clear that balances so segregated and securities
held in safekeeping and in segregation are not subject to the claims of the broker's
general creditors in case of his insolvency.
"3. The rules of the Exchange respecting capital requirements should be
amended so that a member firm is not penalized (as at present) for placing customers' credit balances in segregation.
"SERVICE
"4. The Exchange should adopt
ice charges such as, for example,

securities.
"SEPARATE

"5. The rules of the Exchange should make it clear that a customer, if he so
desires, may request his broker to act as his agent in negotiating a separate individual loan from a bank, secured by the customer's collateral.
"STOCK

EXCHANGE

INCOME

AND RESERVES

"6. The income of the Stock Exchange should be increased out of service charges,
a transaction tax, or otherwise, in an amount sufficient to balance its budget
and also build up a substantial reserve fund available to meet emergency or
unusual needs which may arise.
"FIDELITY

INSURANCE

"7. The rules of the Exchange should provide for standard minimum amounts
of fidelity insurance on employees, to be maintained by member firms, and to the
extent found feasible after further study these rules should be extended to cover
insurance on partners.
"SEPARATION

OF UNDERWRITING

FROM BROKERAGE

BUSINESS

"8. All firms making dealing and underwriting commitments in excess of their
capital should be required, as soon as satisfactory mechanisms are devised, to
separate their brokerage from their dealing and underwriting business either by
"(a) Ineorporating their brokerage business (with full guarantee of the
partnership), or
"(b) Incorporating their dealing and underwriting business.
"CAPITAL

~EQUIREMENTS

"9. We recommend an increase from $25,000 to $50,000 in the minimum capital
requirements of member firms carrying customers' accounts.
"MARGIN

FOR COMMODITY

ACCOUNTS

"10. We suggest that the Exchange consider the adoption of rules requiring
for commodity accounts the same minimum margins as required by the rules of
commodity exchanges.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT
"FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

85

AND AUDITS

"11. Member firms should distribute to all customers, at least annually, a
printed financial statement, audited and certified by a firm of public accountants.
This document should contain a clear statement of the broker's policy in the
handling of customers' free credit balances.
"12. The Exchange rules should provide that every active member doing
business as an individual should file a financial statement annually with the
Exchange.
"13. We recommend that the annual audit of member firms by public accountants be conducted on a surprise basis; and include a spot check of the firm's
records of receipts from and deliveries of cash and securities to individual customers.
"14. Since the Stock Exchange's examining force and periodic inspections are
its principal mechanism for self-supervision, we recommend further strengthening
of the examining staff."

Between September 1, 1939, and the close of the past fiscal year,
June 30, 1940, the exchange has done the following to effectuate the
recommendations of this nonmember committee:
1. On September 15, 1939, minimum capital requirements
for a member firm doing any business with anyone, other than
members or member firms, were increased from $25,000 to
$50,000.
2. On March 28, 1939, the Board of Governors of the Exchange referred to the Committee on Member Firms a report
pursuant to which affiliated corporations may be formed on a
permissive basis so as to insulate brokerage customers, at least
partially, from the financial hazards of the underwriting and
dealer business (the most dangerous phases of the securities
business) which are engaged in by member firms. However,
when the Committee on Member Firms was authorized to
receive applications to form such affiliated corporations, it was
also instructed not to compel the formation of such corporate
underwriting and dealer affiliates. To date, one such corporation has been set up.
3. Thej exchange, on January 19, 1940, required that the
annual independent audit of member firms be made on a surprise basis. However, the date for the surprise audit is selected not by the exchange but by the accountant employed
by the member firm to be thus audited.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The following have not been done:
1. No action h88 been taken to require the segregation of
free credit balances of customers who have not authorized the
broker to use their funds in the conduct of his own business.
The exchange h88 expressed the view that such segregation
might prove ineffective unless and until, through amendments
to the Bankruptcy Act, such funds so segregated would be
clearly recoverable by customers after bankruptcy.
2. Although counsel for the New York Stock Exchange has
conferred with the Commission on the matter, it /h88 not yet
been possible, owing to technical and other difficulties, to have
presented to Congress a specific amendment to Section 60 (e)
of the Bankruptcy Act which would make it clear that customers' free credit balances so segregated and customers' securities segregated in safekeeping or 88 "excess margin" may
be reclaimed by such customers.'
3. No rules have been adopted to "make it clear" that a customer may obtain, through his broker, separate individual
loans from banks secured by the customer's own collateral.
The exchange h88 taken the position that no action along this
line is necessary since customers of a member firm always had
and still have the right to request the firm to act as agent in
negotiating a separate loan secured by the customer's collateral.
4. No steps have been taken to build up a reserve fund
available to meet emergency or usual needs which may arise.
5. Although counsel to the New York Stock Exchange has
conferred with representatives of the fidelity insurance industry,
the technical problems involved in such an extension of the
principle of fidelity insurance have as yet prevented the adoption of rules to require standard minimum amounts of fidelity
insurance on partners as well as on employees of member firms.
6. The exchange has taken no steps to require that member
firms undertaking dealer and underwriter commitments in
excess of their capital should be required to separate the
financial risks of their dealer and underwriter business from
their brokerage business .

7. The exchange has not adopted rules requiring minimum
margins for commodity accounts.
8. Although the exchange, on September 19, 1939, did adopt
a rule requiring its member firms to distribute to all of their
customers annual printed statements showing their financial
condition, this requirement was rescinded on November 13,
1939. Although the monthly statements to customers of
member firms must advise customers that they may obtain
copies of the firm's financial statement, customers have had
this right since March 1938. The exchange also considers
it inexpedient at this time to adopt the further recommendation of the H Public Examining Board" that member firms
should endorse on financial statements a legend specifying the
policy of the firm in handling customers' free credit balances.
9. Although the exchange, on March 1, 1940, made certain
minimum service charges on customers' accounts effective,
this requirement was rescinded on March 27, 1940.
10. The exchange has not required individual members to
file financial statements with it.
11. The exchange has not, so far as the Commission is aware,
taken any steps towards the further strengthening of its
examining staff.
Exchanges

Registered

and Exempted

from Registration.

During the past fiscal year, there has been no change in the number
of exchanges registered with the Commission as national securities
exchanges, but, for the first time in four years, there was a change in
the number of exchanges exempted from such registration.
The Milwaukee Grain and Stock Exchange made application to the
Commission on April 9, 1940, to withdraw its application for exemption from registration as a. national securities exchange. In this
application, the exchange stated:
"Trading in securities on this Exchange was suspended as of April 1, 1938, for
the reason that the volume had declined to a very low point and a number of the
firms relinquished their memberships.
It was thought that trading could be
resumed at a later date, but that appears very unlikely at present. and it therefore is deemed advisable to make application for withdrawal."

This:application was granted by the Commission in its order of May
1, 1940, wherein the Commission's orders dated November 5, 1935,
and March 7, 1936, under Section 5 of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, granting said application for exemption, were set aside.

There have been the usual changes in the rules, practices, and organization of the registered and exempted exchanges as reflected in
their applications for registration or exemption. Consequently, during
the past fiscal year, the national securities exchanges filed 154 amendments to their applications and 24 amendments were received from
exempted exchanges. Each of these amendments was studied and
analyzed, not only that the Commission might determine compliance
with relevant legislation and regulations, but also to the end that
appropriate comments and suggestions could be addressed to the
exchanges concerned in order to facilitate the performance of their
public obligations.

STEPS TAKEN TO GUARD AGAINST DISORDERLY
SECURITIES MARKETS

Critical market conditions caused by the outbreak of war in Europe
during the past fiscal year called for intense scrutiny by the Commission of day -to-day and even hourly developments. Section 19 (a) (4)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorizes the Commission
"* * * if in its opinion the public interest so requires, * * *
with the approval of the President, summarily to suspend all trading
on any national securities exchange for a period not exceeding ninety
days." It was apparent to the Commission that sudden military
developments abroad might well create a condition in the securities
markets requiring the exercise of this authority.
As early as April 1938, when Austria was annexed by Germany,
the Commission had set up machinery for keeping itself informed of
current developments-in
order to keep ahead of actual market
response to various occurrences. Even at that time, the orders
which would have been necessary for the exercise of the statutory
powers had been prepared so as to be ready at a moment's notice if
market conditions should make it imperative to use them. At the
same time, extensive studies were made to determine as closely as
possible what might be the impact upon our securities markets of
an actual declaration of war in Europe. Recalling that it had been
necessary for the New York Stock Exchange to close in 1914, when
the World War began, efforts were made to determine what, if any,
analogies existed between 1914 and 1938.
When, in September 1939, war actually was declared, the preparation which the Commission had made proved most valuable. Lines
of direct communication to valuable sources of information in the
financial community were quickly reestablished. Liaison with each
of the national securities exchanges was immediately developed
through the regional offices of the Commission. In this way, the
Commission was able to know currently about the volume and trend
of orders in brokerage offices even before those orders actually reached
the floors of the exchanges for execution.
Although the securities markets accepted the beginning of actual
hostilities in Europe with equanimity, the Commission's experience
gained during the September rally, together with the intermission for
further study which was afforded by the strength of the market, was
to prove most helpful when the invasion of the Low Countries by
Germany, in May 1940, produced violent repercussions in our securities markets. During that intermission, the Commission had increased the efficiency of its mechanisms for gathering advance market,
economic, and international information and, hence, was in a better
position to appraise each succeeding development as it arose. Studies
were made to determine the extent to which the nationals of each

90

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

European country might liquidate American securities together with
the likelihood that belligerent nations themselves might be required
to finance their activities by liquidation of American securities. The
domestic situation was also carefully reviewed and currently reanalyzed. This included a consideration of such technical factors as
the extent of short positions and the volume oJ margin commitments.
Plans were also worked out so that-if it should become necessary to
close the stock exchanges, "bootleg" markets would not grow up in
the over-the-counter field and trading would be controlled in such
markets by cooperative efforts.
Closing the exchanges-the securities markets-has
always been
regarded as a step which the Commission would initiate only with
the greatest reluctance and only when completely convinced that it
was absolutely necessary. The Commission is well aware of the
importance of free securities markets to the American economy.
Congress, however, in giving the Commission authority to take this
drastic step, with the approval of the President, recognized that
occasions could arise in which a chaotic securities market might so
disrupt and demoralize general business and might so irreparably
damage not only investors but the entire national economy that
closing the markets would be the only alternative. Obviously, no
hard and fast rules to govern the closing of exchanges could be laid
down in a statute, for the reason that there could be no way of telling
what particular kind of a critical situation might develop. But it is
clearly the Commission's continuing duty to so prepare itself that no
crisis can get so far out of hand that catastrophic damage can be done
before the action can be taken.
A critical situation which bore danger signals to warn that the use
of the statutory power might be essential developed immediately
upon the invasion of the Netherlands and Belgium early in May of
1940. To the casual observer, looking back at the chart of daily
stock market movements, it might appear that a chaotic condition
actually did exist. Daily market breaks ranged as high as 10 points
a day for various averages of listed securities, and in individual
securities the daily declines were sometimes much greater.
The Commission, however, was not watching the market from the
standpoint of daily movements. It was maintaining a constant
minute-to-minute scrutiny. Through its machinery for gathering as
much information as possible, it kept constant scrutiny over the
volume and trend of orders as they came into the leading brokerage
offices before those orders reached the floor. Each morning before
the markets were opened, the Commission and its experts were in
contact with its sources of information to find out the character and
size of the brokerage orders which had accumulated over night. It
kept track of the effect of market changes upon margin accounts. It

91
received current reports on the size of short positions and the volume
of short sales. It knew at all times the approximate condition of the
books of the specialists in various leading stocks on the floors of the
various exchanges. It was able, in cooperation with the New York
Stock Exchange, the Treasury, and certain houses specializing in
foreign dealings, to judge the trend and volume of foreign transactions.
The significant factor to be considered was the character of the
market-more
than the trend of the market. Was the market
orderly or was it disorderly? A disorderly market is generally regarded as a market in which prices rise or fall several points between
transactions-or
a market in which no transactions at all are possible
because of the wide spread between the bid and asked prices. By
these standards, the markets of May 1940 were generally orderly.
Prices frequently declined rapidly, but in nearly every instance the
breaks were limited to less than a point between transactions.
At
no time was the market frozen and buyers and sellers could always
transact business at prices within a reasonable relation to the prices
of preceding transactions.
In short, although stocks lost many
points during those first days of the invasion of the Low Countries
and France, there was no time at which the market machinery failed
to function smoothly.
The Commission was, nonetheless, constantly prepared to act if
further developments should bring about the feared break-down.
Members of the Commission were in constant contact with the White
House and the President, at his request, was furnished with current
reports throughout the crisis. In the event that market conditions
should have become so fraught with danger as to make it advisable to
close the exchanges, the Commission, with the approval of the President, would have been ready to act.
Although there has not been a recurrence of a crisis similar to that
which existed in May 1940, the Commission is prepared again to put
its machinery for minute-to-minute market surveillance into operation whenever the need should arise.
MARKET SURVEILLANCE

In enforcing the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
outlawing manipulation of security prices, the Commission's policy
of administration has been based upon the principle that it is far
more in the public interest to prevent, rather than to punish, fraud.
As a result, prompt action is taken whenever any deviation from
normal in either price or volume is of such a nature, after consideration of all the facts, as to suggest a high degree of probability of 8
violation. Although the Commission believes in prompt action, it
should be emphasized that it does not believe in any unnecessary interference with the proper functioning of the market place and, therefore.

92

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the greatest discretion is used in the authorization of an investigation. To some extent, the speed with which the Commission moves,
when it is deemed necessary, lessens the chances of successful punitive
action against those responsible for the fraudulent trading since, in
such cases, manipulation usually dies at its inception and, therefore,
insufficient evidence makes prosecution difficult.
The detection of manipulation is dynamic rather than static because
the methods of the manipulator are continually changing. With his
increased familiarity with the law, he experiments continually with
new and more subtle methods of evasion to which the Commission must
as continually adapt its technique of detection. The Commission
receives many complaints from members of the public and it always
appreciates the spirit of cooperation shown by those members of the
public who are sincerely anxious to offer information which may be of
assistance in the administration of the statutes.
However, of the
total number of complaints received, only a relatively small percent
have to do with matters of manipulation.
While all such complaints
receive the most serious consideration, the task of detection could not
be done satisfactorily if the Commission relied solely upon such sources
of information.
The reports of security transactions filed by officers, directors, and
principal stockholders under the provisions of Section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, are of value in the work of. detection.
Continuing studies of all secondary distributions, based upon information voluntarily furnished the Commission by certain of the exchanges, are also of value in providing necessary background information upon which judgment may be based. Stock tickers are maintained at both the Washington Office and at the New York Regional
Office and the work of the tape readers is frequently of very real value
in promptly detecting violations of certain rules of the exchanges
themselves, but any violation of the anti-manipulative provisions of
the statute must rest upon the establishment of prohibited motives
which are not immediately obvious from the printings on the tape.
Experience has shown, however, that the most effective method of
detection lies in the Commission's systematic observation of the
market behavior of all securities on all national securities exchanges
and the interpretation of the price and volume movements of all
securities on the basis of all factual information which can be obtained.
To that end, there is maintained at the Washington Office of the
Commission a trained staff of specialists with practical experience in
trading, as well as economists and technicians, whose sole responsibility it is to observe systematically by broad industrial categories the
movements in both price and volume of all securities and to develop
from such studies probable cases of manipulation.

.A.N:NU!AL RE'PORT

93

INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission's aim in its administration of the statutory prohibitions against stock market manipulation is a sufficient policing of
the markets in order to accomplish the extinction of the prohibited
forms of manipulation.
On the other hand, the Commission recognizes that this policing must be carried out in a manner which will not
interfere with the legitimate functioning of those markets. It is quick
to track down any suspicious appearances of manipulation, but its
technique of investigation has been developed to the point where a
few well directed inquiries usually suffice to determine the presence
or absence of a prohibited manipulation.
The method is to review and interpret all complaints and reports
of suspicious market movements as well as the Commission's ownfirsthand observations in the light of increasingly more complete files
of current data and its history of experience. In many cases the
Commission readily satisfies itself, without recourse to outside inquiry, that there has been no violation of the anti-manipulative provisions of the Federal securities legislation. In other cases, the usual
first resort is to a "flying quiz" for the purpose of quickly assembling
any essential missing facts. A review of 175 quizzes conducted by the
New York Regional Office shows that it requires only about four interviews to clear up the average case, most of the interviews being with
exchange officials, members, and other brokers and dealers. With
the returns from a "quiz" at hand, the case is again reviewed and is
closed if no violation appears to have occurred. If the "flying quiz"
confirms the Commission's original suspicion of manipulation, a
preliminary trading investigation is next undertaken.
Such an investigation involves a thorough analysis of all transactions.
Finally, a formal trading investigation may be authorized by the
Commission, at which point, for the first time in the process, individual customers and other persons may be required to supply such
information as is necessary to complete the history of the case.
During the past year, improved technique and better coordination
between all the offices of the Commission allowed a broadening of the
sources of detection with an actual decrease in the number of quizzes
and in the number of preliminary and formal trading investigations
initiated. However, 24 formal proceedings against the persons
involved resulted from trading investigations, as against 18 such proceedings in the previous year.
Thus, during the past fiscal year, as a result of these investigations,
2 cases were referred to the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution, 7 persons were enjoined from continuing manipulative activities, 8 cases involving transactions by members of various exchanges
were referred to such exchanges for appropriate action, proceedings
were instituted for the revocation of registration of 2 broker-dealers,

94

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and 3 broker-dealers withdrew their registrations.
On information
proceeding from trading investigations in the first instance, the
Commission issued a stop order under the Securities Act of 1933
suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement with
respect to one stock issue and authorized proceedings to determine
whether the registration on a national securities exchange of another
stock issue should be suspended or withdrawn.

RECORD OF PUBLIC ACTION TAKEN AS A RESULT OF
TRADING INVESTIGATIONS

On October 18, 1939, James H. Rand, Jr., Winfred C. Hoty, James
E. Reynolds, and N arnell, Inc., consented to being permanently
enjoined by the United States District Court for the Southern District
of New York from future violations of Sections 9 (a) (1) and 9 (a)
(2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This action resulted
from an investigation of transactions effected by these persons during
1936 and 1937 in Remington Rand, Inc., common stock listed on the
New York Stock Exchange.
On November 29, 1939, Judge Harold Burke in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York, imposed a
sentence of two years imprisonment and a :fineof $4,000 on Joseph J.
Msscuch, president of Breeze Corporations, Inc. Mascuch was
found guilty of both counts of an indictment charging perjury before
an examiner of the Commission during an investigation of transactions

Court for the Southern District of N ew York for violation of the
provisions of Sections 9 (a) (1) and 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and for conspiracy in the sale of Standard Commercial
Tobacco Oo., Inc., common stock by means of false and fraudulent
misrepresentations.
On February 23, 1940, a second indictment
was returned against the above-named defendants upon 19 additional
mail frauds counts; 1 count for violation of Section 17 (a) (1) and
2 counts for violation of Section 17 (a) (2) of the Securities Act of
1933; and a final count for conspiracy in violation of the mail fraud
statute, Sections 17 (a) (1) and 17 (a) (2) of the Securities Act of
1933, and Sections 9 (a) (1) and 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. This case was referred to the United States Attorney
for the Second District of N ew York by the Commission in April
1939 and resulted from an investigation of the activities and transactions by the above parties during 1937 in Standard Commercial
Tobacco Co., Inc., common stock then listed on the New York Stock
Exchange.
This case was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
On January 29, 1940, Norman W. Minuse was sentenced to 2 years
imprisonment and fined $5,000. Joseph E. H. Pelletier was sentenced
to 18 months in prison and fined $1,000, and Russell VanWyck
Stuart, previously sentenced to 2 years, received a suspended sentence
and was placed on 2 years probation.
These sentences were imposed
by Federal Judge Matthew T. Abruzzo in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of N ew York after a jury had found
these persons guilty of conspiracy to violate Sections 9 (a) (1) (a),
(b), and (c) and Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. This case was referred to the Department
of Justice for
prosecution on May 12, 1938, and resulted from an investigation of
transactions which occurred during 1935 and 1936 in Tastyeast, Inc.,
Class A common stock listed on the New York Curb Exchange.
On February 14, 1940, George J. Morrison and Emil W. Jacques

of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Sentence was suspended
as to Jacques, who was put on probation for two years. The defendants pleaded guilty after the Government's case had been presented.
This action resulted from an investigation of transactions by such
persons during November and December 1934 in BIG Sandwich
Shops, Inc., common stock then listed on the N ew York Produce

A. Isaacs of New York City, and Josiah M. Kirby of Cleveland, Ohio,
were indicted by the Federal Grand Jury in United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York charged with violations
of the anti-manipulative provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, as well as of the mail fraud statutes and conspiracy. This action
resulted from an investigation of the activities and transactions of
these persons during 1936 and 1937 in Automatic Products Corp.
common stock listed on the N ew York Curb Exchange. This case
was referred by the Commission to the Department of Justice on
November 29, 1938, for prosecution. This case was pending at the
close of the fiscal year.
On May 13, 1940, A. W. Porter, Inc., A. W. Porter, and Arthur H.
Johnson consented to being permanently enjoined by the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York from
further manipulative activities in violation of Section 9 (a) (2) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and from selling stock in violation of
the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. This action resulted from an investigation of transactions effected by these persons
during 1939 in Pressed Metals of America, Inc., common stock listed
on the New York Curb Exchange.
On May 20, 1940, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit upon review of the order of the Commission of
February 28, 1938, expelling Charles C. Wright from membership on
the New York Stock Exchange and four other exchanges, found that
Wright had violated Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and upheld the constitutionality of that section, as well as of
Section 19 (a) (3) of such Act, pursuant to which proceedings were
brought to determine whether Wright had violated the anti-manipulative provisions of the Act. The court held that the evidence did not
support the Commission's finding that Wright had also violated
Section 9 (a) (1) in "matching" buying and selling orders. The
court's opinion directed the Commission to consider modification of
its expulsion order to one of suspension.
MARGIN REGULATIONS

Pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, this Commission
has the responsibility of enforcing Regulation T of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System which comprises the margin
regulations promulgated under Sections 7 and 8 (a) of the Act.
During the past fiscal year, within the limits of available time and
personnel, the Commission continued to conduct margin inspections of
brokerage firms.
As during the previous year, emphasis was placed on the inspection
of firms which are not members of national securities exchanges.
Most of the inspections have been of a broad character designed to

SIXTH

.AN:N'U.AL REPOOT

97

determine compliance on the part of brokerage firms with all applicable
rules and regulations, including the margin regulations. During the
past year, margin inspections were made of 160 member and nonmember firms. In accordance with the Commission's usual practice,
the results of certain of these inspections bearing upon compliance
with Regulation T were made available to the Board of Goyernors of
the Federal Reserve System.
Also, during the past year, the Commission received cooperation
from the national securities exchanges with respect to the enforcement
of Regulation T. Each national securities exchange, upon becoming
registered with this Commission, agreed, pursuant to Section 6 (a) (1)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, "* * * to enforce insofar
as is within its powers compliance by its members, with the provisions
of this title, and any amendment thereto and any rule or regulation
made or to be made thereunder;
* * *." Pursuant to this agreement, the New York Stock Exchange reported to the Commission
that it had censured and fined six member firms during the year for
violation of Regulation T.
During the past fiscal year, four more of the Commission's field
offices have carried on margin-inspection work insofar as limited
personnel made it possible. In addition to the New York, Boston,
Chicago, and San Francisco Regional Offices and the Washington
Field Office which were mentioned in the Commission's Fifth Annual
Report, the offices at Atlanta, Denver, Detroit, and Fort Worth have
submitted inspection reports which included the results of margin
inspections.
PEGGING. FIXING. AND STABILIZING OF SECURITY PRICES

On January 3, 1940, the Commission adopted rules and regulations,
designated as Regulation X-9A6-1, effective February 15, 1940,
governing transactions incident to the stabilization of security prices
in certain limited types of situations. This regulation was promulgated pursuant to Section 9 (a) (6) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, which makes it unlawful to effect transactions for the purpose
of stabilizing the price of any security registered on a national securities exchange "in contravention of such rules and regulations as the
Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors." In taking this initial
step toward the substantive regulation of stabilizing activities, the
Commission sought to deal with only a narrow phase of the much
greater problem of security price stabilization considered as a whole.
Differences of viewpoint between the Commission and the underwriting industry and between various representatives of that industry
itself, coupled with the Commission's own awareness of the economic
potentialities of its actions, resulted in its decision to attack the

98

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

problem of stabilization piecemeal, It was felt the safest progress
into this field, where previously there had been no regulation under the
statute, could be made by isolating particular segments of the larger
problem, regulating those segments, and basing further regulation
upon the experience thus derived.
Stabilizing to facilitate so-called "market offerings" where the price
of the security is represented to be at or based upon open market
prices is one segment of the problem of stabilization wherein lies the
greatest potentiality of abuse. Before the Act, market operations to
stimulate the success of this type of offering often constituted not
stabilization, but the most flagrant type of "pool manipulation"
outlawed by Section 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
It was because of the susceptibility of this particular kind of stabilizing
to grave abuses that the Commission determined to single out this
narrow field for the first test of its substantive regulation of stabilizing.
Accordingly, Regulation X-9A6-1, by its terms, is applicable only
where the stabilization of a registered security is undertaken to facilitate an offering of any registered security which is represented to be
"at the market" or at a price related to the market price.
In general, Regulation X-9A6-1, although it unequivocally prohibits
any marking up of prices to facilitate offerings or the rigid "pegging" of
market prices in aid of this type of offering, is designed to permit no
more than the maintenance of an orderly market on the securities
exchange involved during the continuance of the offering. The
regulation, which requires that all purchasers must be given notice of
the stabilizing operation, also provides that during the continuation
of stabilizing a "ceiling" shall be placed upon the price of the stabilized
security by prohibiting the stabilizers from making any purchase or
sale of a security involved in the stabilization above its "maximum
price 0' as fixed by the rule. This provision is designed to remove, so
far as possible, any incentive on the part of the stabilizers to create,
directly or indirectly, a rise in the market price of any security involved
in the stabilization.
As of the close of the past fiscal year, only one stabilizing operation
had been undertaken which was subject to the requirements of the rule.
On March 12, 1940, a notice of intention to stabilize the Class A and
Class B common stock of the Columbia Broadcasting Corporation was
filed by and on behalf of the underwriters of an offering of 20,000
shares of Class A stock and 80,000 shares of Class B stock. These
stocks were all listed and registered on the New York Stock Exchange.
In promulgating Regulation X-9A6-1, the Commission, in its
accompanying statement, expressly recognized that experience in the
actual operation of the regulation may necessitate amendments from
time to time and that the Commission's staff will continue, as it has
in the past, to cooperate with representatives of the investment bank-

SIXTH

.A.NWUAL REPO'RT

99

ing industry in the further study of problems incident to this and other
types of stabilizing.
As of the close of the past fiscal year, experience
in administration of the rules had not indicated the desirability of
making any further amendments in those rules.
Shortly after the promulgation of Regulation X-9A6-1, the Commission published a statement of its policy on the whole broad problem
of the pegging, fixing, and stabilizing of security prices. This statement enunciated the legal, ethical, and economic aspects of the
problem of stabilizing, described its fundamentals,
outlined the
arguments pro and con, and evaluated the alternative courses of
possible Commission action. Pertinent excerpts from this statement
which, for the first time, reached the formal conclusion that the
Commission should adopt a broad program of regulation, are quoted
below:
"It seems clear that the only course open to the .Commission is to adopt regulations which can be revised from time to time as we see how they actually work.
Such regulations must reconcile, as far as possible, the often conflicting objectives
of protecting purchasers of securities, on the one hand, and of preserving the
ready flow of capital into industry, on the other. Here, as in most other fields
of human activity, perfection is an unattainable ideal. Compromise and adjustment are inescapable.
A closer approach to the ideal than is now achievable
may in the future be found in the development of investment banking or other
underwriting institutions with sufficient resources so that the need for stabilizing
can be substantially reduced, even entirely eliminated.
But the growth of
American industry cannot wait upon such a development.
Consequently, the
Commission has concluded that its immediate duty under the statute is to meet
the situation through regulated stabilizing, frankly recognizing the experimental
character of its approach to the problem."

Iri. a separate statement designed to demonstrate that stabilizing
was primarily for the benefit of the underwriters of securities and
not the investors or issuers, Commissioner Healy attacked stabilizing
as a manipulation designed to help induce the public to exchange
its money for a security which the underwriter is selling at a market
price the decline of which, through his own acts, he is preventing or
retarding."
Expressing regret that the majority of the Commission
was willing to accept stabilizing as It an integral part" of our system
of security distribution, he wrote:
It

"I think that the worst possible situation in which to permit stabilizing is
when the offering price is represented to be 'at the market.'
Even when stabilizing is permitted in connection with an offering at a fixed price, the harm to
investors is not to be overlooked for there the stabilized price may frequently
mislead and injure those who buy. The investor, observing the exchange price
or (as often happens) having had his attention called to it by salesmen, believes,
as he has a right to, that the price is one made by the free play of supply and
demand in a fair and unmanipuIa.ted market.
But when the offering price is
'at the market' the possibilities of deception and injury to investors are immeasurably increased.
Securities issued 'at the market' are issued on the theory
that the price is set not by the underwriter but by the interplay of the forces of

100

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

supply and demand.
Yet the regulation by permitting stabilizing of such securities permits an interference with the free forces of supply and demand and
thereby tolerates the creation of a price mirage and the distortion of the price
which would be set by the market if it were to function without artificial support."

Commissioner Healy called attention to the fact that the regulation
permitted stabilizing of secondary as well as primary distribution and
reviewed the American system of security distribution which is characterized by the underwriter's haste to dispose of issues-a haste
which he demonstrated was made necessary by their lack of capital
which often made it impossible for them to enter into truly" firm"
commitments. He concluded that stabilizing in connection with
offerings "at the market" was not in the public interest and that
prohibiting it was necessary for the protection of investors. He
stated that Section 9 (a) (6) gave the Commission ample power to
enact a rule forbidding stabilizing when the distribution was "at
the market."
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1940, the Commission continued its administration of Rule X-17A-2, which requires the filing
of detailed reports of all transactions incident to offerings in respect
of which a registration statement has been filed under the Securities
Act of 1933 where any stabilizing operation is undertaken to facilitate
the offering. During the past fiscal year, 184 out of a total of 337
registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933 contained
a statement of the intention to stabilize to facilitate the offerings
covered by such registration statements.
Because of the fact that
registration statement in some cases covers more than one offering,
there were a total of 205 offerings of securities in respect of which the
statement required by Rule 827 of the rules and regulations under the
Securities Act of 1933 was made to the effect that a stabilizing operation was intended to be undertaken.
Stabilizing operations were
actually conducted to facilitate 71 of these offerings. In the case of
bonds, public offerings of $588,953,140 principal amount were stabilized.
Offerings of stock issues aggregating 5,207,330 shares and having an
aggregate estimated public offering price of $160,143,147 were also
stabilized. Fifty-nine of the stabilizing operations commenced during
the past fiscal year had been completed and notices of termination of
stabilization filed with the Commission prior to June 30, 1940. Twelve
such stabilizing operations were still in progress as of the close of the
past fiscal year and the Commission was still receiving the reports of
detailed transactions required by Rule X-17 A-2 in respect of such
operations.
REGISTRATION

OF SECURITIES

ON EXCHANGES

Purpose and Nature of Registration of Securities on Exchanges.

In order to make available currently to investors reliable and
comprehensive information regarding the affairs of the issuers of

SIXTH .A.:N:N:U.AL REPORT

101

securities listed and registered on a national securities exchange,
Sections 12 and 13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provide for
the filing with the Commission and the exchange of an application for
registration, and annual and other periodic reports, containing certain
specified information. Such applications and reports must be filed on
the forms prescribed by the Commission as appropriate to the particular type of issuer or security involved, which forms are designed to
disclose pertinent information concerning the issuer, its capital structure and that of its affiliates, the full terms of its securities, warrants,
rights, and options, the control and management of its affairs, the
remuneration of its officers and directors, and financial data, including
schedules breaking down the more significant accounts reflected therein.
In general, the Act provides that an application for registration
shall become effective 30 days after the receipt by the Commission of
the exchange's certification of approval thereof, except where the
Commission determines it may become effective within a shorter
period of time. It is unlawful under the statute for any member,
broker, or dealer to effect any transaction in any security (other than
an exempted security) on any national securities exchange unless
registration is effective as to the security for such exchange.
Examination of Applications and Reports.

All applications and reports filed pursuant to Sections 12 and 13 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are examined by the Commission
to determine whether accurate and adequate disclosure has been
made of the information required by the Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. This examination does not involve an appraisal
and is not concerned with the merits of the registrant's securities.
When the examination discloses that material information has not
been furnished in accordance with the requirements, or that generally
accepted accounting principles and procedures have not been followed
in the preparation and presentation of financial statements, the
registrant is so advised by letter, or in conference with its representatives, and any necessary correcting amendments are obtained and
examined in the same manner as the originally filed documents.
Where the examination discloses omissions which are clearly of an
immaterial nature, particularly in connection with periodic reports
under Section 13 of the Act, the registrant may merely be notified
thereof by means of a letter containing suggestions which should be
followed in the preparation and filing of future reports, without insistence upon the filing of an amendment to the particular report in
question.
The examination of an application for registration is made as
promptly as possible after it is filed in order that any material defi273226-41-8

102

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

-
 ciencies may be brought to the attention of the registrant and the
exchange before registration becomes effective in accordance with the
provision of the statute.
While the basic period available for this
purpose is 30 days, it was necessary to complete the examination in
considerably less time in approximately 40 percent of all applications
filed during the past year, inasmuch as the Commission issued orders
accelerating the effective date of registration in these cases.
Since the annual report is required to be filed within 120 days after
the close of the fiscal year of the registrant and because of the fact that
approximately 78 percent of all registrants have fiscal years corresponding to the calendar year," there is filed with the Commission a
peak load of nearly 1,800 annual reports at or about the end of April
each year. Consequently it is necessary to spread the work of examining these annual reports over the ensuing months.
Current reports
are examined during the month in which they are filed.
That the Commission's examination procedure, together with the
policy of publishing the opinions and decisions of the Commission
and the opinions of its Chief Accountant, has been of material assistance to registrants and their accountants is evidenced by an improvement, both immediate and cumulative, noted in the presentation of
factual information in applications for registration and supplemental
periodic reports.
Proceedings under Section 19 (a) (2).

Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 empowers
the Commission, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing,
to deny, to suspend the effective date of, to suspend for a period of not .
exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw, the registration of a security,
if it finds that the issuer of such security has failed to comply with any
provision of the Act or the ru1es and regulations thereunder.

Revision of Certain Registration Forms under the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.

Form 15, used for the registration of securities of incorporated
investment companies on a national securities exchange, and Form
17, used for such registration of securities of unincorporated investment companies, were revised during the past fiscal year. The amendments add an item to the forms proper, requiring certain historical
financial information which was previously furnished in a schedule to
the financial statements.
These amendments were necessary in order
that the financial statements required by Forms 15 and 17 should
conform with the revised instructions governing the form and content
of financial statements contained in the new accounting Regulation
S-X.6 Changes of a minor nature were also made in several of the
other registration forms.
Statistics of Securities Registered or Temporarily Exempted from Registration
on Exchanges.

Up to and including June 30, 1940,2,898 issuers had :filed a total of
5,162 applications for registration of securities under Section 12 of the
Act and a total of 19,454 annual and current reports under Section 13
of the Act. As of June 30, 1940, the registration of securities of 2,408
of these issuers was in effect, and the registration of the securities of
the remaining 490 issuers had ceased to be effective for a variety of
reasons; e. g., withdrawal from registration, etc.

Withdrawal

or Striking

of Securities

from Listing and Registration

on Exchanges.

In accordance with the provisions of Section 12 (d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, applications involving 66 issues were filed with the Commission
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1940, for the withdrawal or
striking of such issues from listing and registration on national securities exchanges. As of June 30, 1939, applications involving 17 issues
were pending. During the past fiscal year, the Commission granted
applications involving 54 issues and suspended decision with respect
to 1 issue; applications involving 7 issues were withdrawn by the
applicants; and those involving the remaining 21 issues were pending
as of June 30,1940.
A considerable proportion of these applications derived from continuation of the policy of the N ew York Stock Exchange of seeking to
remove from listing and registration thereon issues deemed no longer
to have adequate public distribution, activity, or market value for
trading on that exchange. Applications from that source involving
30 issues were filed during the past year. As of June 30,1939, applications involving 7 issues were pending. During the fiscal year, the
Commission granted applications involving 23 issues; applications
involving 2 issues were withdrawn; and those involving the remaining
12 issues were pending on June 30, 1940.
During the past fiscal year, certifications of removal were received
from national securities exchanges involving 201 issues stricken from
listing and registration because of payment, redemption, or retirement.
A number of the new applications for listing and registration on national
securities exchanges, filed during the past year, were with respect to
issues resulting from refundings and changes in capital structure in
connection with these 201 issues.

SIXTH ANNUAL Rl9PO'RT

105

Applications for the Granting, Extension, and Termination of Unlisted Trading
Privileges on Exchanges.

National securities exchanges.-Clause
(1) of Section 12 (f) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides that the Commission, upon
application by a national securities exchange, may continue unlisted
trading privileges to which a security had been admitted on such
exchange prior to March 1, 1934. On June 30, 1940, unlisted trading
privileges under clause (1) continued in 1,505 stock and 321 bond
issues. This is a reduction of 1,180 stock and 967 bond issues from
the original total continued by the Commission under clause (1).
Outstanding causes of this reduction under clause (1) lie in refundings,
recapitalizations, mergers, and reorganizations involving substantial
changes in characteristics of issues or substitutions or exchanges
therefor. Such altered or new securities may be admitted to unlisted
trading on an exchange only upon approval by the Commission of
applications submitted under clause (2) or clause (3) of Section 12 (f).
Clauses (2) and- (3) of Section 12 (f) provide that the Commission,
upon application by a national securities exchange, may extend unlisted trading privileges thereon to any security duly listed and registered on another national securities exchange or in respect of which
prescribed information is available, provided certain conditions as to
public distribution in the vicinity of the exchange and other matters
are satisfied. On June 30, 1940, unlisted trading privileges under
clauses (2) and (3) existed with respect to 159 stock and 20 bond issues,
trading in odd lots only being authorized with respect to 16 of the stock
issues. These issues represent the total extension by the Commission
of unlisted trading privileges under these two clauses since May 27,
1936, when they became effective upon the amendment of Section 12
(f), except for 5 issues subsequently removed, viz, 1 by redemption,
1 by recapitalization, 1 by transfer from the New York Curb Exchange
to the New York Stock Exchange, and 2 by termination of listing and
registration on another national securities exchange. A number of
these issues are of companies whose issues, or whose predecessors'
issues, were admitted to trading upon the applicant exchanges in the
past. In the case of the Boston and Philadelphia Stock Exchanges,
substantial majorities of the shares and share values to which unlisted
trading privileges have been extended under clause (2) fall in this
category.
The following tables summarize the dispsition of applications under
clauses (2) and (3) of Section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934:

As indicated by the preceding text and tables, the disposition of
applications by national securities exchanges is here accounted for.
Since unlisted trading privileges in various issues have been applied
for, and granted to, more than one exchange, the figures include substantial duplication of the net number of issues involved. This is
particularly true with respect to the stock issues under clause (1).
The duplication involved can be measured by comparing the aggregate 1,664 stock and 341 bond trading authorizations under clauses
(1), (2), and (3) as of June 30, 1940, with the unduplicated totals of
1,194 stock and 340 bond issues admitted to unlisted trading privi-

leges on national securities exchanges as of that date, which are indicated in table 32 of Appendix V, page 290. These unduplicated totals
include 631 stock and 308 bond issues which are admitted to unlisted
trading privileges only; the remaining issues are fully listed and registered (or, in a few cases, temporarily exempted from registration) on
national securities exchanges other than those having unlisted trading
privileges therein.
The national securities exchanges to which unlisted trading privileges have been granted number 15-unchanged for the year.
Exempted exchanges.-During
the past fiscal year, the Milwaukee
Grain & 'Stock Exchange discontinued its securities department," resulting in removal from unlisted trading privileges of 72 stock and
9 bond issues, and reducing from 5 to 4 the number of exempted
exchanges permitting unlisted trading in securities.
The Commission granted applications of the Wheeling Stock Exchange for the extension of unlisted trading privileges to 5 stock
issues and denied applications involving 2 stock issues.
On June 30, 1940, the Seattle Stock Exchange had pending before
the Commission applications to extend unlisted trading privileges to
7 stock and 3 bond issues.
The result of these actions has been a reduction from 157 stock and
12 bond issues admitted to unlisted trading privileges on 5 exempted
exchanges as of June 30, 1939, to 90 stock and 3 bond issues admitted
to suc~ trading on 4 exempted exchanges as of June 30, 1940.

of National Securities Association.

The program of cooperative regulation of the over-the-counter
markets envisioned by the Maloney Amendment to the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (now Section 15A of that Act), a program of
self-regulation by the industry working through associations registered under the Act and supervised by the Commission, became an
actuality during the past fiscal year. The Investment Bankers Conference, Inc., with its charter, by-laws, and rules of fair practice
amended to meet the minimum standards set by the statute and with
its name changed to National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
filed its application for registration as a national securities association
on July 20, 1939. After a public hearing, the Commission granted
this application on August 7, 1939.8 No other association, either
national or affiliated, applied for registration during the year ended
June 30, 1940.
Membership in National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,

those barred by specific types of prior misconduct set forth in the
statute, has practically doubled since the date of registration, reaching
a total of almost 2,900 individuals, partnerships, and corporations
located throughout the United States. Even in cases of previous
misconduct, the ineligible broker or dealer may petition tlie Commission for an order directing his admission to membership in a registered
securities association. One such petition was filed with the Commission during the past fiscal year and; after hearing before a trial examiner and argument before the Commission, the petition was denied.
In this case the Commission, on the basis of an independent review
of the record, found that a controlling partner of the petitioner had
been guilty of conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles
of trade, had been expelled by the New York Stock Exchange because
of such conduct, and had on prior occasions engaged in additional
transactions detrimental to the welfare of an investment trust controlled by the petitioner. Therefore, the Commission determined
that it was unable to find it appropriate in the public interest to
approve or direct the admission of the petitioner to membership in
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and denied the
application .9
The Commission has kept in close touch with the regulatory and
educational work of the association by daily contact and cooperation
with the association's executive director and counsel in Washington
and by group and individual conferences in many parts of the country
with its governors and the members of its various committees. The
investigations of complaints conducted by local business conduct
committees of the association have been followed with especial care.
Furthermore, the Commission has transmitted to the association
information concerning transactions and business practices of certain
members of the association which appeared prima fade to constitute
violations of high standards of commercial honor and hence of the
association's rules, although such transactions and practices did not
necessarily constitute violations of law. Such information was
usually obtained by the Commission from routine inspections of
registered over-the-counter brokers and dealers. The association has
limited its activities for the protection of investors to investigations
of specific complaints and does not undertake such routine examinations or surprise audits as are sometimes made by national securities
exchanges of their members. For this reason, the inspection work of
the Commission cannot be said to have been decreased by the association's activities.
On the other hand, the association has in several instances been of
material assistance both to its members and to the Commission by
adjusting, through prompt informal actions, situations which might

otherwise have led to administrative or legal proceedings by the Commission. The association has also done much valuable work in explaining and "bringing home" to its members the significance of the
Commission's various rules and regulations, designed for the protection of investors, under which the over-the-counter market functions.
A notable instance of this educational activity appeared in connection
with the rules and regulations requiring brokers and dealers to maintain and preserve specified memoranda and bookkeeping records respecting each transaction.
These rules and regulations, which were
the only new ones affecting the over-the-counter market to be adopted
during the past fiscal year, were made the subject of a detailed analysis and explanation prepared by the association and sent to all of its
members.
Supervision of Over-the-Counter Brokers and Dealers.

During the past fiscal year, the Commission continued its supervision of over-the-counter brokers and dealers registered under Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and expanded its
program of inspection of such brokers and dealers which had been
undertaken on an experimental basis as early as 1937. These inspections serve the twofold purpose of (1) ascertaining whether there is
compliance with the requirements of the statutes administered by the
Commission and the rules and regulations thereunder and (2) aiding
brokers and dealers to a more complete understanding of the legal
requirements imposed upon them. In those cases where, as a result
of an inspection or other investigation, serious violations of law were
discovered, the Commission employed its power to deny or revoke
registration or obtained a decree of court enjoining further violation.
Some of the more serious of these violations may be mentioned briefly.
One of the most serious over-the-counter problems that has received the attention of the Commission has been the practice on the
part of certain dealers of selling a security to a customer at a price
bearing no reasonable relation to the price at which the customer
otherwise could have obtained the security, and under such circumstances that the customer, in reliance on the established custom of
dealers in the securities business to effect transactions at fair prices,
reasonably believes that the dealer is effecting the transaction at a
price that is fair. In a series of cases, the Commission has construed
Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 15 (c) (1) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as prohibiting dealers from exploiting customers by means of security transactions effected at a
price bearing no reasonable relation to the prevailing price. In In the
Matter of Duker &1 Duker, the firm induced customers to turn over to
it securities which were to be sold and the proceeds invested in other
securities.
Thereafter, the firm, without disclosing that it was acting

SIXTH .A.NNUALImPORT

111

as a principal, sold other securities to the customers' accounts at
prices far above the prevailing prices at which the firm had acquired
such securities. The profits thus realized by the firm in such transactions ran as high as 56 percent. In holding that this practice constituted a violation of both Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933
and Section 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
that the broker-dealer registration of Duker & Duker should be revoked, the Commission, in its opinion, said:
"Inherent in the relationship between a dealer and his customer is the vital
representation that the customer will be dealt with fairly, and in accordance with
the standards of the profession. It is neither fair dealing, nor in accordance
with such standards, to exploit trust and ignorance for profits far higher than
might be realized from an informed customer. It is fraud to exact such profits
through the purchase or sale of securities while the representation on which the
relationship is based is knowingly false. This fraud is avoided only by charging
a price which bears a reasonable relation to the prevailing price or disclosingsuch
information as will permit the customer to make an informed judgment upon
whether or not he will complete the transaction * * * This opinion is not,
of course, to be taken as a condemnation of all profits realized by dealers. Our
decision is merely that a dealer may not exploit the ignorance of his customers
to exact unreasonable profits resulting from a price which bears no reasonable
relation to the prevailing price."

In In the Matter oj Jansen and Oompany, the Commission denied an
application as a broker and dealer where the applicant was found to
have engaged in the same practices as were condemned in the Duker
case, with the added circumstance that the applicant had assured
its customers that it would sell securities to them at the cost to the
applicant plus a small commission.
Another. type of fradulent conduct is the obtaining by a broker
of a secret profit by misrepresenting to the customer the price at which
the order of the customer has been executed. In some instances,
a broker has obtained a secret profit by representing to a customer
that his order was executed at a certain price, when in fact the broker
executed the order at a different price. Such conduct violates the
obligation an agent owes to his principal. In In the Malter oj Oommonwealth Stock &: Bond 00., the Commission revoked the brokerdealer registration of a firm which had induced elderly persons, whose
savings were invested in securities, to execute orders authorizing the
firm to sell, for their accounts, their security holdings and to use the
proceeds to purchase at the market other securities recommended
by the firm, where the firm, knowing that its customers were ignorant
of the market value of the securities recommended for purchase,
callously abused the trust reposed in it by delivering to its customers
securities having a market value substantially less than that of the
securities turned over by the customers and retaining for itself an
unconscionable and secret profit. In holding that this conduct
constituted a violation of Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933

112

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and Section 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Commission said:
"The registrant was entitled to be paid the customary commissions in transactions such as that described, but it is gross fraud and over-reaching to exploit
the ignorance of a trusting customer to retain secret profits which, in fact, represent
funds belonging to the customer."

Instances have also been found of brokers and dealers operating
with impaired capital or operating while actually insolvent.
A
practice commonly known as "bucketing" was also discovered in a
number of instances.
In all such cases, the Commission has taken
appropriate action.
In cooperation with a special committee of the National Association
of State Securities Commissioners, the Commission has been working
toward the development of 8, standardized form for the registration
of brokers and dealers in the various States, which, if adopted by the
different State regulatory authorities, would substantially simplify
the problems of registration of over-the-counter brokers and dealers
doing business in more than one State.
The following statistics relate to the registration of brokers and
dealers pursuant to Section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934.

SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS

Pursuant to Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange .Act of 1934, ,.
the Commission has adopted rules and regulations governing the i
solicitation of proxies, consents, and authorizations from the holders
of securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges. ;
It is well known that the only way in which the stockholders of a ,i
large corporation can participate in the management of their com- i
pany's affairs is through the use of proxies. Where the stockholders 1
are uninformed concerning the matters upon which the proxies are
to be voted and where the proxy machinery is available only to the
existing management, it is impossible for the average stockholder to
protect his investment through intelligent participation in the determination of corporate policies. .Accordingly, the general purpose
of the proxy rules is to insure that security holders who are requested
to authorize or consent to proposed corporate action are furnished
with sufficient information to enable them to exercise an intelligent
judgment on the matters involved, as well as an opportunity to
indicate their approval or disapproval of such matters.
"The fundamental requirement of the proxy rules is that corporate
managements and others who solicit proxies, consents, or authorizations from security holders shall furnish to the security holders a
proxy statement containing prescribed information as to each matter
on which the proxies are to be voted. Furthermore, with certain
exceptions, the persons soliciting such proxies, consents, or authorizations must give stockholders an opportunity to specify whether their
proxies shall be voted for or against each proposal submitted. The
Commission believes that the information now required to be disclosed in the proxy statement with respect to such vital matters as
the election of directors, voluntary reorganizations, and mergers is

!

114

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the minimum which must be furnished to stockholders _to enable
them to act intelligently with respect to their investments.
The rules also require that managements give to minority stockholders an opportunity to present new proposals to their fellow stockholders. For example, a stockholder who desires to secure Corporate
action on a suggestion of his own can be assured that in most cases
his proposal will be submitted to the other stockholders of the corporation if he gives timely notice to the management of his intention
to present the matter at the annual meeting. Thereafter, if the
management solicits proxies, it must include in its own proxy material
a description of the proposal and must give the stockholders an opportunity to state whether their proxies shall be voted for or against the
proposal. In cases where independent solicitation is deemed desirable, however, the proxy rules provide that a management soliciting
proxies must cooperate in mailing soliciting literature of minority
groups. The Commission believes that, to date, these provisions
have operated as a desirable extension of corporate democracy.
The manner in which the proxy rules operate to assist security
holders in protecting their own interests may be illustrated from
actual cases. In one case, the management of a corporation solicited
proxies which would authorize the issuance of a new preferred stock.
The proxy statement contained no information as to the underwriter
of the issue. An investigation revealed that plans were virtually
completed for the sale of the entire issue of the stock through the
private investment firm of the company's president and that a substantial underwriting fee was to be paid to this firm. The Commission held that this information should be included in the proxy statement so as to be available to stockholders in deciding whether or
I10t to authorize the new issue of preferred stock. .As a-result, the
management postponed the scheduled stockholders' meeting and
agreed not to use the proxies already obtained until they should
be expressly confirmed by the stockholders upon the basis of complete information concerning the proposed underwriting arrangement. Subsequently, the management solicited proxies, but did riot
request authorization to issue new stock.
-

In another case, the management of a corporation solicited proxies
to be used for the election of directors; the approval of the formation
of a new company, the disposition of certain properties, the granting
of options to purchase stock of the new company to persons to be
named by the board of directors in their discretion, the purchase of
certain timber lands, and other matters. Except with respect to
the election of directors, the proxy statement was completely devoid
of such information concerning these proposals as would enable the
stockholders to decide intelligently whether to give or withhold the
requested proxies. When the Commission pointed out the.deficienoies

SIXTH .ANNUAL

,BJ!}l'I()M

115

in the proxy statement, the management agreed that the proxies which
had been obtained would be used only to elect directors and that the
other matters would not be acted upon until the stockholders had
given new proxies based upon a supplemental proxy statement
containing the required information.
The cases referred to above illustrate that under the proxy rules
the Commission's role is to insure the disclosure to stockholders of
the indispensable information. Other cases may be cited to show
that stockholders who have been provided with such information
are thereby aided in protecting their interests. Thus, the directors
of a company which had been unable to meet the dividends on its
$7 preferred stock and which had accumulated dividend arrearages
in excess of $13,000,000, proposed to create a $4.50 cumulative
preferred stook that would be offered to the existing preferred stockholders in exchange for their present holdings. The proposal also
included the surrender of accumulated dividends on the preferred
stock. The common stockholders, with whom the management's
interest largely rested, were not to be called upon to give up any of
their rights. When the management solicited proxies in compliance
with the Commission's proxy rules, the stockholders' responses were
so unfavorable to the plan that the management cancelled the scheduled speoial meeting of stockholders and withdrew the proposal.
Subsequently, when the management solicited proxies for a revised
plan which would compensate the preferred stockholders for their
sacrifices by giving them debentures and common stock, the revised
plan was approved by the stockholders.
Effeotive February 15, 1940, the proxy rules were amended to
require that material to be used in connection with the solicitation
of proxies be filed with the Oommission for inspection at least ten
days before the beginning of the solicitation. Formerly, the rules
had only required that the material be filed by the date of the first
solicitation. Prior to the amendment, many corporations were
seriously embarrassed by the necessity of sending out supplemental
material to correct deficiencies which could readily have been pointed
out in advance by the Commission's staff. The present requirement
of filing proxy material in advance of solicitation has virtually eliminated this possibility of embarrassment. In particular cases, the
ten-day waiting period may be shortened by the Commission upon
a showing of unusual circumstances.
The solicitation of proxies from security holders of registered publio
utility holding companies and their subsidiaries (other than solicitations relating to reorganizations) is governed by the rules which the
Commission has adopted pursuant to Seotion 12 (e) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. These rules, in effect, subject
such solicitations to the proxy rules discussed in the preceding
paragraphs.

116

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During the past fiscal year, 1,626 separate pieces of proxy soliciting
material and 431 pieces of supplemental material were examined.
Moreover, pursuant to the Commission's policy of furnishing every
assistance to persons who desire to obtain informal opinions or suggestions in advance of the filing date, considerable time was devoted
to hundreds of conferences with representatives of corporations who
were preparing proxy soliciting material in compliance with the proxy
rules. These conferences were, of course, in addition to the regular
examination which is made of all proxy soliciting material filed with
the Commission.

Part IV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to compel full and fair
disclosure to investors of material facts regarding securities publicly offered and sold in interstate commerce or through the mails.
Its provisions are also designed to prevent fraud in the sale of
securities. Issuers of securities to be publicly offered and sold in
interstate commerce are required to file registration statements
with the Commission. These registration statements are required
to contain specified information on the proposed offering, and are
available for public inspection.
REGISTRATION

OF SECURITmS

UNDER THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

General Scope of Act.

The Securities Act of 1933 provides for full and fair disclosure of
the material facts concerning securities to be offered to the public in
interstate commerce or through the mails, but does not confer upon
the Commission the power to approve or pass upon the merits of any
security. Inthe latter connection it should be emphasized that neither
the fact that a registration statement for a security has been filed or
is in effect, nor the fact that a stop order is not in effect with respect
to that particular statement, is to be deemed a finding by the Commission that the registration statement is true and accurate on its
face, or that it does not contain an untrue statement of a material
fact, or a material omission, or be held to mean that the Commission
has in any way passed upon the merits of, or given its approval to,
the security. In fact the statute specifically prohibits any representation to that effect to a prospective purchaser. However, since
the registration statement constitutes a record of the representations
made in connection with the offering, such registration statement
serves, where any such representations are false, to simplify the problem of proof in any legal proceedings which may result.
Registration Statement.

To register securities under the Securities Act of 1933, the Act
provides for the filing with the Commission, on an appropriate form,
of a registration statement meeting the requirements specified in that
Act and the rules and regulations of the Commission promulgated
thereunder and the elapse of a certain specified period of time after
such filing. Registration forms have been prescribed by the Commission to meet the requirements peculiar to various types of securities.
In each case, the form is designed to secure a fair disclosure of the
117
273226-41-9

118

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

material facts concerning the security proposed to be offered, in order
that the investor may intelligently appraise its desirability as an investment. An integral part of the requirements of each registration statement is a prospectus setting forth in condensed or summarized form
the more essential information contained in the registration statement
proper. The Act provides that no offering of the security or delivery
of it after sale may be made in interstate commerce or through the
mails unless accompanied or preceded by such a prospectus.
The registration statement becomes effective on the 20th day 1
after its filing with the Commission, except in certain cases specified
in the Act. Thus the investor is given a 20-day period in which to
consider facts concerning the proposed security issue, and simultaneously the Commission is given a reasonable time within which to
make an examination of the registration statement for omissions,
incomplete disclosures, and inaccuracies. In connection with this 20day period, the Commission adopted, effective on July 20, 1939, a
revision of Rule 930 (b) of the General Rules and Regulations under
the Securities Act of 1933, providing that such "twentieth day" shall
begin immediately upon the close of business at the Commission at
4:30 p. m., Eastern Standard Time, after 19 days from the date of
filing have elapsed, counting weekdays, Saturdays, Sundays, and
other holidays alike.
Where an amendment to a registration statement is filed prior to
the effective date of the registration statement, such amendment has
the effect of establishing a new filing date and starting a new 20-day
period running, although the Commission is given the power to relate
the filing of the amendment back to the original filing date when such
action is not detrimental to the public interest. An amendment filed
after the effective date of the registration statement becomes effective
on such date as the Commission may determine, with due regard to
the public interest and the protection of the investor.
Examination Procedure.

Where the Commission's examination and analysis of the registration
statement discloses any omission or incomplete statement of material
facts, or inaccuracy, it is the practice to send the registrant a so-called
deficiency letter pointing out the weaknesses apparent in the statement. In such cases, the letter or memorandum specifying these
deficiencies usually is sent to the registrant within approximately 10
days after the original filing date of the registration statement, which
affords the registrant an opportunity to correct the statement by
amendment before the indicated effective date and before the securities
I On August 22, 1940,Section 8 (a) of the Securities Act of1933, as amended, was amended (Public, No. 768,
76th CongresS-Title III) to confer upon the Commlssion discretionary authority to accelerate the e1fectlve
date of reglstratlon statements filed under the provisions of the SecurIties Act of 1933. On August 23, 1940,
the Commission announced Its general policy under this discretionary authority (Securities Act of 1933
Release No. 23(0).

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

119

are offered for sale. In many cases, conferences are held with the
registrant or its attorney. This informal procedure frequently reveals
to the registrant what appear to be material misrepresentations or
omissions in the data set forth in the registration statement and
enables it to amend the data in these respects. Clearly the effect of
this procedure constitutes not only fair treatment of the registrant,
but also serves the main purpose of the .Act, which is to insure that
investors have the opportunity of exercising intelligent judgment
based upon an adequate and accurate disclosure of the facts concerning
the enterprise. In addition, it eliminates the alternative of allowing
a defective statement to become effective and then either having the
security sold upon such misrepresentations. or instituting stop order
proceedings to suspend the effectiveness of the registration statement.
The basic procedure outlined with respect to the examination of
registration statements is also followed in the examination and
analysis of amendments thereto, supplemental prospectus material,
and annual reports filed by registrants subject to the Securities .Act of
1933 under the conditions specified in Section 15 (d) of the Securities
Exchange .Act of 1934, as amended.
There may be instances where the registration statement is found
upon examination to include untrue statements or omissions of
material facts apparently in reckless or intentional disregard of the
requirements of the statute. Under such circumstances, the Commission is empowered by Section 8 of the .Act to institute stop order
proceedings to suspend the effectiveness of the registration statement.
The Commission is also empowered by Section 8 to make an examination in any case to determine whether such proceedings should be
instituted.
This section further grants the Commission power to
issue an order prior to the effective date, refusing to permit a registration statement to become effective, if after notice and opportunity
for hearing it finds that the statement is on its face incomplete or
inaccurate in any material respect.
Disclosures

Resulting from Examination.

In order to give some indication of the result of the Commission's
examination procedure in securing fair disclosure of material information required in registration statements, a few cases are briefly
summarized below:
(1) Payment oj $1,835,181 dividends made by investment trust out oj
capital.-.A registrant which operated an investment trust was
required, by the terms of its trust agreement, to distribute its total
interest and dividend income. In addition, net profits, if any, arising
from the sale of portfolio securities during the year were also distributed to holders of participation certificates in order that the trust
could qualify as a mutual investment company under the Federal
income tax laws. Provisions for taxes and other recurring expenses

120

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the trust, together with net losses, if any, accruing in any year
through the sale of portfolio securities, were charged to the capital
account. The Commission objected to this accounting procedure
for the reason that it failed to disclose clearly the aggregate amount
by which the principal or capital contributed by investors had been
impaired as a consequence of expenses and losses which had been
incurred by the trust on the sale of portfolio securities. As a result
the financial statements were completely revised to reflect the application of proper accounting principles, which resulted in showing a
deficit, as of March 31, 1939, in the aggregate amount of $1,835,181,
representing the amount by which distributions, expenses, and net
loss on securities sold exceeded income.
(2) New aircraft company proposed to du'lde stockholders' equity for
benefit of promoters, and to place control in underwriters.-A
newly
organized aircraft company proposed to offer well over $2,000,000 of
securities to the public, representing practically the entire cash investment in the enterprise. The nature of certain terms of the offering,
vital to investors, was not clearly disclosed in the prospectus to be
distributed to prospective investors in connection with the public
offering. To illustrate the character of the terms in question, the
promoters were to receive a substantial block of securities of the
company for alleged services; in addition, despite the fact that the
investors were asked to put up all the cash involved, the equity of
the purchasers of these securities would have been subjected to almost
unlimited dilution through the issuance of warrants to underwriters
and promoters, the proposed further issuance of stock at a later date
to promoters for services to be rendered, and the denial of preemptive
rights to the potential stockholders; and the underwriters were to
control a majority of the board of directors. When the company
was informed that the prospectus must make full and fair disclosure
of these aspects of the offering, it substantially revised the terms
thereof. Specifically, the company thereupon reduced the proportion
of promotional stock to be represented in its capital structure, reduced the amount of warrants to be issued to underwriters, and
eliminated the indicated underwriter control.
(3) Bus company carried at $1,277,363.02 franchise of predecessor
street railway although abandoned-Valuation
reduced to $1.00.-In the
examination of the registration statement filed by a registrant operating a bus transportation system in a large city, it was noted that the
total assets of $2,315,769.80 reflected in the current balance sheet
included an intangible asset item of "Franchise and organization
expense" valued at $1,277,363.02. It was discovered that this item
represented largely capitalized cost of an abandoned street railway
system which was supplanted by the bus system. The Commission
considered it misleading under the circumstances to reflect the book

SIXTH

oANNUAL REJ?O'RT

121

value of the railway properties abandoned as an asset. Stop order
proceedings were instituted.
Subsequently the registrant filed amendments to the financial data reducing the item in question to a nominal
figure of $1 and showing a corresponding increase in the deficit account.
(4) Mining claims overvalued $1,820,272.07-Intangibles
not seqregated.-The gross valua tion of mineral claims appearing in the balance
sheet of a registrant engaged in gold mining and exploratory development was shown as $2,270,232.07. The Commission's examination
of the registration statement developed information showing that this
amount represented an arbitrary value placed upon the claims by
former directors, and that the stock consideration included in this
figure had been given for personal services, water rights, surface rights,
and development expense. As a result of the Commission's inquiry
into the facts of this situation, the registrant filed an amended balance
sheet in which the valuation of mineral claims was reduced $1,820,272.07. The fact that stock had been issued at a discount of $1,650,000
was disclosed on the amended balance sheet. The aggregate value of
development costs, financing services, surface rights, and water rights
was recorded at $170,272.07. The amounts of reserves for depreciation, depletion or amortization applicable to each of these items were
shown separately in the amended balance sheet, with a statement of
the bases npon which these items and the mineral claims were being
amortized, depleted, or written off.
(5) Hazards surrounding marketability oj proposed mining products
not setjorth.-A mining company with property located in southeastern
Canada filed a registration statement covering an offering of securities
from which the company expected to secure net proceeds of $600,000.
This amount was to be used in developing the mining properties and,
if warranted by these developmental operations, in constructing a mill
for the treatment of the ores mined, the potential products being a zinc
concentrate and a copper-lead concentrate.
However, the omission
from the registration statement of information concerning the existing
or potential markets for these ultimate products and certain other pertinent information appeared to make the statement misleading in a
material respect, and the Commission accordingly instituted stop order
proceedings.
Following the taking of testimony, the registrant
amended the registration statement to include the following information therein:
"It must be pointed out that the registrant has not investigated the marketing
possibilities of its potential products; however, there is no market in Eastern
Canada for the potential products of the registrant's mining properties, viz., zinc
concentrate and lead-copper concentrate, nor are there any facilities for treating
these products in existence or in the course of construction; that the producers of
such metals located in the same general area in which registrant's property is
situated have found it necessary to ship products to Great Britain, France or
Belgium where the prices are materially lower than on the market in the United

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

States; that the':existence of an available commercial market for the potential
products of this mine in the United States is open to serious doubt and the registrant has not ascertained whether it will be able to dispose of said products at a
profit in the United States and, further, if such products are shipped to the United
States for sale same will be subject to a tariff of four cents per lb. on copper, 1.2
cents per lb. on zinc and l~ cents per lb. on lead."

(6) Gas utility's depletion reserve understated by $300,000.-The
examination'of the financial statements of a natural gas public utility
company filed with its registration statement revealed that the policy
of determining depletion reserve with respect to its investment in
natural gas production, land, and leases apparently had no relation
to the carrying value of such assets or to the estimated recoverable
gas reserves.
The Commission raised the question of whether the depletion
policy would provide a reserve sufficient to recover the carrying value
of these assets. As a result of the Commission's inquiry, the registrant changed its depletion policy so that the reserve which would be
created thereby would be sufficient to retire these properties at the
end of their estimated productive life. The registrant also filed an
amended balance sheet increasing the depletion reserve by more than
$300,000 and reducing earned surplus by a corresponding amount.
(7) Oil company revises balance sheet, reducing assets from $4.00,000
to $50,000.-The
registration statement as originally filed by an oil
company gave every indication that the par value of the promotional
stock of the company had been arbitrarily charged to an asset account
entitled "Leases and Options." The Commission made inquiry of the
registrant concerning the accuracy or the carrying value of the asset
account. Subsequent to such inquiry the promotors returned to the
company for cancelation $225,000 aggregate par value of this promotional stock. The examination by the Commission was also instrumental in the elimination from the balance sheet of an unsubstantiated
write-up of $97,665 which was reflected in the so-called fixed asset
accounts. Thus, while the original balance sheet dated September
30, 1939, included Leases and Options (appearing under "Fixed
Assets") valued at $353,225.30, total assets amounting to $399,309.32,
Issued Capital Stock of $274,690, Unrealized Appreciation (as described above) to the extent of $97,665 and Deficit of $9,481.80, the
amended balance sheet dated December 31, 1939, listed Total Assets
of $49,213.79, Capital Stock of $73,380 and Deficit of $36,455.30.
Usual Length of Time Required to Obtain Effective Registration Statement.

The Commission makes every effort consistent with its powers
and duties under the statute to give registrants the opportunity to
secure effectiveness of registration statements with the least possible
difficulty and delay. Obviously, where amendments to the registration statement are filed shortly prior to the 20th day after original

SIXTH ANNUAL R.El'IORT

123

filing, the time elapsing between the original filing and effective dates
may extend beyond the basic 20-day period. However, the result of
an analysis recently made on the basis of a representative sample of
registration statements (excluding those involved in refusal order or
stop order proceedings under Section 8) indicates that while there was
an average elapsed time of 29 days from original filing to effectiveness
for statements which became effective during the calendar year 1937,
the corresponding elapsed time in 1939 was 21 days. Often the
registrant not desiring the statement to become effective on the 20th
day after filing, voluntarily and deliberately delays, for various
reasons, the effective date by the filing of a simple amendment before
the statement becomes effective.
New Forms and Rules Adopted under the Securities Act.

In connection with its administration of the Securities Act of 1933,
the Commission adopted during the year a form designated as Form
8-10, to be used for the registration of all types of oil or gas interests.
This new form replaces both Form G-1 and Form G-2 heretofore
used for the registration of producing and nonproducing oil and gas
royalty interests, respectively. Form 8-10 is designed to secure a
clearer presentation of material information required under the Act,
and to afford an appropriate medium for registration of certain types
of oil and gas interests for which no special form had previously been
available.
In conjunction with the rules and regulations promulgated under
the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, discussed elsewhere in this report,
it was necessary for the Commission to adopt a form supplementing
the various registration statement forms under the Securities Act of
1933. The form adopted was designated as Supplement 8-T. This
supplement, which must be included in registration statements relating
to securities to be issued under an indenture to be qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939, requires certain additional information
not called for by previously existing registration statement forms.
During the year the Commission also adopted Ru1e 890 which
permits the inclusion of disclosures with respect to the stabilization
of security prices in certain types of short-form notices of security
offerings. Certain other changes in existing ru1es and regulations
under the Securities Act of 1933, largely of a clarifying nature, were
also made.
Statistics of Securities Registered

under Securities Act of 1933.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, there were 4,115 registration
statements on file, of which 3,249 were effective, 159 were under stop
or refusal order, and 647 had been withdrawn, while 60 were under
examination or held pending the receipt of amendments.
During the period Ju1y 1, 1939, to June 30, 1940, inclusive, 338

124

registration statements were filed, and there were 323 registration
statements which became effective during the period; a total of 3,529
statements were effective at the end of the period, 43 of those effective
at the beginning of the period or during the period having been either
withdrawn or placed under stop order.
The net number of registration statements withdrawn increased by
57 to a total of 704 on June 30, 1940. The net number of stop or
refusal orders increased during the period by 13, a total of 172 of
such orders being in effect on June 30, 1940. As of June 30, 1940,
there were 48 registration statements in the process of examination
or awaiting amendments.

page 235 identifies by name the registrant and
indicates the aggregate dollar amount of the proposed offering involved
in the case of each registration statement as to which stop orders,
refusal orders, and withdrawal orders were issued during the year.
A total of 1,027 amendments 2 to registration statements were also
filed during the past fiscal year requiring examination by the Commission, compared with a corresponding total of 1,275 during the
preceding year.
There were also filed during the year a total of 252 annual reports
and 69 amendments thereto by certain registrants pursuant to Section
15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, requiring
examination. These figures compare with figures for the previous
fiscal year of 172 reports and 66 amendments to reports.
In addition, the following figures show the volume of certain supplemental prospectus material filed during the past fiscal year under
the Securities Act of 1933:
(1) 309 prospectuses were filed pursuant to Rule 800 (b)
which requires the filing of such information within 5 days
• These amendments include 770classed as "pre-effectlve" and 257as "post-e1fective." and do not take into
account 367 others of a purely formal nature classed as "delaying" amendments.

after the commencement of the public offering;
(2) 280 sets of supplemental prospectus material were filed
by registrants to show material changes occurring after the
commencement of the offering; and
(3) 323 sets of so-called 13-month prospectuses were filed
pursuant to Section 10 (b) (1) of the Act.
Thus during the past fiscal year there were filed in the aggregate 912
additional prospectuses of these 3 classes.
At the same time, 274 supplementary statements of actual offering
price were filed as required by Rule 970 j and there were 34 instances
where registrants voluntarily filed supplemental financial data.
Securities effectively registered.-During
the fiscal year ended June
30, 1940, effective registrations under the Securities Act of 1933
amounted to $1,787,000,000. This compared with a total of
$2,579,000,000 for the preceding fiscal year and $2,105,000,000 for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1938.3
Of the total of $1,787,000,000 of securities effectively registered
during the past fiscal year, $1,433,000,000 was proposed for sale by
issuers. Electric, gas, and water utility companies accounted for
$639,000,000, or 44.6 percent of the total amount proposed for sale by
issuers. Manufacturing companies ranked second in importance
with $475,000,000, or 33.2 percent of the total. Financial and investment companies with $150,000,000, or 10.5 percent of the total,
were next in importance. These three major industry groups, therefore, represented all but about 11.7 percent of the total.
Fixed interest-bearing securities predominated with an aggregate
amount of $1,113,000,000, or 77.6 percent of the total proposed for
sale by issuers. This amount included $684,000,000 of secured bonds,
or 47.7 percent of the total, and $429,000,000 of unsecured bonds, or
29.9 percent of the total. Common stock aggregated $161,000,000,
or 11.3 percent of the total, followed by preferred stock with $110,000,000, or 7.7 percent, and certificates of participation with $49,000,000, or 3.4 percent. All equity financing combined amounted to less
than one-fourth of total registrations.
A detailed breakdown of registration statistics for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1940, indicates that 306 statements covering 443
issues became effective in the amount of $1,787,000,000. Included
in this total was $40,000,000 of substitute securities such as voting
trust certificates and certificates of deposit. Securities registered for
the account of others equaled $60,000,000. There remained, therefore, $1,687,000,000 of securities other than substitute securities
registered for the account of issuers. Of this total, however, $254,000,000 represented securities not proposed for sale by issuers. Among

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the larger of such items were $175,000,000 of securities to be issued in
exchange for other securities, $51,000,000 of securities reserved for
conversion, $24,000,000 of securities reserved for other subsequent
issuance, and $2,000,000 for securities reserved for exercise of options.
The remaining amount of $2,000,000 consisted of securities to be
issued against claims, for other assets, and as compensation for issuing
and distributing services.
After these various deduction items there remained $1,433,000,000
of securities proposed for sale by issuers. Compensation to be paid
underwriters and agents equaled $43,000,000, or 3.0 percent of the
total proposed for sale by issuers. Expenses were $9,000,000, or 0.6
percent of the total. Cost of flotation, therefore, was equivalent
to 3.6 percent of the total.
Estimated net proceeds accruing after all issuing and distributing
expenses aggregated $1,381,000,000. The bulk of these proceeds was
to be applied for repayment of indebtedness and retirement of preferred stock. The amount to be used for repayment of indebtedness
was $1,012,000,000, or 73.3 percent of the total, and for retirement of
preferred stock $57,000,000, or 4.1 percent. New money purposes
accounted for $163,000,000, or 11.8 percent of the total, including
$64,000,000, or 4.6 percent, for plant and equipment; $90,000,000,
or 6.5 percent, for working capital; and $9,000,000, or 0.7 percent, for
all remaining new money purposes. The amount to be used for
purchase of securities was $115,000,000, or 8.3 percent of the total.
This included $113,000,000, or 8.2 percent of net proceeds, to be used
for the purchase of securities for investment.
Securities to be offered through underwriters amounted to $1,212,000,000, or 84.5 percent of the total proposed for sale by issuers.
This compared with $167,000,000, or 11.7 percent, to be offered
through agents and $54,000,000, or 3.8 percent, to be offered directly
by issuers. Securities to be offered to the general public aggregated
$1,312,000,000, or 91.5 percent of the total, as compared with $82,000,000, or 5.7 percent, to be offered to security holders and $39,000,000, or 2.8 percent, to be offered to all others.
Detailed statistics showing break-downs by types of securities,
industry classification of issuers, purpose of registration, proposed use
of net proceeds, and proposed methods of selling, covering securities
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1940, are presented in tables 1 to 7 of Appendix V,
pages 244 to 264. In interpreting the tables, as well as the summary
figures quoted above, it should be kept in mind that these statistics
are based solely on the registration statements filed by the registrants
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Therefore, all the
data refer to the registrants' intentions and estimates as they appear

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

127

in the registration statements on the effective dates and, thus, in reality
represent statistics of intentions to sell securities rather than statistics
of actual sales of securities.'
Security offerings.-8ecurities registered under the Securities Act of
1933 constitute only part of all new issues offered for cash. Furthermore, the statistics of new offerings include only actual offerings,
whereas the statistics of registrations reflect registrants' intentions to
sell securities. Comprehensive statistics of new cash offerings of
securities for the period July 1, 1934, through June 30, 1940, are
presented in tables 8 and 9 of Appendix V, pages 265 and 266. The
tables show the estimated gross proceeds of issues offered for sale,
classified by type of offering, type of security, and type of issuer.
In general, the data cover such issues over $100,000 in amount,
and (for debt issues) of a maturity of one year or over at date of
issuance as were reported as offered for cash in the financial press,
in documents filed with the Commission, or in other available sources.
The statistics include offerings irrespective of whether the issues were
publicly or privately placed and regardless of whether they were
registered under the Securities Act of 1933. The statistics of new
offerings thus embrace certain corporate and non-corporate issuing
groups exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933,
by virtue either of the nature of the transaction or issuer, and include
securities of common carriers, most issues placed privately, and
Federal, State, and local governmental issues.
New issues of securities offered for cash during the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1940, amounted to $5,486,000,000, compared to $6,779,000,000 during the preceding year. Of the total issues floated during
the past fiscal year, $2,320,000,000 was issued by corporations,
$2,164,000,000 by the United States Government and Agencies,"
$952,000,000 by States and municipalities, $28,000,000 by foreign
governments (sold in this country), and $22,000,000 by eleemosynary
institutions.
The principal instrument of flotation was the fixed
interest-bearing security, 96 percent of the total new issues (corporate
and non-corporate) having the form of bonds, notes, and debentures.
Of the corporate securities offered, public utility companies were
the largest issuers, comprising 47 percent of the total, while industrial
issues accounted for 28 percent, and rail and other issues accounted
for 25 percent. Corporate securities privately placed totaled $757,000,000, or 33 percent of all corporate offerings, as compared with

public utility issues, $101,000,000 industrial securities, and $250,000,000 railroad and other flotations.
Underwritingparticipation8.-During the fiscal year ended June 30,
1940, a revised series of statistics of underwriting participations was
instituted on a quarterly and annual basis. Participations in underwritten registered issues were shown separately for the 50 largest
New York City firms and for the 50 largest firms outside of New
York City. The amount of issues managed was shown separately for
the 20 leading firms in and outside of New York City. These statistics
permit a determination of the distribution of the security underwriting business covering registered issues among the various investment banking firms,"
Oost oj jlotation.-In May 1940, the Commission issued a study
entitled, "Cost of Flotation for Small Issues 1925-1929 and 1935-1938"
submitted to it by the Research and Statistics Section of the Trading
and Exchange Division. This study, consisting of 16 statistical tables,
9 charts, and explanatory text of 23 pages, presented detailed statistics
regarding the cost of flotation for issues of less than $5,000,000 for
two periods deemed to be representative of conditions prevailing
prior to and subsequent to the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933.
Data for the earlier period were obtained from questionnaires sent out
by the Commission and for the latter period were based upon registration statements which became effective under the Act. Statistics
were presented covering variations in cost of flotation according to
type of security, size of issue, size of issuer, industry, method of
offering, and yield. While the report contained detailed data for
bonds and preferred stocks, no information was presented covering
common stock issues because of the inadequacy of available data.
Current statistics on the cost of flotation of issues effectively
registered under the Securities Act of 1933 were in process of preparation at the end of the 1940 fiscal year. These data were scheduled for
release during the succeeding fiscal year.
Security characteristics.-8tatistics on the characteristics of issues
effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933 were continued
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1940. This analysis indicates
the extent to which certain security characteristics, such as voting
and preemptive rights on stock issues and sinking fund, callable and
convertible features on bond issues, are found in the case of registered
securities. Statistics covering the three months ended September 30,

EXEMPTION

FROM REGISTRATION

UNDER SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

The Commission is authorized by Section 3 (b) of the Securities
Act of 1933 to adopt rules and regulations providing conditional
exemption from registration under that Act for certain security issues
where the public offering does not involve an aggregate amount in
excess of $100,000. In the exercise of this authority, the Commission
has adopted Regulation A, governing such exemptions other than
those relating to oil and gas interests; Regulation B, covering exemptions pertaining to fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights;
and Regulation B-T, providing exemptions of interests in an oil
royalty trust or similar type of trust or unincorporated association.
The Commission now has under consideration a revision of Regulation
A with a view to extending and simplifying, insofar as practicable, the
exemptions thereunder.'
Regulation A.-Proposed stock offerings of $100,000 or less (other
than those of companies engaged in the oil and gas business) accounted
for the filing during the year of 111 prospectuses under Rule 202,
representing a total offering price of $7,950,000, and 197 letters of
notification under Rule 210, involving a total offering price of
$12,740,000. Stock offerings of oil and gas companies accounted for
the filing of 14 additional prospectuses under Rule 202, representing
a total offering of $1,015,750, and 16 additional letters of notification
under Rule 210, representing a total offering of $896,944.
Numerous amendments which were required in order to correct
deficiencies in the information set forth in the various prospectuses
and letters of notification were also examined in the same manner as
the documents originally filed.
Regulations B and B-T.-From
July 1, 1939, to June 30,1940,1,359
offering sheets were filed and examined, together with 841 amendments, pursuant to Regulation B. The aggregate offering price of
the securities covered by these offering sheets was approximately
$31,072,774. In addition, two prospectuses representing an aggregate
7 Copies of a draft of the proposed revision were sent for criticism and suggestions to about 700 persons,
consisting of issuers of the types who would use the regoIation, underwriters, brokers and dealers, attorneys, mining associations, and investment bankers. Of the replies received, the criticisms and suggestions
offered seem to represent a very good cross-section of opinion in financial and business centers in all parts
of the country. The criticisms and snggestions received were eomplled and carelnlly studied after which
the proposed regulation was revised in the light thereof. The Commission rescinded Rules 200 to 210,
inclusive, of RegoIation A, elfectlve January 1, 1941,except as to issues of securities bona fide offered to the
pUblic on or before such date under any exemption contafned in any of such roles, and adopted new roles
under such regoIation, effective December 9, 1940.

Areas.

During the past fiscal year, the Commission was confronted with the
problem of regulating the sale of unregistered oil securities which,
except for prompt action, could well have assumed major proportions
and might have resulted in the loss of considerable money by the
investing public.
The discovery of oil in commercial quantities in the Tinsley Field,
located in Mississippi, and the extension of activity in the Centralia
and Sale Fields in Illinois were attended by an unusual influx into
those regions of promoters, security salesmen, and "confidence men,"
whose operations have been the subject of close surveillance in other
parts of the country. These persons were bent upon exploiting the
potentialities of sudden wealth in the sale of highly speculative and,
in some cases, entirely worthless securities. Some of the persons who
descended upon these new oil centers had criminal records in security
fraud cases, and others had been subjected to disciplinary action of
various types.
The Commission moved to meet the dangers which the operations
of such promoters indicated by the establishment of a temporary
office at Jackson, Mississippi, and a subregional office in St. Louis,
Missouri. Within a short time after the establishment of the Jackson
office, final judgments had been obtained against several corporations
and individuals conducting the more vicious types of promotions.
These persons were enjoined from violating the registration and fraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the sale of various oil

SIXTH

securities. In addition, a final judgment was obtained against the
publisher of a promotional newspaper enjoining publication of
purported news articles" touting" various oil securities.
The publicity resulting from these various actions had an immediate
deterrent effect. A :Q.umberof known "confidence men" promptly
ceased their activities and departed. Other persons, who probably
through ill-advice or misinformation had violated statutory provisions,
discontinued actions which appeared illegal and sought advice from
Commission attorneys as to methods of procedure in compliance with
the statute.
Considerable help was given by the staff of the Jackson office to
those persons who manifested the desire to comply with the requirements. As a result of these measures, the situation in these areas is
well under control, although a substantial amount of work in prosecuting past violations remains to be done.
The more recent establishment of the St. Louis office has had a
similar salutary effect in that region.
Oil and Gas Investigations.

During the year investigations were conducted in 293 cases involving
oil and gas properties or proposed offerings of oil and gas securities.
These investigations, which arose largely out of complaints received
by the Commission, were primarily conducted to ascertain whether
transactions in oil and gas securities were effected in violation of either
Section 5 or Section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933. However, in
some cases facts and circumstances indicating possible violation of
Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 were developed in
the course of the investigation. Of the 293 investigations, 157 had
been disposed of and 136 were pending at the close of the fiscal year.
As a result of these investigations, in 22 cases the persons concerned
were enjoined from violating the registration or fraud provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933, and in 5 cases the facts were referred to
the Department of Justice for criminal prosecution. A tabular
summary with respect to the Commission's oil and gas investigations

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, sold, or
delivered after sale through the mails or in interstate commerce,
except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an
indenture which meets the requirements of the Act and has been
duly qualified with the Commission. The provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 of
such securities to be issued under a trust indenture shall not be
permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to
the specific statutory requirements expressed in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The indenture is automatically
"qualified"
when registration becomes effective as to the securities themselves.
ENACTMENT

AND SCOPE OF ACT

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (Public, No. 253-76th Congress),
which grew largely out of the study and investigation of the work,
activities, personnel, and functions of protective and reorganization
committees, together with the findings and recommendations, made
by the Commission pursuant to the direction of Congress contained
in Section 211 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, was enacted
August 3, 1939. The Act, which adds a new title (Title III) to the
Act of May 27, 1933, as amended, Title I of which is the Securities
Act of 1933, was designed to correct certain defects which have heretofore existed in trust indentures and to provide means by which
security holders under such indentures may protect their interests.
It provides standards of eligibility for trustees with a view to assuring the choice of trustees who are disinterested and responsive to
the needs of the security holders; establishes a procedure by which
investors may obtain, prior to purchase of the indenture security, an
analysis of the effect of the more important indenture provisions;
and provides a further means whereby security holders will be furnished with material information through the life of securities issued
under an indenture. There was included in the Act, however, an
exemption for indenture securities sold or bona fide offered to the
public within 6 months after the date of enactment.
In brief, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, with certain exceptions,
prohibits the public offering of notes, bonds, debentures, and similar
securities by use of the mails and instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, where such securities are required to be registered under
133
273226--41-10

134

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the Securities Act of 1933 or, in certain other instances, where they
are not subject to such registration requirements, unless they are to
be issued under an indenture which conforms to specific statutory
standards. An indenture, to be qualified under the Act, must
incorporate certain specific provisions, including those governing the
eligibility and qualification of the trustee, and must provide for
periodic reports by both the obligor and the trustee to the security
holders with respect to compliance by the obligor with conditions and
covenants contained in the indenture and the trustee's continued
eligibility. The Commission is required to issue an order refusing
to permit qualification of an indenture if the indenture does not conform to the statutory requirements or if the trustee has any conflicting interest as defined in the statute.
Where the indenture securities are to be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, the necessary information as to the trustee
and the indenture must be contained in the registration statement.
In the case of the two classes of securities which, although exempted
from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, are
not exempted from the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act,
namely, securities issued in exchange for other securities of the same
issuer and securities issued under a plan approved by a court or
other proper authority, the obligor must file an application for the
qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required
information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.
The application becomes effective upon termination of the period
prescribed for registration statements under the Securities Act of
1933 and is likewise subject to refusal order or stop order proceedings.
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 makes it unlawful for any person
in issuing or selling any security to represent or imply that any action
or failure to act by the Commission in the administration of this
Act means that the Commission has in any way passed upon the
merits of, or given approval to, any trustee, indenture or security,
or any transaction or transactions therein, or that any such action
or failure to act with regard to any statement or report filed with
or examined by the Commission pursuant to the Act or any rule,
regulation, or order thereunder, has the effect of a finding by the
Commission that such statement or report is true and accurate on its
face or that it is not false or misleading.
NEW WORK ARISING UNDER STATUTE

The enactment of this new legislation has resulted in the filing of
additional material, all of which must be examined by the Commission.
This examination must be completed with special promptness since,
if refusal order proceedings should appear to be necessary, the statute
requires that notice of opportunity for hearing be given within 10 days

SIXTH ANNUAL ,REPORT

135

after the material is filed, and that the hearing be held within 10 days
after such notice.
In order to assist prospective obligors and trustees in complying
with the requirements of the new Act, members of the Commission's
staff have followed the practice of holding pre-filing conferences
with their representatives and attorneys which, in a number of cases
have disposed of questions prior to the filing of the registration statement or application for qualification and thus resulted in a substantial
saving of time and expense to the applicant. Similar assistance has
been given in response to written and telephone inquiries regarding
the application of various provisions of the statute to particular
situations.
RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS

Following the enactment of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the
Commission promulgated general rules and regulations thereunder,
together with appropriate forms for the trustee's statement of eligibility and qualification and for the application for qualification
of identures covering securities not required to ,be registered under
the Securities Act of 1933. The procedure thus provided for has been
integrated with the related requirements of the Securities Act of 1933.
Prior to the adoption of the new regulations and forms, they were
submitted in tentative form to a number of individual banks, lawyers,
underwriting houses, State and Federal banking authorities, and other
interested persons in order to obtain the benefit of their criticism and
suggestions.
Forms T-l and T-2 are the forms prescribed for the necessary
statement of eligibility and qualification of corporations and individuals, respectively, designated to act as indenture trustees. Each
form is designed to show whether the trustee is eligible to act or has
any conflicting interest as defined in the statute. Form T-3 has
been adopted for use in making applications for qualification of
indentures covering securities which are exempted from registration
under Section 3 (a) (9) or 3 (a) (10) of the Securities Act of 1933.
Forms for annual reports by obligors, who do not otherwise report
under Sections 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
are in the course of preparation.
These reports, in general, are
required by the statute to disclose information with respect to continued compliance by the obligor with the conditions and covenants
incorporated in the indenture.

Part VI

OTHER

ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION
VARIOUS STATUTES

UNDER

THE

INTERPRETATIVE AND ADVISORY SERVICE

From its inception, the Commission has recognized that the technical
nature of the statutes which it administers requires a substantial
amount of interpretative and advisory assistance to the general
public. During the past fiscal year, thousands of requests for such
assistance have been responded to by correspondence and in conferences. The questions thus presented fall into two groups, (1)
difficult questions of statutory construction raised by persons who
are generally familiar with securities legislation and (2) questions as
to the general application of the statutes submitted by persons with
little or no familiarity with the statutory requirements.
Many of the general inquiries pertain to small business enterprises
seeking capital. The Commission is fully aware of the problems confronting such concerns and endeavors to assist them by furnishing,
upon request, detailed advice as to the procedure for registration and
the possibility of exemption from the registration and prospectus
requirements. Although the Commission answers abstract questions
of general application, definite opinions are given only upon the presentation of all the facts of an actual or proposed transaction, including the names of the persons involved. The Commission does not
render interpretative opinions with respect to possible civil liabilities,
since it has no jurisdiction over these matters.
Compilations of interpretations have been prepared to assist in
according uniform treatment to recurring situations. However, new
problems of interpretation are continually presented which require
not only the analysis of intricate factual situations, but a resort to
legislative history and the analogies of judicial case law. Because of
the great variety of circumstances under which almost every problem
is presented, it has not been feasible to publish a comprehensive
interpretative glossary on the statutes administered by the Commission. However, a number of interpretations of more general application have been made public as opinions of the General Counsel.
Recently, a number of unusual cases were presented relating to the
definition of the term "security."
These cases involved the sale of
real or personal property coupled with collateral arrangements, such as
137

138

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

leases back to the seller. The subjects of the purported sales of
property were objects as varied as foxes, rabbits, chinchillas, and
oysters; tung and citrus groves; mechanical devices, such as parking
meters and vending machines; and undivided interests in ships. In
each such case where it appeared that the transaction actually constituted an investment by a member of the public in the hope of a
return through the efforts of persons other than the investor, the Commission has held that a sale of a security was involved and that the
purported sale of the real or personal property was merely camouflage
and not the substance of the transaction. A number of judicial
decisions involving this question are discussed elsewhere 1 in this
report.
Another matter of some importance during the past fiscal year was
the problem of what constitutes control of a corporation under the
Securities Act of 1933. In most cases, controlling security holders
disposing of their shares must obtain registration of their shares by
the issuer, whereas security holders not in control are not required to
register. Therefore, it is often important to determine whether particular persons proposing to sell a block of securities of a company
are in control of that company. Congress has made it clear that the
concept of control is not to be limited to ownership of 51 percent of
the voting securities, but is to be applied in all cases where in fact
control exists. The question is, therefore, one which frequently
depends on intangible factors and requires careful consideration of
each case as a separate problem. In some cases the Commission, at
the request of a stockholder who is doubtful whether he should consider himself in a position of control, has conducted investigations,
privately and informally, in order to determine what position it should
take if sale of the securities without registration is proposed. At the
conclusion of such inquiries, the Commission advises the stockholder
either that it will take no action or that it will sue to enjoin the sale
if such sale is proposed to be effected without registration.
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission receives and replies to thousands of complaints
annually with respect to fraudulent and otherwise illegal practices in
the sale of securities. While the Commission is unable to assist
investors directly in recovering money obtained from them in violation of law, it welcomes and investigates all complaints with a view to
punishing those guilty of violation and preventing the continuance of
illegal practices. The Commission also acts upon its own initiative
to investigate possible violations indicated by its surveillance of trading
activities and the examination of registration statements.

The Commission has long recognized the advantages to be realized
from cooperation between Federal and State agencies and certain
private organizations interested in the prevention of fraud in the sale
of securities. Accordingly, in connection with the enforcement of the
fraud and registration provisions of the Acts, the Commission has
established through its Securities Violations Files a clearing house for
information concerning fraudulent securities transactions.
The information thus assembled with the assistance of State securities commissions and other public agencies, the members of the National Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., and members of the United
States Chamber of Commerce, is made available only to those officials
and agencies who are directly concerned with the suppression of
fraudulent and other illegal practices in the sale of securities. During
the past fiscal year, 5,775 items of information pertaining to existing
files and 2,804 new names were added to the files. As of June 30,
1940, the Commission had assembled data concerning 35,464 persons
or corporations against whom State or Federal action had been taken
in connection with the sale of securities.

LITIGATION
Civil Proceedings.

At the beginning of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1940, 24 civil
proceedings instituted by the Commission were pending; during the
year, the Commission initiated 56 additional proceedings, including
49 injunctive actions brought against 120 persons to restrain them
from fraudulent and otherwise illegal practices in the sale of securities.
Out of this total of 80 civil proceedings, 67 were disposed of during
the fiscal year, including 56 cases which resulted in the entry of injunctions against 118 persons. The Commission was successful in
every injunctive action disposed of during the year, although in a few
instances it closed cases where further civil proceedings had become
unnecessary because of the successful termination of criminal proceedings against the same parties. Thirteen civil proceedings were
pending at the end of the year.
Since its inception, the Commission has instituted a total of 369
civil proceedings and disposed of 356. Permanent injunctions have
been obtained against 775 firms and individuals.
The following tables indicate, by types of cases, the number of
civil cases instituted by and against the Commission from its inception
to the close of the fiscal year ended June 30, 1940:

A brief description and the status of all civil proceedings commenced or pending during the year ended June 30, 1940, are set forth
in Appendix VI, page 292, of this report. Some of the more important
or interesting of these cases are described in more detail below.
From the beginning, the Commission and the courts have had to
deal with ingenious schemes to secure public investment in business
enterprises without complying with the provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933. These schemes usually are camouflaged as the "sale" of
real or personal property coupled with an arrangement under which
the promoter-seller retains possession of the property, representing
that he will manage or resell it for the benefit of the purchasers. The
test employed by the courts and the Commission in determining
whether such transactions involve the sale of a security is well expressed in Securities and Exchange Commission v. Universal Service
Association,2 in which the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit defined the term "security" as "the investment
of money with the expectation of profit through the efforts of other
persons."
During .the past year, the Commission was successful in a number
of actions to enjoin the sale of such securities in violation of the disclosure (registration and prospectus) and fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
J

106 F. (2d) 232, 237 (1939).

142

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Four cases in which the Commission obtained injunctions against
the sale of unregistered securities involved the purported sale to the
public of slot machines coupled with arrangements under which the
vendor retained control of and serviced the machines and shared the
profits with the owners. In Securities and Exchange Oommission v.
Oity Meter Service Oorporation et al., the defendants consented to the
entry in the United States District Court for New Jersey of an order
permanently enjoining them from further violating the registration
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the sale of securities evidenced by bills of sale for parking meter machines coupled with further
agreements providing for the servicing of the machines by the vendor.
In Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Parking Meter Oorporation of
America, judgment by default was entered by the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Ohio enjoining the defendant from further violations of the registration and fraud provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933. Here, also, the security sold was disguised
as the outright sale of parking meter machines coupled with arrangements for the servicing of such machines by the seller. In addition,
the defendant had violated the fraud provisions of the Act by making
false representations to customers as to the number of machines
owned, the existence of contracts with various municipalities for the
installation of such machines, and the defendant's financial position.
In Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Woodsrard-Berkleu Oompany
et al, and Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Monarch Sales Oompany et al., the defendants consented to the entry of orders by the
United States District Court for the Southern District of Ohio permanently enjoining them from further violation of the registration
provisions of the Act in the sale of securities camouflaged as the sale of
merchandise vending machines, together with an arrangement for the
operation of the machines by the defendants.
In Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Leo O. Pyne et al., the
defendants purported to be engaged in selling to the public undivided
interests in fishing boats entitling the purchasers to share in earnings
which might result from the operation of the boats by the defendants.
In granting a preliminary injunction restraining the defendants from
further violating the registration and fraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933, the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts held that the so-called "ship shares" were securities. In
Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Gilbert et al., the defendants
sold to the public undivided shares or interests in cargo boats to be
built and operated by the defendants with the "owners" sharing in the
profits from shipping operations. The Commission commenced an
action in the United States District Court for the Southern District of
Ohio to enjoin the further sale of such interests without registration.
The defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that, as

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

143

a matter of law, undivided interests in ships were not securities. On
August 14, 1939, the court overruled the motion to dismiss and held
that the allegation in the complaint that the defendants were selling
securities presented a question of fact to be determined at the trial,"
On July 9, 1940, the defendants consented to the entry of a permanent
injunction restraining them from the further sale of such securities
except in compliance with the registration provisions of the Act.
In Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Tung Oorporation oj
America and in Securities and Exchange Oommission v: Jack Franklin,
the defendants purported to be engaged in selling small tracts of land
to the public. In connection with each sale, the defendants undertook
to raise tung trees on the various plots and to divide the profits with
the purchasers or to continue to care for the trees and harvest the crop
for a fixed annual charge to be paid by the purchasers. In the Tung
Oorporation oj America case, the Commission applied to the United
States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois for an order
requiring the corporation and its secretary to produce certain documentary evidence pursuant to the Commission's subpena. The court,
in overruling the defendant's objections to the proceeding, held that
the transactions disguised as the sale of land coupled with leasing
arrangements actually amounted to investment contracts!
Subsequently, the documents requested by the Commission were produced
and the proceeding was dismissed. In the Franklin case, another
United States district court granted a preliminary injunction on April
10, 1940, restraining the defendant from further violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. Thereafter, the defendant consented to a permanent injunction.
Another variation of this pattern of unorthodox types of securities
involves oil and gas properties.
The Securities Act of 1933 specifically defines the term "security" as including fractional undivided
interests in oil, gas, or other mineral rights. Attempts to evade the
disclosure requirements of the Act in the financing of crude oil operations have fallen generally into two patterns.
In Securities and
Exchange Oommission v. Orader, the defendant had acquired oil and
gas leases covering 6,000 acres of land under an agreement by which
he was required to drill a well. To finance the drilling, the defendant
sold assignments covering specifically described portions of such
leases, but retained for himself the drilling block of 160 acres. The
defendant represented that the funds obtained from the sale of
assignments would be employed in drilling a test well on the block
retained by the defendant and that, although the investors would
not share in any production thus obtained, in the event commercial
production was obtained from the well, the value of the assignments

144

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

would be enhanced to the profit of the investors. In this and similar
cases, the Commission has taken the position that the sale of a security was involved and has commenced several actions in each of
which the defendants have consented to the entry of orders permanently enjoining them from further violation of the registration and,
in some instances, the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
Another device which has been employed in the attempt to avoid
registration is exemplified in Securities and Exchange Oommission v.
Futter et 01. Here the defendants purported to be engaged in selling
to the public tracts of land which were part of a unit subject to oil
and gas leases providing that the landowners should receive a royalty
on all oil and gas produced from the unit in proportion to their holdings. It was obvious that the real purpose of the transaction was
to convey an undivided interest in an oil royalty, rather than to sell
land. The defendants consented to the entry of an order permanently enjoining them from further violation of the registration and
fraud provisions of the Act.
The Commission does not, of course, take the position that the
ordinary sale of real or personal property involves the sale of asecurity. Much more than this was involved in the various types of
cases just discussed. Slot machines and land were sold as investments in such small quantities that the only possibility of profitable
operation was by common management. Investors were "switched"
from their holdings of ordinary securities on the representation that
the enterprise in question was a better "investment."
In every case,
both parties to the transaction knew that the purchasers would not
and could not themselves profitably manage the property which purported to be the subject of the sale. Invariably, the purchasers were
concerned, not with acquiring title to, or possession of, specific property, but with obtaining profits from an enterprise to be operated
by others-usually
the seller-promoter, and it is this factor, among
others, which has led the Commission to contend and the courts to
hold that such transactions involved the sale of a security.
Charles O. Wright v. Securities and Exchange Oommission.-On April
26, 1938, Charles C. Wright, a member of the New York Stock Exchange and other exchanges, petitioned the Circuit Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit for a review of an order entered by the Commission on February 28. 1938, expelling him from the exchanges of
which he was a member. The expulsion order followed proceedings
in which the Commission found that Wright had violated Sections 9
(a) (1) and 9 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in transactions on the Los Angeles Stock Exchange in the stock of Kinner
Airplane & Motor Company, Ltd.
On May 20, 1940, the circuit court of appeals upheld the constitutionality of the provisions of the Act authorizing the Commission to

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

145

suspend or expel from national securities exchanges members who it
finds have violated any provision of the Act. In sustaining the Commission's finding that Wright had violated Section 9 (a) (2), the
court said,
"It is plain that Wright effected a series of transactions in Kinner stock 'creating actual or apparent active trading in such security' and 'raising the price'
thereof. The Commission found that he did so for the purpose of inducing the
purchase of Kinner stock by others * * * we think there was substantial
evidence to support the facts upon which the Commission predicated its finding
that Wright manipulated the market in violation of Section 9 (a) (2) of the Act.
If so supported the findings of fact are conclusive upon this court."

The Commission had also found that in the course of the manipulation Wright had "matched" an order to sell 10,000 shares at 60
cents with two later "market" orders to buy 2,500 shares each, which
orders met and partially crossed unexecuted portions of the earlier
"sell" order. The court held that it could not accept the Commission's argument that the orders were of "substantially the same size"
even though it was the practice of the exchange to execute such
orders in board lots of 100 shares each.
The court was divided on the question of its power to modify the
Commission's order from expulsion to suspension. The majority held
that the court had no such power and remanded the case to the Commission in order that the Commission might determine, in its discretion, whether to modify the order in view of the fact that the court
had found insufficient evidence to support the Commission's determination that Wright had illegally matched orders. At the end of
the fiscal year, the Commission had not taken any further action
with respect to the case.
Otis &: Go. v. Securities and Exchange Gommission.-on
September
18, 1939, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth
Circuit affirmed the order of the trial court enjoining Otis & Co.
from further violating Section 17 (a) (2) of the Securities Act of
1933.5 The lower court had found that from June 1935 to February
1936 Otis & Co. had engaged in an over-the-counter distribution of
the stock of Murray-Ohio Manufacturing Company. The stock was
offered for sale" at the market" and customers were advised through
sales literature that "higher earnings for the company-should affect
the market price accordingly." No disclosure was made to purchasers that, during the period of distribution, Otis & Co. was making substantial purchases in the market as a result of which it
dominated the demand side of the market for this stock on the Cleveland Stock Exchange, nor was any disclosure made that Otis & Co.
had entered into agreements with principal stockholders of the issuer
under which a substantial portion of the outstanding shares was

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

withheld from the market during the period of distribution.
During
this time, the exchange quotation for Murray-Ohio stock rose from
4~ to 19.
The circuit court of appeals affirmed the trial court's decision that
the failure to disclose the withholding agreements and the extensive
purchases while offering the stock "at the market" was misleading
and in violation of Section 17 (a) (2). The court also ruled that the
trial court did not lack authority to issue an injunction merely because the defendant had discontinued the prohibited activity before
In this connection,
the Commission brought suit for an injunction.
the court said:
"A dealer who saw the challenge of his activities that is implied in an investigation would probably discontinue them pending the investigation.
It would
seldom, if ever, be possible to show that a dealer was engaged in or about to
engage in prohibited acts or practices when suit began, since the necessary investigation would nearly always have warned the dealer to desist. Consequently, while Section 20 (b) does not expressly so provide, yet if it be assumed
that it requires a showing that a dealer be 'engaged' in or 'about to engage' in
prohibited acts or practices, we are of the opinion that it does not require that
either condition continue until the commencement of suit. It is clear that
appellant was violating Section 17 (a) (2) when the Commission began its
investigation. "

Securities and Exchange Commission v. Universal Service Association
Commission's Fifth Annual Report noted that the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit had affirmed
an order of the District Court for the Northern District of Illinois enjoining Universal Service Association and certain individuals from
violating the registration and fraud provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933 in the sale of subscriptions and memberships in the association
and in the Universal Order of Plenocrats," On August 28, 1939, the
circuit court of appeals denied a petition for rehearing and on January
2, 1940, the United States Supreme Court denied certiorari.
On January 4, 1940, the same circuit court of appeals unanimously
affirmed the judgment of the district court sentencing C. Franklin
Davis, one of the promoters, to six months in jail for criminal contempt of court in violating the injunction order, but reversed, for
lack of sufficient evidence, the judgment of that court finding the
Universal Service Association also in contempt." Davis' petition for
rehearing was denied on February 5, 1940, and the United States
Supreme Court denied certiorari on April 22, 1940.
On May 1, 1940, an indictment was returned in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Illinois charging C.
Franklin Davis, Justus Chancellor, Sr., Fred E. Bennett, Charles E.
Oldenburg, Claude H. Carter, and V. E. Danner with violation of

the fraud and registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
and the mail fraud statute in the sale of interests in the Universal
Order of Plenocrats.

Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Timetrust, Incorporated,
et al.-In this case which started on April 5, 1939, the Commission
is seeking to enjoin Timetrust, Inc., Bank of America National Trust
& Savings Association, Meredith Parker, Ralph W. Wood, H. E.
Blanchett, A. P. Giannini, L. Mario Giannini, and John M. Grant
from continuing to violate Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of
1933 by engaging in fraudulent acts and practices in the sale of Timetrust certificates and Bank of America stock. During the past fiscal
year, all of the defendants filed answers denying the material allegations of the complaint and, with the exception of John M. Grant,
filed cross-complaints seeking to enjoin the Commission's investigation. Thereafter, the defendants, other than Grant and A. P. Giannini, also filed interrogatories. The Commission answered many of
the interrogatories but refused to answer others, principally upon the
ground that the information requested was confidential and that its
disclosure prior to trial might prejudice the Commission's case.
On February 24, 1940, the court dismissed the cross-complaints
and sustained the Commission's refusal to answer such interrogatories.
Thereafter, A. P. Giannini and Grant filed similar interrogatories.
Again the Commission refused to answer certain of them and on
May 10, 1940, the court sustained such action. The case went to
trial on May 21, 1940, in San Francisco, California,"
In re Verser-Clay 00. et al.-In its Fifth Annual Report, the Commission noted that the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Tenth Circuit had affirmed 9 an order of the District Court for the
Western District of Oklahoma directing::E. C. Clay,'"as president of
Verser-Clay Company and the Mid-Continent Crude Oil Purchasing
Company, to appear before an officer of the Commission and produce
certain books, records, and documents of those companies which he
had refused to produce in response to subpenas duces tecum issued
during the course of an investigation of alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933. Previously, the district court had ordered the
respondents to deposit the records with the clerk of that court pending appeal, and the respondents thereupon left with the clerk a package
purporting to contain the records in question.
After the circuit court of appeals had affirmed the order and the
United States Supreme Court had denied certiorari, the package was
delivered to the Commission's representatives and was found to contain only a small part of the specified records. Subsequently, the
• On December 13, 1940,the court filed its findings of fact holding that all of the defendants should be
tlDjoined as requested in the Commission's complaint .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

district court caused contempt proceedings to be initiated and, on
February 17, 1940, found Clay and J. C. Verser, also an officer of the
companies, guilty of criminal contempt of court. Each of the defendants was fined $500, but upon their failure to pay the fines, the
court ordered that they be committed to jail. Clay later paid his fine
and was released.
Securitiee and Exchange Oommiseioti v. Foundation Plan, Incorporated, et al.-Qn December 19, 1939, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of N ew York issued an order permanently enjoining Foundation Plan, Incorporated (formerly known
as United Endowment Foundation, Inc.), Harry C. Williams, Robert
B. Deans, James Connor, Jerry Scott, Benjamin Blumenthal, and
Kirk C. Tuttle from violating Sections 5 (b) (2) and 17 (a) (1), (2),
and (3) of the Securities Act of 1933 by engaging in fraudulent acts
and practices in the sale of securities designated as "periodic plan certificates," "paid up plan certificates," and "Foundation Trust Shares
Series A." This is another of the proceedings instituted by the
Commission to bring about the discontinuance of the fraudulent selling
practices of a group of "top" investment cornpanies." Each of the
companies involved in these cases was selling investment certificates
or contracts which contemplated monthly payments over a period of
years to a corporate trustee which immediately applied such payments to the purchase of shares of an underlying investment trust.
Foundation Plan, Incorporated, and the individual defendants
denied the charges of fraud. The court found, however, that they had
sold installment certificates upon the representation that an investment in such certificates was similar to bank deposit while failing to
disclose that the maturity value of such certificates depended solely
upon the market value of the common stocks in which the purchasers' funds were invested. The court also found that the defendants had represented to purchasers that the trustee, a well-known
bank, was sponsoring and guaranteeing the plan while in fact the
trustee's functions were merely mechanical, and that the defendants
had assured installment purchasers that their payments might be
withdrawn in full at any time without disclosing that a "creation" or
"service" fee, amounting to 7~ percent of the face amount of a certificate, would absorb most of the first year's payments.
Although the securities involved had been registered under the
Securities Act of 1933, these fraudulent practices were facilitated by
the defendants' failure, as found by the court, to furnish purchasers
with a prospectus containing the information which the Act requires
to be made available to investors.
On June 8, 1939, Williams, Tuttle, Connor, Scott, Blumenthal, and
the company were indicted for conspiracy to violate Sections 5 and 17

a

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

of the Securities Act of 1933. Subsequently, pleas of guilty were
entered for all of the defendants except Scott, who was tried and
acquitted. On February 8, 1940, sentences were imposed as follows:
Williams, one year and a day and $5,000 fine; Tuttle and Blumenthal,
each six months and fines of $1,000 and $1,500, respectively; Connor,
six months; and Foundation Plan, Inc., $2,500 fine. Because of the
acquittal of Scott, which the court characterized as a miscarriage of
justice, all of the prison sentences were suspended.
In Securities and Exchange Commission v. Louis Payne, the Commission commenced an action in the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York to enjoin Payne from the further
sale of securities without registration under the Securities Act of 1933.
The Commission's complaint alleged that the defendant was selling
securities camouflaged as the sale of live silver foxes coupled with an
undertaking by the defendant to care for and breed the foxes. The
purchasers were to receive the net proceeds from the sale of the
offspring or their pelts. Pursuant to the Rules of Civil Procedure for
the District Courts of the United States, the Commission served upon
the defendant written interrogatories and requests for the admission
of facts and of the genuineness of certain documents. The Commission consented to an order vacating the interrogatories.
On
January 19, 1940, a similar motion with respect to the Commission's
notice to admit facts and the genuineness of documents was denied.
At the close of the fiscal year, a motion by the Commission for summary judgment was pending before the court. lOa
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Leon Starmont et o1.-on
October 31,1939, the Commission commenced an action in the United
States District Court for the Eastern District of Washington to enjoin
Starmont and Mining Truth Publishing Company, of which Starmont
was managing director and controlling stockholder, from further
violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933.
The defendants published a so-called investment advisory service
known as "Mining Truth."
Certain issues of "Mining Truth"
carried the announcement of the proposed organization of a mining
company and solicited subscriptions to the publication accompanied
by agreements to accept stock in the proposed corporation, such stock
to be assessable and registered with the Commission prior to issuance.
The subscription requirement was eliminated in later issues which
solicited an "indieation of possible acceptance" of stock in the proposed
company. On November 18, 1939, the district court found that this
solicitation involved a sale of securities and issued a preliminary
10. On November IS, IlHO,the court held that Payne was selling securities, granted the Commission's
motion for summary judgment and enjoined Payne from further violating the registration provisions of the
Act.

injunction restraining the defendants from further solicitation without
complying with the Securities Act of 1933. On February 1, 1940, the
injunction was made permament.
Securities and Exchange Commission v. Henderson.--0n March 25,
1940, Frank M. Henderson was permanently enjoined by the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi from
further violating Section 17 (b) of the Securities Act of 1933. Henderson was the publisher of the Mississippi Oil Review, in which,
though not purporting to offer any security for sale, he described
various oil securities, specifically the capital stocks of Yazoo Refinery,
Inc., Eureka Petroleum Company, Inc., and Magnolia Royalty and
Leasing Company, without disclosing that the publication of such
articles was paid for by those companies and by underwriters and
dealers in the securities. The purpose of Section 17 (b) in requiring
the disclosure of such payments is to protect investors from relying
upon descriptions of securities which, while purporting to be objective,
are actually inspired and subsidized by persons seeking to promote the
sale of the described securities. Henderson consented to the entry of
the injunction order.
Criminal Proceedings.

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the
transmission to the Department of Justice of evidence of violations of
the criminal provisions of those statutes. Criminal proceedings are
instituted in the discretion of the Attorney General. It is the policy
of the Commission to make a thorough investigation of alleged violations of law before referring a case to the Department of Justice and
to furnish to the Department the results of such investigation. Thereafter, if criminal proceedings are instituted, the members of the Commission's staff who participated in the investigation assist the United

Commission investigations.
A total of 20 defendants have been so
indicted, including 6 defendants against whom indictments were
returned during the past fiscal year. Four defendants were convicted
of perjury during the year, and at the end of the year indictments were
pending as to 13 defendants.
The number of cases referred to the Department of Justice during
the past fiscal year represents an increase of 25 percent over such
references during the preceding year. Furthermore, the number
of defendants convicted in such cases during the past fiscal year was
not only 31 percent greater than the corresponding figure for the
previous year, but is the largest number of defendants ever convicted
in a single year in cases developed by the Commission. It is also
interesting to note that of the total of 615 defendants convicted in
cases referred by the Commission, 409, or two-thirds, were convicted
on pleas of guilty or nolo contendere.
The following table discloses the comparative statistics with respect
to criminal proceedings in cases developed by the Commission.

Up to July 1, 1940, the Commission had secured the citation of 24
defendants in 7 proceedings for contempt of court orders which had

description of some of the more important cases follows.
United States v. McGhie and Rothe-OnfJulY
12, 1940, George
McGhie, Jr., a Chicago broker, pleaded nolo contendere to an indictment

152

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

returned in the United States District Court for the Western District
of Wisconsin, charging him and Lester W. Rothe, former Special
Deputy Commissioner of Banking of the State of Wisconsin, with
perpetrating a fraud on the Banking Commission of Wisconsin and on
certain closed banks and "segregated trusts" set up under the banking
laws of that State. The scheme involved the payment by McGhie to
Rothe, the indictment alleged, of secret bribes approximating $20,000,
for which Rothe induced the trustees of the "segregated trusts" to purchase securities from George McGhie & Company, and caused both
the banks and the trusts to sell portfolio securities to George McGhie
& Company at prices below the then current market for such securities,
thereby enabling McGhie to resell at a substantial profit. McGhie
was fined $1,500. The case is still pending against Rothe, who has
been serving a prison sentence under a State charge arising out of the
same practices.
Among the false pretenses and misrepresentations charged in the
indictment were the following: that George McGhie, Jr., and Lester
W. Rothe were acting independently and at arm's-length in transactions involving securities of the closed banks and" segregated trusts";
that McGhie was selling such securities" at the market"; and that
securities recommended by Rothe to the trustees of the "segregated
trusts" were good investments and appropriate for such trusts.
United States v. Kenyon &: 00., Inc. et al.-After a trial of seven
and one-half weeks in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York, Kenyon & Co., Inc., Samuel Sobel, Lucian A.
Eddy, Edward E. Embree, Ernest K. Schwartz, and lWei! Management Company, Inc., were found guilty on November 22,1939, under
an indictment which charged violations of the fraud provisions of
the Securities Act of 1933, mail fraud, and conspiracy. Previously,
Charles Russell Kenyon, Norman E. Dizer, and GeorgeR. Grantham
had pleaded guilty.
In general, the indictment alleged, the defendants, together with
Donald P. Kenyon, deceased, defrauded seven investment companies out of approximately $900,000. The scheme to defraud
commenced with the acquisition of control by the defendants and
Donald P. Kenyon of Alpha Shares, Inc., Monthly Income Shares,
Inc. of New Jersey, United Sponsors, Inc., and Investors Fund of
America, Inc. Thereafter, according to the indictment, the defendants and Kenyon extracted funds from these companies by causing
the companies, under the guise of legitimate business transactions, to
pay approximately $460,000 for securities owned by Donald P.
Kenyon or issued by other companies controlled by the defendants
and at prices far in excess of their fair market value. Further, the
defendants and Kenyon caused Monthly Income Shares, Inc., of New
York to pledge securities owned by it as collateral for a loan and to

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

153

advance the proceeds of the loan to the defendants; the defendants
then used this money to purchase at approximately $50 per share, a
controlling stock interest in the North Bergen Trust Company;
thereafter, the defendants transferred 350 of such shares to Monthly
Income Shares, Inc., of New York at the rate of $115 per share
in cancellation of the advance made to the defendants by that
company. As a further example of the defendants' methods it
appears that, after acquiring control of United Sponsors, Inc., and
United Standard Oilshares Corporation, which had management
contracts with Investors Fund of America, Inc., and United Standard
Oilfund of America, Inc., the defendants caused $235,000 to be paid
by the latter two companies as pretended consideration for the cancellation of such contracts, when in fact such payments were devoted
to the use of the defendants and Kenyon. Of these payments,
$34,000 was paid over to Kenyon and Co., Inc., purportedly in payment of a non-existent indebtedness.
Kenyon & Co., Inc., and Weil Management Co., Inc., were fined
$10,000 each; Sobel was sentenced to 2 years imprisonment on each
of five counts, the sentences to run concurrently; and Eddy and
Embree were each sentenced to imprisonment for 1 year and 1 day.
Grantham, Dizer, and Charles Russell Kenyon were placed on
probation for' 5 years. Schwartz has not yet been sentenced.
United Stasee v. Donnell et al.-Qn December 2, 1939, Ethel Pitt
Donnell, Edward J. Hartenfeld, and Robert D. Beckett were convicted in the United States District Court for the Southern District
of Indiana for fraud in connection with the sale of the securities of
American Terminals and Transit Company and its subsidiary,
Green River Valley Terminal Company. The other defendant,
John K. Knapp, was acquitted.
Mrs. Donnell and Hartenfeld were officers and directors of, and
Beckett was sales agent for, the companies. According to the indictment, the defendants defrauded numerous investors in Indiana, Ohio,
and elsewhere by means of misrepresentations and other fraudulent
devices. The indictment alleged that the defendants had represented
that subsidiary companies were operating at a profit and that there
were earnings available for payment of interest and principal on the
companies' bonds and notes, when in fact the subsidiaries were only
in the development stage and had had substantial deficits rather than
profits; that a subsidiary coal company had had large production
and sales of coal, when in fact such production and sales were infrequent, often interrupted, and always at a loss; and that the proceeds
from the sale of securities were to be used for plants and facilities, when
in fact the proceeds were used largely for the benefit of the defendants
and for purposes other than plants and equipment. It was also
alleged that the defendants switched investors out of building and

154

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

loan stocks and into the companies' securities by means of the misrepresentations, together with false statements as to the value of the
building and loan stocks.
Hartenfeld and Mrs. Donnell were each sentenced to ten years imprisonment and fined $5,000, and Beckett was sentenced to eight
years imprisonment and fined $2,500. Hartenfeld appealed from his
conviction which, on June 11, 1940, was affirmed by the United States
Circuit Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit.
United States v. Sidney J. Dillon et al.-On November 27, 1939,
Sidney J. Dillon and Lewis E. Crowley were sentenced in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of Iowa upon their
pleas of nolo contendere to an indictment charging violation of the
fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the mail fraud
statute.
According to the indictment, the defendants made a number of
misrepresentations in connection with the sale of shares in three
investment trusts-American Securities Trust, Mutual Trust Shares,
and Cooperative Trust Shares. It was alleged that the defendants
stated to customers that the trust funds would be invested only in
listed securities or Government bonds; that returns to investors would
be paid only from earnings; that the investors' contributions would
be retained intact; that management expenses would be limited to
one-half of one percent quarterly of the value of the trust assets;
and that the trusts were complying with the regulations of the Iowa
Securities Commission. The indictment charged that at the time
these representations were made, the defendants knew and intended
that a substantial portion of the trust funds would be diverted to the
use of the defendants; that dividends would be paid out of capital;
that the defendants would pay to themselves management fees several
times greater than one-half of one percent quarterly; and that they
had falsely represented the condition of the trusts to the Iowa Securities Commission.
Dillon was sentenced to five years imprisonment and fined $1,000,
and Crowley was sentenced to three years imprisonment and fined
$1,000. On July 16, 1940, the convictions were affirmed by the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.
United States v. McDermott et al.-Qn February 7, 1940, a plea of
guilty was entered by Frederick J. McDermott, one of seven defendants named in an indictment charging conspiracy to gain control of a
group of investment trusts and other corporations with aggregate
assets of over $60,000,000. The fourteen-count indictment, returned
on February 1, 1940, in Federal court at New York City, named, in
addition to McDermott, the following defendants: Harold L. Bishop,
Vincent J. Kennedy, Walter A. Stegman, Slagle J. Halsted, Arthur J.
Keon, and Rinder Corporation.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

155

Defendants Halsted and Keon, according to the indictment, posed
as officers of fifteen non-existent corporations, for which fake bonds
were printed. Stegman, a certified public accountant of New York,
was charged in the indictment with having prepared the financial
statements of these fictitious corporations. McDermott and Bishop
were alleged to have engineered the operations of the plot to defraud
banks, insurance companies, and investment trusts by using the bonds
as collateral to obtain loans, with which they intended to purchase
control of a number of companies, including the following: Reynolds
Investing Company, First Income Trading Corporation, R. C. Williams and Company, Utility Equities Corporation, Eagle Warehouse
and Storage Company, General Public Service Corporation, Manhattan Life Insurance Company, Eureka-Maryland Assurance Company, Colonial Life Insurance Company, Utility and Industrial Corporation, Franklin Life Insurance Company, and Universal Indemnity
Company.
United States v. F. Donald Ooster et al.-on May 22, 1940, the
United States District Court for the Southern District of N ew York
sentenced seven defendants convicted under indictments based upon
the tremendous fraud perpetrated by Philip Musica, alias F. Donald
Coster, president of McKesson & Robbins, Inc. Coster committed
suicide. His three brothers, George, Arthur, and Robert, and
Benjamin Simon pleaded guilty prior to the trial. During the trial,
Leonard Jenkins and John Jenkins also entered pleas of guilty. The
jury found John H. McGloon, vice president and comptroller of
McKesson & Robbins, Inc., guilty of falsifying reports filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, but acquitted Horace B.
Merwin and Rowley W. Phillips, directors. The following sentences
were imposed; Arthur Musica and Benjamin Simon, each three years
imprisonment; George Musica, two years and six months imprisonment; Robert Musica, one year and six months imprisonment; John
Jenkins, one year and one day imprisonment; Leonard Jenkins, suspended sentence of one year and one day; and John H. McGloon, one
year and one day imprisonment and a $5,000 fine. McGloon has
taken an appeal. On December 30, 1940, after the close of the fiscal
year, McGloon's conviction was affirmed by the Circuit Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit.
Evidence was introduced to show that there had been a conspiracy
and scheme to inflate the assets of McKesson & Robbins, Inc., and
affiliated corporations by means of fictitious purchases and sales,
which were reflected in false and misleading statements made in annual
reports filed with the Commission and the New York Stock Exchange.
United States v. S. W. GongoUet al.-On April 8, 1940, sentences
were imposed by the United States District Court for Minnesota on
seven defendants convicted of fraud in connection with the sale of

156

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

several million dollars face amount of investment contracts and other
securities issued by a large number of investment companies, the
securities of which were sold from coast to coast by S. W. Gongoll &
Company, Minneapolis. The principal defendant, Stanley W.
Gongoll, was given a prison sentence of 4 years; Frank F. Hofacre,
office manager, W. S. Douglas, officer of several of the companies, and
Paul J. Thompson, sales manager, were each given jail sentences of 15
months; sentence was suspended as to Stanley B. Newhall, salesman,
Mildred V. Nylund, confidential secretary, and Elaine M. Wegfors,
market trader, each of whom was placed on probation for 3 years.
When it was forced into bankruptcy, S. W. Gongoll & Company
owed $2,800,000 to its clients and had cash assets of but $4,600. The
Commission's investigation disclosed that the securities of the numerous companies controlled by the defendants were sold in California,
Colorado, Iowa, Illinois, New York, Pennsylvania, North Dakota,
South Dakota, Wisconsin, and Minnesota. Under the defendants'
scheme, customers deposited securities and money, for which they
received various forms of investment contracts and profit-sharing
agreements, to be used by the defendants to speculate in securities.
The indictment charged that the defendants misrepresented their
earnings, their success in trading, the financial condition of the company, and the amount of reserves that had been set up to protect the
accounts of the customers from loss. The indictment also charged
that the defendants had sold unregistered securities in violation of
the Securities Act of 1933.
United States v. Shideler et al.-On September 25, 1939, Fred W.
Shideler was sentenced in the United States District Court for the
Southern District of Indiana to seven years imprisonment and fined
$5,000 on his plea of guilty to an indictment charging him and William
A. Shideler with the fraudulent operation of a securities business in
Indianapolis. On January 11, 1940, William A. Shideler was found
guilty under the same indictment and sentenced to eight years imprisonment.
The Shidelers, operating under the name of Shideler and Company,
solicited money and securities from numerous customers for investment in trading accounts to be managed by the defendants on a
profit-sharing basis. Under one of the plans, the investors were to
get a monthly income which was represented to be advances against
profits to be earned. To induce people to invest, the indictment
alleged, the defendants falsely asserted that they were maintaining a
$300,000 fund to pay losses in the event that the market declined.
Evidence was adduced at the trial to show that members of the public
invested on the basis of false representations which included statements that the defendants were successful dealers in securities and
expert stock market analysts, and that the :firm had been making
large profits for its customers. Further to deceive the investors, the

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

157

indictment alleged, the defendants resorted to the device of making
pretended profit distributions out of the very funds invested by the
customers.
United States v. Fritz et al.-An attorney, two New York City
brokers, and a small loan company executive were convicted on November 1, 1939, in the United States District Court for Maryland on
an indictment charging violation of the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the mail fraud statute in the sale of the stock of
Allied Finance Corporation of Baltimore. During the trial, evidence
was introduced to show that the prospectus :filedwith the Securities
and Exchange Commission and used in the sale of the stock, misrepresented the amount of commission to be paid to the distributing
brokers and the amount of the proceeds that would go into the capital
funds of the company. The fraudulent scheme, it was charged,
included the not uncommon device of impressing investors through
the payment of dividends, even though the company was operating at
a deficit. David Kohler and M. D. Schreiber, brokers of New York
City, who conducted the stock distribution, were each given a prison
sentence of 12 months; Andrew G. W. Fritz, president of Allied Finance Corporation, was given a prison sentence of 6 months; and
Philip Birnbaum, of New York City, attorney for Kohler and Schreiber
was placed on probation for 3 years. Birnbaum's appeal was dismissed by the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit.
United States v. Rossignol et al.-0n
November 4, 1939, J. R.
Rossignol and A. J. Crocy were found guilty in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Georgia under an indictment charging the employment of a fraudulent stock-trading scheme
effected through the operation of Rossignol & Crocy, Inc., Atlanta,
Georgia. The defendants held themselves out as expert investment
counsellors and by means of misrepresentations induced the public
to entrust funds to the company for trading under a profit-sharing
arrangement.
The conviction of Rossignol, who had been sentenced
to four years imprisonment, was affirmed on June 20, 1940, by the
United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. Crocy,
who received a two and one-half year prison term, did not appeal.
Evidence was produced at the trial to show that it was part of the
scheme to defraud for the defendants to appropriate and convert both
the funds invested and the collateral put up by investors, and to
maintain an artificial market in the shares of Bankers Industrial
Service, Inc" some of which were given to investors as evidence of
the good faith of the defendants and were falsely represented to be
equal in value to the money put up by the investors.
United States v. Holmes et al.-The most severe sentence ever imposed in a criminal case under the Securities Act of 1933-15 years
imprisonment and a :fineof $25,00o-was received by Leo S. Holmes,
of Omaha, one of three defendants convicted on May 4, 1940, in the

158

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

United States District Court for Nebraska of fraud in connection
with the sale of the securities of First Mortgage Acceptance Corporation, Omaha, Nebraska. When the corporation went into bankruptcy in February 1939, it had outstanding $1,350,000 face amount
of securities. Holmes was president of the company. George M.
Hauser, vice president of the company, was sentenced to 6 years
imprisonment and fined $1,000, and J. W. McCormack, a Chicago
real-estate broker, the third defendant, was given a prison sentence
of 15 months.
Evidence was introduced at the trial to show that Holmes and
Hauser, who controlled First Mortgage Acceptance Corporation and
its affiliates, Conservative Mortgage Acceptance Corporation and
Nebraska Agricultural Corporation, purchased numerous real-estate
mortgages from the defendant McCormack and others at large discounts from the face amount of these mortgages so that First Mortgage Acceptance Corporation and Conservative Mortgage Acceptance
Corporation could set up fictitious profits. The pretended profits
were used, it was charged, to make interest and maturity payments
on the securities sold to the public, a device which was effectively
employed to induce additional investments and to conceal the insolvency of the company.
In United States v. Norman W. Minuse et al., the indictment charged
a conspiracy to violate Sections 9 (a) (1) and (2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, in that Minuse had obtained an option to
purchase 79,000 shares of Tastyeast, Inc., Class A common stock
and had thereafter entered into a conspiracy with the other defendants, Joseph E. H. Pelletier and Russell Van Wycke Stuart, to raise
the price of the stock on the N ew York Curb Exchange by means of
"wash" sales, "matched" orders, and a series of manipulative transactions for the purpose of distributing the optioned stock at the
higher prices. The "matched" orders were alleged to involve the
entering of orders on one side of the market with the knowledge that
orders of substantially the same size would be entered on the other
side at substantially the same time and price, and with a manipulative
purpose. Other market-rigging devices charged in the indictment included the payment of secret bonuses to various customers men for
their services in inducing customers and clients to purchase the stock
and the promise of rebates or discounts on the purchase price.
Minuse and Pelletier were found guilty and, on January 29, 1940,
were sentenced in the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York-Minuse to 2 years imprisonment and a fine
of $5,000 and Pelletier to 18 months imprisonment and a fine of
$1,000. Stuart, who had previously pleaded guilty, was sentenced
to 2 years imprisonment, which sentence was suspended. However, on August 7, 1940, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

159

for the Second Circuit reversed the judgment of the lower court for
errors at the trial relating to the introduction of evidence and other
rulings of the court and ordered a new trial.
United States v. George J. Morrison et al.-Morrison
and Emile
Jacques were named as defendants in an indictment charging violation of Sections 9 (a) (1) and (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. Morrison had obtained an option to purchase 5,000 shares of
the common stock of BIG Sandwich Shops, Inc., at prices ranging
from 1 to 1%. Thereafter, according to the indictment, Morrison and
Jacques "rigged" the market for the stock on the New York Produce Exchange by means of "wash" sales and a series of manipulative transactions designed to create the appearance of active trading and to raise the price from $1.25 to $4.00 per share, for the purpose
of distributing the optioned stock at the higher prices. These "wash"
sales were alleged to involve transactions in the stock, without any
change in beneficial ownership, between the two defendants and
through accounts opened by them with different brokerage firms, and
which resulted in fictitious quotations on the ticker tape. During the
trial and after the Government's case, both defendants pleaded guilty
and were sentenced in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to imprisonment for 1 year and 1 day each.
Sentence was suspended as to Jacques, who was put on probation for
2 years.
United States v. Perry et al.-The Commission's investigation into
the fraudulent sale of securities issued by the Seminole Provident
Trust resulted in the conviction of six defendants in the United States
District Court at Minneapolis. The trust held options on interests in
six oil and gas leases in the Seminole field in Oklahoma. The fraud
charged in two indictments consisted of misrepresentations with
respect to the amount of the proceeds from the sale of securities that
would be applied to the purchase of oil and gas leases, the payment
of distributions to investors out of the proceeds from the sale of units
or securities under the pretense that these funds were derived from
the sale of oil produced on the trust's properties, and that the properties would produce in excess of 4,000,000 barrels of oil, when in fact
they could not be expected to produce more than 500,000 barrels.
One of the indictments also charged that the defendants, other than
Ahlborg, had violated the prospectus requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933 and had represented that the Commission had passed
upon the merits of the securities issued by the trust, in violation of
Section 23 of the Act.
On November 18, 1939, E. R. Perry and S. L. Dedman, "trustees"
of Seminole Provident Trust, were each sentenced to 15 months imprisonment; John Ahlborg, operating under the name of Foreman &
Company and the principal underwriter, received a prison sentence of 4

160

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

months and was fined $1,500; Otis Backenstoce and Delbert R. Card,
who had conducted selling campaigns in Minnesota, were placed on
probation for 2 years; R. B. Allport, who, holding himself out as a
petroleum valuation engineer, had participated in the scheme by writing letters concerning the accuracy of the valuation reports used in
the sale of the units, was placed on probation for 1 year; and Kent K.
Kimball was acquitted.
According to the registration statement filed with the Commission,
the defendants had proposed to sell securities in the aggregate amount
of $800,000, divided into 8,000 units. In September 1937, the trustees
consented to the entry of a stop order. Thereafter, a permanent
injunction was issued against the defendants as the result of a suit
brought by the Commission, and the broker-dealer registration of
Foreman & Company was revoked.
United States v . Platt et al.-On September 29, 1939, Moe Platt and
John J. McKee were convicted in the United States District Court
for the Southern District of N ew York on a charge of conspiracy to
defraud the United States in connection with its governmental function of administering the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The indictment alleged that McKee, while
employed by the Commission as an accountant-investigator, had accepted bribes from Platt to assist Platt in obstructing an investigation by the Commission into his activities in connection with the sale
of the stock of Backbone Mining Company. Each of the defendants
was sentenced to two years imprisonment and fined $2,500.
Subsequently, Platt, together with Bernard Frankel, Bernard
McNey, and Charles Lutz, pleaded guilty in the United States District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania to indictments
charging violation of the fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
in the sale of the stock of Backbone Mining Company. It was alleged
that the defendants in selling such stock had falsely represented that
application had been made to list the stock on an exchange; that-the
stock would be placed on a regular dividend basis within a few months;
that the stock, which was under option to the defendants at 75 cents
a share, would advance to at least $20 a share within a few months;
and that the distribution of the stock by the defendants had been
approved by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The indictments also charged it to be a part of the scheme for the defendants,
by means of various artificial devices, to raise the price of the stock
from $1 to $6 a share. Platt was sentenced to imprisonment for two
years and six months, to run concurrently with the earlier sentence,
while each of the other defendants was placed on probation for two
years and fined $200.
United States v, Buckman et al.; United States v, George et al.;
United States v. Kehaya et al.-Barton E. Buckman and Louis C.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

161

George, both of Madison, Wisconsin, were convicted on June 5, 1940,
in the United States District Court for the Western District of Wisconsin under an indictment charging them with fraudulent practices
in connection with the operation of B. E. Buckman & Company, one
of the largest securities :firmsin the Middle West. Evidence was introduced to show that Buckman and George, officers of B. E. Buckman & Company, had organized, and dominated the affairs of, Continental Public Service Company, an Arkansas corporation; Gulf
Coast Water Company, a Texas corporation; Dairyland, Inc., a
Texas corporation; and Continental Service Company, a Delaware
corporation, the stocks of which were sold by B. E. Buckman & Company at a time when the issuers of the securities were insolvent.
Defendant Edgar C. Holt pleaded nolo contendere and defendants
Edwin J. Crofoot, Richard E. George, Fielding T. Spain, Clarence C.
Winebrenner, and Wilbur V. Malkson were acquitted.
The indictment was nolle prossed as to defendants James C. Casey, Lewis P.
Bracy, and Frank R. Shotola.
Part of the case presented was based upon falsification of the financial condition and earnings of B. E. Buckman & Company and the
corporations, the securities of which were sold by the defendants.
Evidence was introduced to show that it was a part of the scheme for
B. E. Buckman & Company to borrow bonds and other securities
from its customers in order that they might be converted into cash to
be used by B. E. Buckman & Company, which was insolvent at the
time. Buckman was sentenced to five years imprisonment and a
fine of $2,000; George, to six years imprisonment and a fine of $2,000;
and Holt, to four years probation and a fine of $500.
Pending against Buckman and George is an indictment returned in
the United States District Court for the Northern District of illinois
charging them with perjury committed before an officer of the Securities and Exchange Commission. In this case, Perry Sletteland, an
attorney of Madison, Wisconsin, is a codefendant. .Another indictment, charging Louis C. George, together with two other defendants,
with having effected a stock manipulation on the New York Curb
Exchange, is pending in New York City. Moses A. Isaacs, of New
York, and Josiah Marshall Kirby, of Cleveland, are the co-defendants.
The indictment charges that the defendants created an artificial
market in the stock of Automatic Products, Inc., by means of various
manipulative devices, including the guarantee of purchasers against
loss and the payment of commissions and bonuses for the purpose of
drumming up buying power and thereby facilitating the distribution
of 95,000 shares of the stock.
Louis C. George is also named in an indictment returned in New
York which includes as defendants Ery Kehaya, Harry J. Rothman,
and Harry D. Meyer. This indictment charges a manipulation of

162

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the N ew York Stock Exchange market for the stock of Standard
Commercial Tobacco Company by means of wash sales, matched
orders, and by touting customers men. It is charged that George's
participation in this scheme occurred while he was vice president of
B. E. Buckman & Company. At the time of the indictment, the
United States Attorney estimated that the public had lost upwards
of $4,000,000.
The "Front Money" Racket.

For some time the Commission has been concerned over the prevalence of the "front money" or "advance fee" racket, in which unscrupulous operators approach a wide variety of small business concerns with the suggestion that needed capital be obtained through
the sale of securities. Frequently, the "front money" operator takes
an exclusive option on such securities for the purpose of inducing the
belief that the operator's sole remuneration would consist of commissions from the sale of the securities. Thereafter, the victim is induced to make payments for various alleged services, such as incorporation, the employment of a registrar and transfer agent, dealers'
trips to inspect the business and to interest other dealers throughout
the country, and the preparation and filing of a prospectus or registration statement with this Commission. These fees are alleged to
represent the actual cost of such services, but in fact include large
personal undisclosed profits to the operators of the scheme.
During 1938 and 1939, the Commission instituted proceedings
resulting in the revocation of the broker-dealer registrations of three
firms which were engaged in the operation of" front money" schemes.
The Commission then submitted to the Post Office Department and
the Department of Justice the evidence it had obtained in these and
other cases in which the operators were not registered, but concerning whose activities the Commission had received complaints. The
ensuing joint investigation disclosed that, for the past six years,
hundreds of small concerns engaged in many types of business had
been induced to pay to the "front money" operators fees estimated to
aggregate hundreds of thousands of dollars. The investigation failed
to reveal a single instance in which a share of stock had been sold for
the victims.
On May 21, 1940, the joint investigation culminated in an indictment by a Federal grand jury in Cleveland, charging 12 defendants
with violations of the mail fraud statute and with conspiracy to violate
the mail fraud statute in the operation of an international "front
money" scheme. Included among the defendants were the dominant
figures in two of the three firms whose broker-dealer registrations had
already been revoked by the Commission. The controlling person in
the third firm has already been convicted of mail fraud and sentenced
to the penitentiary.
On June 20, 1940, an additional indictment was

returned in Detroit, charging four defendants with similar frauds.
Herbert C. Schelzel, one of the defendants named in the second indictment, has already pleaded guilty in the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Michigan and has been sentenced to 15
months imprisonment.
Civil and Criminal Cases in which Certiorari was denied by the United States
Supreme Court during the past fiscal year.

In United States v. William P. Buckner, Jr., et al., William P.
Buckner, Jr., and William J. Gillespie were convicted of mail fraud
and conspiracy and Felipe Buencamino of conspiracy in connection
with the operations of a committee for the protection of holders of
Philippine Railway bonds." On January 8, 1940, the Circuit Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the convictions of Buckner
and Gillespie on five mail fraud counts and the conspiracy count,
reversing on two mail fraud counts. The conviction of Buencamino
was also affirmed. Buckner and Gillespie filed petitions for writs of
certiorari, which were denied on March 11, 1940.
In United States v. Harry H. Landay et al., five defendants were
convicted of violation of the registration and fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933 and conspiracy in connection with the sale of
stock of R. Cummins & Company. On December 14, 1939, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit affirmed their convictions.
Landay, Lane, Attix, and Brown filed petitions for writs of certiorari.
The petitions were denied on April 1, 1940.
In Securities and Exchange Oommission v. Universal Service Association, six defendants were enjoined from violating the registration and
fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with the
sale of subscriptions and memberships in Universal Service Association and Universal Order of Plenocrats. On June 23, 1939, the Circuit
Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the judgment of the
district court." A petition for a writ of certiorari was denied January
2, 1940.
In Securities and Exchange Oommission, as relator, and Universal
Service Association et al., as respondents, two defendants were found
to be in criminal contempt of court for violating the permanent injunction entered against them on April 14, 1938. Both defendants appealed and on January 4, 1940, the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit affirmed the order of the district court as to C.
Franklin Davis, but reversed the order as to Universal Service Association." Davis filed a petition for a writ of certiorari which was denied
on April 22, 1940.

ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN THE FIELD OF ACCOUNTING
AND AUDITING
The McKesson & Robbins Case.

As explained in the Commission's Fifth Annual Report, public
hearings in the McKesson & Robbins case were held pursuant to
an order entered by the Commission on December 29, 1938, to determine (1) the character, detail, and scope of the audit procedure followed by Price, Waterhouse & Co., in the preparation of the registrant's financial statements; (2) the extent to which prevailing and
generally accepted standards and requirements of audit procedure
were adhered to and applied in the preparation of the financial statements; and (3) the adequacy of the safeguards inhering in generally
accepted practices and principles of audit procedure to assure reliability and accuracy of financial statements. Following the close of
the fiscal year, the Commission published a report on its investigation
of this matter."
A summary of the principal facts in this case and
the conclusions set forth in the Commission's report are reproduced
below:
"SUMMARY

OF PRINCIPAL

FACTS

"The securities of McKesson & Robbins, Incorporated (Maryland)
were listed and traded on the N ew York Stock Exchange and registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Financial statements of the Corporation and its subsidiaries for the year ended
December 31, 1937 (the last before the disclosure of the fraud hereinafter described) certified by Price, Waterhouse & Co., filed with this
Commission and the New York Stock Exchange, and issued to stockholders reported total consolidated assets in excess of $87,000,000.
Approximately $19,000,000 of these assets are now known to have
been entirely fictitious. The fictitious items consisted of inventories,
$10,000,000; accounts receivable, $9,000,000; and cash in bank,
$75,000; and arose out of the operation at the Bridgeport offices of a
wholly fictitious foreign crude drug business shown on the books of
the Connecticut Division of McKesson & Robbins, Incorporated
(Maryland) and McKesson & Robbins, Limited (Canada), one of its
subsidiaries. For the year 1937, fictitious sales of these units amounted

of Documents, Washington,

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

165

to $18,247,020.60 on which fictitious gross profit of $1,801,390.60 was
recorded. At the time of the exposure of the fraud on or about December 5, 1938, the fictitious assets had increased to approximately
$21,000,000.
"The fraud was engineered by Frank Donald Coster, president of
McKesson & Robbins since its merger with Girard & Co., Inc., in
November 1926. In reality Coster was Philip M. Musica who, under
the latter name, had been convicted of commercial frauds. In carrying
out the fraud Coster in the later years was assisted principally by his
three brothers: George E. Dietrich, assistant treasurer of the Corporation, who was in reality George Musica; Robert J. Dietrich, head
of the shipping, receiving, and warehousing department of McKesson
& Robbins at Bridgeport, Connecticut, who was in reality Robert
Musica; and George Vernard, who was in reality Arthur Musica, and
who managed the offices, mailing addresses, bank accounts, and 'other
activities of the dummy concerns with whom the McKesson companies
supposedly conducted the fictitious business.
"To accomplish the deception, purchases were pretended to have
been made by the McKesson Companies from five Canadian vendors,
who thereafter purportedly retained the merchandise at their warehouses for the account of McKesson. Sales were pretended to have
been made for McKesson's account by W. W. Smith & Company, Inc.
and the goods shipped directly by the latter from the Canadian vendors
to the customers. Payments for goods purchased and collections
from customers for goods sold were pretended to have been made by
the Montreal banking firm of Manning & Company also for the account of McKesson. W. W. Smith & Company, Inc., Manning &
Company, and the five Canadian vendors are now known to have
been either entirely fictitious or merely blinds used by Coster for the
purpose of supporting the fictitious transactions.
"Invoices, advices, and other documents prepared on printed forms
in the names of these :firms were used to give an appearance of reality
to the fictitious transactions. In addition to this manufacture of
documents, a series of contracts and guarantees with Smith and
Manning and forged credit reports on Smith were also utilized. The
foreign :firms to whom the goods were supposed to have been sold
were real but had done no business of the type indicated with
McKesson.
"The fictitious transactions originated early in the life of Girard &
Co., Inc., Coster's predecessor concern, incorporated on January 31,
1923, and increased until they reached the proportions mentioned
above. The manner of handling the transactions described above was
273226--41----12

166

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the one in vogue since the middle of 1935. Prior to that time the
fictitious goods were supposed to have been physically received at
and reshipped from the Bridgeport plant of McKesson. And prior
to 1931 McKesson made actual cash payments directly for the fictitious purchases, which at that time were supposed to have been made
from a group of domestic vendors, but recovered a large part of this
cash purportedly as collections on the fictitious sales. The change
from using actual cash to the supposed clearance through Manning &
Company was not effected abruptly but for some time after 1931 both
systems were used. The Canadian vendors, however, were used only
in connection with the Manning clearance system. From the report
of the accountant for the trustee in reorganization of McKesson &
Robbins, Incorporated, it appears that out of an actual cash outgo
from the McKesson Companies in connection with these fictitious
transactions of $24,777,851.90 all but $2,869,482.95 came back to the
McKesson Companies in collection of fictitious receivables or as cash
transfers from the pretended bank of Manning & Company.
"CONCLUSION

"Our conclusion based upon the facts revealed by the record, the
testimony of the expert witnesses, and the writings of recognized
authorities is that the audits performed by Price, Waterhouse & Co.
substantially conformed, in form, as to the scope and procedures
employed, to what was generally considered mandatory during the
period of the Girard-McKesson engagements. Their failure to
discover the gross overstatement of assets and of earnings is attributable to the manner in which the audit work was done. In carrying
out the work they failed to employ that degree of vigilance, inquisitiveness, and analysis of the evidence available that is necessary in a
professional undertaking and is recommended in all well-known and
authoritative works on auditing. In addition, the overstatement
should have been disclosed if the auditors had corroborated the
Company's records by actual observation and independent confirmation through procedures involving regular inspection of inventories and
confirmation of accounts receivable, audit steps which, although considered better practice and used by many accountants, were not
considered mandatory by the profession prior to our hearings.
"Price, Waterhouse & Co. maintain that a balance sheet examination is not intended and cannot be expected to detect a falsification of
records concealing an inflation of assets and of earnings if accomplished
by a widespread conspiracy carried on by the president of a corporation, aided by others within and without the recognized ranks of a
corporation's operating personnel, and that no practical system of
internal check can be devised the effectiveness of which cannot be
nullified by criminal collusion on the part of a chief executive and key

SIXTH ANNuAL REPORrr

167

employees. Such cases are so rare, in their opinion, that there is no
economic justification for the amount of auditing work which would
be required to increase materially the protection against it.
"The inference to be drawn from this position and from statements
made by others in connection with this case is that a detailed audit of
all transactiona as distinguished from an examination based on tests
and samples would have been necessary to reveal the falsification.
However, as we view the situation in this case, a detailed audit of all
transactions carried out by the same staff would merely have covered a
larger volume of the same kinds of fictitious documents and transactions. While this might have brought under review more instances
of what we have listed as circumstances suggesting further investigation, there is little ground for believing that this alone would have
raised any greater question as to the authenticity of the transactions.
"Moreover, we believe that even in balance sheet examinations for
corporations whose securities are held by the public, accountants can
be expected to detect gross overstatements of assets and profits
whether resulting from collusive fraud or otherwise. We believe that
alertness on the part of the entire staff, coupled with intelligent
analysis by experienced accountants of the manner of doing business,
should detect overstatements in the accounts regardless of their cause
long before they assume the magnitude reached in this case. Furthermore, an examination of this kind should not, in our opinion, exclude
the highest officers of the corporation from its appraisal of the manner
in which the business under review is conducted. Without underestimating the important service rendered by independent public
accountants in their review of the accounting principles employed in
the preparation of financial statements filed with us and issued to
stockholders, we feel that the discovery of gross overstatements in the
accounts is a major purpose of such an audit even though it be conceded that it might not disclose every minor defalcation. In short,
Price, Waterhouse & Co.'s failure to uncover the gross overstatement
of assets and of earnings in this case should not, in our opinion, lead
to general condemnation of recognized procedures for the examination
of financial statements by means of tests and samples.
"We do feel, however, that there should be a material advance in
the development of auditing procedures whereby the facts disclosed
by the records and documents of the firm being examined are to a
greater extent checked by the auditors through physical inspection
or independent confirmation. The time has long passed, if it ever
existed, when the basis of an audit was restricted to the material
appearing in the books and records. For many years accountants
have in regularly applied procedures gone outside the records to establish the actual existence of assets and liabilities by physical inspection
or independent confirmation. As pointed out repeatedly in this

168

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

report, there are many ways in which this can be extended. Particularly, it is our opinion that auditing procedures relating to the
inspection of inventories and confirmation of receivables, which,
prior to our hearings, had been considered optional steps, should,
in accordance with the resolutions already adopted by the various
accounting societies, be accepted as normal auditing procedures in
connection with the presentation of comprehensive and dependable
financial statements to investors.
"We have carefully considered the desirability of specific rules
and regulations governing the auditing steps to be performed by accountants in certifying financial statements to be filed with us. Action
has already been taken by the accounting profession adopting certain
of the auditing procedures considered in this case. We have no reason
to believe at this time that these extensions will not be maintained
or that further extensions of auditing procedures along the lines
suggested in this report will not be made. Further, the adoption of
the specific recommendations made in this report as to the type of
disclosure to be made in the accountant's certificate and as to the
election of accountants by stockholders should insure that acceptable
standards of auditing procedure will be observed, that specific deviations therefrom may be considered in the particular instances in which
they arise, and that accountants will be more independent of management. Until experience should prove the contrary, we feel that this
program is preferable to its alternative-the
detailed prescription of
the scope of and procedures to be followed in the audit for the various
types of issuers of securities who file statements with us-and will
allow for further consideration of varying audit procedures and for
the development of different treatment for specific types of issuers."
The McKesson & Robbins Criminal Trial.

On March 30, 1939, the United States Grand Jury returned its
third indictment 16 in the matter of McKesson & Robbins, Inc., et al.,
naming, in addition to the three surviving Musica brothers, Benjamin
Simon, John Jenkins, Leonard Jenkins, John H. McGloon, Horace B.
Merwin, and Rowley W. Phillips." The indictment charged violation of the mail fraud statute, of Sections 13 and 32 of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, and a conspiracy to violate the foregoing
statutes. The Musica brothers and Benjamin Simon pleaded guilty
before trial. Insofar as the fictitious crude drug transactions were
concerned, it appears that at an early date Simon performed some
of the functions later carried on by George Vernard. John Jenkins
and Leonard Jenkins, brothers-in-law of Coster, both pleaded guilty
during the trial, the latter only to the conspiracy count. It appears
that they signed contracts, checks, and so forth, in the names of

persons supposedly connected with the fictitious concerns used to
carry on the fraud.
Horace B. Merwin and Rowley W. Phillips, who were directors of
McKesson & Robbins, Incorporated (Maryland), and of its predecessors and subsidiaries, McKesson & Robbins, Incorporated (Connecticut), McKesson & Robbins, Limited, and Girard & Co., Inc., were
acquitted by the jury on all counts. John H. McGloon, comptroller
of McKesson & Robbins since 1928, was acquitted of being part of
the conspiracy, of mail fraud, and of violating Sections 13 and 32 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the 1935 and
1936 annual reports filed by McKesson & Robbins, Incorporated, but
was found guilty on the count charging violation of Sections 13 and 32
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the filing
of the 1937 annual report, the last prior to the disclosure of the fraud.
The sentences imposed by Judge Grover M. Moscowitz at the conclusion of the trial on May 22, 1940, were as follows: George Dietrich,
two years and six months; George Vernard, three years; Robert
Dietrich, one year and six months; Benjamin Simon, three years;
and John Jenkins, one year and one day; all on one count of the
indictment, sentences on other counts being suspended with periods
of probation imposed to start after imprisonment.
John H. McGloon
was sentenced to one year and one day and was fined $5,000. Sentence as to Leonard Jenkins was suspended and he was placed on
immediate probation. An appeal by McGloon is now pending.
Other Accounting Cases.

During the year, the Commission's staff has completed an examination of the books arid accounts of Transamerica Corporation, referred
to in the Commission's Fifth Annual Report. Based upon data disclosed by this examination, an amended order has been issued enlarging the scope of the matters to be considered and directing that the
hearings in this case be resumed.
In its opinion in In the Matter of Missouri Pacific Railroad Oompany,
a proceeding pursuant to Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, and in its report in In the Matter of Alleghany Oorporation,
a proceeding pursuant to Section 21 (a) of the same Act, the Commission severely criticized the accounting practices followed by those
companies. In the Missouri Pacific case, the Commission held that
the registrant's financial statements for the years 1934, 1935, and
1936 did not comply with the Commission's requirements in that they
failed to disclose a liability of more than $12,000,000 arising out of
certain contracts previously entered into with Terminal Shares, Inc.
In the Alleghany Corporation case, the Commission held that the
registrant's financial statements for the years 1934 to 1937, inclusive,
were not in accordance with sound and generally accepted accounting

170

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

principles in that in prior years bond discount and expense, and
losses on sale of investments were charged directly to paid-in surplus,
thereby overstating accumulated earned surplus in the succeeding
years mentioned above, and in that no provision was made for a loss
of more than $29,000,000 arising out of an agreement with the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway Company which provided for a sale or a
contract to sell certain investments to the latter company. Amendments were filed by both of these registrants correcting the points
mentioned.
During the fiscal year, 10 stop order opinions 18 under Section 8 (d)
of the Securities Act of 1933 and 1 opinion on an application to withdraw a registration statement under stop order proceedings, were
issued by the Commission. In all of these cases the financial statements of the registrants were held to be materially false and misleading. In 5 of them the accountants' certificates were criticized and
in one instance the audit on which the accountants based their certificate was found not to measure up to the type of audit to which
stockholders are entitled. The Commission's criticisms of the certifying accountants in the above-mentioned cases were brought to the
attention of the American Institute of Accountants' Committee on
Professional Ethics and the appropriate State authorities for disciplinary action.
Simplification of Accounting Requirements.

Accounting research work completed during the past year has
resulted in the publication of seven accounting series releases. These
deal with the inclusion and exclusion in consolidation of foreign subsidiaries of domestic corporations, the adoption of Regulation S-X,
the form of accountants' certificate to be used under special circumstances, problems arising out of quasi-reorganizations, and the natural
business year.
As part of its program of seeking simplification of its accounting
requirements, previously referred to in the Commission's Third and
Fourth Annual Reports, the Commission about 3 years ago determined to delete from the various instruction books the requirements
as to the form and content of financial statements and the several
positive accounting rules that had been adopted. This determination
rested on the known facts that the language of the several forms was
not identical, due to the incorporation of improvements in the later
forms and the difficulty of an amendment policy that necessitated
change in all of the forms whenever an improvement or change in
anyone was made. In lieu of these many sets of instructions, it was
determined to have a single pamphlet containing the accounting rules
and the requirements as to the form, content, and detail of financial
18lnaddition three stop orders were issued without opinion.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

171

statements and schedules filed under the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This would be applicable to
nearly all statements filed under these two Acts, and would eliminate
the possibility of inadvertent differences and inconsistencies between
forms. Instructions as to the persons and periods for which statements must be filed will continue to be found in the several forms.
Upon adoption February 21, 1940, this pamphlet was designated
"Regulation S-X" and was made applicable to all forms for applications for registration and annual reports under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 except those for railroads and foreign issuers and to Form
A-2 under the Securities Act of 1933. It is intended that Regulation
S-X shall be extended to other forms under the Securities Act of 1933
as soon as such forms can be adapted to its use. Where special financial requirements are necessary, as in the case of outright promotional
companies, fixed investment trusts, or oil and gas interests, these will
continue to appear in the individual forms.
Regulation S-X is the result of a comprehensive study of the
experience gained under the financial requirements in use since 1935.
First, the original provisions of Form A-2 and Form 10, the improvements that had been effected in later forms, and the opinions expressed
in accounting series releases were integrated in a draft of a single set
of instructions. Registration statements, deficiency memoranda,
letters, and conference memoranda were reviewed for the purpose of
ascertaining how particular provisions had worked out in practice,
whether old provisions should be changed or deleted, or new provisions should be added. On the basis of this review, the first draft
was thoroughly revised and submitted to several hundred individuals
and professional groups outside the Commission, including among
others, registrants, public accountants, controllers, attorneys, and
State securities commissioners. The criticisms and suggestions
received were carefully analyzed and considered in preparing a further
revised draft. After consultation with public accountants and others,
additional changes were made before the regulation was promulgated
in its present form.
While Regulation S-X to some extent modified previous rules
embodying the Commission's requirements as to accountants' certificates, the new requirements do not differ materially from the old. It
is contemplated, however, that further modifications of the requirements as to accountants' certificates will be made upon completion
of further study of auditing and auditing procedures.
Accounting Series Releases.

Accounting Series Release No. 13, published during the past fiscal
year, deals with the form of the accountants' certificate in a particular
case in which the registrant had not maintained cash books, journals,

172

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

other books of original entry, or ledgers during the period covered by
the financial statements filed by it with the Commission. The
registrant's files, however, contained original underlying data such as
cancelled checks, check stubs, bank statements, purchase orders,
vendors' invoices, sales orders, and duplicate sales invoices. In order
to prepare financial statements, it was deemed necessary by the
independent accountants who certified the statements that the cash
transactions and sales be recorded in books of original entry and in
turn posted to a general ledger and that the books then be adjusted
to an accrual basis. The entry and analysis of the transactions in
formal books of account were carried out by one of the fum's junior
accountants, loaned on a per diem basis, and by an officer of the
company. The accountants maintained that this preliminary work
consisted merely of classifying and summarizing records of transactions prepared by employees of the company at the time of the
transaction. However, in many cases notations as to the purpose of
disbursements had not been made on the check stubs contemporaneously with the transaction and accordingly it was necessary to rely
in such cases upon the memory of an officer of the registrant in
classifying the recorded disbursements. Upon the completion of
this preliminary work, the certifying accountants found that satisfactory determination had not been made of the balances in certain
of the registrant's asset, liability, and income and expense accounts.
In the second or audit phase of the engagement, the accountants
therefore deemed it necessary to undertake work of a special nature
and in some instances to make original determination as to the
amounts of such accounts.
Notwithstanding these unusual circumstances, the certificate furnished by the accountants to accompany the financial statements
filed with the Commission, following a standard form, represented
that the accountants' opinion was based upon a test-check audit
and that the registrant had consistently maintained accepted principles
of accounting during the period under review. In discussing this
certificate, the Commission's accounting series release indicated that:

"* * * when a registrant during the period under review has not maintained records adequate for the purpose of preparing comprehensive and dependable financial statements, that fact should be disclosed. If, because of the absence
or gross inadequacy of accounting records maintained by a registrant, it is necessary to have essential books of account prepared retroactively and for the accountant to enlarge the scope of the audit to the extent indicated in order to be able to
express his opinion, these facts also should be disclosed, and * *
it is
misleading, notwithstanding partial disclosure by footnotes as in the instant case,
to furnish a certificate which implies that the accountant was satisfied to express
an opinion based on a test-check audit.
Moreover, it is misleading
*
to
state or imply that accepted principles of accounting have been consistently
followed by a registrant during the period under review if in fact during such
period books of account were not maintained by a registrant or were grossly

inadequate, or if it has been necessary for the accountant to make pervasive and

II

Many of the accounting problems confronting the Commission,
particularly during the past year, have arisen in connection with
what may be termed quasi- or accounting reorganizations. These
problems have been discussed by the Commission in its opinions and
by members of the staff in addresses before professional accounting
organizations. In its opinion in In the Matter oj Associated Gas and
Electric Oorporation, a proceeding upon an order to show cause why
an order should not be entered, pursuant to Section 12 (c) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to prevent the declaration or payment of further dividends on its capital stock, the
Commission discussing accounting reorganizations said:
"An accounting reorganization permits a corporation to begin anew the accumulation of earned surplus. It, therefore, enables a company to pay dividends
even though the total operations of the enterprise have resulted in an earned
surplus deficit, such dividends ostensibly being paid out of earnings rather than
contributed capital.
It can be justified only if it accomplishes with respect to
the accounts substantially what might be accomplished in a reorganization by
legal proceedings-namely,
the restatement of assets in terms of present conditions; corresponding modification of capital and capital surplus, and commencement of a new earned surplus account as of the date of the reorganization.
In
short, the enterprise must be put on substantially the same accounting basis as a
new enterprise.
And because the"primary excuse for the device is that it accomplishes expeditiously what might otherwise have to be accomplished by legal
proceedings, clear disclosure of the transactions should be made, and appropriate
consents should be secured."

In this case the Commission rejected the proposition that an
adjustment of assets is not a necessary element of an accounting
reorganization and held that if the continuity of the surplus accounts
is interrupted by an accounting reorganization, that reorganization
must be reasonably complete so as to obviate, so far as possible, the
necessity of future reorganizations of like nature.
Accounting Series Release No. 15 requires that, following a quasireorganization, until such time as the results of operations of the company on the new basis are available for an appropriate period of
years (at least three) any statement or showing of earned surplus, in
order to provide additional disclosure of the occurrence and the significance of the quasi-reorganization, should indicate the total amount
of the deficit and any charges that were made to capital surplus in the
course of the quasi-reorganization which would otherwise have been
required to be made against income or earned surplus. Formal consent of stockholders is an essential step in effecting a quasi-reorganization. When a company charges a deficit to capital surplus pursuant
to a resolution of the board of directors, but without approval of the
stockholders, such action being permissible under applicable State
law, Accounting Series Release No. 16 requires a complete disclosure

174

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of all the attendant facts and circumstances and their effect on the
company's financial position in each balance sheet and surplus
statement filed with the Commission thereafter. In situations of this
nature, it has been the administrative policy of the Commission to
require as an additional disclosure that in the registration statement
or other filing containing financial statements first reflecting such
action by the directors there be included an explanation of the action
taken and an indication of its possible effect on the character of future
dividends.
While the Commission's formal opinions, rules, regulations, and
accounting series releases have been influential in lifting the level of
accounting standards, it is believed that even greater benefits have
been derived from the Commission's day-to-day activities with respect
to accounting matters under the securities Acts. Those cases in
which accounting practices are clearly unsound are generally settled
or corrected in conference between the staff and the registrant, its
counsel, and accountants. For every formal opinion involving an
accounting point there have been a score of cases in which accounting
problems were adjusted in conference. Moreover, presentation in
such conferences of what may be termed the most preferable method
frequently leads to its adoption in lieu of a method which, while
recognized as acceptable, is generally considered not to be the most
preferable.
Cooperation with Professional

Organizations.

The development of uniform standards and practice in major
accounting questions is a common objective of the Commission and
the accounting profession. In many phases of its work the Commission's efforts have been directed toward this end. Representative
bodies of the profession also have been active in seeking the advancement of accounting. In addition to their annual meetings, various
State societies of certified public accountants held regional conferences,
and participated in accounting "institutes" or "clinics" held under
the auspices of a number of prominent universities. These conferences
and "institutes" or "clinics," as well as the annual meetings of the
American Institute of Accountants, the American Accounting Association, the Controllers Institute of America, and various other
organizations were devoted principally to the discussion of technical
accounting and auditing questions in which practitioners and teachers
of accounting and representatives of government and business
participated.
Collections of papers read at some of these meetings and
two monographs recently published by the American Accounting
Association represent an important addition to writings on accounting. In May 1939, a report entitled "Extensions of Auditing Procedure" submitted by the Special Committee on Auditing Procedure

175

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

of the American Institute of Accountants was adopted by the Council of the Institute and published. This report was modified and
adopted at the Institute's annual meeting, September 19, 1939.
The Institute's Committee on Auditing Procedure recently expressed
its intention to proceed with revision of the bulletin, "Examination
of Financial Statements by Independent Public Accountants."
In
addition to their individual efforts the Commission and the profession
in many ways have actively cooperated. The nature and extent of
such cooperation is evidenced by the "Report of the American Institute of Accountants' Special Committee on Cooperation with the
Securities and Exchange Commission" which is reproduced herein as
Appendix XI.
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS, REPORTS, OR
DOCUMENTS

In three of the Acts which the Commission administers,namely, the
Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, provisions are made
for persons to object to the public disclosure of information contained
in reports which they are required to file.19 In the Securities Act of
1933 this provision is restricted to material contracts or portions
thereof and the Commission is empowered to hold confidential any
portion of such contracts if it determines that disclosure would
impair the value of the contracts and would not be necessary for the
protection of investors. In general, the provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 are similar and empower the Commission to hold confidential
under certain conditions any information contained in any reports
required to be filed under those Acts.
The following table indicates the number of applications received
and disposed of during the past year:

At the beginning of the past fiscal year there were pending in the
several United States circuit courts of appeal or in the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia six petitions
filed by issuers seeking to review determinations by the Commission
denying applications for confidential treatment filed pursuant to
Section 24 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the
year, five of these petitions were dismissed by stipulation and the
material involved was made available for public inspection. In the
remaining case, the action of the Commission in denying confidential
treatment of information respecting the gross sales and cost of goods
sold of American Sumatra Tobacco Corporation, contained in that
company's profit and loss statements for the fiscal years ended July
31, 1935 to 1937, inclusive, was affirmed by the United States Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia in a decision handed down on
January 2, 1940.20 American Sumatra Tobacco Corporation did not
within the time allowed petition for a writ of certiorari, and the
information confidentially filed was made available for public inspection. No new petitions for judicial review of the Commission's
determinations in cases of this character were filed during -the fiscal
year. Appendix VI, Table V, page 315, contains a summary of all
petitions for judicial review of cases of this type pending in the
courts during the past fiscal year and their status as of June 30, 1940.
STUDY OF INVESTMENT TRUSTS AND INVESTMENT COMPANIES

During the past fiscal year, the Commission practically completed
transmitting to the Congress the results of its study of investment
trusts and investment companies conducted pursuant to Section 30
of the-Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.21 This study and
the preparation of the reports have been under the general supervision
of Commissioner Robert E. Healy. The current functions of the
study have been under the direct supervision of David Schenker.
The Commission completed the submission to the Congress of all
of its supplemental reports and the reports so submitted during the
past year, together with the dates of submission, consisted of the
following:
Investment Counsel, Investment Management, Investment Supervisory, and Investment Advisory Services-August 17, 1939.

With the exception of the final chapter (Chapter VII, treating with
the management of assets of investment trusts), the Commission also
completed and transmitted to the Congress all of the remaining
chapters of Part Three of its over-all report, which relates to the abuses
and deficiencies in the organization and operation of investment trusts
and investment companies. The chapters of Part Three completed
and transmitted to the Congress during the past fiscal year are Section XI of Chapter II, which sets forth in detail the history of the
Eastern Utilities Investing Corporation, submitted on August 10,
1939; Chapter III, which treats with the problems in connection with
the distribution and repurchase of shares of open-end and closed-end
management investment companies, submitted on October 12, 1939;
Chapter IV, which relates to problems in connection with shifts in
control, consolidations and mergers of management investment companies, submitted on November 20,1939; Chapter V, which deals with
problems in connection with the capital structures of investment
trusts and investment companies, submitted on January 8, 1940;
and Chapter VI, which is concerned with accounting practices and
reports to stockholders of investment companies, submitted on February 12, 1940. Chapter VI is subdivided into three sectionssection 1 treats with the accounting practices of investment companies in general and sections 2 and 3 deal with the accounting practices of the United Founders Corporation Group of companies and
contain in addition a study of the activities of these companies.
Part Four of the over-all report, the final part of the study, which
deals with the economic significance of investment companies, is
practically completed and will be submitted to the Congress during
the coming fiscal year.
The basic recommendations contained in the various parts of the
report described above were embodied in a bill (S. 3580; H. R. 8935)
which was sponsored by Senator Robert F. Wagner in the Senate and
Representative Clarence F. Lea in the House. A subcommittee of
the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency held hearings on
this bill extending over a period of approximately four weeks. At
these hearings, while the immediate need for national legislation
regulating investment companies was conceded by virtually every
witness that testified representing the investment company industry,
objections were made to some of the provisions of the bill. Many
of the representatives of the industry joined in submitting to the
subcommittee at the close of the hearings concrete proposals to
regulate investment trusts and investment companies. Almost
immediately after the conclusion of the hearings, representatives of
the investment companies and of the Securities and Exchange Com-

178

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

mission advised the chairman of the subcommittee that they believed
it might be possible for them to reach a common ground in an agreement on the scope and provisions of the bill. The chairman encouraged them in this endeavor and as a result of their cooperative
efforts a substitute bill (S. 4108) was drafted and submitted to the
Senate on June 6, 1940. On June 12, 1940, Congressman William P.
Cole introduced the substitute bill (H. R. 10065) in the House."
STUDY CONDUCTED FOR THE TEMPORARY NATIONAL ECONOMIC
COMMITTEE
Insurance.

During the past fiscal year the Commission completed the study of
life insurance which it conducted for the Temporary National Economic Committee pursuant to Public Resolution No. 113 of the 75th
Congress.
Public hearings based upon information assembled through field
investigation and questionnaire returns were held intermittently from
August 1939 until March 1940. During the months of August and
September, testimony was taken before a special subcommittee of the
Temporary National Economic Committee on the subject of industrial
insurance, a form of life insurance sold primarily to low-income families. This testimony included a historical and statistical summary
of the industrial insurance business and a review of the activities of
many principal companies operating in the field. Among other
matters considered were the cost of industrial insurance, the methods
by which it is sold, the various types of policies offered, and the resulting distribution of insurance among policyholders. To supplement
these hearings the Commission undertook, in cooperation with the
Work Projects Administration, a survey of the insurance holdings of
certain low-income families residing in the greater Boston area.
Detailed schedules were completed by WP A enumerators for over
2,000 families and in this manner information was obtained for the
first time concerning family holdings of industrial insurance, the
amount of income being spent for various types of insurance, and the
relation between types of coverage and economic status.
Public hearings were also held before the Committee with respect
to the activities of officers and directors for personal gain and reinsurance and rewriting activities of promoters. In this connection,
the history of the several companies which failed during recent years
and the various factors which led to these failures were explored in
detail. Testimony was also taken on the subject of sales and agency
practices.
In February and March of 1940 the final insurance hearings, deal" On August 22, 1940.the Investment Company Act of 1940and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
were approved by the President.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

179

ing with the operating results and investments of the 26 largest
legal reserve life insurance companies, were held. These hearings
dealt primarily with the activities of the companies during the period
from 1929 to 1938 and their experience with various lines of business
including annuities and disability insurance. Funds available for
investment and investments made were analyzed as were the assets
and liabilities of the companies. Detailed studies of various types of
investments such as policy loans, collateral loans, bonds and stocks,
farm and urban mortgages, and real estate were made and the company policies in calculating reserves and surplus were considered in
detail. Net cost studies for principal types of policies at representative ages were presented as part of this general study. To provide the
basis for these hearings on operating results and investments, comparative statistics, based upon replies to two investment questionnaires, were prepared by the Commission's staff.
During the entire period of investigation from November 14, 1938,
to February 10, 1940, the Commission's field representatives examined approximately 30 life insurance companies located in the east
and middle west sections of the country.
The staff of the Commission has completed two reports. One
entitled "Families and Their Life Insurance," to be printed as Monograph No.2 of the Temporary National Economic Committee, covers
the results of the special survey made in cooperation with the Work
Projects Administration. The other, to be printed as Monograph No.
28, is an overall report on the insurance study based upon public
hearings and information obtained through questionnaires or other
reliable sources. As of June 30, 1940, these reports had not been
released by the Temporary National Economic Committee.
Testimony on the subject of life insurance taken before the Temporary National Economic Committee has been printed and may be
purchased at nominal cost from the Superintendent of Documents,
Washington, D. C. This testimony is contained in Parts 4, 10, lQ-A,
12, 13, and 28 of the Hearings before the Temporary National Economic Committee, Congress of the United States, Seventy-sixth Congress, third session, pursuant to Public Resolution No. 113 (Seventyfifth Congress):
Investment Banking.

Certain aspects of investment banking were also presented in public
hearings before the Temporary National Economic Committee in
December 1939, and January 1940. The scope of the testimony was
restricted to the following fields of inquiry: (1) the manner in which
the investment banking processes have been adjusted to conform
with the provisions of the Banking Act of 1933; (2) the extent to
which concentration exists in the industry; and (3) the manner in

180

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

which business is negotiated between underwriters and issuers and
among underwriters.
Testimony relating to the foregoing subjects was presented by
witnesses representing the principal investment banking houses,
several corporations, and the Commission. This testimony appears
in Volumes 22, 23, and 24 of "Investigation of Concentration of
Economic Power," Hearings Before the Temporary National Economic
Committee.
A report on the problems incident to financing small business enterprises prepared at the direction of the Committee was submitted by
the Commission on June 10, 1940. The report embodies a survey of
the following regions which represent a wide variety of economic
conditions: Fall River, Massachusetts; Scranton-Wilkes Barre, Pennsylvania; Detroit, Michigan; Omaha, Nebraska; Birmingham, Alabama; Dallas-Houston, Texas; Denver, Colorado; Seattle, Washington;
and Portland, Oregon. In addition to these field studies, the report
includes a statistical analysis of the available data on the problems of
the smaller business enterprises. This report is contained in Monograph No. 17, "Some Problems of Small Business," published by the
Temporary National Economic Committee.
REPORTS OF OFFICERS, DIRECTORS, AND PRINCIPAL STOCKHOLDERS
General Purpose and Scope of Reporting Requirements.

In order to make available information as to the amount of securities
owned by persons closely identified with the management or control
of enterprises, and changes occurring in their holdings, every person
who is an officer, director, or principal stockholder (i. e., a person who
beneficially owns, directly or indirectly, more than 10 percent of any
class of registered equity security) of an issuer having any class of
equity security listed and registered on any national securities exchange
is required, under Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, to file with the Commission and the exchange an initial report
showing the amount of every class of equity security of the issuer
which he owns beneficially, directly or indirectly, and a report for each
month thereafter in which any purchase, sale, or other change in such
ownership occurs. Under the corresponding provisions of Section
17 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, every
officer or director of a registered holding company must file with the
Commission reports disclosing his direct and indirect beneficial
ownership of all securities of the registered holding company and its
subsidiary companies, as well as all changes occurring therein.
Volume of Reports.

The following tabulation discloses the number of reports filed in
accordance with these requirements and examined by the Commission

Of the 16,305 original reports filed last year under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934,14,215 were monthly reports on Form:4 reflecting purchases and sales and other current changes occurring in the
amount of equity securities beneficially owned; 392 were initial reports
of such stockholdings required to be filed on Form 5, where the issuer
for the first time secured registration of any equity security on a
national securities exchange; and 1,698 were initial reports of such
holdings required to be filed on Form 6 by each additional person
who became an officer, director, or principal stockholder.
In connection with the initial reports filed on Forms 5 and 6, it
might be pointed out that a majority of the 2,090 persons who thus
commenced reporting during the past year did so without the necessity for any action by the Commission. However, it was necessary
to call the reporting requirements to the attention of 716 of these
persons, before obtaining their necessary reports. Information as to
the identity of persons who fail to comply with the requirements of
the statute in filing reports is obtained by the Commission from a
wide variety of sources; such as, for example, applications for registration of securities, annual reports, current reports, and proxy statements filed by issuers pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934;
registration statements filed by issuers under the Securities Act of
1933 j notifications of registration and annual supplements filed by
registered holding companies under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935; letters received from issuers; and the current
releases of certain commercial daily, weekly, and quarterly financial
news services.
At the close of the past fiscal year, the security ownership reporting
requirements of Section 16 (a) had been operative for more than
5 years, and those of Section 17 (a) for more than 4 years, during
which time an aggregate of nearly 150,000 original and amended
reports were filed by more than 29,000 persons. Notwithstanding
the large number of reports and persons involved, there has been
practically no necessity for any formal action by the Commission in
order to secure the filing of these reports.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Examination Procedure.

Where an original report discloses upon examination any material
incompleteness, inconsistency, or inaccuracy, a letter is sent to the
person reporting, calling attention to the deficiency and an amended
report is obtained. The amended report is subjected in turn to the
same examination procedure as the original report. There are, of
course, a number of cases in which it appears that the deficiency in
the report is essentially immaterial and that the purposes of the
statute would not be served by insisting upon the filing of an amended
report. It is the practice in these cases merely to inform the reporting officer, director, or principal stockholder of the nature of the
deficiency in the currently :filedreport and request his cooperation in
the proper preparation of any additional report which may be required
of him in the future. In addition to the large number of letters calling attention to deficiencies appearing in reports, numerous letters
were written to officers, directors, and principal stockholders, and
conferences were held with them and their representatives, in order
to assist them in complying with the reporting requirements of the
statute.
Publication of Security Ownership Reports.

Reports made by officers, directors, and principal stockholders on
Forms 4,5, and 6, and by officers and directors on Forms U-17-1 and
U-17-2, are available for public inspection at the offices of the Commission in Washington, D. C., and reports on Forms 4, 5, and 6 may
also be inspected at the particular exchange with which an additional
copy of each report relating to the issuer concerned must be :filed. In
order to make the information contained in these reports more readily
available to the public, the Commission compiles and publishes such
information in a semimonthly Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings which is widely distributed among individual
investors, newspaper correspondents, and other interested persons.
Copies of these summaries are also available at each regional office of
the Commission and each national securities exchange.
REGIONAL

OFFICES

Approximately one-third of the Commission's entire personnel is
stationed in its 14 regional and subregional offices. The regional offices of the Commission are located at Boston, N ew York
City, Atlanta, Cleveland, Chicago, Fort Worth, Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle. The Cleveland office has a permanent sub office in
Detroit; Chicago has permanent sub offices in Minneapolis and St.
Louis; San Francisco has a permanent suboffice in Los Angeles;
and the Oil and Gas Unit of the Registration Division has a permanent suboffice in Tulsa. These officeshave since their inception been
the first line of enforcement of the various laws administered by the
Commission. Nearly all the investigations of stock frauds and viola-

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

183

tions of the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to
brokers, dealers, and market manipulations have been conducted in
the first instance from the field offices of the Commission. In 1939
the activities of these offices were enlarged so that first-line analysis
and legal work in connection with the Commission's functions under
Chapter X of the newly revised Bankruptcy Act could be carried on
from the field.
The past fiscal year saw the initiation of an experiment to broaden
further the role of the regional offices in the administration of the
Commission's functions. On June 12, 1940, the Commission announced the establishment in the San Francisco Regional Office of an
experimental unit to assist prospective issuers of securities and to
advise them and their representatives on any problems arising in
connection with their registration statements under the Securities
Act of 1933.
Both an attorney and a financial examiner with long experience in
the Registration Division of the Commission were assigned to the
San Francisco office. These experts were instructed to confer with
and assist prospective registrants in the preparation of registration
statements before formal filing. After the statement had been filed
in Washington, they were instructed and equipped to answer any
questions which might arise in connection with the progress of the
registration. A registrant could, if he wished, leave a copy of his
statement in the San Francisco office for conference purposes. The
Registration Division in Washington was instructed to forward to the
San Francisco office a copy of all correspondence with the registrant,
together with a copy of any staff memoranda on the statement, and
the registrant was told by Washington that the San Francisco office
would be equipped to answer any questions which this correspondence
might create.
It was announced by the Commission that if this experiment
appeared to be successful after a reasonable period of time, the same
facilities for assistance to registrants would be extended to the other
regional offices."
II On No.ember 1.19-W.
the Commission voted that in view of the success of this experiment in San Francisco.
similar facilities will be provided in the other regional offices by Febrnary 1. 1941. It fnrther voted that.
for the first time, it will undertake an experiment in complete registration in the field offices. It will set up
complete registration units in the San Francisco and Cleveland Regional Offices. Thls means that regis.
trants having either their principal places of business or that of their principal underwriters in either of these
regions will be able to file tbeir registration statements in the field office and have them examined there.
Only in exceptional cases will it be necessary for the registrant to have direct contact with Washington,
although, of course, the Registration Division and the Commission will closely scrutinize all the actions of the
regional office and the regional office will have to obtain the usual formal Commission action for the
acceleration of the effective date. The registrant will be given the option ofavalllng hlmselfoftheseexperi.
mental facllitles in the two regional offices or of continuing to have hls registration statement handled in
Washington. In this event. faci1ltles for pre-registration assistance and eonsnltatlon on questions raJaed
by Washington during the examination of the statement will be available in these two offices as well as in
the other regional offices. Thls complete registration experiment will continue unW October I, 1941.at
which time:it will be reviewed to determine whether or not It should be expanded to the other office! or
abandoned.

184

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

This development of the facilities of the regional offices was an
outgrowth of the desire of the Commission to recognize the problems
of distance which faced many of those having Commission problems.
Originally set up largely as policing units, the regional offices have
been increasingly called upon to aid members of the public in questions
of interpretation of the various statutes and the rules and regulations
under the statutes.
To meet this demand, the Commission has stationed specially trained attorneys in each regional office and in some
of the suboffices, who are qualified to answer these questions from
persons who would otherwise have to go or write to Washington.
During the past year, the regional offices handled 16,799 of such
inquiries, making either verbal or written answers. Needless to say,
there is a close coordination between the regional offices and the
Washington Office in such matters in order to assure that confusing
and injurious differences of opinion will not develop. .All written
opinions and interpretations issuing from the regional offices are sent
to the office of the General Counsel in Washington for review and all
new questions, where there is any uncertainty in the regional office,
are raised with Washington before an answer is given.
The enforcement activities of the regional offices continued to be
increasingly productive during the past year. Again, it should be
borne in mind that the activities of these offices are at all times closely
supervised by the appropriate authorities on the Washington staff.
These offices conducted 996 formal and informal investigations into
violations of the Securities Act of 1933 during the year. Many of
these were found to be outright frauds and resulted in criminal proceedings being instituted by the Department of Justice on the basis
of the evidence unearthed in the investigation. .All these matters
were reviewed by the Washington staff and approved by the Commission before any formal action was taken. Many of the cases were
referred to the regional offices by the Washington staff, but a very
large percentage of the total were first initiated in the regional office
as a direct result of its closeness to developments in the particular
area under its surveillance.
Another important activity carried on through the medium of the
regional office is the investigation of the activities of brokers and
dealers and the inspection of their accounts as required under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The latter activity is particularly
important inasmuch as it provides a check upon the solvency of the
broker or dealer and a protection against the diversion or misappropriation of the cash and securities of customers. To make these
checks, the Trading and Exchange Division has assigned crews of
inspectors to most of the regional offices. These inspectors make
unannounced visits of inspection at the offices of the various dealers
and brokers in the several regions. Very often the inspectors find that

SIXTH

ANNUAL

185

REPORT

they can be of real service to the brokers and dealers in advising them,
where no irregularity is found, in setting up their books and records in
such a way as to run their businesses in a manner to comply with law
and regulations. During the past year the regional offices made 560
such investigations.
In connection with the enforcement of the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, furthermore, the
regional offices have, during the past year, made 193 investigations
or flying- quizzes into situations where it appeared that there may
have been a manipulation of the price or volume of a particular
security.
As has already been stated, the activities of the Commission under
Chapter X of the new Bankruptcy Act were largely regionalized
almost from the outset. A substantial portion of the reorganization staff of the Commission is assigned to the various regional offices.
From these offices analysts, accountants, and attorneys execute the
Commission's role in these proceedings, including the drafting of
reports on plans of reorganization and making the necessary court
appearances. Here again, of course, the work of the men in the field
is closely reviewed by the Reorganization Division in Washington and
by the Commission itself. During the past fiscal year, the regional
offices of the Commission have worked on 758 reorganization matters,
including both those in which the Commission ultimately became a
party and those in which, while carefully studied, formal Commission
participation was not found necessary under the statute.

FORMAL OPINIONS AND REPORTS

The Commission, during the past year, issued 292 formal opinions
involving matters under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. In addition, the Commission adopted 5 formal reports on plans of reorganization under the

186

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

provisions of Section 11 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 and 12 advisory reports on plans of reorganization under the
provisions of Chapter X of the amended Bankruptcy Act. The Commission also published a report of an investigation under Section 21 (a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Appendix VIII, page 332,
contains a list 24 of these cases.
PUBLIC INSPECTION OF REGISTERED INFORMATION.

Under the provisions of the several Acts administered by the Commission, certain information filed with the Commission is made available to the public under such regulations and reasonable limitations
and at such reasonable charge as the Commission may prescribe.
Accordingly, there are available for inspection in the Public Reference
Room of the Commission at Washington, D. C., copies of all public
information contained in registration statements, applications, reports,
declarations, and other public documents on file with the Commission.
In addition to the thousands of letters and telephone calls received
during the past fiscal year from members of the public requesting

registered; and
4. Within the period of 10 years preceding the date of the filing of
the registration statement, the corporation shall not have failed
to levy and collect assessments in amounts sufficient to meet all current charges.
SPECIAL RULES AS TO THE USE OF FORM A-2 FOR CORPORATIONS

1. Notwithstanding that Form E-1 is specifically prescribed for
use in cases involving an exchange of securities by the issuer thereof
for others of its securities or a modification of the terms of securities
by agreement between the issuer and its security holders, a registrant
otherwise entitled to use Form A-2 may, at its option, use Form
A-2 in any such case if the registrant is not in reorganization pursuant to Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act or in bankruptcy or

212

receivership and if no default exists on any outstanding funded
debt (other than a default in sinking fund payments which has been
waived by the holders of at least 80 percent in principal amount of
the issue outstanding). If Form A-2 is used pursuant to this Rule,
the fee payable for registration shall be calculated in accordance
with Instruction 7 in Form E-l, and the table setting forth the
calculation shall be prepared as prescribed in such Form
2. Form A-2 may be used by a registrant if all the following conditions exist:
(a) The registrant was organized as the successor to a single predecessor, or to a group of predecessors one of which, at the time of
succession, directly or indirectly owned substantially all of the
outstanding stock of all the other predecessors;
(b) The registrant acquired all of the assets and assumed all of
the liabilities of such predecessor or predecessors, and the capital
structure of the registrant immediately following the succession was
substantially the same as the capital structure of the single predecessor, or as the consolidated capital structure of the group of predecessors, except for such changes as may have resulted from the
substitution of issuers incident to the succession or from changes in
capital stock liability per share; and
(c) The single predecessor, or the parent company in a group of
predecessors, could have used Form A-2 if the succession had not
taken place.
In determining whether such single predecessor or such parent
company in a group of predecessors could have used Form A-2, the
record of the registrant in regard to income or annual reporting to
security holders shall be considered a continuation of the record of
such single predecessor or such parent company. In the case of a
group of predecessor companies, the income of the parent company
of the group shall be determined on the basis of consolidated reports
for such parent company and its subsidiaries, the subsidiaries to be
included in the consolidated reports whether or not "they were combined with the parent company to form the registrant.
3. Notwithstanding the provisions of the last sentence of the rule
for the use of Form A-2 for Corporations, that form .may be used
by a corporation otherwise entitled to use the form, if the property
acquired from promoters under the circumstances stated in such last
sentence consisted principally of one or more going businesses, or of
securities representing directly or indirectly more than 50 percent of
the voting power controlling such businesses.
4. Notwithstanding the rules as to the use of Form E-l, or the
rule as to the use of Form A-2 for Corporations, Form A-2 may
be used in the situation described below for registration statements,
except those for which a special form (other than Form E-l) is
specifically prescribed, by corporations which file profit and loss
statements of their own or of their predecessors for 3 years and which,
or the predecessors of which, have in the past 15 years paid dividends
upon any class of common stock for at least 2 consecutive years.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

213

The situation in which Form A-2 may thus be used is that of registration of securities issued or sold in the course of a "reorganization",
as defined in Rule 5 (1) as to the use of Form E-1, where the only
operation which brings the transaction within the definition is the
acquisition of assets of a subsidiary by the registrant in consideration
of securities of the registrant, or the exchange of securities of the
registrant for outstanding securities of a subsidiary.s
5. Any corporation which was formed by the consolidation of two
or more corporations may use Form A-2, if each of the constituent
corporations which collectively brought in a majority of the assets,
as shown by the books of the constituent corporations prior to the
consolidation, could have used Form A-2 if the consolidation had
not taken place. In determining whether any such constituent corporation could have used Form A-2, the record of the registrant in
regard to income or annual reporting to security holders shall be
considered a continuation of such constituent corporation's record.
In this rule, all the corporations consolidated to form the registrant
are called the "constituent corporations."
6. Form A-2 may be used by a registrant if all the following
conditions exist:
(a) The registrant was a wholly owned subsidiary of a corporation
which, either alone or with one or more of its other wholly owned
subsidiaries, was merged into the registrant;
(b) The registrant acquired all the assets and assumed all the
liabilities of the corporations merged into it; and
(c) The parent corporation could have used Form A-2 had the
merger not taken place. In determining whether such parent corporation could have used Form A-2, the record of the registrant
subsequent to the merger, in regard to income or annual reporting
to security holders, shall be considered a continuation of the record
of such parent corporation.
7. Notwithstanding the provisions of clause (b) of the rule as to
the use of Form A-2 for Corporations, this form may be used by a
corporation which has had a net income for only 1 fiscal year of the
5 fiscal years preceding the date of the latest balance sheet filed
with the registration statement, if(1) The corporation was organized at least 5 years prior to the
date of filing;
(2) Total assets of the registrant and its subsidiaries after deducting valuation and qualifying reserves, amount to not more than
$5,000,000, as shown by the most recent balance sheets filed with the
registration statement; and
(3) The registrant is not an investment company, a bank holding
company, or a small-loan or other finance company.

APPENDIX IX
STATISTICAL
ANALYSIS OF REORGANIZATION
PROCEEDINGS
INSTITUTED UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED,
DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1940

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1940, 291 companies entered
into reorganization proceedings under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy
Act, as amended. These companies showed aggregate assets of approximately $985,000,000 (book value) and a corresponding indebtedness of $528,000,000.1 A considerable part of the totals for assets and
indebtedness was accounted for by the Associated Gas and Electric
Company and its subsidiary, Associated Gas and Electric Corporation,
which in January 1940 filed debtors' petitions for reorganization under
Chapter X. The two companies had combined assets somewhat in
excess of $800,000,000, and a combined indebtedness of slightly over
$400,000,000. In the tables which follow, percentages are given for
distributions with the two companies excluded, as well as for distributions including them.
Industrial

Classification.

Manufacturing, real estate, and merchandising companies were
the most numerous, accounting for 109, 56, and 41, respectively. The
inclusion of Associated Gas and Electric Company and its subsidiary
in the electric light, power, and gas group gave this category the lead
in assets and indebtedness. However, with the exclusion of these two
companies, manufacturing companies led with $61,800,000, or 34 percent of the aggregate assets, and with $39,400,000, or 32 percent of
the combined indebtedness of all companies, while real estate companies 2 showed corresponding figures of $36,200,000, or 20 percent
and $27,800,000, or 22 percent.
Geographical

Distribution.

The aforementioned two utility companies had both their principal
place of business and their principal assets in New York. 3 In addition,
the assets of the other 37 companies with their principal assets in New
I The figures for assets and indebtedness in almost all eases were taken from balance sheets, schedules.
and allegations fonnd in the petitions and other documents filed in reorganization proceedings. Estimates
were made of the assets of 17companies and the indebtedness of 5 companies, figures for which were not avail.
able from these sources.
, In this classification, real estate companies include, among others. companies owning apartment houses,
hotel buildings, and office buildings.
, Section 128under Chapter X permits a petition to be filed in the Federal district court in whose terri.
torIal jurisdiction the company has either its principal place of business or Its principal assets.

347

348

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

York amounted to approximately $59,000,000, while the other 39
companies with their principal place of business in N ew York showed
aggregate assets of a like amount and indebtedness of $38,000,000.
Each of these figures is appreciably larger than the corresponding one
for any other State.
The Federal District Court for the Northern District of illinois and
the Federal District Court for the Southern District of New York
took jurisdiction over 24 cases each. The 22 petitions :filed in the
Southern District of N ew York, other than those of the two utility
companies previously noted, involved combined assets of approximately
$51,000,000 and indebtedness of $33,000,000, well above the assets
and indebtedness shown for any other district. Other districts with
a substantial number of cases were the District of Massachusetts with
17, the District of New Jersey with 15, and the Southern District of
California with 14.
Amonnt of Indebtedness.

Of the total of 289 cases remaining after the exclusion of the 2 utility
companies, 229 of the companies had indebtedness of less than $250,000,4but accounted for only 17 percent of the indebtedness of all the
companies. Another 29 percent of the indebtedness was accounted
for by the 50 companies with indebtedness of at least $250,000 but
less than $3,000,000. The remaining 10 companies had an indebtedness of at least $3,000,000 each," Their aggregate indebtedness
accounted for 54 percent of the total.
Type of Petition.

Proceedings for the reorganization of 258 of the total of 291 companies were instituted by the petition of the debtor corporation.
These companies showed aggregate assets of $949,000,000 and indebtedness of $504,000,000. An additional 27 companies, whose combined assets and indebtedness amounted to $30,000,000 and $20,000,000, respectively, were brought into reorganization proceedings
by means of creditors' petitions. Petitions :filedby indenture trustees
commenced reorganization proceedings for the remaining six companies, whose assets totaled $5,000,000 and indebtedness $4,000,000.
• Section 156under Chapter X provides that in all cases involving indehtedness of $250,000or over, dis.
Interested trustees shall he appointed to perform certain functions set out In the statute. In cases Involving
indebtedness of less than $250,000,the court may continne the debtor company in possession or appoint
trnstees .
• Section 172under Chapter X provides that in all cases Involving indebtedness of more than $3,000,000,
the proposed plans of reorganization deemed worthy of consideration by the judge shall be submitted to the
Commission for advisory reports, whereas in the remaining cases, proposed plans of reorganization may be,
but are not required to be, submitted to the Commission for such reports.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

355

The public utility companies in the Company's holding company
system operate in the states of Kansas, Missouri, Arkansas, Texas,
New Mexico, South Dakota, Nebraska, Louisiana and Arizona.
On December 1, 1935,the Company registered with the Commission
under Section 5 of the Act, 15 U. S. C. A. Sec. 7ge, and thereby
became a "registered holding company" as that term is used in Section
11 (e) thereof.
On or about January 13, 1938, the Company filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission an application under the Act for a report
on a Plan of Recapitalization to modify its capital structure, adjust
arrearages in preferred stock dividends, and reduce preferred dividend
requirements. Hearings were had on said Plan before an officer of
the Securities and Exchange Commission on February 23 and 24,
1938. Subsequent to said hearings, but prior to any determination
by the Securities and Exchange Commission with respect to said
Plan of Recapitalization, the Company filed certain amendments
thereto and hearings were again held on said Plan, as so amended, on
March 13,14,15 and 16, 1939. Subsequent to said hearings but prior
to any determination by the Securities and Exchange Commission
with respect to said Plan as so amended, the Company filed an application pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Act asking the Commission
to approve a Plan of Corporate Simplification (hereinafter called the
"Plan") as fair and equitable and necessary to effectuate the provisions of Section 11 (b) of the Act.
The Commission on August 7, 1939, issued a Notice of and Order
for Hearing with regard to such Plan, which notice was published in
the Federal Register on August 9, 1939, and the Company sent by
mail, to each of its security holders a copy of a notice, which set forth
details of the Plan and the date and place of the hearing to be held
with regard to such Plan.
On September 6, 1939, a hearing on the Plan was held pursuant to
such notice before a duly appointed officer of the Commission. At
such hearing the Company appeared and presented evidence in support
of the fairness of the Plan. No security holder or other person appeared at such hearing in opposition to the Plan.
On November 18, 1939, the Commission approved the Plan and
entered its Findings and Opinion and Order. At the same time, the
Commission issued its report on the Plan as requested by the Company. This report was sent to the Preferred and Common stockholders in connection with the solicitation of assents to the Plan.
Thereafter, the Company gave notice to and solicited proxies of the
Common and Preferred stockholders for a stockholders' meeting
which was held in Wilmington, Delaware, on January 12, 1940. At
this meeting the Plan was approved by more than two-thirds of the
Preferred stockholders and by more than a majority of the Common

356

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

stockholders. Certain of the minority stockholders, both Preferred
and Common, objected to the Plan and voted against its approval.
On or about March 18, 1940, the Commission, at the request of the
Company, made an application to this Court, pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 (e) of the Act, to enforce and carry out the terms
and provisions of the Plan.
On March 18, 1940, this Court made its order which brought on the
hearing of this application on April 25, 1940. Notice of this proceeding, in the manner directed in said order, was given to those security
holders of the Company whom the Plan affects. H. Vincent Smart,
Esq., representing 112 shares of Common stock of the Company,
appeared on the return day and an adjournment was taken to May
11, 1940, to enable him to file a memorandum regarding the constitutionality of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and to cross
examine such officers of the Company as he might give notice to the
Company, on or before May 5, 1940, to produce on the adjourned
date. Mr. Smart notified the Court on May 1, 1940, that his client
desired him to withdraw from the proceeding, but he submitted,
nevertheless, a memorandum upon the law, together with a communication prepared by a person connected with his client, containing his
comments upon the alleged unfairness of the Plan and the enforcement
thereof.
There was also informally presented to the Court, prior to May 1,
1940, a request from the Attorney General of the State of Delaware
for an adjournment to enable him to determine whether he would
seek permission to intervene. Before said adjourned date the Court
was advised informally that he did not intend to do so. A letter was
also presented, at the adjourned hearing on May 11, 1940, from
Howard Duane, Esq., of Wilmington, Delaware, advising that he
had been retained by a holder, since 1930, of 340 shares of First
Preferred Stock, $6 Dividend Series of the Company, and that an
action had been brought by him, subsequent to the institution of
this proceeding, in a Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware in
and for Newcastle County upon a bill for an injunction, which apparently is still pending, a motion to restrain and for a temporary
injunction pendente lite, however, having heretofore been denied.
While, as has been stated, no one appeared in opposition to this
application, the Court cannot, and will not, ignore its responsibil,ity
to pass upon the objections which have been suggested by counsel
who appeared and then withdrew from this proceeding.
Section 11 (b) of the Act, so far as pertinent, provides:
It shall be the duty of the Commission, as soon as practicable after January
1,1938:

*

*

*

*

*

*

*

(2) To require by order, after notice and opportunity for hearing, that each

steps as the Commission shall find necessary to ensure that the corporate structure
or continued existence of any company in the holding-company system does not
unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure, or unfairly or inequitably
distribute voting power among security holders, of such holding-company
system.
***

Section 11 (e) of the Act, provides in part:
If, after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission shall find such
plan, as submitted or as modified, necessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection (b) and fair and equitable to the persons affected by such plan, the
Commission shall make an order approving such plan; and the Commission, at
the request of the company, may apply to a court, in accordance with the provisions of subsection (f) of section 18 [79r of this chapter], to enforce and carry out
the terms and provisions of such plan.

Section 24 of the Act, Title 15 U. S. C. A. Sec. 79x, provides that
any person or party aggrieved by an order issued by the Commission
may obtain a review upon petition to the Court of Appeals of the
United States within any circuit wherein such person resides or has
his principal place of business, or in the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia. Such appeal must be taken
within 60 days after the entry of such order. No such appeal has
been taken and the time so to do has long since expired.
Subsection (f) of Section 18, Title 15 U. S. C. A. Sec. 79r (f),
reads as follows:
Whenever it shall appear to the Commission that any person is engaged or
about to engage in any acts or practices, which constitute or will constitute a
violation of the provisions of this title [chapter], or of any rule, regulation, or order
thereunder, it may in its discretion bring an action in the proper district court of
the United States, the Supreme Court of the District of Columbia, or the United
States courts of any Territory or other place subject to the jurisdiction of the
United States, to enjoin such acts or practices and to enforce compliance with
this title [chapter] or any rule, regulation, or order thereunder, and upon a
proper showing a permanent or temporary injunction or decree or restaining order
shall be granted without bond. The Commission may transmit such evidence
as may be available concerning such acts or practices to the Attorney General,
who, in his discretion, may institute the appropriate criminal proceedings under
this title [chapter].

The authority of the Court under this section to approve the Plan
in accordance with subsection (f) is challenged but it would certainly
defeat the intent of the Congress and the purpose of the Act if the
Court lacks such power in view of the express language of Section 11
(e) which reads:
If, upon any such application, the court, after notice and opportunity for hearing, shall approve such plan as fair and equitable and as appropriate to effectuate
the provisions of Section 11 [this section] the court as a court of equity may, to
such extent as it deems necessary for the purpose of carrying out the terms and
provisions of such plan, take exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the company
or companies and the assets thereof, wherever located; and the court shall have
jurisdiction to appoint a trustee, and the court may constitute and appoint the
Commission as sole trustee, to hold or administer, under the direction of the court

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and in accordance with the plan theretofore
Commission, the assets so possessed.

approved by the court and the

The officers of the Company, because of the pending suit in the
Chancery Court of Delaware, might refrain from carrying out the
Plan without such a protective order as here applied for and of course
the purpose of the Plan approved by the Commission would thereby
be defeated and the assets of the Company possibly depreciated, if
not, wasted.
But Section 25 of the Act, Title 15 U. S. C. A. Sec. 79y, providing for
jurisdiction of offenses and suits, provides in part:
Any suit or action to enforce any liability or duty created by, or to enjoin any
violation of, this title [chapter] or rules, regulations, or orders thereunder, may
be brought in any such district or in the district wherein the defendant is an
inhabitant or transacts business * * *. Judgments and decrees so rendered
shall be subject to review as provided in sections 128 and 240 of the Judicial
Code, as amended, CU. S. C. A. Title 28, Sections 225 and 347].

By the term of the Plan itself its effectiveness is dependent upon
approval by a Federal Court as well as the Commission.
Consequently I hold that this Court has jurisdiction of the Company and the subject matter.
I am further persuaded to this determination by an examination
of the Report of the Senate Committee on Interstate Commerce, No.
621, 74th Congress, First Session.
THE PLAN

The Plan contemplates the exchange of all of the Preferred and
Common Stock of the Company now outstanding for New Common
Stock. Each share of present Preferred Stock, together with all
accumulated unpaid dividends, will receive five shares of New Common Stock. Each share of present Common Stock will receive one
and four-fifths shares of New Common Stock. The new shares of
Common Stock are to have a par value of $10 each and will be entitled
to one vote per share.
Upon carrying out the proposed Plan, the resulting distribution of
New Common Stock will be as follows:

The Plan also provides that the "Assignments and Agreements"
now outstanding in the face amount of $370,523.84, may be redeemed
by the Company at any time upon thirty days notice and upon payment at the rate of $100 for each $95 face amount outstanding.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

359

In connection with the consummation of the Plan, the Company
proposes to make various accounting entries which will have the effect
of adjusting or eliminating certain accounts in the Company's balance
sheet. These accounting entries are in accordance with the Securities and Exchange Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for
Public Utility Holding Companies; certain of the entries are required
by the Uniform System, and the others are within the Company's
discretion.
The Plan, by its terms, is to become effective if it secures not only
the approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission, but also
that of the holders of two-thirds of the Preferred and a majority of
the Common Stock, and of a Federal Court upon application by the
Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the
Act.
The contemplated procedure is as follows: If the approval of the
Securities and Exchange Commission is secured, the Plan will be
submitted for the consideration of the stockholders. If approval is
given by the specified majorities, the Commission is requested to
apply to a Federal Court to enforce and carry out the terms and provisions of the Plan. If the Plan is then approved by the Court, it is
to be consummated either (a) by amending the charter of the existing
corporation, or (b) by organization of a new corporation which will
take over all of the assets and assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the existing corporation.
In the event that the existing corporation is to be used in the consummation of the proposed Plan, the present certificate of incorporation will be so amended as to eliminate all provisions relating to the
presently authorized and outstanding First Preferred and Common
Stock and so as to authorize the issuance of 500,000 shares of New
Common Stock, each share having one vote and having a par value
of $10.
In the event that the proposed Plan is consummated by the formation of a new corporation, such new corporation will be organized
under the laws of Delaware or such other state as may be determined
by the board of directors. It will have powers and purposes substantially similar to those possessed by the present corporation. The
new corporation will have an authorized capital consisting of 500,000
shares of Common Stock, each share having one vote and having a
par value of $10. Following the formation of such new corporation,
all of the property now owned by Community Power and Light Company will be sold, transferred and assigned to the new corporation,
which will at the same time assume all of the liabilities and obligations of the present company in return for such an amount of common
stock of the new company as will be necessary to consummate the

1!

proposed Plan. This Common stock will then be distributed
accordance with the provisions of the Plan.
QUESTIONS

PRESENTED

By

THE

III

PLAN

In order to approve the Plan the Act requires the Commission to
find that the Plan is necessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection (b) of Section 11, which in turn requires it to find that the
present corporate structure of the Company is such that the Commission must take steps to insure that the Company's corporate
structure will not unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure
of the holding-company system and to insure that the voting power
is not unfairly or inequitably distributed among security holders, and
that the Plan is fair and equitable to the persons affected by it.
All of the proceedings before the Commission were introduced upon
the hearing before, and received in evidence by me.
In the Findings and Opinion of the Commission it found:
1. That the corporate structure of the Company was unduly and
unnecessarily complicated and that the complications in the corporate structure of the Company rendered the corporate structure
of the holding company system, of which the Company is a part,
unduly and unnecessarily complicated, contrary to the standards of
Section 11 (b) of the Act;
2. That the voting power was unfairly and inequitably distributed;
3. That the Plan was necessary to effectuate the provisions of
subsection (b) (2) of Section 11 of the Act;
4. That the modification in the terms of the Assignments and
Agreements was necessary to eliminate complications in the Company's corporate structure;
5. That the Plan was fair and equitable to both classes of stockholders;
6. That the modification in the terms of the Assignments and
Agreements was fair to the holders thereof, and
7. That there was nothing in the proposed accounting transactions
tending to make the Plan unfair or not in compliance with the Act.
PRESENT

FINANCIAL

CONDITION

OF THE COMPANY

Since 1931, the Company and its subsidiaries, including General
Public Utilities, Inc., have been short of working capital. Such cash
as the system had was used to pay principal and interest on certain
bank loans, interest on the Assignments and Agreements, and for
construction purposes and hence could not be used for dividends on
the Preferred Stock. As the dividends on the Preferred Stock
accumulated it became more difficult for the Company or its sub-

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

361

sidiaries to sell securities to obtain the much needed additional
capital.
From 1927 to 1931, the Company paid regular dividends on its
Preferred and Common Stocks.
In every year from 1927 to 1930, the dividends paid exceeded the
amounts earned.
In the period from 1932 to 1938, inclusive, the total net cash in
the system, not including General Public Utilities, Inc., amounted
to approximately $5,054,608, and in the same period the following
disbursements were made: (1) Payments of principal on bank debt,
$1,775,000; (2) interest on bank debt, $337,782; (3) interest on
Assignments and Agreements, $294,704; (4) Construction, $2,928,341;
or a total of $5,335,627, leaving a cash deficit for the period of $281,219.
The bank loan, which cost the Company more than $2,100,000 from
1931 to 1938 in principal and interest, was originally incurred by the
Company at the instance of its then parent company, American
Community Power Company (hereinafter called "American").
On September 8, 1931, the American, which then controlled the
Company, caused it to issue a six percent Demand Note in the amount
of $1,500,000 in consideration of the payment of $500,000 in cash by
American to the Company and the assignment to the Company of a
note in the face amount of $1,000,000, payable to American by
General Public Utilities, Inc.'s predecessor.
As of the same date, American borrowed $1,500,000 from The
Chase National Bank of The City of New York (hereinafter called
"Chase") and executed and delivered a six percent collateral note for
six months in that amount. As security, American turned over to
Chase, the Company's note to it for $1,500,000 and, as additional
collateral, American Commonwealths Power Corporation (Del.), the
parent of American (hereinafter called "Commonwealths"), deposited
50,000 shares of the common stock of American, which was all
of that Company's outstanding stock.
As a part of the transaction, it was agreed by American that its
note to Chase would mature upon (1) the nonpayment of an
$1,800,000 issue of notes of American, which were due November 1,
1931, or (2) upon the nonpayment of the $4,000,000 issue of Secured
Notes of General Public Utilities, Inc.'s predecessor, due December
1, 1931.
Neither of these obligations was paid at maturity.
To obtain a waiver from Chase of default on American's note it
caused the Company to pledge additional collateral as security for
its note. The additional collateral so pledged was all of the common

362

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

stock of the predecessor of Texas-New Mexico Utilities Company and
$1,800,000 of notes of General Public Utilities, Inc.'s predecessor.
Receivers were appointed for American by the Chancery Court of
Delaware on Dec. 31, 1931, and on Feb. 15, 1932, the Company
executed a Collateral Agreement with Chase under the terms of which
the note of the Company was extended to May 1, 1932, and the
Company recognized Chase as the holder of its note in due course
and agreed to pay interest and principal of such note when due.
The note to Chase was finally liquidated, after periodic extensions,
on March 27, 1936, as a result of funds borrowed from the Empire
Trust Company and from the Continental Bank & Trust Company,
both of New York City. The principal of the notes to these two
banks was reduced until as of June 30, 1939 only $150,000 was due
to the Continental Bank & Trust Company. This has now been
paid from the proceeds of a loan secured from the Reconstruction
Finance Corporation.
Because of the conduct of its former parent companies, the Company was also required to issue certain Assignments and Agreements"
although it received no cash return therefrom.
During 1931, Commonwealths caused employees and officers of the
operating subsidiaries of the Company to sell shares of its $6.24
Preferred Stock and shares of the Prior Preferred Stock of American
Commonwealths Power Corporation, New Jersey, in the territory
served by such operating subsidiaries. None of the proceeds of
these sales went to the Company or to any of its subsidiaries.
In order to avoid litigation and retain the good will of the customers
of their subsidiaries, the Company offered to take up the Prefe'rred
Stock that had been so sold at the instance of Commonwealths (Del.).
This transaction was evidenced by an assignment to the Company of
any claim which such Preferred stockholders of Commonwealths
(N. J.) may have had in the premises. In turn, the Company agreed
to pay to the holder of such Preferred stock $6.24 per annum for each
$100 face amount of Prior Preferred Stock (which had been sold for
$95). These obligations have no due date, but are exchangeable at
the option of the Company for its junior Preferred stock, provided
there are no arrears of dividends on the First Preferred Stock. The
Company has never, because of said dividend arrears, been in a position
to exercise its right to issue Preferred stock in settlement of these
Agreements.
During the period from 1931 to 1938, the interest on the Assignments and Agreements amounted to $294,704. This amount was
paid by the Company with no cash return to it and to that extent
utilized cash which would otherwise have been available for dividends
on the First Preferred Stock.
II

EJXTH

REPORT

It appears that the cash entering the system through normal
business operations was not sufficient to meet the cash requirements
of the system, including construction. During the same period it
has been impossible for the subsidiary companies to take care of
their own construction for additions and extensions through the sale
of new securities.
The Trust Indenture, under which the $14,000,000 principal amount
of the Company's First Mortgage Collateral Trust Gold Bonds are
issued, provides that all securities of the direct operating subsidiaries
owned by the Company are to be pledged with the Trustees. The
Company covenanted that it would not permit the subsidiaries to
issue any additional securities unless such securities were also pledged
with the Trustees. This provision prevented sale of securities to
anyone except the Company and that company was not in a cash
position to put any additional money in the operating properties.
General Public Utilities, Inc., has a similar provision in the Trust
Indenture securing its First Mortgage and Collateral Trust 6%%
Bonds. Its subsidiaries are thus unable to sell securities to finance
their own extensions and additions. General Public Utilities, Inc. is
not in a cash position to put additional funds into its subsidiaries, and,
as has been stated, the Company cannot advance money to General
Public Utilities, Inc., so that company may aid its subsidiaries.
Temporary respite from this situation was secured by the Company
in May 1939, through the medium of a Reconstruction Finance Corporation loan of $1,350,000. Of this amount, $1,250,000 is to be used
by the Missouri Utilities Company, The Kansas Utilities Company,
and the Texas-New Mexico Utilities Company for construction of
additions and extensions in the territory served by such companies.
The remaining $100,000 to be used by the Company, together with
funds of its own, to payoff the bank loans previously mentioned.
Under the terms of the loan agreement the Company is presently
restricted while the loan is outstanding to a maximum annual dividend of 50 cents per share on the New Common Stock, or a total
annual dividend payment of not over $181,405.
FAIRNESS

OF THE PLAN

The Commission found that:
The most obvious question of fairness is the allocation of securities between
the present Preferred and Common stockholders. Unless their present interests
in the Company correspond to the proposed 95 to 5 distribution, the plan may
be said to be unfair in the absence of offsetting considerations.
On the other
hand, it is to be recognized that such relationships cannot be measured with
precision.
The usual methods for determining the fairness of a reallocation of securities
require consideration of the values presently available for each class. On the

364

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

basis of book values, as determined by the latest balance sheet, there would appear
to be an excess of value available for the Common Stock, which might be used as
a basis for some recognition.
However, as pointed out above, values on the
balance sheet include items which ought not to be there and which it is now
proposed to eliminate.
When these eliminations are made, the margin apparently available for the Common Stock disappears.
This, however, is not conclusive as to the right of the Common Stock to participation.
At the present time the corporate earnings exceed the Preferred
dividend requirement and the forecasts of future earnings point to a still further
improvement.
It may be assumed, therefore, that although it will take many
years before the present Common Stock can hope for a return, especially in view
of the crippling effect of the present capital structure, nevertheless there is an
eventual prospect which must be regarded as having a present value. If the
company were in a position to payout all of its corporate net income in the
form of dividends, the Common stockholders might, on the basis of the present
level of earnings, expect some return after approximately 10 years. However,
according to tile Company's management the system must conserve its cash for
improvements, replacements, and betterments, and as pointed out above, the
loan agreement with the Reconstruction Finance Corporation limits dividend
payments so long as that loan is outstanding unless that corporation's consent
is obtained to any proposed increase in dividend payments.
Nevertheless, the
possibjlity that there may eventually be dividends available for the Common
Stock is such that we cannot say that the Common Stock has no value, and we
therefore believe that it is entitled to some participation in the Company.
We have frequently said that for reorganization purposes earning power rather
than the book value of assets is the best test of value. Genesee Valley Gas Co.,
Inc., 3 S. E. C. 104 (1938); In re Utilities Power & Light Corp., 1939, D. C.
29 F. Supp. 763, 5 S. E. C. 483. In the present case it is unnecessary to attempt
to appraise the exact value of the Common Stock of Community.
It is evident
from the income figures, as previously set forth above, that there is some excess
of earnings over present Preferred dividend requirements.
We therefore believe
that some value remains for the Common Stock. Under circumstances where
a larger participation was being given to Common Stock, we might be required
to evaluate more precisely the equity for such common stock. On the other hand,
the fact that there appears to be no prospect of dividends being paid on the Common
Stock for many years indicates that any participation being given to that class
of stock must necessarily be slight. Under all the circumstances of the present
case and upon consideration of the entire record, we are of the opinion that the
proposed allocation is reasonable.
It may be argued that whatever value exists for the Common Stock is presently
subordinated to the claims of the Preferred stockholders, whereas the plan proposes to place both on a parity so far as the future is concerned. In the present
case such a contention seems unreal. Any attempt to give the Preferred stockholders for their overwhelming interest securities senior in rank to those issued to
the holders of Common Stock would produce a useless complexity without substantially affecting the result. The interest of the present Common stockholders
is so small as in no event to warrant the issuance of more than one class of securities.
It follows from the foregoing that the vesting of the Preferred stockholders
with 95 % of the voting power is consistent with the respective interests of the two
classes of stock and we find the plan fair and equitable to both classes of stockholders.
As we have pointed out, the modification in the terms of the Assignments and
Agreements is in substance merely incidental to the simplification of the Company's corporate structure.
Since no real change is made in the rights of the

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

365

holders of Assignments and Agreements, and since they will continue to receive
interest at the same rate unless and until the Company is able to redeem their
securities at the full price, we find that the proposed alteration in the terms of
these documents is fair to the holders thereof.
NECESSITY FOR PLAN

The Commission found:
With huge Preferred Stock arrearages which, because of the terms of the
Reconstruction Finance Corporation's loan heretofore mentioned, will increase
for the present rather than diminish, and in view of the fact that the Assignments
and Agreements now outstanding cannot be called unless converted into junior
preferred stock, which cannot be issued so long as Preferred dividends are in
arrears, we are of the opinion that the Company's corporate structure is unduly
and unnecessarily complicated.
Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion
that the complications in Community's corporate structure render the corporate
structure of the holding company system of which Community is a part unduly
and unnecessarily complicated, contrary to the standards of Section 11 (b).
We reach the same conclusion with respect to the distribution of voting power.
As already stated, under the terms of the charter the holders of Common Stock
are in a position to control the Company at all times and, in the absence of defaults,
have the sole voting power for the election of directors.
The fact is that the
interest of the Common Stock in the Company's assets and earnings is at best
slight. In substance the Company belongs to the Preferred stockholders, assuming that its creditors are secure in their claims. We therefore conclude, and so
find, that the voting power is presently unfairly and inequitably distributed.
The proposed modification in the terms of the Assignments and Agreements is
merely an incident to the transformation of the Company's corporate structure
from three authorized classes to one class of stock. Under the present terms of
the Assignments and Agreements, they may be converted into a junior preferred
stock "if and when defaults in preferred dividends have been remedied and regular
preferred dividends have been resumed."
Since the consummation of the simplification plan will terminate all rights to accrued dividends, it is evident that
the Company, upon the exchange of stock required by the plan, would, so far as
the terms of the Assignments and Agreements are concerned, be in a position to
convert the Assignments and Agreements into preferred stock and then immediately to call such preferred stock at its call price of $100 per unit. The effect of
the proposed modification, therefore, appears merely to make unnecessary the
actual issuance and calling of the junior preferred stock. In that way the additional complication in the corporate structure resulting from such issuance is
avoided. No real change is made in the rights of the holders of Assignments and
Agreements. So far as any alteration is made requiring our approval, therefore,
we find that such modification in the terms of the Assignments and Agreements
is necessary to eliminate complications in the Company's corporate structure and
to carry out the original purposes of the Assignments and Agreements in the light
of the elimination of the Company's Preferred Stock and its transformation into
a one stock company.
Under all of the circumstances of this case, in the light of the Company's present financial condition and future prospects, and in view of the present inequitable
distribution of voting power, we conclude and so find that the plan of corporate
simplification is necessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection (b) (2) of
Section 11.

366

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

It has been suggested to the Court, as previously stated, that Section
11 of the Act is not an exercise of the Congressional power over Interstate Commerce in that "the test of application * * * is not
whether the holding company is engaged in or affects interstate commerce but rests solely on the test of whether it is a holding company."
This suggestion is without merit. Section 11 does not apply to all
holding companies. It is expressly limited in its application to "registered" holding companies under Section 5 of the Act. Nor is registration required indiscriminately of all holding companies as such.
On the contrary, registration is obligatory only for those holding companies which engage in certain specified types of transactions.
Section 4 (a) of the Act 15 U. S. C. A. Sec. 79d (a), reads:
After December 1, 1935, unless a holding company is registered under section
5 [7ge of this title], it shall be unlawful for such holding company, directly or
indirectly(1) to sell, transport, transmit, or distribute, or own or operate any utility assets
for the transportation, transmission, or distribution of, natural or manufactured
gas or electric energy in interstate commerce;
(2) by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce
to negotiate, enter into, or take any step in the performance of, any service,
sales, or construction contract undertaking to perform services or construction
work for, or sell goods to, any public-utility company or holding company;
(3) to distribute or make any public offering for sale or exchange of any security
of such holding company, any subsidiary company or affiliate of such holding
company, any public-utility company, or any holding company, by use of the mails
or any means or instrumentailty
of interstate commerce, or to sell any such
security having reason to believe that such security, by use of the mails or any
means or instrumentality
of interstate commerce, will be distributed or made
the subject of a public offering;
(4) by use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce,
to acquire or negotiate for the acquisition of any security or utility assets of any
subsidiary company or affiliate of such holding company, any public-utility
company, or any holding company;
(5) to engage in any business in interstate commerce; or
(6) to own, control, or hold with power to vote, any security of any subsidiary
company thereof that does any of the acts enumerated in paragraphs (1) to (5),
inclusive, of this subsection.

In Electric Bond and Share Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission, 1938,303 U. S. 419, 58 S. Ct. 678, 82 L. Ed. 936, 115 A. L.
R. 105, the Court sustained Sections 4 (a) and 5 of the Act as constitutional and held that the doing of any of the things specified in
clauses (1) to (6) of Section 4 (a) above quoted constituted an engagement in interstate commerce subject to the regulation of Congress.
Therefore, the only holding companies required to register are those
which engage in interstate commerce. Since Section 11 by its terms
applies only to registered holding companies, it is evident that "the
test of application" does not" rest solely on * * * whether the

SIXTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

367

Company is a holding company" without regard to whether it is
"engaged in or affects interstate commerce."
The further suggestion has been made to the Court that, despite
its registration under Section 5 of the Act, the Company is not subject
to regulation by Congress under the commerce clause because it "is
simply a holding company collecting dividends and interest from its
investments, in no reasonable sense, engaged in interstate commerce."
But in view of the regulatory provisions of the Act which take effect
only after registration it would seem unlikely that the officers and
directors of the Company would have caused it to register under
Section 5 of the Act unless the Company engaged in interstate
commerce as defined in clauses (1) to (6) of Section 4 (a).
However that may be, the record is clear that at least three subsidiaries of the Company transmit, and own and operate utility assets
for the transmission of electric energy in interstate commerce, within
the meaning of clause (1) of Section 4 (a) of the Act. These are TexasNew Mexico Utilities Company, Kansas Utilities Company and
Missouri Utilities Company, all of whose outstanding voting securities
are owned, or controlled and held by the Company with power to vote.
That the interstate commerce is conducted through the subsidiary
companies rather than by the Company itself is of no moment. In
Electric Bond & Share Co. v. Securities and Exchange Commission,
supra, Mr. Chief Justice Hughes said (303 U. S. at page 440, 58 S. Ct.
at page 686, 82 L. Ed. 936, 115 A. L. R. 105):

* * *

That they conduct such transactions through the instrumentality
of subsidiaries cannot avail to remove them from the reach of the federal power.
It is the substance of what they do, and not the form in which they clothe their
transactions, which must afford the test. The constitutional authority confided
to Congress could not be maintained if it were deemed to depend upon * * *
mere modal arrangements

* * *.

I deem the second suggestion to be without merit.
The suggestion was further made that Section 11 of the Act is not
within "the power of Congress to pass uniform laws on bankruptcy
* * * (or) * * * to establish post offices and post roads."
Reliance is placed by both suggestors on Burco, Inc. v. Whitworth,
4 Cir., 1936, 81 F. 2d 721. That case arose upon an application for
instructions by a trustee appointed under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act, 11 U. S. C. A. ~
207. The debtor was a holding company
as defined by the Act and the question was whether the trustee should
comply with the registration provisions of Sections 4 (a) and 5. The
Court held that those sections were unconstitutional and directed the
trustee to disregard them. That decision has been clearly overruled
by the later determination of the Supreme Court in the Electric Bond
& Share Co. Case, 1938,303 U. S. 419, 58 S. Ct. 678, 82 L. Ed. 936,

368

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

115 A. L. R. 105, that Sections 4 (a) and 5 are constitutional.
The
Court in the Burco case, however, unlike the Supreme Court in the
Electric Bond & Share Co. case, gave expression to opinions concerning
sections of the Act other than those in issue. This, of course, is sheer
obiter. In view of the fact that the Burco case has been overruled as
to the matter decided, little weight can be given to its dicta.
The Company is engaged in interstate commerce through the instrumentality of its subsidiaries and the application of subsection (b) (2)
and (e) of Section 11 are clearly within the power of Congress under
the commerce clause.
The power of Congress over interstate commerce is, subject to the
limitations of the Bill of Rights, plenary and sovereign (Kentucky
Whip & Collar Co. v. Illinois Central Railroad Co., 1937, 299 U. S.
334,345, 57 S. Ct. 277, 81 L. Ed. 270; Champion v. Ames, 1903, 188
U. S. 321, 347, 352, 23 S. Ct. 321, 47 L. Ed. 492; Gilman v. Philadelphia,
1865, 3 Wall. 713, 725, 18 L. Ed. 96 i Gibbons v. Ogden, 1824, 9 Wheat.
1, 196, 6 L. Ed. 23; Cohens v. Virginia, 1821, 6 Wheat. 264, 412, 5
L. Ed. 257) and is not limited to such commerce itself but extends" to
every instrumentality or agency by which it is carried on" (Minnesota
Rate Cases, 1913, 230 U. S. 352, 399, 33 S. Ct. 729, 739, 57 L. Ed.
1511,48 L. R. A., N. S., 1151, Ann. Cas. 1916A, 18) and to the "persons
engaged in it." Sherlock v. Alling, 1876, 93 U. S. 99, 103, 23 L. Ed.
819.
Within the field of interstate commerce Congress possesses a police
power to promote the general welfare akin to that of the states in the
realm of their domestic affairs. Nebbia v. New York, 1934,291 U. S.
502, 524, 54 S. Ct. 505, 78 L. Ed. 940, 89 A. L. R. 1469; Brooks v.
United States, 1925,267 U. S. 432, 436, 45 S. Ct. 345, 69 L. Ed. 699,
37 A. L. R. 1407; Board of Trade of City of Chicago v. Olsen, 1923,
262 U. S. 1,41,43 S. Ct. 470,67 L. Ed. 839.
Congress may, therefore, under the commerce clause, enact legislation "to foster, protect and control [interstate] commerce with appropriate regard to the welfare of those who are immediately concerned,
as well as the public at large, and to promote its growth and insure its
safety."
Dayton-Goose Creek R. Co. v. United States, 1924, 263
U. S. 456, 478, 44 S. Ct. 169, 172, 68 L. Ed. 388, 33 A. L. R. 472. It
is within the province of Congress, moreover, in the regulation of
interstate commerce to privide for the security of the people in their
relationships to corporations engaged in such commerce. Thus in
Crutcher v. Kentucky, 1891, 141 U. S. 47, 58, 11 S. Ct. 851, 854, 35
L. Ed. 649, the Court said:

* * * The prerogative, the responsibility, and the duty of providing for the
security of the citizens and the people of the United States in relation to foreign
corporate bodies, or foreign individuals with whom they may have relations of
foreign commerce, belong to the government of the United States
* * *.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

369

And the same thing is exactly as true with regard to interstate commerce as it is
with regard to foreign commerce. No difference is perceivable between the
two. * * *

The powers of Congress in this regard were succinctly stated by the
late Frank B. Kellogg some thirty years ago:

* * * Within its power of regulation it may prescribe what corporations
may so engage in such commerce. It may prohibit corporations organized under
foreign governments from engaging therein, or prescribe the regulations under
which they may so engage. It may equally prohibit state corporations from so
engaging, or as a condition prescribe the regulations under which they may engage.
Such conditions may include the terms under which the capital stock shall be
issued and paid for, and proper guaranties to insure the solvency of such corporations, to the end that their securities may be safe investments for the people, and
that they may be able to perform their obligations as instrumentalities
of
commerce.
Federal Incorporation and Control, 20 Yale L. J. 177, 188 (1910).
Similarly Victor Morawetz, an eminent authority on constitutional
and corporate law, wrote over a quarter of a century ago:

* * * The organization, powers, and financial conditions of a * * *
corporation may have a direct and important relation to the transaction of interstate and international commerce, and may be of such a character as to render
the * * * operations of the corporation a menace to the security and welfare of the people of all the states.
A statute prohibiting the transaction of
interstate commerce by means of a corporate organization which is a menace to
the security of the public would seem justifiable as an exercise of the police power
over interstate commerce and as a regulation of such commerce within the
meaning of the Constitution.
The Power of Congress to Enact Incorporation Laws and to Regulate
Corporations, 26 Harv. L. Rev. 667, 680 (1913).
Subsections (b) (2) and (e) of Section 11 of the Act are clearly
within the power of Congress above described. A corporation engaged in interstate commerce whose corporate structure is unduly or
unnecessarily complicated or unfairly and inequitably distributes voting power among its security holders is manifestly inimical both to
that commerce and its own security holders. That is especially so of
public utility holding companies one of whose main functions is to
finance the operations of their subsidiaries through funds raised by the
sale of their own securities.
The suggestion that, in providing a means of corporate simplification for registered holding companies, the Act is arbitrary and capricious is demonstrably unwarranted.
The suggestion that the plan is not within Section 11 (b) (2) in that
the corporate structure of the Company is not complicated and does
not unfairly and inequitably distribute voting rights is equally untenable. It appears clearly from the opinion of the Commission
approving the plan that, although there have been earnings, dividends
have not been declared since November 1931 because the funds were

370

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE OOMMISSION

found necessary to meet debt obligations and to pay for necessary
improvements to the properties of the operating subsidiaries. With
huge arrearages of unpaid and undeclared dividends on the Preferred
Stock, the Company finds itself without credit to raise the funds necessary to enable it to fulfill its duties to its subsidiaries. The" Assignments and Agreements" being without maturity, constitute perpetual
debentures, which, unless the Plan is consummated or the arrearages
on the Preferred Stock are somehow paid, cannot but contribute to the
inability of the Company to function normally.
Complexity is not a matter to be determined merely by counting
.A corporate structure is unduly
the classes of securities outstanding.
and unnecessarily complicated when it prevents the corporation involved from performing its functions. By such a test there can be no
doubt that the Company's corporate structure falls within the meaning
of Section 11 (b) (2) of the Act.
That the voting rights are unfairly distributed is apparent. The
Commission found the 10,000 shares of outstanding Common Stock
to be valueless on the basis of adjusted book-value, and on an earning
basis to have but a 5 percent interest in the Company. Yet this class
of stock presently controls the Company through a preponderance of
voting strength.
It has been further suggested that in their application in the instant
case subsections (b) (2) and (e) of Section 11 are unconstitutional in
that they would abrogate" vested contractual rights given * * *
by state law." I do not agree. In the exercise of its powers under
the Constitution, Congress may properly enact legislation which has
the effect of impairing or even abrogating existing contract rights.
This has been recognized on numerous occasions by the Supreme
Court in sustaining statutes enacted under the power to coin money
and regulate its value. Legal Tender Cases, 1870, 12 Wall. 457, 549,

subordinate the exercise of the Federal authority to the continuing operation of
previous contracts would be to place, to this extent, the regulation of interstate
commerce in the hands of private individuals, and to withdraw from the control
of Congress so much of the field as they might choose by prophetic discernment
to bring within the range of their agreements.
The Constitution recognizes no
such limitation.
It is of the essence of the delegated power of regulation that,
within its sphere, Congress should be able to establish uniform rules, immediately
obligatory, which as to future action should transcend all inconsistent provisions.
Prior arrangements were necessarily subject to this paramount authority.

Nor is the suggestion that Sections 11 (b) (2) and 11 (c) of the Act in
their present application violate the Tenth Amendment of any merit.
Assuming that Delaware law prohibits its corporations from amending
their charters so as to substitute some other right for that of Preferred
shareholders to accrued unpaid and undeclared dividends: Congress is
not fettered in the regulation of the instrumentalities of interstate
commerce by state law. United States v. Delaware & Hudson Co.,
1909,213 U. S. 366,405,29 S. Ct. 527,53 L. Ed. 836; Northern Securities
Co. v. United States, 1904, 193 U. S. 197,345, 24 S. Ct. 436, 48 L. Ed.
679; Pittsburgh & W. V. R. Co. v. Interstate Commerce Commission,
1923, 54 App. D. C. 34, 293 F. 1001, 1003, appeal denied, 1924, 266
U. S. 640, 45 S. Ct. 124, 69 L. Ed. 483. Thus in the Delaware & Hudson case, supra, the Court said (213 U. S. at page 405, 29 S. Ct. at page
535, 53 L. Ed. 836):

* * *

The power to regulate commerce possessed by Congress is, in the nature
of things, everenduring, and therefore the right to exert it today, tomorrow, and
at all times in its plenitude must remain free from restrictions and limitations
arising or asserted to arise by state laws, whether enacted before or after Congress
has chosen to exert and apply its lawful power to regulate.

In the Pittsburgh & W. V. R. Co. case, supra, the Court sustained
Section 20 (a) of the Interstate Commerce Act, 49 U. S. C. A. 920 (a),
which placed the issuance of securities by transportation companies
engaged in interstate commerce under the regulation of the Interstate
Commerce Commission. In overruling a contention similar to that
here raised, the Court said (54 App. D. C. 34, 293 F. at page 1003):
The validity of section 20a, supra, is questioned on the ground that it is not
a regulation of Interstate Commerce, nor within the power of Congress, but is
instead a usurpation of states' rights contrary to tne Tenth Amendment of the
Constitution of the United States. It is authoritatively asserted that with one or
two exceptions all the railroad corporations of the country are organised under
state laws, and it is contended are subject exclusively to the constitution and
laws of the states in wnich they were created.
We are not impressed by this
contention.
Unquestionably every state has plenary power over its corporations,
but when that power comes in conflict with the exercise by Congress of a power
expressly conferred by the Constitution, the authority of the state must yield.
We are here considering the power of Congress to regulate interstate commerce;
in that field the authority of Congress is supreme. A law of Congress enacted
pursuant to express constitutional sanction, is the supreme law of the land, "anything in the Constitution or laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding."

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The Court said in Champion v. Ames, 1903, 188 U. S. 321, 357, 23
S. Ct. 321, 327,47 L. ED. 492:

* * *

If it be said that the act
is inconsistent with the Tenth Amendment,
reserving to the States respectively or to the people the powers not delegated to
the United States, the answer is that the power to regulate commerce among the
States has been expressly delegated to Congress.

But the Delaware law is not as has been suggested.

All that Keller

v. Wilson & Co., Del. Sup., 1936, 190.A. 115, and the cases that follow
it (relied upon by Mr. Duane) hold is that accumulated unpaid and
undeclared dividends are not subject to elimination by action of the
stockholders under Section 26 of Delaware's General Corporation
Law. This is apparent from the later decision of the same court in
Federal United Corporation v. Havender, Del. Sup., 1940, 11 .A. 2d
331, holding that such dividends can properly be eliminated by corporate action under Sections 59 and 59.Aof the General Corporation Law.
The Keller case, supra, turns upon the point that Section 26 of
the General Corporation Law was not in effect when the corporation
in question was organized and that consequently rights of preferred
shareholders contracted before its enactment were not subject to
impairment by it. Consolidated Film Industries v. Johnson, Del.
Sup., 1937, 197 .A. 489, goes a step further. It was there held that
even as to corporations organized after its enactment, Section 26,
while effectively creating means to bar the cumulation of future
dividends, could not be used to affect dividends already accrued without impairing the obligation of contract. These cases, of course, are
based on the provision of Section 10 of .Article I of the federal Constitution which prohibits the states from impairing obligations of contract. But Congress is not subject to any such restriction, and the
plan before this Court is promulgated not by virtue of any state law,
but under the paramount and exclusive power of the federal government to regulate interstate commerce and its instrumentalities.
In the Havender case, supra, the Supreme Court of Delaware made
it clear that the public policy of that state did not prohibit the elimination of accrued unpaid and undeclared dividends. There the court
found in Sections 59 and 59.A of the General Corporation Law a
caveat to preferred shareholders (apparently missing in Section 26)
that their right to accumulated unpaid and undeclared dividends
might be eliminated. The court therefore held that those sections
afford means to accomplish that end without conflicting with the
prohibition of Section 10 of .Article I of the federal Constitution.
The policy of Delaware law and the concern of the courts of that
state with this subject was well phrased in the Havender case, supra,
where the court said, 11 .A. 2d, at page 342:
There is no invasion of legal or equitable rights, nor is there moral wrong, in
disposing of dividends on preference stock accumulated through time other than

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

373

by their payment in money, if the right to such dividends has not the status of a
fixed contractual right * * *, and if the terms of disposal are fair and
equitable in the circumstances Of ~ case;

* '" *.

Thus the public policy of Delaware is not against the compounding
of accumulated dividends. It is only when state action in that regard
would invade contract rights that the law of Delaware hesitates.
But, as already noted, the plan before this Court is not based on
Delaware law, but on paramount federal law which is not subject to
Section 10 of Article I of the 'federal Constitution.
It has been further suggested that in their application to the case at
bar Sections 11 (b) (2) and n (e) of the Act are "spoliative and confiscatory and in violation of. the Fifth Amendment." But as the
Supreme Court has on numerous occasions pointed out the proscription by the Fifth Amendment of the deprivation of property without
due process of law applies only to direct appropriations. Norman '0.
Baltimore & Ohio R. Co., 1935, 294 U. S. 240, 55 S. Ct. 407, 79 L. Ed.
885, 95 A. L. R. 1352; Union Bridge Co. v. United States, 1907,
204 U. S. 364, 27 S. Ct. 367, 51 L. Ed. 523; Scranton v. Wheeler, 1900,
179 U. S. 141,21 S. Ct. 48,, 45
, L. Ed. 126; Legal Tender Cases, 1870,
12 Wall. 457, 20 L. Ed. 287.

Thus in answer to a similar contention it was said in the Legal
Tender cases, supra, 12 Wall. at 551,20 L. Ed. 287:

* * * That provision has. always been understood as referring only to a
direct appropriation, and not to consequential injuries resulting from the exercise
of lawful power. It has nev~ .qe~ supposed to have any bearing upon, or to
inhibit law" that indirectly wOJ.;.lf,Jwrmand loss to individuals.
A new tariff,
an embargo, a draft, or a war
i~evi~bly bringI upon indivTidhuals
greatdlosses;
may, indeed, render valuable property almost \'8 ueless.
ey may estroy
the worth of contracts.
But whoever supposed that, because of this, a tariff
could not be changed, or a noa-intercourse act, or an embargo be enacted, or
a war be declared? * * *

~f!i

That no taking within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment is
here involved is apparent.
There is a further suggestion that Sections 11 (b) (2) and 11 (e)
of the Act do not authorize a plan altering the rights of stockholders
inter sese. This is coupled with the additional suggestion that this
Court cannot enforce such a plan because Section 11 (e) of the Act
gives the Court jurisdiction 'only over the Company and its assets
but not over the stockholders.'
-

Section 11 (b) (2)' expressly provides for the elimination of undue
and unnecessary complications' in the corporate structure of a company. But the corporate':struct~e
of a company consists of the
classes of its securities out~Uthding and the respective rights of their
holders. Certainly if undue, and unnecessary complications in a
company's corporate structure are to be eliminated the statute must
envision a readjustment of those rights. Any other interpretation
273226--41----~

374

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of the statute would render it ineffectual to accomplish one of its
stated purposes.
Section 11 (e) of the Act gives the Court jurisdiction over the
corporation and its assets to the extent necessary to enforce and
carry out the plan. Such jurisdiction is manifestly sufficient to work
a readjustment of the rights of security holders. This is so, at least
insofar as stockholders are concerned, because jurisdiction over the
corporation carries with it jurisdiction over the corporate charter
which is the source and mainspring of shareholders' rights. Having
jurisdiction over the corporation and its charter the court has ample
power. On numerous occasions stockholders' rights have been
altered by courts acting under former Section 77B of the National
Bankruptcy Act and Chapter X of that Act as amended, 11 U. S.
C. A. Sec. 207, 501 et seq. In both such classes of cases the courts
had jurisdiction not over the stockholders but merely over the
corporation and its assets.
It would seem that stockholders of a corporation involved in
proceedings under Section 11 (e) of the Act are in no different position
from stockholders of corporations in reorganization under Section
77B or Chapter X. In each case the stockholders are afforded
opportunity for hearing. They may take advantage of that opportunity or they may not. But in any event the Court's jurisdiction
over the corporation, deemed adequate to effect a readjustment of
stockholders' rights under Section 77B and Chapter X, is clearly
sufficient to accomplish that purpose under Section 11 (e).
Finally, as Mr. Justice Pitney said in Blair v. United States, 1919,
250 U. S. 273, 279, 39 S. Ct. 468, 470,63 L. Ed. 979:
Considerations of propriety, as well as long established practice, demand that
we refrain from passing upon the constitutionality of an act of Congress unless
obliged to do so in the proper performance of our judicial function, when the
question is raised by a party whose interests entitle him to raise it.

The constitutionality of the Act, moreover, is buttressed by a
presumption to be overcome only "when the unconstitutionality
exists beyond a rational doubt." International Mercantile Marine
Co. v. Stranahan, C. C., S. D. N. Y., 1907, 155 F. 428, 430.
Similarly in Sarony v. Burrow-Giles Lithographic Co., C. C., S. D.
N. Y., 1883, 17 F. 591, 592, the late distinguished father of my colleague Judge Coxe said:
The court should hesitate long and be convinced beyond a reasonable doubt
before pronouncing the invalidity of an act of. congress. The argument should
amount almost to a demonstration.
If doubt exists the Act should be sustained.
The presumption is in favor of its validity.
rhis has long been the rule-a rule
applicable to all tribunals, and particularly to courts sitting at nisi prius, Were
it otherwise, endless complications would result, and a law which, in one circuit,was declared unconstitutional and void, might, in another, be enforced as valid.

For the foregoing reasons the application will be granted. Submit
findings of fact and conclusions of law and decree providing that this
Court approves the Plan as fair and equitable to the persons affected
and necessary to effectuate the provisions of subsection (2) of Section
11 (b) and that this Court as a Court of Equity for the purpose of
carrying out the terms and provisions of such Plan takes exclusive
jurisdiction and possession of the Company and the assets thereof
wherever located and appoints the Company as sole Trustee in possession to hold and administer under the direction of the Court and in
accordance with the Plan thus approved, the assets so possessed.

APPENDIX XI
REPORT OF THE SPECIAL COMMITTEE ON COOPERATION WITH
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION 1
(Adopted

May 14, 1940)

To THE COUNCIL OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ACCOUNTANTS:
Gentlemen: This report summarizes the activities of the special
committee on cooperation with Securities and Exchange Commission
during the past eight months. We shall also make reference in this
report to certain releases of the S. E. C.
INDEPENDENT

STATUS

OF THE PUBLIC

ACCOUNTANT

When the present chairman of the S. E. C. took office he said that
the independence of the accountant must be preserved and strengthened
and standards of thoroughness and accuracy protected. The interest
of the S. E. C. in this matter and the influence they can exert will undoubtedly fortify the independent status of the public accountant.
Last fall, for example, the chief accountant of the Commission was
directed by the Commission to discuss with committees of the Institute
whether it would not be possible for the S. E. C. to help in strengthening the position of the public accountant.
The Commission expressed the desire to be of assistance in cases where an accountant who
insists on making an audit of adequate scope or on following an accepted accounting principle may be faced with the loss of a client. No
practicable solution to this problem has yet been found, but the initiative taken by the S. E. C. in the matter is significant of their interest
in our behalf.
A few months ago we were asked by one of the commissioners
whether appointment of auditors by stockholders rather than by the
management would make for greater independence on the part of the
auditor. We expressed our belief that the auditor's independence
did not depend upon-the channel of his appointment.
One of the provisions in the Wagner-Lea bill for regulation of investment companies
would require that accountants be selected by vote of the shareholders.
The purpose of that provision, Judge Healy of the S. E. C. said in
recent hearings before the Senate committee on banking and currency,
was to impress upon accountants that their responsibility is to the
security holders rather than to the management.
I

This Is 8 Committee of the American Institute of Accountants.

376

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

377

The latest amendment to the proxy regulation requires that when
the election of an auditor is one of the matters to be acted upon pursuant to the proxy solicited, the proxy statement shall describe briefly
any material relationship of the auditors to the company and any
of its affiliates and similar information with respect to any relative
or spouse of the auditor having the same home as the auditor. If such
a relative holds investments in securities of the company or of any of
its affiliates, there may exist a material relationship which would have
to be described in the proxy statement.
Here regulation is carried to
an extreme, but we can have no dissent from its aim which is support
of the independence of the auditor.
In accounting- series release No.2, the Commission took the position
that an accountant cannot be deemed to be independent if he holds an
interest in the registrant that is significant with respect to its total
capital or his own personal fortune, and that in one case a firm of
accountants could not be considered independent because one of the
partners owned stock in a client corporation which was substantial in
value and constituted more than one percent of the partner's personal
fortune. That pronouncement by the S. E. C. was a salutary one, in
our opinion. We believe that accountants would be well advised to
refrain from investing in any securities of their client companies.
A UDITING

METHODS

The S. E. C. has stressed the importance of examination of books and
records at the place where they are kept and the practice of inspecting
the company's plant and its products during an audit. Accountants
should aim to familiarize themselves with the plant layout, the operating methods, the nature of the products, the personnel of the accounting department, and the methods of internal check and control,
and to substantiate oral explanations received by contact with employees having first-hand knowledge of the facts or by observation of
the physical aspects of the business,"
In another case 3 that came before the S. E. C., the Commission
found that an audit was inadequate because it did not comprise an
investigation of the accounting methods followed at a branch office.
The Commission based its finding on its rule of several years standing
that in giving due weight to an internal system of audit the accountants
shall review the accounting procedures followed and satisfy themselves that the procedures are in fact being followed.
There are some indications that the S. E. C. expects that examinations by auditors should be more detailed. Here is one of the most
difficult problems confronting the auditor. He cannot make a com• Securities

plete audit of all the transactions or all the accounts, and his observations of the physical plant, operations, and products must be quite
restricted.
He is obliged, for the most part, to draw his conclusions
about the integrity of the accounts as a whole from examination of a
portion of the transactions and book entries. He has to render his
report promptly or the report will be of little use to the public. He
has to undertake the audit at a reasonable fee to the company.
If he
should fail to discern that a minor discrepancy is not a bit of carelessness, but is part of a manipulation of larger proportions, the risk to
him is that his oversight, in the light of after events, may be made to
appear to be gross negligence.
All business concerns should not be saddled with the expense of a
yearly audit as detailed as that designed for the occasional concern
whose management comes under suspicion .
.An auditor must expect to incur the ill will of some clients for insistence on a principle of accounting or disclosure; he will be indeed
fortunate if throughout his career no ingenious fraud in bookkeeping
escapes him, if he is never severely blamed for an oversight; he will
seldom receive commendation for his most conscientious investigations
that are conducted in accordance with the best technique and result in
no spectacular discovery.
A question of audit procedure which has attracted some attention
from the S. E. C. is whether the auditor, instead of depending uponhis
own interpretation of contracts or other legal documents or upon the
explanations of them by counsel of the client company, should himself
engage counsel to construe the documents.
With few exceptions we
think the auditor is justified in accepting the opinion of counsel of the
client company on the meaning of legal documents.
When we read the releases of the S. E. C. we cannot fail to be impressed with the relative importance ascribed by the Commission to
corporate earnings. We may ask ourselves whether the usual procedure for audit of operating accounts of a business concern is adequate
in the interest of investors or whether it would not be practicable to
make more use of statistical data which the auditor could ascertain at
intervals during the year from the operating departments.
.
CERTIFICATION

In promulgating the new Regulation S-X, which we shall discuss
presently, the S. E. C. announced that the rules governing certification by accountants would be reconsidered upon the completion of
pending proceedings with a view to revisions deemed necessary JIS a
result of these cases. Before issuing any new rule on certification,
the Commission, following its usual practice, will undoubtedly discuss
any proposed changes with a committee of the Institute.

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

379

We understand that the S. E. O. has taken cognizance of the Institute bulletin, "Extensions of Auditing Procedure," and that their
usual policy is not to accept any auditor's certificate which indicates
that in his examination of accounts receivable or inventories he has
not followed the procedure outlined in the bulletin.
REGULATION

S-X

During the past two years the Institute committee has had a number of conferences with the S. E. C. staff and one of the commissioners with regard to successive drafts of new accounting requirements.
Finally issued in February of this year, these requirements are now
known as Regulation S-X. The amendments to former requirements
effected by this new regulation were described in the March 1940,
issue of The Journal oj Accountancy.
These amendments, most persons will probably agree, do not add materially to the bulk of information required to be included in financial statements and schedules
in registration statements.
Regulation S-X should not be regarded as the last word. We may
expect it to be revised from time to time, The staff of the S. E. O.
do not feel bound to accept all financial statements that are prepared
exactly in conformity with the requirements of Regulation S-X, and
they may at times call for additional information or insist that information shall be presented in somewhat different form than that indicated in Regulation SaX. Accountants should bear in mind that
Regulation S-X, like previous instruction books, is only a minimum
requirement.
FOOTNOTES

TO FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

Financial statements in registration statements have been replete
with explanatory footnotes. A substantial number of prospectuses
contain, on the average, a full page of footnotes to every balancesheet or income statement.
The S. E. C. in some of the cases decided
have considered that quite small items, omitted or erroneously described, were material. Accountants have to recommend, in the best
interests of their clients, the disclosure of much explanatory information appended to the financial statements.
The Oommission has had experience with a few cases where footnotes were manifestly used improperly. In one release the Commission held that the face of a balance-sheet containing an untrue statement through overvaluation of an asset is not curable by a footnote
admitting the overvaluation.
Two years ago, in accounting-series
release No.4, the Oommission formally defined its administrative
policy on financial statements by declaring in substance that a financial statement founded on accounting principles for which there is no

380

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

substantial authoritative support presumably is misleading despite
disclosures in footnotes or in the accountants' certificate.
It may not always be possible, even with the attention that is being
given to the development of accounting principles, to find a substantial authoritative precedent for every kind of.transaction met with in
special cases. We believe that the S. E. C. is disposed to administer
accounting-series release No.4 in the spirit rather than in the'letter.
.
L
REPORTS

TO STOCKHOJ.,DERS

Uniformity or standardization of accounting and reporting is one
of the avowed objectives of the S. E. C. The fact that some corporations now publish quite condensed financial statements, in the
judgment of the S. E. C., points to the need of a regulation prescribing
what financial information corporations shall furnish to investors in
their annual reports.
11 • ;
The S. E. C. has tentatively considered requiring corporations
subject to the securities-exchange act which solicit proxies from their
stockholders to furnish annually to their stock\iQJders a balance-sheet,
income statement, surplus statement, and ~cliei:J.uleof supplementary
profit-and-loss information conforming. in geiieral with the requirements of form lQ-K. In meetings with the.S, E. C. legal staff and
with the chief accountant of the Commission, .members of our committee offered several suggestions respeetingrauch a requirement.
There are a number of difficulties to be overcome. One is the time
factor . We have pointed out to the S: E ..D. tbB..fifcorporations should
be required to furnish to their shareholders balance-sheeta, income
statements, surplus statements,
and supplementary profit-and-loss
statements conforming with the standard accounting requirements of
the S. E. C. and including, in the case of companies that have subsidiaries, consolidated statements and statements of any significant
unconsolidated subsidiaries, the effect probfi.bly would be that annual
meetings of corporations would be set forward:\fand financial reports
would reach the stockholders later in the- year'than at present.
There appears to be no disposition on thc part of the S. E. C. to
prescribe requirements for quarterly reports:
NATURAL

BUSINESS

'YEKR

The congestion of work which besets many aecounting firms .during
the winter months, owing to the preponderances of the calendar-year
companies, has beep the subject of discussions between our committee
and commissioners and the chief aceountant of the S. E. C. The
S. E. C. has no power under the securiti~ act or the securities-exchange
act to require corporations to change their, fiscal years, but recognize
the advantages to a corporation in having a fiscal year that coincides

381

SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

with its natural business year. The chief accountant of the S. E. C.
has already issued a release 4. on this subject and the S. E. C. has offered
to bring the subject to the public attention from time to time.
LIMI'l'ATIONS

OF FORMAL

ACCOUNTING

REQUIREMENTS

Releases of the S. E. C. dealing with matters of accounting have
contained many citations from accounting literature and several have
included references to opinions expressed by accountants in roundtable discussions at meetings of the Institute.
It is apparent that
the S. E. C. has given considerable weight to principles that have
received substantial recognition on the part of practising accountants
and the teaching profession.
But rules and principles of accounting, however carefully defined,
will not :fit all cases. Developments in business and finance continually give rise to new problems in the application of accounting
principles. Public accountants have the responsibility of discerning
the cases that are out of the ordinary and cannot be adequately dealt
with merely by conformance with a prescribed rule.
There is the danger that public accountants concentrating their
attention on rigid rules, standardized forms, and theoretical principles
of accounting may at times lose sight of what is more importantthe economic implications and consequences of accounting reports
and policies.
The S. E. C. and the accountancy profession have common objectives. Differences of opinion are bound to arise as to ways and means
for accomplishing the objectives, but our experience has shown that
representatives of the S. E. C. and committees of the American
Institute of Accountants can discuss opposing views frankly to their
mutual advantage.
