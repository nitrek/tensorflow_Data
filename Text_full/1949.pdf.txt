FOREWORD
This is a report of the activities of the Securities and Exchange
Commission during the fifteenth fiscal year of its existence. While
the report is in no sense as ambitious a survey of the Commission's
work and its problems as was undertaken in its Tenth Annual Report,
some trends are noted herein for the five preceding years.
The statutes entrusted to the Commission give it a wide range of
responsibility for protection of the investor.
We have frequently
stressed the fact that the generally applicable legislation administered
by the Commission places its main emphasis on disclosure. That
legislation is based on the theory that business, on the one hand, and
the investor on the other, should retain a full range of individual
responsibility for financial and investment decisions.
However, the statutes go further.
For example, in regulating the
conduct of securities professionals who do business with investors the
statute imposes certain minimum capital requirements and provides
that customers shall not be unduly prejudiced by practices in regard
to the hypothecation
of securities by professionals for their own
borrowings.
Since, in the ordinary course of business many firms
handle cash and securities belonging to customers it is important for
the Commission to help prevent loss to investors occurring as a result
of violation of such restrictions.
Further, many of the rules evolved
under antifraud standards applying to such professionals have the
effect of requiring obedience to certain business practices; an example
is the doctrine, announced by the Commission and judicially affirmed,
that dealers in the over-the-counter market may not, without disclosure, charge a customer a price not reasonably related to current
market prices. While adequate disclosure and consent of the customer
may avoid the charge of fraud when a firm has exacted high markups
in its sales, the fact is that most firms obey the limitation on pricing
inherent in the doctrine without regard to disclosure.
We have tried to show further in this report the importance, when
dealing with securities frauds and manipulation, of prompt and preventative action. It is of little comfort to an investor to suffer loss
through a firm which is, in effect, judgment proof. The best protection of the investor is to prevent the harm before it occurs.
For these reasons it is fallacious to think of the Commission as
merely an information clearing house. It has duties which, in order
to be fully borne, must carry the Commission's work into the books,
records, practices, and financial conditions of thousands of securities
firms scattered all over the country.
The "passive" activity of the Commission-the
receipt and processing of filings-is
activity over which the Commission has no
control. It must be performed as the demand for the work arises.
The Commission cannot, for example, delay work on a registration
statement covering an issue of securities under the Securities Act of
XIII

FOREWORD

1933 without either subjecting investors to the risk that an inadequate
statement has been filed or unduly interfering with financing pro~ams.
On the other hand while the enforcement or "active" work
ill the examination of the records of securities firms by the Commission
can be rationed according to available manpower and facilities it is
no less significant to millions of investors than is the work of a superintendent of banks to depositors.
The Commission has long felt that its enforcement activities need
to be strengthened. Weare now considering streamlined procedures
of examination to increase the number of inspections, and we hope
that with additional funds we will be able to devote more manpower
to this work.
An additional development worth commenting upon is the recent
introduction by Senator Frear of S. 2408, a proposal to safeguard
investors in securities not listed on national securities exchanges. The
Securities Exchange Act contains several cardinal provisions whose
purpose it is to change blind trading into informed investment by
requiring corporate management to meet certain standards in its relations with investors. As a condition of listing its securities on a
national securities exchange the law provides that each issuer must
register and file initial and periodic information about the company
and its financial affairs; it subjects those who solicit securityholders'
proxies to the requirement that information be disclosed sufficient to
permit an intelligent exercise of the vote; it contains provisions requiring disclosure by insiders-officers, directors and large holders of
equity securities-of their holdings of equity securities of the corporation and contains provisions designed to prevent such persons from
using inside information to profit from short term trading in equity
securities of their companies. With limited exceptions these requirements do not exist with respect to securities not registered with the
Commission under the Securities Exchange Act although many of
their issuers are of substantial size and have substantial numbers of
securityholders among the public.
S. 2408 would extend to certain large companies not now registered
under the Securities Exchange Act the standards of that act relating
to filing of information, the solicitation of proxies, and trading by
corporate insiders. Not all companies would be so covered, but only
those having assets of 3 million dollars or more and 300 or more
securityholders-size
limits selected because they indicate the existence of sufficient public interest in the company to warrant the extension of these standards.
This proposal was first contained in a report to the Congress by the
Commission submitted in 1946 and entitled "A Proposal to Safeguard
Investors in Unregistered Securities." That report showed how
freedom from regulation permitted unregistered companies with large
public stockholder interests to withhold from their securityholders the
minimum information necessary for intelligent understanding of the
investors' position and informed exercise of the investors' rights.
The President endorsed this proposal and commended it to the Congress. Soon after the introduction, on August 8, 1949, of S. 2408, the
Commission undertook to bring its 1946 report up to date. Such a
revision should be ready soon.

FOREWORD

xv

The bill represents no departure from the basic philosophy of the
existing law-that the securityholder who risks his money, who is the
ultimate owner of the enterprise, is entitled to have a proper accounting
from management of its stewardship of the company's affairs-but
simply seeks to fill gaps left by piecemeal adoption of legislation
affecting securities in 1934, 1935, 1936, 1938, 1939, and 1940. The
bill would avoid the anomaly whereby the disposition of management's
fiduciary duties depends, not upon the extent of public interest in a.
given company, but upon the accident that its management at one
time listed the company's securities for trading on the exchange and
registered them under the Securities Exchange Act.
Administration of the geographical integration and corporate
simplification requirements of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act of 1935 has continued at a rapid pace. During the fiscal year
covered by this report 44 companies with assets of $1,748,878,827 were
divested by registered holding companies through compliance with
these standards. All of these companies thereby ceased to be subject
to the Holding Company Act. Divestments since December 1, 1935,
resulting in complete divorcement from jurisdiction under the Act
were thus increased to 661 companies with assets of $7,964,764,537.
Of the 2,152 companies subject at one time or another to the act, 1,510
have been eliminated through divestment, dissolution, mergers, and
other means.
In addition 206 companies with assets of $3,781,000,000 have been
divested by one or more holding companies, but remain subject to the
statute by reason of their relationship to a registered holding company.
One hundred forty-three of these companies with assets of approximately $3,355,000,000 are expected to continue under the Commission's jurisdiction indefinitely as members of systems which will
become fully integrated.
It is estimated that these integrated
systems will control from 6 to 7 billion dollars of assets.
A great deal has been accomplished under the Holding Company
Act. However, despite serious attrition in personnel the case workload today in the important categories is actually greater than it was
in 1941. Average employment in the Division of Public Utilities
had dropped from 234 in 1941 to 150 at the end of the 1949 fiscal
year. Yet, at the end of the 1941 fiscal year we had only 37 voluntary
and involuntary reorganization proceedings pending-at
the end
of the 1949 fiscal year we had 138. Total proceedings regarding
reorganization and the acquisition and sale of properties and portfolio
securities pending at the end of 1941 was 163-at the end of 1949 it
was 265. In 1941 we disposed of 192 applications and declarations
concerning financing out of 257 current for the year. During 1949
we disposed of 317 out of 434 current during the year. At the end of
1949 we had 117 of such proceedings pending, whereas at the end of
1941 we had 65.
This report is intended to inform the Congress of the activities of
the Commission. The Commission's facilities are always available
to supply further information about its work.

PART I
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES

ACT OF 1933

The purpose of the Securities Act of 1933 is to provide full and fair
disclosure and to prevent fraud in the sale of securities in interstate
and foreign commerce and through the mails. To this end, the act
requires that issuers of securities to be offered for such public sale must
file with the Commission registration statements setting forth prescribed information about the securities; that investors must be furnished, at or before delivery of the security purchased, a copy of a
required prospectus containing the more significant items of such information; and civil and criminal penalties are provided for securities
frauds. The act does not authorize the Commission to pass on the
investment merits of securities and it makes representations to the
contrary unlawful.
THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Purpose of Registration

Unless exempted from the Securities Act, securities offered for sale
in interstate commerce or by the use of the mails must be registered.
Securities for which such exemption is provided consist, in general, of
government and municipal securities and the issues of banks, railroads,
cooperatives and other organizations and associations specified in
section 3 (a) of the act or covered by exemptions in rules and regulations adopted by the Commission, as discussed elsewhere in this report,
pursuant to section 3 (b) of the act. In addition, while the act contains no exemption for securities of governmental or other foreign
issuers as such, Public Law 142, 81st Congress, approved by President
Truman on June 29, 1949, extended a specific exemption to securities
issued or guaranteed by the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development from the registration requirements of both the
Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.1
An integral part of each registration statement is the prospectus,
which sets forth the more pertinent information about the security
offering. As a basic method of direct disclosure to investors, the prospectus plays a vital role in carrying out the purpose of the act.
The registration statement as a whole discloses material facts dealing, among other things, with the character, size, and profitableness of
the business, its capital structure, the uses to which the company
intends to put the proceeds realized from the sale of the securities,
options outstanding against securities of the issuer, remuneration of
officers and directors, bonus and profit-sharing arrangements, underwriters' commissions, and pending and threatened legal proceedings.
There must also be included in this document certified financial statements of the business enterprise.
I For comments of the ColIJJIl!llslonmade upon the proposal to exempt Issues of the World Bank, eee Jetter
from CbaIrman Hanrahan incorporated in Senate Report No. 504and House Report No. 70S,to accompany
B. 1664and H. R. 4332,respectively, Sist Cong.• 1st sass'l calling attention to the fact that the provlslons of
these acts prohibiting outright fraud are applicable to 'exempted securities," and under this enactment
would continue to be applicable to securities issued or guaranteed by the World Bank.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The information contained in registration statements filed with the
Commission is not only made available immediately for public inspection at the offices of the Commission but also forms the basis of widespread publicity released by financial news services, financial writers,
and newspapers throughout the nation, which further accelerates the
process of getting this information rapidly before a greatly enlarged
field of potential investors.
Recently, therelJ1as been a marked trend, encouraged by the Commission, toward use of smaller prospectuses than had commonly been
customary. As a result, in place of the cumbersome and somewhat
formidable document, printed on a heavy stock of legal-size paper,
which was commonly furnished to prospective investors during the
early years of the administration of the act, in recent years many registrants used smaller and simpler prospectuses furnishing the lay investor
with a more convenient and more readable document than heretofore.
Examination Procedures

One of the Commission's most important undertakings has been
its development of procedures and techniques, which are constantly
undergoing improvements as dictated by experience, for the fast and
thorough examination of registration statements to determine compliance with the disclosure requirements of the act. The need for
speed in the examination process arises not only from the statutory
prescription of an effective date of the registration statement, in the
ordinary case on the twentieth day after its filing, but also from the
Commission's desire to avoid unnecessary interference with financing
plans.
Where examination shows the registration statement to be inaccurate or incomplete in disclosure of material information, the Commission may resort to its power under section 8 of the act and issue
an order preventing or suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.
However, the Commission has, during the past five
years, continued its policy of exercising this power sparingly. Instead, it has relied for enforcement mainly upon the long-standing
practice of securing an amendment to the registration statement.
Accordingly, registrants are informally advised, as promptly as
possible after the statements are filed, of any material misrepresentations or omissions found upon examination and they are afforded an opportunity to file correcting amendments before the
statements become effective. This advice is furnished by means of
an informal "letter of comment" which indicates what information
should be corrected or supplemented to meet the disclosure standards.
Another informal procedure that has proved effective in speeding
the registration process is the "pre-filing conference" between stali
members and representatives of registrants and underwriters.
In
this manner registrants are encouraged to discuss problems in connection with the proposed filing for the purpose of determining in
advance what types or methods of disclosure may be necessary under
the circumstances of the particular case. Considerable use is made
of this procedure, which has contributed to the marked reduction inthe number of instances where the Commission has found it necessary
to resort to stop-order proceedings or other formal action under
section 8.

FIFTEENTH

3

AN1I.'UAL REPORT

Neither the Commission, the issuer, nor the underwriter desires a.
statement to become effective unless it complies with the act. Often,
the staff will ascertain that deficiencies exist in the registration statement as filed, or the issuer or underwriter may wish either to amend
the statement or simply to delay its effectiveness because of changes
in the securities market or for other business reasons. In such cases,
if there is a danger that the registration statement may become
effective in -
defective form or prematurely for the purposes of the
issuer or underwriter, it is customary for the registrant to file a
minor amendment, called a "delaying amendment," which starts the
20-day waiting period running anew.
Effective Date of Registration

Statem.ent

The 20-day waiting period was provided by the Congress in order
to permit widespread publicity among investors of the information
contained in the registration statement before it becomes effective.
The Commission is, however, empowered at its discretion to accelerate the effective date where the facts justify such action so that the
full 20-day period need not elapse before the registration statement
can become effective. In the exercise of this power, the Commission
must have due regard to the adequacy of the information about the
security already available to the public, to the complexity of the
particular financing, and to the public interest and the protection of
investors.
.
.
Time Required to Complete Registration Process

The Commission seeks to accomplish completion of the registration
process within the statutory 20-day waiting period, and to that end
it has enlisted the cooperation of representatives of the securities
business. Studies of the amount of time required to complete the
registration process in all-cases during the past three years show that
the median elapsed time has been shortened from 30* days in 1947
to 24~ days in 1948 and to 22}{days in the 1949 fiscal year.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

The table covers all statements processed, including those where
voluntary delays were sought for reasons extrinsic to the examination
process. The detailed figures for each month of the year show that
no more than 20 days in total elapsed time has been required to obtain
effectiveness of the typical registration statement during each of the
last four months of the year.
It will be noted from the table that the Commission has maintained a
median of 10 days between receipt of filings and staff comment on the
registration statement.
Variations in time for the total registration
process are due in large part to variations in the time taken for corrections by those who file statements and to the lapse between corrections and effectiveness. Many factors enter into the duration of the
latter period; among them are the necessity for further corrections
and variations in the time necessary for analyzing supplementally
filed amendments.

It should be noted that while the volume of bonds registered by
issuers for cash sale decreased only slightly in the 1949 fiscal year,
stock so registered showed a marked decrease.
From September 1934 through June 1948 new money purposes
represented 33 per cent of the net proceeds expected from the sale of
issues registered for the accounts of issuers. In the 1949 fiscal year
new money purposes represented 76 percent of the expected net proceeds for the year-large
enough to raise the 15-year average by 4
points to 37 percent,"
The table below shows the amount of each type of security registered for cash sale for the accounts of the issuers in each of the fiscal
years 1935 through 1949 as well as the three 5-year totals. In addition to the totals of the new issues for cash sale, all registrations are

Registrations of securities for cash sale by electric, gas, and water
companies in the 1949 fiscal year established a new high for the
group, exceeding by 8 percent the previous high established in the
1946 fiscal year and by 12 percent the amount for the 1948 fiscal
year. They accounted for two-fifths of the total for the year. Transportation and communication companies, with 24 percent of the
total, registered 41 percent less than in the 1948 fiscal year, which'
represents their peak year for the 15 years. Companies classified as
financial and investment companies and manufacturing companies
registered almost equal amounts of securities, 16 percent of the total
each, decreases of 13 and 22 percent, respectively, from the amounts
for the 1948 fiscal year. No registration statements were filed by
foreign governments for cash sale during the 1949 and 1948 fiscal
years.

This may be compared with the
$5,887,000,000 in the 1948 fiscal year, which was estimated to be
the largest amount of money ever raised in the securities markets
for new capital purposes. As between money allocated to fixed and
working capital purposes in the 1949 fiscal year, there was an increase
of $200 million in the amount for new plant and equipment expenditures, offset by a decline of 300 million dollars in proceeds for working
capital purposes. Public utility companies (including telephone) accounted for 52 percent of the new money financing, industrial and
miscellaneous firms for 38 percent, and railroad companies for 10

percent. The volume of refinancing through new issues of securities
declined further to $777,000,000, compared with $1,136,000,000 in
the 1948 fiscal year and a peak volume of $5,310,000,000 for the 1946
fiscal year." Refunding of outstanding bonds fell to $151,000,000,
the lowest amount for this purpose since the beginning of the series
in 1934. However, funds used for repayment of other debt, principally bank loans, increased and amounted to $600,000,000 as compared with $360,000,000 in the preceding fiscal year.

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER mE

4, 822

ACT

The Commission is authorized under section 3 (b) of the act to
provide, by rules and regulations, exemption from the registration
requirements for issues of securities whose aggregate offering price to
the public does not exceed $300,000.
The Commission has adopted five regulations pursuant to this
authority: Regulation A, a general exemption for small issues; regulation A-R, a special exemption for notes and bonds secured by first
liens on family dwellings; regulation A-M, a special exemption for
assessable shares of stock of mining companies; regulation B, an
exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights; and
regulation B-T, an exemption for interests in oil royalty trusts or
similar types of trusts or unincorporated associations.
The act originally imposed a maximum limit of $100,000 upon the
amount of an offering which the Commission was thus empowered to
exempt from registration until by amendment of the statute effective
May 15, 1945, this limit was raised to $300,000. Following this
amendment of the law, the Commission revised its regulation A
insofar as it applies to issuers (as distinguished from controlling
stockholders) so as to extend the general exemption from the registration requirements provided thereby up to the ceiling of $300,000.
Small offerings of securities may be made and sold to the public
pursuant to a section 3 (b) exemption on the basis of a less complete
disclosure than that required by the act in the case of a registered
security. For example, regulation A provides for the filing of a simple
letter of notification, containing limited information about the issuer
and the offering, with the appropriate regional office of the Commission, and provides further that the offering may be made five business
days thereafter.
It should be emphasized, however, that any exemption from registration permitted under section 3 (b) carries no exemption from civil
liabilities under section 12 for misstatements or omissions, or from the
criminal liabilities for fraud under section 17. For the proper enforcement of these sections, the conditions for the availability of the
exemptions provided under section 3 (b) include, with the exception
of regulation A-R, the requirement that certain minimum information
be filed with the Commission and that disclosure of certain information

be made in sales literature, if any sales literature is used. While no
prospectus need be used, selling literature must be filed in advance
of its use.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

There has been a marked increase in the amount of small financing
by means of offerings made under regulation A since the maximum
permissible amount of such an offering was tripled to $300,000 in
May, 1945. The striking character of this increase in offerings can
be noted in the following table:

The figures for the 1949 fiscal year include 127 letters of notification
covering offerings aggregating $18,355,308 of securities of companies
engaged in some phase of the oil and gas business. This represents an
increase of about 25 percent in the number and 50 percent in the
dollar amount of these particular offerings over the 1948 year.
Of 1,389 letters of notification filed in the 1949 fiscal year (omitting
three that were incomplete and subsequently withdrawn), 726 covered
proposed offerings of $100,000 or less; 276 covered offerings of more
than $100,000 and less than $200,000; and 387 covered offerings of an
amount between $200,000 and $300,000. Issuing companies made
1,238 of these offerings, stockholders made 142, and both issuers and
stockholders made the remaining 9. Commercial underwriters were
employed to handle 396 of the offerings, officers and directors or other
persons not regularly engaged in the underwriting business marketed
195, and no underwriter was used in connection with the remaining 798.
The Oommission's procedure for making an exempt offering under
regulation A is simple. All that is necessary is to file the prescribed
letter of notification and such sales literature as the offeror intends to
employ with the appropriate regional office of the Oommission five
business days before the offering is to be made. In processing by the
Commission this material is examined in the field and reviewed by the
staff at the Oommission's headquarters.
This review involves a search
for pertinent information in the Oommission's extensive files and an
examination to determine whether the exemption provided by the
regulation is applicable to the particular case and whether the information filed discloses any violation of any of the acts administered by
the Oommission. The results of this review are made available
promptly to the regional office. The Oommission also follows the
practice of cooperating with the proper local authorities in the states
in which the securities are proposed to be offered by furnishing them
significant data about the proposed offering.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A-M

During the 1949 fiscal year the Commission received and examined

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B-Oil and Gas Securities

To help deal with the special problems arising in oil and gas financing
the Commission maintains a specialized unit in its central office. This
unit not only administers regulation B but also gives technical help
and advice with regard to offerings of oil and gas securities under other
provisions and rules of the Securities Act. Where oil and gas securities are significant in the portfolio of broker-dealers undergoing inspection by the staff of the Commission, inspection reports are submitted
to this unit for advisory assistance. Last year, in addition to its
examination of 85 offering sheets filed under regulation B, this unit
was called upon to render technical advisory assistance in connection
with the examination of 127 letters of notification filed under regulation A covering securities of companies engaged in various phases of
the oil and gas business; 54 registration statements and 58 amendments
thereto; and 33 broker-dealer inspection reports.
It assisted also in
the examination of 7 applications for registration of securities on exchanges, 3 filings of proxy soliciting material, and 1 annual report on
Form I-MD, under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, all raising
some technical problem concerning oil and gas securities.
As a further means of coordinatmg its work dealing with the sale of
oil and gas securities, the Commission maintains a petroleum geologist
in Tulsa, Okla. This field officer is a source of up-to-date information
on wells and tracts located in the Mid-Continent and Coastal regions.
He not only makes examinations of actual tracts involved in specific
investigations conducted by the central or various of the regional offices
of the Commission, but also conducts a considerable amount of research
pertaining to oil and gas production and development for use of the
staff charged with examining offering sheets filed under regulation B
and sales literature filed for the information of the Commission under
regulation A.
The oil and gas unit maintains an extensive reservoir of pertinent
information about various companies and wells now consisting of
between 30,000 and 40,000 catalogued items. This information comes
generally from all the oil-producing states in the United States,
Canada, and Mexico and, in as yet a more limited way, from other
oil-producing countries throughout the world.
The Commission's examination and investigative procedures are
designed to protect investors in oil and gas securities, while saving
needless time, effort and expense for all parties concerned, by avoiding
insofar as possible any necessity to resort to Iegal proceeding.
Most
problems are disposed of directly and informally in the field before
they would mature into litigation.
During the past 5 years the Commission has participated in only
17 oil and gas investigations which have led Ultimately to court
convictions or injunctions; and there have been only 204 preliminary,
informal, and formal oil and gas investigations during this period.
As we have noted, examination of letters of notification and related
sales literature filed under regulation A is concerned with aiding the
Commission in the enforcement of section 17 of the act. Often the
information needed for such examination does not require the expense

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

13

of a field trip but merely a reference to the technical files already
catalogued by the Commission's oil and gas unit, or consultation with
experts in other agencies of the Government. In a typical case, the
Tulsa representative of the Commission, through his personal local
contacts in the industry and expert information on most producing
areas in the Mid-Contment and Rocky Mountain fields, is able to
take any action indicated before the expiration of the five business
days of waiting provided under the regulation before the securities
may be sold. Where, for example, sales literature filed with the Denver regional office appears to be misleading, that office sends a copy
immediately to the Tulsa office. If the material is found to be untrue
or misleading, a report to that effect is communicated to the originating
office before the waiting period has expired, so that the offerors may be
informed and thus enabled to correct their sales literature before it is
distributed to the public. Since sales campaigns of many of the
regulation A issues extend over a period of many months, with new
sales appeals being prepared for such issuance under the regulation
sometimes as often as once every week or 10 days, these technical
examinations and reports have become increasingly numerous and
continuous. As evidence of the growth in this particular work, it
may be noted that in the 1948 fiscal year the Tulsa Office prepared
a total of 89 technical memoranda and investigative reports, of which
20 related to sales literature filed under regulation A, whereas last
year the corresponding total had increased to 136, of which a very
much larger number, 84, related to such sales data.
The exemption from registration provided by regulation B for
fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights is limited to a maximum aggregate offering price of $100,000. Regulation B requires
that an offering sheet be filed with the Commission summarizing
pertinent information regarding the security being offered. In the
1949 fiscal year a total of 85 such offering sheets, and 76 amendments
thereto, were received and examined by the Commission. The following actions were taken on these filings:

Oonfidential written reports oj sales under regulation B.-The Commission also received and examined during the 1949 fiscal year 1,262
confidential written reports of actual sales made under regulation B
and filed on Forms I-G and 2-G, in the aggregate amount of $460,935.
The reports are required pursuant to rules 320 (a) and 322 (c) and (d)
of regulation B concerning sales made by broker-dealers to investors
and by dealers to other dealers. Where examination of these reports
indicates that a violation of the law may have occurred, the Commission makes an investigation or takes such other action as may btl
deemed appropriate.
During the past 5 years the proportion of nonproducing interests
offered for sale under regulation B has more than doubled. These

14

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

CO:MMISSION

nonprodueing interests accounted for 22 percent of total regulation B
filings in the 1945 fiscal year and for 55 percent of the total :filedlast
year in the 1949 fiscal year.
Oil and gas investigations.-Nineteen new investigations involving
oil and gas securities were instituted by the Commission in the 1949
fiscal year and 25 such cases closed. This brought the total current
during the year to 150 and the number pending at the close of the year
to 125. Most of these investigations, conducted by the regional
offices and reviewed by the technical staff of the central office, arise
out of complaints from investors to the Commission. They are undertaken primarily to determine whether the transactions in question
were effected in violation of section 5, which requires registration, and
of section 17, which prohibits fraud in securities transactions.
As a result of the evidence developed in some of these oil and gas
investigations the Commission has :filedcomplaints in the courts seeking injunctions restraining violations of the law, and has cooperated
with the Department of Justice in undertaking criminal prosecutions
where the facts warrant such action. During the 1949 year two persons were enjoined from violations of the registration provisions of the
Securities Act and another was enjoined from further violations of the
antifraud provisions of the act in the sale of oil and gas securities. In
the same period indictments were secured in two cases developed by
the staff, charging violations of these antifraud provisions, and one
defendant whose transactions had previously led to his indictment for
such offense was last year sentenced to imprisonment for 2 years.
FORMAL ACTIONS UNDER SECTION 8

The purpose of the Commission's informal procedures in processing
registration statements is to get registration statements which compl:y
with the requirements of the act before the statements become effective. In almost all cases conference and comment by letter are sufficient both for the needs of the registrant and for the adequate protection of investors. It is sometimes necessary, however, for the Oom-:
mission to exercise its powers under section 8 in order to prevent a
registration statement from becoming effective in deficient or misleading form or to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement
which has already become effective.
Under section 8 (b) the Commission may institute proceedings to
determine whether it should issue an order to prevent a registration
statement from becoming effective. Such proceedings are authorized
if the registration statement as :filedis on its face inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. Under section 8 (d) proceedings may
be instituted at any time to determine whether the Commission should
issue a stop-order to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement if it appears to the Commission that the registration statement
includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated or otherwise necessary to make the
statements included not misleading. Under section 8 (e) the Com-.
mission may make an examination to determine whether to issue a
stop-order under section 8 (d).
Examinations under section 8 (e) may be held in public, or the
record may be made public after the close of the hearing. However,

to insure that no injury shall be done to a registrant by means of bad
publicity if the examination should reveal no violation of the law, the
Commission makes it a practice to hold such examinations preliminarily in private. On the other hand, all stop-order proceedings
under section 8 (d) are held in public.
Examinations under Section 8 (e)

At the beginning of the past year one private examination under
section 8 (e) was pending and three were authorized during the year.
The examinations were discontinued and the registration statements
withdrawn in two cases and stop-order proceedings were authorized
in a third case. The registration statement was withdrawn and the
record of examination was made public in the fourth case, described
below:
The First Guardian Securities (Iorporaiion-e-File No. 2-7554.-The
company filed a registration statement proposing the sale of nearly
$2,000,000 of preferred and common stocks. The information contained in the registration statement indicated a willful attempt to distort descriptions of both the business of the company and the background of the company's promoters, who were also its principal officers
and stockholders.
The prospectus stated: (1) That the company would deal in securities for the purpose of investment and trading and that funds not so
used would, up to 50 percent of the company's assets, be used for
making collateral or factoring loans or for any other types of profitable
opportunities; (2) that during its period of operations the company
had invested its money principally in collateral loans and had, in one
case, charged the borrower a factoring rate of 2 percent a month,
implying that this was the maximum rate; (3) that the management
planned to operate the company in such manner as to enable it to
qualify under section 361 of the United States Internal Revenue Code
as a regulated investment company, which would entitle it to certain
tax benefits; (4) that the company intended to pay a dividend on
Common Stock of 20 cents per quarter and that initially the dividend
would be paid from capital surplus; and (5) that the company did not
intend to invest in real estate.
The prospectus also sought to convey the impression that the promoters had extensive business experience. In describing their experience, the prospectus stated that "after successfully accumulating
sufficient capital" they "organized a distributing agency for soft
beverages during 1929;" that "they subsequently organized" a company "for the manufacture of textiles and integrated products from
the raw yarn through a nationwide retail distribution;" and that
"during 1943 and 1944 they liquidated their operations in the textile
field and principally engaged in trading and investing in stocks, bonds
and debentures for their own account and for the account of the
members of their immediate family."
Investigation disclosed that the registration statement was in fact
false and misleading. For example, the investigation disclosed that,
contrary to the statements contained in the prospectus: (1) The policy
of the registrant would be to place its monies primarily in collateral
loans, which would be generally secured by non-liquid collateral such
862946-liO---S

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

as second mortgages on real estate, personal endorsements, chattel
mortgages and shares of stock of privately owned corporations, and
that the promoters had little experience in making such loans; (2) the
company received fees and interest on collateral loans at rates as high
as 12 percent a month; (3) the normal operations of the company
would be such that it could not claim the tax benefits made available
by section 361 of the Internal Revenue Code; (4) assuming that it sold
all of the shares of stock offered, the company could not meet its stated
dividend policy of 20 cents a quarter on the common stock payable
out of earnings unless gross earnings were at least 15 percent on its
capital, and that by reason of the asset coverage required with respect
to the preferred stock by provisions of the Investment Company Act
it could not pay such dividend out of capital surplus for more than 2
years at the most; and (5) the company did in fact intend to invest in
real estate. Furthermore, the investigation disclosed that the financial statements included in the registration statement were certified
by an accountant who owned shares of stock of the company during
part of the period covered by the audit. The independence of the
accountant was questioned for this reason.
Regarding the experience of the promoters, the investigation disclosed that the beverage business in which they had engaged consisted
of the sale of soft drinks to factory workers when they were still no
more than 13 years of age. The company which was engaged in the
business of "manufacturing textiles and integrated products from the
raw yarn through a nationwide retail distribution" was in fact a small
enterprise engaged for the most part in the business of selling ladies'
blouses. The reference to their trading in securities was no less misleading. It sought to convey the impression that they had experience
in trading in securities but did not show the results of their experience.
The investigation disclosed that during the period referred to in the
prospectus the promoters traded extensively in securities and suffered
a net loss as a result of their operations.
Subsequent to the investigation the Commission granted the company's request to withdraw the registration statement.
At the same
time the Commission ordered that the investigation pursuant to section 8 (e) be made public.
Stop-Order Proceedings under Section 8 (d)

Three stop-order proceedings were authorized in the 1949 fiscal
year and public hearings were held in the cases during the year. In
one case the registration statement was withdrawn and the proceedings
dismissed. The remaining two cases were pending as of the close of
the year.
American Oil Explorers Inc.-File No. 2-7886.-This
company,
newly organized for the purpose of engaging in speculative oil exploration, filed a registration statement on March 17, 1949, covering
5,000,000 shares of its I-oent par value common stock to be offered to
the public at a purported price of $1 per share, for an aggregate of
$5,000,000. At the time the registration statement was filed the company's entire capital amounted to $1,000. Each purchaser of stock
was to receive a paid-up life insurance policy in an amount equal to
the price of the total number of shares purchased by each shareholder,
but not less than $250 nor more than $2,000 for anyone investor.

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

17

Such policy was to be purchased by the company from a specified
insurance company for a single stated premium, the amount of which
would vary with the age of the particular investor.
On April 5, 1949, the Commission ordered the institution of stoporder proceedings under section 8(d), alleging misstatements and
omissions to state material facts in regard to numerous items of required information. Issue was taken, among other things, with the
misleading nature of the proposed offering which combined life insurance and' a speculative stock in one package. The company
represented in the prospectus that by applying a major part of the
proceeds from the sale of the issue to the purchase of fully paid-up
life insurance having a face amount equal to the sum paid by investors,
the scheme would provide investors with long-range protection against
loss of the capital invested in the speculative program of oil exploration. The Commission attacked this deliberate attempt to imply the
absence of risk in an investment in this highly speculative venture,
since life insurance alone could have been bought elsewhere for the
same or a lower premium without the need of subjecting a substantial
amount of additional money to the hazards of the promoters' enterprise.
A second issue raised was the legality of a combined offering of life
insurance with stock under pertinent State law. Additional issues
included: (1) The accuracy and adequacy of the disclosures regarding
the insurance company; (2) the failure to disclose properly the relationship between the registrant and another company, controlled by
the registrant's promoters, which was to provide management advisory services; (3) the nature of the emoluments the promoters
would receive through such arrangement; and (4) the failure to state
that the price of the shares would vary as between investors by reason
of the fact that a portion of the amount paid in, variable with the age
of each investor, was to be invested in life insurance, and the resulting
balance, representing the actual price of the stock, would differ materially for different purchasers.
After the Commission's order for a public hearing was issued, the
registrant filed a request for withdrawal of its registration statement
and no sale or offering of the securities was made. The request was
granted by the Commission on April 19, 1949.
DEFICIENCIES DISCOVERED IN EXAMINATION OF
REGISTRATION STATEMENTS

The examination of registration statements during the waiting
period brings to light many deficiencies in the registration statements
which would, if undiscovered, be published and furnished to investors.
These are sometimes corrected; often they are of such material
character that the statements are withdrawn on discovery of the
deficiency. The following are examples of deficiencies discovered in
examination of registration statements.
Failure to Disclose Interest of Parent Company

A company operating a chain of restaurants filed a registration
sta.tement for 120,000 shares of convertible preferred stock, $1 par
value. Thirty-two thousand two hundred and fourteen of the shares

18

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

were to have been offered, by way of exchange, to the holders of the
company's then outstanding $6 cumulative preferred stock, on a
share-for-share basis, and the remaining 87,786 shares were to have
been offered to the company's stockholders and to the public at $15
per share. The old preferred had a $100 liquidating preference and
carried, as indicated, a $6 cumulative dividend rate. Dividend arrearages amounted to $95 per share. The new preferred stock to have been
offered in the share-for-share exchange had a par value of $1 per
share, a $30 liquidating preference and a cumulative dividend rate of
$1.50. The registration statement failed to disclose adequately the
rights which the old preferred stockholders would give up and the
rights which they would receive if they accepted the exchange offer.
Although there was no equity for the common stock of the company
the exchange of old preferred stock for the new preferred stock would
create an equity for the common stock through the reduction in the
liquidating preference and the elimination of dividend arrearages.
No disclosure was made in the registration statement as to the benefits
which would thereby'accrue to the company's parent, which held 45
percent of the common stock.
In conferences with counsel for the company the staff pointed out
these inadequacies of the registration statement.
It developed in
these conferences that the fair or current value of the companv's
property, plant. and equipment, carried on the books of the company
at a depreciated value of $3,478,301, wad very substantially less than
the books indicated, and that if the land, buildings, and equipment
were offered for "ale, these assets would probably yield less than
$1,000,000. Shortly after these conferences the company withdrew
the registration statement upon the grounds that the company's
restaurants had been leased to another company and that the plan
of financing was no longer necessary,
Expenses Paid by Company to Accommodate Selling Stockholders

A manufacturer of metal roofing filed a registration statement
covering an offering of 30,000 issued shares of the company's $1 par
value common stock to be sold to employees at $10 per share. Although the stock was owned by and to be offered in behalf of three
of the company's principal officers, who were also directors and
controlling stockholders of the company, the entire cost of financing
purchases under this employee stock purchase plan was to be borne
!>yo the company as an accommodation to these seIling stockholders.
Thus it was disclosed in the registration statement as originally filed
that purchases would be financed with loans from two local banks,
and that the company would not only pay interest charges on the
installment notes securing such loans but also the cost of insuring
the loans, while providing in addition a special cash deposit in the
banks for the purpose of guaranteeing all loans made. This participation by the company assured immediate payment to the seIling
stockholders.
This method of financing prompted serious questions on the part
of the Commission's examining staff concerning not only the legality
of the banks' participation therein but also whether the assumption
of such expenses and guarantees by the company would constitute
ultra vires acts as to which issues no disclosure was made in the regis-

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

19

tration statement.
Subsequently, the registration statement was
amended to indicate that the banks had entirely withdrawn from
participation in the offering, that the company's participation therein
was limited to periodic pay-roll deductions for payment of the shares
purchased by the employees, and that the company's expenses in
connection with the offering were confined to the cost of stock certificates and transfer fees.
Failure to Disclose Cease and Desist Orders

A company, owning a gold-mining property which had been developed by a predecessor, filed with its registration statement a prospectus in which it was represented that the property was then in
condition for operation except for minor installations of mill equipment. An estimate of ore reserves in excess of 400,000 tom, as set
forth in the prospectus, served to round out the registrant's picture
of a mine about ready for productive operations. The ore reserve
estimate rested on a three-page report by the company's mine manager. It was readily apparent upon examination, however, that this
report gave no evidence that its ore estimate was based on an adequate
sampling of the mine. On the contrary, it indicated an insufficient
sampling. The prospectus omitted all discussion of this vitally
important question of sufficiency of the samJ.llin~ as a basis for the
ore reserve estimate. It failed to show the following significant facts:
(1) The predecessor company, after having finished substantially all
development work done at the property and after a thorough sampling
of the mine, concluded it had no ore reserves in its mine and that the
mine did not justify an~urther
expenditures; and (2) an extensive
program of check-sampli 0' by the company filing the registration
statement gave results mai y consistent with those of the predecessor.
After the deficient character of the registration statement was called
to the attention of the company, a conference was arranged during
which the inadequacies of the statement were discussed by the examining staff with a representative of the company. Thereafter the company elected to abandon its proposed public offering and withdrew
its registration statement.
Wliile the process of examination was under way, the Commission's
staff discovered from sources of information independent of the registration statement that numerous cease and desist orders forbiddmg
the sale of the registrant's securities were then in effect in several
States, and it was pointed out to the registrant that disclosure of the
existence of these orders would need to be included in the registration
statement in order to make it not misleading to the public. The
registrant's request for withdrawal was stated to have been made in
view of the existence of these orders.
Preferred Position of Insiders

. A company filed a registration statement covering the public offermg of stock of the company. Some of the stock was to be offered by
the -
company and the balance by company insiders-officers of the
company and persons closely associated with them. Some of the
stock to be offered by the insiders had been acquired through the
exercise of options. These options had been obtained by an individual
closely associated with the company management.

20

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

When the registration statement was filed it was examined by the
staff_:m the ordinary course. Such examination disclosed the necessityffor ascertaining further facts concerning the acquisition of the
options. Upon ,ljnquiry, it was ldiscovered that in~~cquiring the options financial statements were used which did ;not reflect then current
earnings, which had substantially improved over .those shown. The
last purchases of options were made shortly before the close of the
company's 1948 fiscal year, when new financial statements would have
become available disclosing that earnings for that year had increased
to about three times over earnings for the prior year. The stock
obtained through exercise 'of the options was to be resold to the
public at a price greatly in excess of the option price paid.
The company thereafter elected to withdraw its registration statement, giving as its reason the then condition of the securities market.
Liability for Pensions not Disclosed

A registration statement was filed by a gas company which, with
its subsidiaries, had guaranteed annuities for life to certain former
employees who had retired and to others who were eligible to retire.
Annual payments to those retired were charged to profit and loss only
when made. However, the issuer did not carry any liability in its
balance sheet for the estimated amount of the cost of future payments
of annuities for past services in the financial statements originally
filed in connection with its public offering of securities. Following
discussions held between the Commission's staff, representatives of
the issuer, and the certifying accountants in the course of the examination of this registration statement, an actuarial study was made to
ascertain the estimated liability representing the cost of these annuities. This cost was found to approximate $1,500,000 and was
consequently so recorded on the balance sheet as a liability, with a
corresponding reduction of earned surplus.
Overstatement of Inventories and Understatement

of Losses

A registration statement filed by an aircraft producer preparatory
to a public offering of debentures contained financial statements
which indicated that the operating loss for the accounting period
covered amounted to $783,000. As a result of inquiry, it was found
by the staff that materials and parts inventories and work in process
inventories were greatly overstated. At the same time it was discovered that realizable values from the sales of goods in the regular
course of business were, on the other hand, substantially less than
the actual cost of materials and other expenses of manufacture.
The staff also ascertained that manufacturing costs used in determining operating results were based on standard costs which had not
been properly adjusted to reflect substantially higher actual costs.
Under the circumstances, appropriate adjustments were required to
be made in the financial statements in order that they would not be
misleading, as a result of which the amount of operating losses,
originally reported as $783,000, was shown to be $2,000,000, and
carrying values of inventories shown on the balance sheet were
commensurately reduced. Subsequently the registration statement
was withdrawn.

FIFTEENTH

Write-up of Fixed Assets

A company engaged in the construction business filed a registration
statement which included a consolidated balance sheet reflecting fixed
assets in a gross carrying amount of approximately $11,000,000 and
showing a net worth of $2,180,000. In the course of the staff's examination of the financial statements conferences Were held with representatives of the issuer and it was ascertained that during 1928 certain
land had been acquired in an arm's-length transaction and reflected
on the books of a subsidiary at cost. The issuer constructed a building
on this land which was completed in the early part of 1929. Shortly
after the completion of the building negotiations were entered into
with underwriters for the sale of securities and the underwriters, in
negotiating the price and amount of the public offering, assigned a
value to the land and buildings which was $4,507,000 in excess of cost.
The issuer wrote up the fixed assets and assigned the entire amount of
the write-up to land.
At the suggestion of the Commission's staff, a pro-forma consolidated balance sheet was included reflecting the consolidated financial
condition of the company based on cost of fixed assets, which the
Commission considers to be the proper accounting basis for carrying
fixed assets. This accounting adjustment brought about while the
registration statement was in process of examination resulted in a
reduction of the asset value of land from $7,400,000 to $3,000,000,
and the substitution of a deficit of $2,900,000 for a previously shown
surplus of $1,600,000.
The original prospectus included a representation that the net book
value of the common stock was $4.36 per share. This representation
was revised to indicate further that the common stock had no net
book value on the basis of using cost in accounting for fixed assets.
Effect of Additional Depreciation and Taxes on Earning Power

One company filed a registration statement in connection with the
proposed sale of equity securities, the principal purpose of which was
to acquire certain assets of a partnership and certain real estate from
the partners.
The amount to be paid for the partnership assets
exceeded the amount at which they were carried on the partnership
books, the excess being related to depreciable property.
The prospectus included a summary of earnings of the partnership
for the 10~ years ended June 30,1947. The staff pointed out that the
summary of partnership income did not properly show the earning
power of the assets to be acquired as recognition was not given to the
additional depreciation charge resulting from the excess payment for
property, nor to income taxes which would have been incurred had the
partnership been operated as a corporation. As amended, the summary of earnings showed for each period the effect of additional
depreciation and of income taxes computed on a pro-forma basis of
rates ap plicable to corporations.
The significance of the added information thus disclosed may be
appraised in the light of the following differences: The highest net
income of the partnership during the 1O~years covered in the summary
was $171,067.06 in 1943. Additional depreciation of $45,000 and
corporate Federal income taxes of $46,000 would have reduced such

22

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

income to $80,067.06. Further, in 4 years in which there were profits
on the partnership basis there would have been losses on the pro-forma
basis. In respect of the latest period, the 6 months ended June 30,
1947, profits shown for the partnership of $111,648.92 become
$55,148.92 on the corporation basis, a reduction of approximately
50 percent.
Good Will Amortized

An issuer, engaged primarily in the manufacture and sale of milk
products, acquired, through merger, the facilities and business of
another company engaged in a like business. The purchase price
substantially exceeded the net assets as reflected on the acquired
company's books. This excess, together with certain other transactions, gave rise to an item of approximately $1,300,000 in the consolidated balance sheet which was shown as good will. It was indicated, in a prospectus :filed by the issuer in connection with a public
offering of equity securities, that the good will balance was not being
amortized. It was pointed out to representatives of the issuer that
this good will appeared to represent, in effect, the cost of additional
earnings which should be amortized against the realization of such
earnings in order to make future statements of earnings meaningful.
The issuer revised its prospectus to reflect the adoption of an amortization policy for its item of good will over a period of 15 years.
Sale of Stock at Different Prices

A foreign gold mining company filed a registration statement for
500,000 shares of common stock, $1 par value, to be offered at $1 per
share. This company and its three predecessors (all controlled by
the same promoter) despite sporadic efforts over a period of 30 years
had been unsuccessful in their efforts to find a commercial body of ore.
Following the filing of the statement a conference was had with the
company's promoter and his counsel. At this conference the staff was
informed that the stock was currently obtainable and had been sold
in the foreign country at 50 cents per share, a fact not disclosed in the
registration statement.
It was also learned that the company's
immediate predecessor had been denied the right to sell securities by
a large number of States in this country and that the promoter had
been refused a broker's license by the appropriate authorities in his
own country. The registration statement was silent as to these
matters.
The information given with respect to the development of the mining
property and its prospects was inadequate and misleading. For
example, it was stated in the prospectus that in 1918 a It * * * kidney
of concentrated free gold * * *" was found on the property which
was said to be "two feet long, ten inches wide, and about two feet
deep" and to be practically solid gold." This gold would have had a
value of over $1,000,000 at the gold price prevailing in 1918. Since
governmental reports of gold production for the area in which the
property is located showed no gold production for the year- 1918 or
for a number of succeeding years, inquiry was made as to the issuer's
basis for the representation.
No supporting evidence was presented.'!

FIFTEENTH

REPORT

23

Upon being advised of the serious nature and extent of the deficiencies existing in the registration statement, the company withdrew the
statement.
Promoter's Profit in Cooperative

A cooperative apartment corporation filed a registration statement
in connection with an offering of common stock wholly owned by
the sponsor of the enterprise, the stock to be purchased in conjunction
with the issuance to each purchaser of a proprietary lease on an apartment. The estimated profit accruing to the sponsor was not disclosed in the registration statement originally filed. At the suggestion
of the Commission the prospectus was amended to reveal that the cost
of the building and related charges was estimated at $550,000, for
which the purchasers were paying $700,000 ($400,000 in stock and
$300,000 first mortgage) resulting in a profit to the sponsor of $150,000.
Disclosure of Financial Position

.An electrical products manufacturing corporation filed a registration statement covering 270,000 shares of its common stock. Some
time prior to the date of filing the company reported to its stockholders a net loss of $724,000 for the 6-month period ended October
31, 1948. However, the certified financial data included in the proposed form of prospectus pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act indicated a net loss of $3,108,000 for that period. The
greater loss disclosed in the prospectus was due to additional inventory write-downs and reserves of $1,765,000, a further reserve of
$396,000 against possible loss on an investment in an affiliated company, and other audit adjustments of $223,000.
The principal deficiency in respect of the financial statements
related to inventories, which at October 31, 1948, after deducting a
reserve of $2,200,000, represented over 42 percent of total assets and
64 percent of total current assets.
The prospectus and the report of a management consultant retained
by the corporation showed that the corporation was carrying excess
inventories, the discontinuance of certain product lines, and reflected
absolescence and faults in products. Further, the prospectus stated
there was general inefficiency in purchasing, production, shipping, and
warehousing.
The amounts stated in the balance sheet for inventories were
based upon book records. The accountants in their certificates
stated: "* * * such continuous records of quantities as are maintained by the Corporation with respect to certain portions of the
inventories are not integrated in monetary amounts with the general
accounting records. * * *" They also stated: "Assuming use
and realization of the inventories in the regular course of business, we
have no reason to believe that the inventory amounts at October 31,
1948, have not been fairly stated."
Inventories had been written
down by $1,268,700 during the year ended April 30, 1948, and by
$1,700,967 during the 6 months ended October 31, 1948.
The Commission's letter of comment set forth that, in view of the
statements in the prospectus and elsewhere in respect of the inventories, it did not appear that reliable and dependable financial statements could be prepared in the absence of a physical inventory as of
the balance sheet date and questioned whether the accountants had

24

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

followed generally accepted auditing procedures under the circumstances. This failure to take a physical inventory raised the serious
question of whether the amount of inventories, and of the writedowns made therein, had been properly determined.
During the pendency of the registration statement the Federal
Government attached the company's property because of a default
in the payment of income taxes. Also the Reconstruction Finance
Corporation imposed conditions with regard to a proposed mortgageloan to which the company could not agree. The registration statement was subsequently withdrawn after the negotiation of an agreement for the sale of the company to another company.
The filing of the registration statement, which was immediately
made public by the Commission pursuant to the statute, instantly
gave rise to widespread publicity released by financial news services,
financial writers and newspapers generally. The loss for the accounting period, as disclosed in the registration statement, was a matter of
public record the moment it was filed, and it was immediately reported
in the public press and in the various financial news services. Trading
in the stock was suspended for 1 hour by the authorities of the exchange on which the security was listed so as to give investors an
opportunity to consider a statement by the company's president concerning the revised figures shown in the prospectus.
Comparative Investment Positions of Public and Promoters

In order to disclose clearly certain essential features of a proposed
offering, particularly the contributions made and benefits received
by promoters, the staff of the Commission requested that certain
information be presented in tabular form by a registrant engaged in
the manufacture and sale of an electrical product. The relative
amounts of cash contributed by the public and by the promoters and
their respective voting power and shares in the dividends were set
forth in the prospectus, pursuant to this request, in a simple table.
This table disclosed that, assuming all the stock were sold, the
promotors would have 50 percent of the voting power for an investment of $2,500-less than 1 percent of the total capital investment in
the company-whereas the price to the public of a similar 50 percent
of the voting power would be $480,000. In addition, in case the
registrant should be able to pay dividends of $80,000 or more a year,
public investors could get a maximum of only $16,000 a year more
than the promoters.
The registration statement was subsequently withdrawn, and the
company elected to make an offering of a reduced number of shares
under the exemption from registration provided by regulation A.
However, disclosure similar in form to that described above, adjusted
principally to the smaller amount of offering involved, was continued
in the company's offering circular filed under regulation A.
In addition, the relative position of this company's class A stockholders was greatly improved by a change in their dividend rights
effected while the registration statement as originally filed was undergoing examination. The original filing covered a proposed offering
of class A stock. At that time the registrant had outstanding class
B stock, all of which was owned by promoters. The class A stock
was stated to have a noncumulative dividend preference of 30 cents

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

25

per share. After the payment of 30 cents on the class A stock the
class B stock was entitled to 20 cents per share, and thereafter the
two classes were to share equally in dividends. The registrant was
requested to point out in the prospectus that because of the noncumulative feature of the class A stock and the promoters' ownership
of class B stock it was within the latters' power and interest to withhold dividends on the class A stock until such time as earnings had
accumulated to the point the registrant could pay 20 cents a share
on the class B stock as well as 30 cents a share on the class A stock.
By amendment then filed the registrant disclosed it had changed its
class A stock to make it cumulative.
CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS

During the past 5 years the Commission has continued its longestablished policy of revising its rules, regulations, and forms whenever it has appeared that such action was necessary for the protection
of investors or to meet changing business conditions. This flexibility is intended to simplify compliance with the statute in the most
practicable manner for different classes of issuers and securities with
distinctive problems peculiar to the class. Changes may be made
as a result of recommendations by the staff, or at the suggestion of
persons who must comply with the requirements of the statute.
In either case, no material change is made without a series of conferences with persons interested or who may be affected by such
change. Some outstanding changes made during the past 5 years
in the rules, regulations, and forms under the Securities Act of 1933
are summarized below.
Rules Relating to Exemptions

For a summary review of changes in sizes of offerings exempted
from registration by Commission rules see discussion, above, of
exemptions under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act.
Amendment of Rules Relating to Registration

Rule lSl-The
Red-Herring Prospectus.-Rule 131 was adopted by
the Commission on December 5, 1946. Its purpose is to facilitate
the dissemination of information about a security before the registration statement for such security becomes effective. It provides that
the sending or giving to any person before a registration statement
becomes effective of a copy of the proposed form of prospectus filed
as a part of the registration statement shall not, in itself, constitute
an "offer to sell," "offer for sale," "attempt or offer to dispose of,"
or "solicitation of an offer to buy ," withinjthe meaning of section 2 (3)
of the act, if the proposed form of prospectus contains substantially
the information required by the act and the rules and regulations
thereunder to be included in a prospectus for registered securities, or
substantially that information with certain specified exceptions. The
rule was adopted for a trial period of 6 months and the Commission
later announced that it would be continued in effect indefinitely.
The copy of the prospectus so distributed is the so-called red-herring
prospectus.
Regulation O.-Qn June 9, 1947, the Commission adopted a complete revision of regulation C, which contains general requirements

26

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

governing the preparation, form, contents, and filing of registration
statements and prospectuses.
The purpose of the revision was to
simplify the registration procedure and conform the requirements of
the rule to present day needs.
On November 10, 1948, the Commission added rule 431 to regulation C. This rule, designed to avoid the necessity of dual prospectuses
in certain cases, provides that in sales of securities by an issuer to its
existing stockholders a prospectus may consist of a copy of the
proposed form of prospectus meeting the requirements of rule 131
plus a document containin~ such additional information that both
together contain all of the mformation required to be included in a
prospectus for registered securities. Under this rule most of the
information required to be included in a prospectus may be sent to
stockholders prior to the effective date of the registration statement.
Upon the effectiveness of the registration statement the document
is sent to stockholders incorporating the previous information by
reference and containing such additional information as to price arid
related matters as is necessary to constitute a statutory prospectus.
An1endment of Forms for Registration

Revision oj Form S-t.-The
most important of the Commission's
forms for registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933 is
Form 8-1. On January 8, 1947, a revised and simplified Form 8-1
was adopted and two predecessor forms, A-I and A-2, were rescinded.
Another predecessor form, Form E-l, was later rescinded.
Further
items of Form 8-1 calling for information about remuneration of
company officials were further amended on December 17, 1948, to
reduce the number of persons whose individual remuneration must be
disclosed.
Revision of Form S-2.-Form 8-2 is used for the registration of
securities of certain newly organized companies and other companies
which are still in the promotional or development stage. It was
revised so as to simplify considerably the requirements of the form.
At the same time it superseded Form 8-12, which was concurrently
rescinded.
Forms 8-4 and S-5.-Minor
amendments to these forms were
adopted recently on March 1, 1949. These amendments merely
corrected certain references which required clarification because of
other changes in the rules and regulations.
Form S-7.-With
the organization of the International Bank: for
Reconstruction and Development (the so-called World Bank) it became necessary to adopt a form for the registration of security issues
offered by the bank. Accordingly, Form 8-7 was adopted for this
purpose on July 8, 1947. This form followed the pattern of Form
8:-1 and other forms adopted under the act except that the requirements were adapted to the particular organization and functions of
the bank, The Eighty-first Congress amended the Bretton Woods
Agreements Act so as to exempt securities issued and securities guaranteed as to both principal and interest by the bank: from the registration provisions of the act. Therefore, registration by the bank of such
securities is no longer required.
However, this amendment to the
Bretton Woods Agreements Act requires the bank to file with the Commission such annual and other reports with regard to such securities as

FIFTEENTH

27

ANNUAL REPORT

the Commission shall determine to be appropriate in view of the special
character of the bank and its operations and necessary in the public
interest or for the protection of investors.
Form S-l1.-When
regulation A-M was adopted on March 24,
1945, the Commission concurrently adopted Form 8-11 for the registration of shares of exploratory mining corporations. This form is for
the use of mining corporations that are not engaged in active ore
production and have no mining property developed beyond the exploratory stage. Its use is limited to corporations that have not been
involved in recent successions and are without important subsidiaries.
It dispenses WIth the requirement for the certification of financial
statements by independent accountants since the type of corporation
eligible to use the form will generally have had few financial transactions.
LITIGATION UNDER TIlE SECURITIES ACT
Whenever it appears that any person has violated or is about to
violate any of the provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Commission IS authorized to bring an action to enjoin such violations. Such
injunction actions, which are prophylactic in character, constituted
the major portion of the litigation arising under the act during the
past 5 years. A very considerable part of the injunctions which have
been issued were directed against violations of sections 5 and 17.
Section 5 requires all securities offered to the public other than those
specifically exempted by the statute to be registered with the Commission. Section 17 makes unlawful the use of fraud in the sale of
securities.
The attempts to circumvent those sections assume many forms, some
of which are patterned upon schemes recurring in substantially the
same form year after year," and some of which involve new devices.
One of the most ingenious sought to capitalize upon the public's
general familiarity, as a result of the war bond drives, with the soundness and safety of government bonds as an investment.
This
familiarity was used by promoters of some highly speculative enterprises to obtain capital for their ventures without a full disclosure of
the risks involved. Thus, investors were told that their investment
would be guaranteed by the government and 75 percent of the funds
involved were actually used to purchase government bonds, which
would at maturity have a face value equal to 100 percent of the stockholder's investment, thereby "insuring" this investment. The promoters would then use the other 25 percent of the investment for the
particular speculation in mind-without
disclosing this fact. The
Commission w as successful in obtaining injunctions against such
practices. 13
In order to avoid the scrutiny which accompanies registration
under the act, the promoters of some companies have disregarded the
requirement of registration. Accordingly, actions instituted by the
Commission to enforce the act in the sale of securities often involve
violations of both sections 5 and 17. The industries in which fraud
IS Of these, the so-called "Ponzl"
scheme, Is perhaps the most common. Under It, the promoter psys
:bulous returns to Inv, stors by using the prlnclpsl fund to psy Interest. See 8. E. C. v. Mall (Civil No 613•

is attempted in the sale of securities vary. A substantial proportion
of injunctions under the act have related to the sale of mining securities."
Other actions instituted by the Commission have forced compliance
with sections 5 and 17 of the act primarily with respect to the financing of oil wells," gas wells," and various alleged inventions or patents."
Although unscrupulous persons may practice fraud in the sale of
securities of almost any business, these types of enterprises are
often selected. The misrepresentations
may include exaggeration
of the prospects of the company being exploited, false claims of recommendations by Government agencies," and omissions to state material facts concerning the portion of the proceeds of each sale which
is to be used for the private purposes of a promoter."
An injunction was granted by the district court in almost every
action under the act in which the Commission sought injunction
relief during the past 5 years. In one case, S. E. O. v. W. J. Howey
00.,211 the district court refused to grant the injunction, was sustained
by the Court of Appeals, and the Supreme Court granted certiorari.
The Commission took the position that the sale of acreage which was
part of a large citrus grove, when coupled with the offer of a contract
to harvest and sell the fruit, constituted the sale of a security within
the meaning of section 2 of the act. The Supreme Court so held,
reversing the lower courts.
This decision approved the position consistently taken by the Commission that whenever a purchaser has no intention of assuming any
control of the property purchased, but is really buying only an interest
in a business enterprise and looks solely to the efforts of the promoter
to earn a profit for him, there is involved the purchase of a security.
Misrepresentations
or fraudulent conduct in the course of such purchase, or the failure to register the security being sold when registration
is necessary, furnish the basis for an injunction.
The success achieved
by the Commission in these cases is due, to some extent, to the care
with which complaints are investigated.
The Securities Act, like the other statutes administered by the
Commission, authorizes the Commission, pursuant either to a complaint or on its own initiative, to conduct investigations for the purpose
of determining whether any provision of the act has been or is about
to be violated.
For the purpose of such investigations the Commission, or any officer designed by it, is empowered to administer oaths,
subpena witnesses, or to require the production of records deemed
relevant or material to the inquiry.
Information disclosed in such
investigations often serves as the basis for formal hearings conducted
by the Commission, for injunction actions, or for references to the
Department of Justice to institute criminal proceedings.

Considerable litigation has arisen out of refusals to appear in
response to Commission subpenas. Usually, opposition to the subpena is short-lived," for it is now well established that compliance
should be prompt, and an appeal taken for purposes of delay will be
dismissed." Moreover, where the defendant continues his refusal to
comply with the subpena in spite of a court order, the court is required
to enter a decree that will coerce the production of the material named
in the subpena. In the Penfield case, where a district court order
obtained by the Commission enforcing a subpena duces tecum was
ignored the Commission initiated contempt proceedings. The district
court then merely ordered defendant to "pay a fine of $50, and stand
committed until paid." Since this order did not enable the Commission to obtain access to the documents it had sought to subpena, an
appeal was taken. The Court of Appeals reversed, ordering the entry
of a coercive decree, and the Supreme Court affirmed the action of
the Court of Appeals."
In only one case during the past 5 years has a petition been filed
for review of a Commission order entered pursuant to the Securities
Act. In that case, petitioner sought to review a so-called order of
the Commission consenting to the filing of amendments to a registration statement as of an earlier date and thus, by the automatic operation of section 8 (a) of the act, accelerating the effective date of the
registration statement.
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit
dismissed the petition for review on the ground, inter alia, that the
action of the Commission was not reviewable."

ADMINISTRATION

OF TIIE SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE

ACT

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to eliminate fraud,
manipulation, and other abuses in the trading of securities both on
the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, which
together constitute the Nation's facilities for trading in securities; to
make available to the public information regarding the condition of
corporations whose securities are listed on any national securities
exchange; and to regulate the use of the Nation's credit in securities
trading. The authority to issue rules on the use of credit in securities
transactions is lodged in the Board of Governors of the Federal
Reserve System, but the administration of these rules and of the other
provisions of the act is vested in the Commission.
The act provides for the registration of national securities exchanges,
brokers, and dealers in securities, and associations of brokers and
dealers.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration of Exchanges

Section 5 of the act requires each securities exchange within or
subject to the jurisdiction of the United States to register with the
Commission as a national securities exchange or to apply for exemption from such registration.
Exemption from registration is available
to exchanges which have such a limited volume of transactions
effected thereon that, in the opinion of the Commission, it is not
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors to require their registration.
At the close of the 1949 fiscal year the following 18 exchanges were
registered as national securities exchanges:
Boston Stock Exchange.
Chicago Board of Trade.
Chicago Stock Exchange.
Cincinnati Stock Exchange.
Cleveland Stock Exchange.
Detroit Stock Exchange.
Los Angeles Stock Exchange.
New Orleans Stock Exchange.
New York Curb Exchange.

New York Stock Exchange.
Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange.
Pittsburgh Stock Exchange.
St. Louis Stock Exchange.
Salt Lake Stock Exchange.
San Francisco Mining Exchange.
San Francisco Stock Exchange.
~pokane Stock Exchange.
Washington Stock Exchange.

Five exchanges were exempted from registration at the close of the
1949 fiscal year. These are:
Colorado Springs Stock Exchange.
Honolulu Stock Exchange.
Minneapolis-St. Paul Stock Exchange.

Richmond Stock Exchange.
Wheeling Stock Exchange.

The registration or exemption statement of each exchange contains
information pertinent to the organization, rules of procedure, trading
practices, membership, and related matters, and the exchanges are
required to keep such information up to date by filing appropriate
amendments. During the year the exchanges filed a total of 84 such
30

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

31

amendments, bringing the number of amendments filed during the
past 5 years to 488. Many of these amendments contained only
periodic information required by the rules, such as membership lists,
names of officers and directors, financial statements of the exchanges,
etc. However, changes which were effected by the exchanges in their
constitutions, rules and trading practices were also reported. Each
amendment was reviewed to ascertain whether the change was
adverse to the public interest and complied with the Act. The
nature of the changes in the exchanges' rules and trading practices
varied considerably. Some of the more significant which occurred
during the 1949 fiscal year are briefly outlined below:
New York Stock Exchange and New York Curb Exchange, effective December 15, 1948, each modified its rules to permit members
trading for their own account on the floor of the exchange to purchase for their own account, under certain conditions, long stock at
a price higher than the last sale. Previously, floor traders could not
purchase for their own account any stock at a price higher than the
last sale.
New York Curb Exchange, following action taken by New York
Stock Exchange and others during the previous fiscal year, adopted,
effective February 1, 1949, a revised schedule of commission rates on
stocks selling at 50 cents or above per share. Its new commission
rates are, as in the past, computed on a rate-per-share basis. Salt
Lake and Spokane Stock Exchanges also revised their schedule of
commission rates upward effective June 1 and 2, 1949, respectively.
New York Stock Exchange and New York Curb Exchange, on
February 15, 1949, each amended its rules respecting equity in
margin accounts to securities having a market value at or below $5
per share, for the purpose of new securities transactions or commitments or withdrawals of cash or securities. These two exchanges, on
June 6, 1949, and June 15, 1949, respectively, also amended their
rules by lowering the initial margin and minimum equity requirements from $1,000 to $500.
New York Curb Exchange adopted new standards to be followed
in approving odd-lot differentials assigned to securities dealt in on
the exchange. These new standards became effective June 1, 1949,
and resulted in the revision on that date of the odd-lot differentials
for 255 stocks.
Cincinnati Stock Exchange changed the method of trading on the
exchange from a call system to one of continuous trading with a
posted market. This change in trading procedure was patterned
after the methods of Cleveland Stock Exchange and became effective on September 13, 1948. Under the old system of trading, all
trading, except odd-lot trading in securities for which odd-lot books
were operated by odd-lot dealers, was on call; i. e., members on the
floor of the exchange engaged in competitive bids and offers for each
security as it was called from the rostrum. The new system ot continuous trading provides for all bids and offers to be posted upon a
blackboard which is used as a trading post. Bids and offers are
posted in order as to price and time received and the highest bidder
and lowest offerer have preference over other bids and offers.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Cincinnati Stock Exchange also amended its rules and regulations
to permit delivery through a designated Cincinnati bank or trust
company of securities having no transfer office in the city of Cincinnati.
Philadelphia Stock Exchange changed its name to PhiladelphiaBaltimore Stock Exchange effective March 7, 1949, as a result of the
merger of that exchange with Baltimore Stock Exchange. Upon
consummation of the merger, the activities of Baltimore Stock Exchange were terminated and Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange
opened an office in the city of Baltimore. A private wire is maintained between that office and the trading floor of the exchange in
the city of Philadelphia for the use of its members in placing orders.
In addition, an office of Stock Clearing Corporation of Philadelphia,
a wholly owned subsidiary of Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange,
was established in Baltimore for the purpose of facilitating the transfer of securities in that city. A majority of the issuers of securities
listed and registered on Baltimore Stock Exchange prior to the
merger transferred their listing and registration to PhiladelphiaBaltimore Stock Exchange. The two exchanges believed that merger
of their activities would result in benefits to issuers of securities
traded on the exchanges as well as to the public, due, among other
things, to the wider spread membership of the merged exchanges and
consolidation of the trading areas involved.
San Francisco Stock Exchange and New York Curb Exchange each
adopted an amendment to its rules governing trading by members
while acting as brokers. The rule involved, which was contained in
the list of rules originally adopted by the exchanges upon recommendation of the Commission in 1935, prohibited members from competing
with public orders at all times. The amendment to the rule relaxed
this restriction to the extent that a specialist-odd-lot dealer may now
compete with public orders to offset positions previously acquired or
to offset odd-lot orders to be executed.
Floor Trading

The term "floor trading" designates the use of the facilities of the
floor of an exchange for trading by members for their own account as
distinguished from transactions for customers' accounts.
On January 15, 1945, the Division of Trading and Exchanges reoommended the adoption of a rule, pursuant to section 11 (a) (1) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would prohibit floor trading in stocks on New York Stock Exchange and New York Curb
Exchange. This recommendation was accompanied by a report
which outlined the legislative background of the Commission's powers
with respect to floor trading and described the nature and effects of
such trading in considerable detail. A public conference was held
on May 16, 1945, to consider the merits of the proposal. Subsequent
to the public conference, representatives of the Commission and of
N ew York Stock Exchange met for additional discussions. Finally,
at the request of N ew York Stock Exchange, the Commission agreed
to permit the exchanges to adopt certain rules restricting floor trading.
The Division of Trading and Exchanges has kept constant watch on
the activity of floor traders and their effect on the market. At the
request of N ew York Stock Exchange and after conferences by the
Commission with the staff and with exchange officials, the rules were

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

33

revised in February 1947 and again in December 1948. Although
these revisions permit wider flexibility of action by floor traders, the
general policy of the exchanges restrains floor traders from many of
the practices which were condemned in the division's report of 1945.
Disciplinary Actions by Exchanges Against Members

Pursuant to a request of the Commission, each national securities
exchange reports to the Commission any action of a disciplinary
nature taken by it against any of its members or against any partner
or employee of a member for violation of the Securities Exchange Act,
any rule or regulation thereunder, or of any exchange rule. During
the year 5 exchanges reported having taken disciplinary action against
a total of 46 members, member firms, and partners of member firms.
The nature of the actions taken included fines ranging from $50 to
$2,500 in 15 cases, with total fines aggregating $18,275; expulsion of
an individual from exchange membership; suspension of an individual
and of 3 firms from exchange membership j revocation of the registration of a specialist for a period of 60 days; and censure of individuals
or firms for infractions of the rules and warnings against further
violation. The disciplinary actions resulted from violations of various
exchange rules, principally those pertaining to partnership agreements,
capital requirements, handling of customers' accounts, specialists,
and conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Purpose and Nature of Registration

Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act forbids trading in any
security on a national securitie J exchange unless the security is
registered or exempt from registration.
The purpose of this provision
is to make available to investors reliable and comprehensive information regarding the affairs of the issuing company by requiring an
issuer to file with the Commission and the exchange an application
for registration disclosing pertinent information regarding the issuer
and its securities.
A companion provision contained in section 13 of
the act requires the filing of annual, quarterly, and other periodic
reports to keep this information up to date. These applications and
re:ports must be filed on forms prescribed by the Commission as appropnate to the class of issuer or security involved.
Examination of Applications and Reports

All applications and reports filed pursuant to sections 12 and 13
are examined by the staff to determine whether accurate and adequate
disclosure has been made of the specific types of information required
by the act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder.
The examination under the Securities Exchange Act, like that under
the Securities Act of 1933, does not involve an appraisal and is not
concerned with the merits of the registrant's securities.
When examination of an application or a report discloses that material information has been omitted, or that sound principles have not been
followed in the preparation and presentation of accompanying financial data, the examining staff follows much the same procedure as
that developed in its work under the Securities Act in sending to the
registrant a. letter of comment, or in holding a conference with its

34

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

attorneys or accountants or other representatives, pointing out any
madequacies in the information filed in order that necessary correcting
amendments may be obtained.
Here agam, amendments are examined in the same manner as the original documents.
Where a particular inadequacy is not material, the registrant is notified by letter
pointing out the defect and suggesting the proper procedure to be
followed in the preparation and filing of future reports, without insistence upon the filing of an amendment to the particular document
in question.
Statistics of Securities Registered on Exchanges

At the close of the 1949 fiscal year 2,194 issuers had 3,645 security
issues listed and registered on national securities exchanges. These
securities consisted of 2,570 stock issues aggregating 2,965,371,336
shares, and 1,075 bond issues aggregating $21,625,697,083 principal
amount.
This represents increases of 127,874,694 shares and $1,472,803,350 principal amount, respectively, over the aggregate amounts
of securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges at
the close of the 1948 fiscal year.
During the year 37 issuers not previously having securities registered under the act on national securities exchanges effected such
registration and the registration of all securities of 52 issuers was
terminated, principally by reason of retirement and redemption and
through mergers and consolidations.
Included in these 52 issuers are
8 issuers whose securities were removed from registration by reason
of the termmation of the registration of the Baltimore Stock Exchange
on March 5, 1949, such issuers having determined not to transfer the
registration of their securities to the Philadelphia-Baltimore
Stock
Exchange.
The following table shows the number of applications and reports
filed during the fiscal year in connection WIth the registration of securitres on national securities exchanges:

or Additional Securities

Rule X-12A-5 provides a temporary exemption from the registration requirements of section 12 (a) of the act to securities issued in
substitution for, or in addition to, securities previously listed or
admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange. The purpose of this exemption is to enable transactions to
be lawfully effected on an exchange in such substituted or additional
securities pending their registration or admission to unlisted trading
privileges on an exchange.
The exchanges filed notifications of admission to trading under this
rule with respect to 108 issues during the year. The same issue was

admitted to trading on more than 1 exchange in some instances, so

Special Offerings on Exchanges

Rule X-lOB-2

permits special offerings of large blocks of securities
securities exchanges provided such offerings
are effected pursuant to a plan which has been filed with and approved by the Commission.
Briefly stated, a security may be the
subject of a special offering when It has been determined that the
auction market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb a particular.
block of a security within a reasonable period of time without undue

of a security is made at a fixed price consistent with the existingauction market price of the security, and members acting as brokers
for public buyers are paid a special commission by the seller which
ordinarily exceeds the regular brokerage commission. Buyers of the

obtain the security at the net price of the offering. '
Since February 6, 1942, the date on which rule X-10B-2 was.

Each exchange with a special-offering plan in effect has been
requested to report detailed information to the Commission on each
offering effected on the exchange under the plan. Such reports Were
received from the Chicago, San Francisco, and New York Stock
Exchanges and New York Curb Exchange during the year with respect to a total of 25 offerings. These offerings involved the sale of
263,700 shares of stock with an aggregate market value of $5,750,000
and ranging in market value from $49,500 to $570,900. Special
commissions paid to brokers participating in these 25 offerings
totaled $161,000. Further details of special offerings during the
year are given in appendix table 13.
The first special offering was effected on N ew York Stock Exchange
on February 19, 1942, and from that time through June 30, 1949, a
total of 406 offerings have been effected on 4 of the 9 exchanges having
special-offering plans. These offerings totaled 4,915,900 shares with
a market value of $144,335,000 and brokers were paid special commissions totaling $2,815,800.
Secondary Distributions Approved by Exchanges

A "secondary distribution," as the term is used in this section.fis
a distribution over the counter by a dealer or group of dealers of a
comparatively large block of a previously issued and outstanding
security listed or admitted to trading on an exchange. Such distributions take place when it has been determined that it would not
be in the best interest of the various parties involved to sell the
shares on the exchange in the regular way or by special offering.
The distributions generally take place after the close of exchange
trading. As in the case of special offerings, buyers obtain the security
from the dealer at the net price of the offering, which usually is at or
below the most recent price registered on the exchange. It is generally the practice of exchanges to require members to obtain the
approval of the exchange before participating in such secondary distributions. Registration of such distributions under the Securities
Act of 1933 may also be necessary.
During the 5-year period ending June 30, 1949,7 exchanges reported
having approved a total of 510 secondary distributions under which
31 920,000shares of stock with a market value of $845,656,000 were
so id. Of these, 97 distributions involving the sale of 4,481,000 shares
with a market value of $129,014,000 were approved by 4 exchanges
during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1949. Further details of
secondary distributions of exchange stocks are given in appendix
table 14.

Nearly half of the 1,419 stock issues traded on New York Stock
Exchange and over one-quarter of the 819 stock issues traded on
New York Curb Exchange were also traded on various regional exchanges, and the principal dollar volumes of the leading regional
exchanges are in these dually traded stocks. Six of the regional
exchanges accounted for over 90 percent of the dollar volume of stock
transactions on all 22 such exchanges during 1948. These 6 exchanges-Boston,
Chicago, Detroit, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, and
San Francisco-reported
an aggregate 1948 dollar volume of $858,600,000 in stocks, of which about $750,000,000 was in the issues also traded
on New York Stock Exchange or Curb. Only the smaller regional
exchanges still accomplish most of their trading in local issues.
No duplication of either stock or bond issues exists between New
York Stock Exchange and New York Curb Exchange, and very little
duplication of bond issues exists between the New York and regional
exchanges, bond trading on the latter having shrunk to negligible
proportions since 1929-30. Bonds traded on New York Stock Exchange included $114,572,000,000 United States Government, State,
and municipal issues.
TERMINATION OF REGISTRATION UNDER SECTION 19 (a) (2)

The Commission is empowered, under section 19 (a) (2) of the act;
after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, to deny, to
suspend the effective date of, to suspend for a period of not exceeding
12 months, or to withdraw the registration of a security, if it finds that
the issuer of such security has failed to comply with any provision of
the act or the rules and regulations thereunder.
During the past year the Commission instituted formal proceedings
under section 19 (a) (2) involving four issuers to determine whether
to suspend or withdraw the registration of their securities for failure
to comply with the reporting requirements of section 13 of the act
and the rules and regulations thereunder. Specifically, in three of
such cases the issuers had failed to file their annual report for 1947,
and in the other case, the Commission alleged the failure to correct
serious accounting deficiencies appearing for 3 years in succession
in financial statements filed under the act despite repeated efforts of
~e Commission to obtain correction thereof. Two of these proceedmgs were dismissed, after the hearings, when the issuers filed their

38

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

required annual reports; registration was ordered withdrawn in one
case; and the proceedings in the fourth case, instituted in June 1949,
were still pending at the close of the fiscal year.
The case in which registration was ordered withdrawn was that of
the Assessable Common Capital Stock Ten Cents Par Value of Reorganized Carrie Silver-Lead Mines Corp. listed and registered on the
San Francisco Mining Exchange.
The brief language of the syllabus
of the Commission's findings and opinion in this case, published February 21, 1949,1 is sufficient to show why this registration was terminated: "Where an issuer having securities listed and registered on
a national securities exchange has failed to comply with the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 in that it has generally failed to file its annual
reports within the time prescribed for filing said reports i has failed to
submit with the annual report for 1946 required financial statements
and has failed to file the annual report for 1947 up to the present time,
and where, in addition, the company is largely inactive and has practically no assets held the securities of such issuer will be withdrawn
from registration."
Assertions of more serious violations of the law appear in the case
pending at the close of the 1949 fiscal year, involving the registration
of Barnhart-Morrow
Consolidated Common Capital Stock $1 Par
Value. A full statement of issues involved was published by the
Commission in its order scheduling a hearing to be held shortly after
the close of the year," As set forth therein, the Commission's Division
of Corporation Finance asserts, among other things, that the issuer,
in its annual reports filed for the years 1945, 1946, and 1947, willfully
and knowingly made a false and misleading statement with respect to
its assets and net worth. More specifically, the examining staff had
discovered that, at about the time the issuer was organized in 1926,
capital stock in the amount of $219,120.50 was issued to the two organizers for alleged services and for a lease interest; that such lease
interest acquired from the organizers was abandoned and quit-claimed
by the issuer to the lessor in the fall of 1927; and that the issuer went
into receivership on March 19,1931, and continued in receivership until
November 24, 1936. Nevertheless, the alleged services and lease
interest above-mentioned are reflected as "Intangible Assets" in the
amount of $219,120.50 under the description "Capital Stock issued for
services and leases" in the balance sheets of the financial statements
contained in the issuer's annual reports filed on Form 1o-K for the
fiscal years ended December 31, 1945, 1946, and 1947. In the same
balance sheets the net worth of the issuer is reflected as $278,247.88,
$395,031 and $396,765.96, respectively.
UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES

Securities traded on exchanges on an unlisted basis are of two
principal varieties.
Some are listed and registered on an exchange but
are traded unlisted on one or more other exchanges. As to these securities, the public enjoys the protections afforded by the listing and
registration under the Securities Exchange Act. A great majority of
the issues in this category are listed on N ew York Stock Exchange and
admitted to unlisted trading on various exchanges in other cities .

ANNUAL REPORT

The other category consists of issues not listed or registered on any
registered exchange. Most of such issues are admitted to unlisted
trading on N ew York Curb Exchange alone. In their case the public
is not protected by any listing agreement with the issuer nor by the
financial reporting requirements of section 13, the proxy rules under
section 14, and the "trading by insider" reporting and penalty clauses
of section 16 of the Securities Exchange Act, except to the extent that
the issuers or issues may be registered under other acts administered
by the Commission containing similar requirements.
Exchange trading in issues admitted to unlisted trading prior to
March 1934 is permitted to continue under section 12 (f) (1) of the
Securities Exchange Act. The further admission of issues to unlisted
trading, however, has been prohibited except to the extent permitted
under section 12 (f) (2) in the case of issues already listed and registered on some registered exchange," and under section 12 (f) (3) in the
case of issues not so listed and registered, as more specifically outlined under the next subheading, "Applications for Unlisted Trading
Privileges." 4
Twelve years ago, on June 30, 1937, the status of unlisted issues on
the registered exchanges was as follows:

These issues were practically all in the section 12 (f) (1) category of
securities which had been admitted to unlisted trading prior to March
•
1, 1934.
Since the first grant in April 1937 of an application by an exchange
under section 12 (f) (2) for unlisted trading in stocks listed on some
other registered exchange, there have been 562 admissions of such
stocks to the various exchanges. The number of actual issues involved
is less than this figure because many issues have been admitted to
unlisted trading on 2, 3, or more exchanges. These admissions of
stocks under section 12 (f) (2) have, however, barely maintained the
number of listed stocks traded unlisted on other exchanges, which
has fallen from 554 in 1937 to 539 in 1949. The grants have tended
to make the same stocks available on numerous exchanges and to
substitute currently active stocks in offset to the many retirements
of issues originally admitted to unlisted trading under section 12 (f)
(1). Annual trading on the various exchanges in these unlisted issues
is shown in appendix table 21.
Only nine stock issues have been admitted to unlisted trading on an
exchange (two of them on two exchanges) under section 12 (f) (3).
Two of these issues have been removed from this unlisted status on
New York Curb Exchange by reason of listing on New York Stock
Exchange. One of the issues continues on N ew York Curb Exchange
but has become listed on Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange.

Admissions of bonds under sections 12 (f) (2) and 12 (f) (3) have

It has become unusual to apply
for bond admissions under these sections, except in case of very large
and, particularly, convertible issues.

There has been a great diminution of issues, in all except the first
category, under the 1937 level. The principal shrinkage has been in
stocks and bonds not listed on any registered exchange, and this, as
has been frequently stated in these reports, was the expectation of
Congress when it authorized continuance of such privileges in 1936.
The 344 stocks admitted to unlisted trading without being listed
on any registered exchange aggregated 353,595,077 shares, warrants,
and receipts as of June 30, 1949. The reported volume of trading in
these stocks for the calendar year 1948 was 23,762,256 units, including
15,882,748 domestic shares, 3,913,708 Canadian shares, 2,598,000
warrants,
and 1,367,800 American depository receipts. The
353,595,077 unlisted shares were about 1O~ percent of the total of
3,375,691,673 shares admitted to trading on the registered exchanges,
and the 23,762,256 reported volume was 4~ percent of the total volume
of 540,487,546 shares and warrants on the registered exchanges for the
calendar year 1948. Of the 23,762,256 reported volume of trading in
units of unlisted securities for 1948, 21,850,060 (92 percent) were
on New York Curb Exchange, 1,578,999 (6.6 percent) were on San
Francisco Stock Exchange, and 337,197 (1.4 percent) were scattered
among 6 other regional stock exchanges. All but 1 of the 84 bond
issues admitted to unlisted trading without registration were on New
York Curb Exchange.
The single bond issue and all but 1 of the 36 stocks admitted only
to unlisted trading on the exempted exchanges were on Honolulu
Stock Exchange.
Comprehensive figures with respect to issues and volumes on
exchanges will be found in appendix tables 8 to 21, inclusive.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Section 12 (f) (2) of the act provides that, upon application to and
approval by the Commission, a national securities exchange may extend unlisted trading privileges to a security which is listed and registered on another national securities exchange. Pursuant to this
section, applications were granted during the year extending unlisted
trading privileges to Boston Stock Exchange with respect to 5 stock
issues; Chicago Stock Exchange, 3 stock issues; Cleveland Stock
Exchange, 6 stock issues; Los Angeles Stock Exchange, 4 stock issues;
Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange, 5 stock issues; Pittsburgh
Stock Exchange, 11 stock issues; St. Louis Stock Exchange, 1 stock

FIFTEENTH

issue; San Francisco Stock Exchange, 2 stock issues; and Washington
Stock Exchange, 1 stock issue.
Section 12 (f) (3) of the act permits the Commission to grant an
exchange's application for the extension of unlisted trading privileges
to a security which is not listed and registered on another national
securities exchange if investors have, respecting such a security~.protections equivalent to those provided for in the act regarding listed
securities. Applications were granted under this section, during the
year, extending unlisted trading privileges to New York Curb Exchange with respect to three bond issues and two stock issues, one of
which (Northern States Power Co. common stock) was later removed
upon listing on New York Stock Exchange, while the other (Utah
Power & Light Co. common stock) was also admitted to unlisted
trading under this section on Salt Lake Stock Exchange.
Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

During the year the exchanges filed numerous notifications pursuant
to rule X-12F-2 (a) of changes in the title, maturity, interest rate,
par value, dividend rate, or amount authorized or outstanding of
securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges. Where changes of
this nature only are effected in an unlisted security, the altered
security is deemed to be the security previously admitted to unlisted
trading privileges and such privileges are automatically extended to
the altered security.
However, when changes more comprehensive
than these are effected in an unlisted security, the exchange may file
an application with the Commission, pursuant to rule X-12F-2 (b),
seeking a determination that the altered security is substantially
equivalent to the security previously admitted to unlisted trading
privileges. The Commission denied one such application by New
York Curb Exchange," and granted two other applications of that
Exchange with respect to one of the two securities each involved,
denying them with respect to the others," Other applications filed
pursuant to this rule were granted by the Commission with respect
to four stock issues and one debenture escrow certificate issue on New
York Curb Exchange, three stock issues on Philadelphia-Baltimore
Stock Exchange, and two stock issues on Boston Stock Exchange.
DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES
Securities Delisted by Application

Section 12 (d) of the act provides that upon application by the
issuer or the exchange to the Commission, a security may be withdrawn or stricken from listing and registration on a national securities
exchange in accordance with the rules of the exchange and subject to
such terms as the Commission deems necessary for the protection of
mvestors, In accordance with this procedure 18 securities (3 of
which were listed on 2 exchanges each) were stricken from listing and
registration as a result of various events which had the effect of
practically terminating public interest in the issues involved.
These
included situations where the issuers were in the process of liquidation
and where the issues were weatly reduced in the amount. outstanding.

securities exchanges, the issuers applied to have them withdrawn
from listing and registration on one of the exchanges, which applications were granted; but they remained listed and registered on the
other exchange. An application by an issuer to withdraw one stock
issue from listing and registration was granted bv the Commission,
on the ground that the number of shares remaining in the hands of
the public had become reduced to a very small number.
Securities Delisted by Certification

Securities which have been paid at maturity, redeemed, or retired
in full, or which have become exchangeable for other securities in
substitution therefor, may be removed from listing and registration
on a national securities exchange if the exchange files a certification
with the Commission to the effect that such retirement has occurred.
The removal of the security becomes effective automatically after
the interval of time prescribed by rule X-12D2-2 (a). The exchanged
filed certifications under this rule effecting the removal of 111separate
issues, In some instances the same issue was removed from more
than one exchange, so that the total number of removals, including
duplications, was 132. Successor issues to those removed became
listed and registered on exchanges in many instances.
In accordance with the provisions of rule X-12D2-1 (d), New
York Curb Exchange removed five issues from listing and registration
when they became listed and registered on N ew York Stock Exchange,
This rule permits a national securities exchange to remove a secunty
from listing and registration in the event trading therein has been
terminated pursuant to a rule of the exchange which requires such
termination if the security becomes listed and registered and admitted
to trading on another exchange. Removal under this rule is automatic, the exchange being required merely to notify the Commission
of the removal.
Securities Removed From Listing on Exempted Exchanges

A security may be removed from listing on an exempted exchange
if such exchange files an appropriate amendment to its exemption
statement setting forth a brief statement of the reasons for the
removal. Three exempted exchanges removed three issues from
listing thereon during the year.
MANIPULATION AND STABILIZATION

Sections 9, 10, and 15 of the Securities Exchange Act prohibit
manipulation of securities. The Commission is empowered to define
and regulate manipulative and other fraudulent devices. Section 9
forbids certain specifically described forms of manipulative activity.
Transactions which create actual or apparent trading activity or which
raise or lower prices are declared to be unlawful if they are effected
for the purpose of inducing others to buy or to sell. Certain practices
designated as "wash sales" and "matched orders" effected for the
purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of active trading
or a false or misleading appearance with respect to the market for a
security are declared to be illegal. Persons selling or offer~ securities
for sale are prohibited from disseminating false information to the
effect that the price of a security will, or is likely to, rise or fall because
of market operations conducted for the purpose of raising or depressing

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

43

the price of a security. Persons selling or buying securities are
forbidden to make false or misleading statements of material facts,
with knowledge of their falsity, or willfully to omit material information regarding such securities for the purpose of inducing purchases or
sales. Sections 10 and 15 (the latter applying to the conduct of overthe-eounter securities brokers and dealers) empower the Commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and prohibit manipulative
practices.
Pursuant to its statutory authority, the Commission has adopted
rules and regulations to aid it in carrying out the expressed will of
Congress. Sections 9, 10, and 15, as augmented by the Commission's
rules and regulations, are aimed at freeing our securities markets from
artificial influence, to help maintain fair and honest markets where
prices are established by supply and demand and uninfluenced by
manipulative activity.
Manipulation

A principal reason for the adoption of the Securities Exchange Act
was the manipulation of securities prices which, prior to 1934, took
millions of dollars annually from the public. In the early years of the
Commission's existence some large-scale manipulations were detected
and as a result various penalties were imposed upon certain market
operators, including expulsions from exchanges, jail sentences, and
fines.
As a result of the act and its administration

manipulation is no
longer an appreciable factor in our markets. However, efforts to
raise or depress artificially the prices of securities are still encountered.
During the past 5 years several notable cases of the type set forth
below were detected.
Thornton & Co., a broker-dealer located in New York City, was
found to have manipulated the stocks of Lindsay Light & Chemical
Co. on the Chicago Stock Exchange and of Northwest Utilities Co.
over-the-counter. The registration of Thornton & Co. as a brokerdealer was revoked. The Federal Corp. was enjoined from attempting
to manipulate the stock of Red Bank Oil Co. at a time when the company was attempting to register 990,000 shares of stock for sale to the
public. Albert B. Windt was sentenced to 6 months in fail and fined
$1,000, and the broker-dealer registration of Aurelius F. DeFelice
was revoked for their manipulation of the stock of Tonopah Gipsy
Queen Mining Co. on the San Francisco Mining Exchange. Serge
Rubinstein and Frank Bliss were indicted on February 7, 1949, on
char~es of fraud and market manipulation in connection with their
distrlbution of Rubinstein's holdings of Panhandle Producing &
Refining Co., resulting in an alleged unlawful profit of $3,000,000 to
Rubinstein. The Rubinstein case was the only one of those enumerated where the public suffered a substantial loss: The above cases,
detected by the methods set forth in the next few paragraphs, were
investigated by the appropriate regional offices of the Commission. In
the cases involving criminal prosecution the results of Commission
investigation were referred to the Department of Justice for punitive
action.
..
In administering the anti-manipulation requirements there is a
premium on prompt action to prevent harm before it occurs and on

44

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

the avoidance of interference with the legitimate functioning of the
markets. To accomplish this the Commission has continuously modified and sought to improve its procedures for the systematic surveillance of trading in securities. Methods used to detect manipulation
have necessarily been elastic and fluid in character, since techniques
employed by manipulators change constantly, increasing in subtlety
and complexity.
The staff scrutinizes price movements in approximately 8,500
securities, including 3,500 issues traded on exchanges and 5,000 which
have the most active markets over-the-counter.
Information maintained concerning these securities includes not only data reflecting
the market action of such securities but also includes news items,
earnings figures, dividends, options, and other facts which might
explain price and volume changes. In addition, periodic observations
are made of the price movements of the thousands of other issues
which occasionally change hands in our public markets. The markets
for securities about to be sold to the public are watched very closely.
In this connection, 800 securities were kept under special observation
during the 1949 fiscal year for periods ranging from 14 to 90 days.
When no apparent explanation can be found for an unusual movement in a security or for an unusual volume of trading, the matter
may be referred to one of the regional offices of the Commission for a
field investigation. For reasons of policy the Commission keeps confidential the fact that trading in a given security is under investigation, for it has found that knowledge of the existence of such investigations may unduly affect the market or reflect unfairly upon individuals whose activities are being investigated.
As a result, the
Commission occasionally receives criticism for failing to investigate
in cases when, in fact, it is actually engaged in an intensive investigaTtiohn.

two forms. The "flying quiz," or preliminary investigation, IS
designed to detect and discourage incipient manipulation by a prompt
determination of the reason for unusual market behavior. Often the
results of a flying quiz point to a legitimate reason for the activity
under review and the case is closed. Frequently facts are uncovered
which require morefextended investigation, and in these cases formal
orders of investigation are issued by the Commission. In a formal
investigation, members of the Commission's staff are empowered to
subpena pertinent material and to take testimony under oath. In
the course of such investigation data on purchases and sales over
substantial periods of time are often compiled and trading operations
involving considerable quantities of securities are scrutinized.
The Commission operates on the premise that manipulation should
be suppressed at its inception. Many of the cases investigated never
come to the attention of the public because the promptness of the
Commission's investigation, through the flying quiz technique, stops
the manipulation before it is fully developed. Public losses are seldom
recoverable even though the perpetrator of a fraud is brought to
justice. Therefore it IS believed that these investigatory methods
afford more protection to the public than allowing market operations

StabiIization

During the 1949 fiscal year the Commission continued the administration of rules X-17A-2 and X-9A6-1. Rule X-17A-2 requires the
filing of detailed reports of all transactions incident to offerings in
respect of which a registration statement has been filed under the
Securities Act of 1933 where any: stabilizing operation is undertaken
to facilitate the offering. Rule X-9A6-1 governs stabilizing transactions effected to facilitate offerings of securities registered on
national securities exchanges, in which the offering prices are represented to be "at the market" or at prices related to market prices.
Of the 455 registration statements filed during the 1949 fiscal year,
188 contained a statement of intention to stabilize to facilitate the
offerings covered by such registration statements.
Each of the latter
filings was examined critically as to the propriety of the proposed
method of distribution and market support and the full disclosure
thereof. Because a registration statement sometimes covers more
than one class of security, there were 209 offerings of securities in
respect of which a statement was made, as required by rule 426 under
the Securities Act, to the effect that a stabilizing operation was contemplated. Stabilizing operations were actually conducted to facilitate 66 of these offerings, principally the stock offerings. In the case
of bonds, public offerings of 2 issues aggregating $86,300,000 in principal amount were stabilized. Offerings of stock issues aggregating
12,186,838 shares with an estimated aggregate public offering price of
$297,659,921 were stabilized. In connection with these stabilizing

46

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

operations, 9,454 reports were filed with the Commission during the
fiscal year. Each of these reports has been analyzed to determine
whether the stabilizing activities were within permissible limits.
To facilitate compliance with the Commission's rules on stabilizing
and to assist issuers and underwriters to avoid violation of the statutory provisions dealing with manipulation and fraud, many conferences
were held with representatives of such issuers and underwriters and
many written and telephone requests were answered. It is the Commission's experience that such issuers and underwriters place great
value on the immediate service which the Commission is able to render
them by being at all times available to give them responsible advice
as to problems dealing with proper stabilizing techniques in the offering of securities.
SECURITY

TRANSACTIONS

OF CORPORATION

INSIDERS

A corporation "insider," by virtue of his position, may have knowledge of his company's condition and prospects which is not available
to the general public. Accordingly, any transactions effected by him
in the company's securities are of particular interest to other stockholders and investors.
For the purpose of providing information with
respect to such transactions, sections 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, 17 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,
and 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act»f 1940 require that corporation "insiders" file reports of certain transactions in the securities
of their companies. These reports are required to be filed by every
beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any equity security listed
on a national securities exchange and by every officer and director
of the issuer of any equity security so listed; every officer or director
of a registered public utility holding company; and every officer,
director, beneficial owner of more than 10percent of any class of security
(other than short-term paper), member of an advisory board, investment adviser, or affiliated person of an investment adviser of a registered closed-end investment company.
The Commission requires
the filing of an initial report showing beneficial ownership, both direct
and indirect, of the company's securities when one of these relationships is assumed and subsequent reports must be filed for each month
thereafter in which any purchase or sale, or other change in such ownership occurs, setting forth in detail each such change, on or before the
tenth day following the month in which it occurs.
The staff examines all reports filed to determine whether they comply with applicable requirements.
Where inaccuracies or omissions
appear amended reports are requested.
The reports are available for
public inspection from the time they are filed. However, it is manifestly not possible for many interested persons to inspect these reports
at the Commission's central office, or at the exchanges 'where additional
copies of section 16 (a) reports are also filed. The Commission
therefore publishes a monthly official summary of security transactions and holdings which is widely distributed among individual
investors, brokers and dealers, newspaper correspondents, press services, and other interested persons. Files of this summary are maintained at each of the Commission's regional offices and at the offices
of the various exchanges.

Preventing Unfair Use of Inside Infonnation

For the purpose of preventing unfair use of information which may
have been obtained by an insider by reason of his relationship to the
issuer, section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act provides that any
profit realized by an officer, director or principal stockholder from
short-term transactions (any sale and purchase or any purchase and
sale of any equity security of the issuer within any period of less than
6 months) shall be recoverable by the issuer. If necessary, suit for the
recovery of such profits may be instituted by the issuer or by any
stockholder of the issuer if it fails or refuses to act within 60 days after
request. Similar provisions are contained in sections 17(b) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act and 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act. Voluntary payments of short-term profits have been made
in a number of instances, and others have been made upon request by
the issuer based upon information disclosed in ownership reports filed
with the Commission by the Insider involved. Further substantial
amounts have been recovered through court action. One of the first
of such suits under section 16(b) was decided for the plaintiff in 1942,
and since .that time, particularly during the past 5 years, a growing
number of similar actions have been brought in the courts. The Commission has participated as amicus curiae in several of these cases.
Statistics of Ownership Reports

During the 5-year period ended June 30, 1949,93,396 security ownership reports were filed with the Commission, compared with 87,000
reports filed during the previous 5-year period. Since these various
regulations were put into effect, 309,494 reports have been filed by
45,179 insiders of 2,733 issuers of listed equity securities, of 225 registered public-utility holding companies, and of 234 registered closedend investment companies. The following table shows the number of
reports filed during the past fiscal year:

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

SOUCITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS AND AUTHORIZATIONS

Under three of the acts it administers-sections
14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 12 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of
1940-the Commission is authorized to prescribe rules and regulations
concerning the solicitation of proxies, consents, and authorizations in
connection with securities of the companies subject to those acts.
Pursuant to this authority, the Commission has adopted regulation
X-14, which is designed to protect investors by requiring the disclosure
of certain information to them and by affording them an opportunity
for active participation in the affairs of their company. Essentially,
this regulation makes unlawful any solicitation of any proxy, consent,
or authorization which is false or misleading as to any material fact or
which omits to state any material fact necessary to make the statements already made not false or misleading. Under the regulation it
is necessary, in general, that each person solicited be furnished such
information as will enable him to act intelligently upon each separate
matter in respect of which his vote or consent is sought. The proxy
rules set forth in this regulation also contain provisions which enable
security holders who are not allied with the management to communicate with other security holders when the management is soliciting
proxies.
Statistics of Proxy Statements

During the 5-year period from July 1, 1944, to June 30, 1949, the
Commission received and examined both the preliminary and definitive
material with respect to 8,356 solicitations under regulation X-14, as
well as "follow-up" material employed in 1,376 instances.
During the 1949 fiscal year the Commission received and examined
both the preliminary and definitive material with respect to 1,702
solicitations under regulation X-14 as well as "follow-up" material
used in 191 instances.
The number of proxy statements filed by management and by
others than management, and the principal items of business for which
stockholders' action was sought in these solicitations, is shown

Examination of Proxies

The problems which arise in the Commission's administration of
regulation X-14 may be shown by reference to a few actual cases
examined by the staff during the 1949 fiscal year.
In a proxy contest in the spring of 1948, a group in opposition to
the management of an aircraft company proposed the election of a
majority of the board of directors. The first proxy form which was
used by the opposition group authorized the proxies named to vote
shares at the annual meeting of the company to be held April 21, 1948,
and at all adjournments thereof. Just before the annual meeting the
opposition group made a resolicitation of proxies. The second proxy
form attempted to seek authority to vote" at the annual meeting to
be held on April 21, 1948, and all adjournments thereof, and any
meeting, regular or special, held up to and including the 1949 annual
meeting to be held on or about April 20, 1949, and all adjournments
thereof. * * *" Upon objection by the Commission to such
indefinite duration of a proxy, the opposition group agreed that
proxies received as a result of the latter solicitation would not be used
at any stockholders' meeting other than that of April 21, 1948, and
any adjournment of this particular meeting. In order to prevent the
premature solicitation of proxies and in order to clarify the rule in
this respect, amendments to the proxy rules were adopted on November 5, 1948, especially providing that no proxy shall confer authority
to vote at any annual meeting other than the next annual meeting (or
any adjournment thereof) which is to be held after the date on which
the solicitation is made.
In most cases no such proxy contest is involved. Nevertheless, a
wide variety of problems may be presented to the examining staff in
any particular case. One example illustrates how a public utility
company's inadequacy of reserves for its fixed assets was made clear
to the investing public as a result of a proxy examination made by the
staff. This company filed preliminary copies of proxy solicitation

50

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

material to be used in obtaining stockholder approval for an increase
in authorized long-term debt, and with such material included certified
financial statements.
As originally filed, the accountants' certificate
contained the qualification: "subject to the adequacy of the reserve
for property retirements."
To the Commission's examiners this
reservation presented some doubt as to whether the accountants
had excluded the reserve from the purview of their audit or whether
they were of the opinion that the reserve was inadequate.
Following
informal discussions with the accountants their certificate was revised
to state clearly that the reserve was materially inadequate and that
they took exception to the financial statements because of such
inadequacy.
Their resultant certificate, as revised, read in part
as follows:
The company uses the retirement-reserve method of providing for property
retirements, the purpose of which is to equalize the burden of retirement losses
from year to year. As stated in Note 5 of the notes to the balance sheet, the
ratio between the expired life * * * is materially in excess of the ratio
between the related retirement reserve and the estimated original cost of such
property, and a straight-line depreciation reserve would materially exceed such
retirement reserve. * * *

The certificate as revised was used together with the financial statements in a prospectus covering a public offering of securities made
shortly thereafter by the issuer under the Securities Act of 1933.
While it is unusual for the Commission to find it necessary to
resort to the courts for the enforcement of its proxy regulations, it has
been engaged in such litigation during the past year in a case involving
the solicitation of proxies by John A. Topping from the stockholders
of Certain-Teed Products Corp. The Commission's attention was
called to a letter of April 1, 1949, sent by: Mr. Topping to stockholders. The Commission in its complaint filed with the court alleged
that the letter was not filed as required by the proxy rules and that
certain statements contained therein were false and misleading.
The
Commission therefore sought an injunction prohibiting Mr. Topping
from sending further letters of this nature in contravention of these
rules. On June 1, 1949, the court denied the defendant's motion
to dismiss the Commission's complaint; denied the temporary injunction requested by this Commission without prejudice, on the theory
that since the annual meeting had been held no immediate danger
existed of further violations of law; and retained jurisdiction in
the case. This litigation is still pending and awaiting a ruling by
the court on the defendant's motion for summary judgment.
Illustrating the proxy cases which give rise primarily to one or
more of a wide variety of accounting problems was that of a chemical
manufacturer which filed preliminary proxy material covering a
proposed merger between the company and one of its subsidiaries
for the purpose of effecting a recapitalization of the parent company.
The notes to the financial statements contained in the proxy material
revealed that the accumulated
unpaid dividends on 213,052.15
shares of preferred stock amounted to $83.50 per share or a total
of $17,789,854.53. The surplus shown on the balance sheet amounted
to $11,477,570.43.
The company proposed that new first preferred and second preferred
stock would be issued in exchange for its outstanding preferred stock,

FIFTEENTH ANNUAL

REPORT

51

the effect of which would be to satisfy alI. dividendfarrearages.
It
proposed also to carry forward its surplus intact without reflecting any
deduction arising out of the satisfaction of dividend arrearages.
After discussions between the staff and representatives of the company
of the results sought to be obtained by the proposed merger, the
main purpose of which was to eliminate preferred dividend arrearages,
and of the accounting procedure proper under the circumstances,
the company's financial statements were revised to indicate that the
entire surplus of $11,477,570.43 remaining, after routine adjustments,
would be eliminated and treated as capital upon consummation
of the merger.
The method used by a company in the valuation of its inventories
becomes significant to stockholders in many cases, as may be illustrated by still another actual proxy examination conducted by the
staff. An. oil company submitted copies of proxy solicitation material
with respect to a proposed merger with another oil company. This
proxy material contained financial statements of both companies. In
reviewing the financial statements, the staff noted that the companies
used different methods of valuing their principal inventories; e. g.,
last-in, first-out method; first-in, first-out method; and the averagecost method. Both companies used the last-in, first-out method for
valuing inventories of crude oil and of crude oil content of refined
and semirefined products at refineries, which constituted a substantial
portion of total inventories.
It should be noted that in the determination of net income, the
last-in, first-out method of valuing inventories has the effect of
deducting from sales the cost of recent products purchased, instead of
the cost of such products on hand at the beginning of the year (based
on the first-in, first-out or average cost methods) plus purchases during
the year. Therefore, generally, in a period of rising prices the effect
of the last-in, first-out method is to show earnings and inventories in
the balance sheet substantially lower than they otherwise would have
been if other generally recognized methods had been used. In a
period of declining prices, earnings would normally be greater on the
last-in, first-out basis. It was deemed particularly pertinent in this
case, as frequently occurs in many other instances, that the financial
statements should disclose to stockholders the valuation on a current
cost basis of inventories carried on the last-in, first-out basis. These
financial statements were amended to indicate that with respect to
one company's inventories valued on the last-in, first-out method
($3,067,611.03) the approximate current cost aggregated $6,000,000,
and with respect to the other company's inventories stated on the lastin, first-out method ($1,999,756) the approximate current cost aggregated $3,750,000. This disclosure, obtained for the benefit of stockholders, enabled them more adequately to appraise their respective
equities.

Administrative Proceedings

Section 15 (b) of the act provides that registration may be denied
for specific types of misconduct on the part of an applicant, and that,
once allowed, registration may be revoked for such misconduct if the
Commission finds after an appropriate record has been made that such
denial or revocation is necessary in the public interest.
The Commission's staff, therefore, examines all applications for registration and
numerous other available sources of information to determine whether
the applicant has engaged in any violations of law which would constitute a statutory basis for challenging the propriety of giving him
the privilege incident to registration.
When indications of such misconduct are discovered, the Commission orders proceedings to establish the facts and to afford the applicant full opportunity to be heard
on the specified charges so that an appropriate determination may be
made. Similar procedures are followed in revocation proceedings
against registered brokers and dealers and in proceedings to determine whether to suspend or expel a broker or dealer from membership
in a national securities exchange or association.
The following tabulation reflects the number of proceedings instituted under sections
15 (b) and 15A during the 5-year period ending June 30, 1949, and

Most of the proceedings brought against brokers and dealers stem
at least indirectly from the Commission's routine fraud detection procedures designed to detect and prevent violations of law.
During the last five fiscal years revocation proceedings have been
instituted against seven brokers and dealers for manipulation of the
market in particular securities. Two proceedings of this nature were
decided during the 1949 fiscal year and the registrations of Aurelius
F. De Felice and Thornton & Co. were revoked on findings that they
had manipulated the market in willful violation of law.
In the first case, De Felice and one Windt undertook a manipulation of the market which raised the price of the common stock of
Tonopah Gipsey Queen Mining Co. from 40 cents on March 15, 1946,
to 75 cents on March 26, 1946, at which level it was maintained until
April 10, 1946. This was accomplished by artificial trading generated
by De Felice and Windt and by their contraction of the available trading supply in the security.
By obtaining option agreements from one Christiansen, who owned
1,091,191 of the 1,243,715 shares of Tonopah's outstanding stock
(in connection with which Christiansen agreed to deposit 750,190 of
his shares in escrow until November 1, 1947), Windt removed from
the market all except 41,001 of Christiansen's shares, thus removing
an overhang from the market and facilitating the manipulation.
Despite the fact that DeFelice was informed by the board of governors
of the San Francisco Mining Exchange that it would be necessary for
Christiansen to make available a sufficient amount of stock to prevent
an unduly narrow market, DeFelice effectively removed from trading
20,000 of the 40,000 shares offered by Christiansen by placing such
shares with a customer off the exchange. The Commission found
that DeFelice had followed a course of conduct for the manifest
purpose of raising the price of the stock in order to induce the purchase of the stock by others, and that he aided and abetted Windt,

who he had reason to believe was effecting like transactions with a
similar purpose. DeFelice thereby violated section 9 (a) (2) of the
Securities Exchange Act.
In the second case, Charles J. Thornton was the active and controlling partner in Thornton & Co. Thornton entered matched orders
and effected wash transactions on the Chicago Stock Exchange in
the common stock of Lindsay Light & Chemical Co. from June 1,
1946, to July 31, 1946, and in the 7 percent cumulative preferred $100
par value stock of Northwest Utilities Co. from February 9, 1946, to
July 2, 1946, for the purpose of creating a false and misleading appearance of active trading in these securities. This raised the price of the
Lindsay common from approximately $32 to $35.50 per share and the
price of the Northwest preferred from approximately $152 to approximately $184 per share and was done for the purpose of inducing the
purchase of these securities by others.
In the course of the manipulation of the market in each of these
securities Thornton made sales to the public both on the Exchange
and over-the-counter markets within the range of the fictitious prices
it had created directly and at levels achieved in public transactions
which followed Thornton's substantial participation in the market.
To screen his operations Thornton placed buy and sell orders with
numerous brokers, none of whom was ever on both sides of a transaction. Thornton admitted that he had entered large numbers of
matched orders and consummated a substantial volume of wash
transactions, 116 in all. He contended, however, that they were not
for the purpose prescribed by statute but rather to delay payment
for securities which he had purchased and could not finance, in other
words a "kiting" of securities. He further contended that he was
endeavoring to accumulate an inventory in such securities.
The Commission found that his public sales and the mechanics of
his trading were not only inconsistent with his assertions, but also
that, granting the truth of his contentions, the asserted financing objective was in any event accompanied by a manipulative purpose.
Thornton's activities on the Chicago Stock Exchange in the two
securities were found to violate section 9 (a) (1) and (2) of the Securities Exchange Act. Since he had sold such securities over-thecounter as well without disclosing to the purchasers that the prices
charged were determined by prices established by a manipulated
market on the Exchange, the Commission found also that Thornton
had violated sections 10 (b) and 15 (c) (1) of the act and rules X-I0B-5
and X-15CI-2 (a) and (b) thereunder. On a petition for review
filed by Thornton, the Commission's order was affirmed by the
United States Court of Appeals and certiorari was denied by the
United States Supreme Court. Litigation aspects of the case are
discussed later in the report of litigation activities.
Ten other proceedings which resulted in revocation of registration
pertained to the more common types of fraudulent practices involving
other people's money, such as violation of fiduciary obligations, misrepresentations, and misappropriation of customers' funds and securities. Two of them, Southeastern Securities Corp. and Hammill &
Co., involved shocking abuse of the trust and confidence reposed by
certain customers of these firms.

56

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The~proceedings against Hammill & Co. concerned the utter betrayal of the trust and confidence reposed in Albert L. Hammill, the
controlling partner of. the firm, by. a customer, Mrs. ~., a widow
without business experience. At a time when the financial condition
of his firm was precarious, Hammill advised and induced Mrs. G. to
sell certain securities on the representation that the proceeds would
be reinvested in another security which would be of greater advantage
to her. Hammill, however, did not reinvest the proceeds, aggregating
$4,534.69, in such security but persuaded Mrs. G. to accept his personal promissory note in the amount of $4,000. The Commission,
po~t:il1 out the confidential relationship that existed between
Ha
. and Mrs. G., observed that, at a minimum, Hammill was
under an obligation to disclose to this customer all pertinent information, including the particulars of his own financial condition and
the fact that by accepting his note for her claim against the firm she
could assert her claim only against Hammill and not against Hammill
and his partner. Later, Hammill's partner withdrew from the firm
because of its distressed financial condition. In order to return the
securities which this partner had invested in the firm and which were
pledged as collateral for a bank loan, it was necessary for Hammill
to substitute new securities. On the promise that she would receive
4-percent interest on her money and that her securities would be
deposited with a bank where they would be safe, Hammill induced
Mrs. G. to invest all of her securities, aggregating about $15,000, in
a new partnership in which he and Mrs. G. would be the partners.
Six months thereafter the business collapsed.
The Commission based its order revoking registration on findings
that Hammill had willfully violated section 17 (a) of the Securities
Act and sections 10 (b) and 15 (c) (3) and rules X-10B-5 and X-15
(c) (3)-1 of the Securities Exchange Act.
The facts in the proceedings against Southeastern Securities Corp.
were similar in some respects to the facts in the Hammill proceedings.
Here there were three women customers into whose trust and confidence Luck, president and controlling stockholder, had insinuated
himself and whose trust and confidence he betrayed. His conduct of
the affairs of one of these customers, a patient bedridden at a nursing
institution, was especially shocking and reprehensible. Luck maintained that this customer had executed a power of attorney authorizing
him to trade for her account, but a handwriting expert of the Federal
Bureau of Investigation testified that in his opinion the customer's
signature on the power of attorney was a forgery. It is the first
instance in any administrative proceeding against brokers and dealers
in which the Commission has introduced expert testimony to challenge
handwriting.
Another aspect of these proceedings related to the financial condition of the company. The evidence disclosed that the company and
Luck had made false entries on Southeastern's books purporting to
remove certain liabilities for the purpose of giving the appearance of
solvency, when in fact the company was insolvent. Thus it was
found, in part, that entries were made on Southeastern's books
debiting certain accounts of directors and customers with the amounts
of their credit balances and crediting the capital surplus account of
Southeastern in those amounts. On one day there were thus elim-

57

FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

inated credit balances aggregating more than $145,800 and the same
amount was added to surplus. The evidence adduced at the hearing
clearly established that certain of the creditors whose balances were
thus transferred expected the money to be repaid. The device of
false and fictitious entries was employed by Luck to enable the company to continue in business while it was actually insolvent.
The Commission found on the foregoing facts that Southeastern
and Luck willfully violated section 10 (b) and rule X-lOB-5 of the
act, that Southeastern, aided and abetted by Luck, violated section
15 (c) (1) of the act and rule X-15CI-2 (a) and (b) thereunder, and
that Southeastern violated section 17 (a) of the act and rule X-17 A-3
thereunder.
Of the remaining revocations several involved different types of
violations. Three were based on findings of willful failure to file
financial reports and one was based on the filing of a false financial
report and on the willful violation of rule X-15C3-1, which requires
brokers and dealers to maintain net capital of not less than 5 percent
of their aggregate indebtedness.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

The broker-dealer inspection program, initiated by the Commission
in 1940 under section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, which
authorizes the Commission to make periodic, special and other examination of the books and records of brokers and dealers, is one of the
Commission's important implements in the detection and prevention
of violations of law by broker-dealers. These inspections are conducted by the staff of the Commission's regional offices. They are
sometimes limited to a particular phase of a firm's operations, such
as its financial condition or its method of handling particular accounts,
but generally they involve full scale examination of all characteristic
activities, culminating in a report on the extent to which its operations
are in compliance with the standards established by the act and rules.
During theJast~5years_a_total_of3,621_broker-dealer inspections were

condition were reported in 33 inspections. Investigations of 18 firms
were undertaken as a result of information obtamed during these
examinations. Two of these have gone out of business, the registrations of 2 others have been revoked, and 1 has been enjoined from
engaging in certain fraudulent practices and ordered by-the court to
establish and maintain the books and records required by rule
X-17A-3.
In addition to inquiry into the various matters referred to above,
the inspection procedures call for a test check to determine whether
the firm inspected deals fairly with customers at prices reasonably
related to the current market. These tests checks have a dual purpose-first to enforce the principle, judicially established in Charles E.
Hughes &: 00., Inc. v. 8. E. 0., that it is fraudulent for a dealer to sell
securities to customers, or buy from them, at prices not reasonably
related to the market unless he discloses the variation from the
market," and second to determine the effectiveness of the rules of the
NASD relating to fair prices and fair and equitable principles of
trade."

ANNUAL

REPORT

During the 5 years prior to the decision in Charles E. Hughes &: Co.,

Inc. v. S. E. C. in 1944 the Commission revoked the registrations of
nearly a score of brokers and dealers for fraudulent transactions in
securities at prices not reasonably related to the current market.
While the number of such proceedings has diminished there are still
some indications of overreaching and some evidence that it has taken
a new form. The NASD is vitally interested in the problem and the
Commission is encouraged to believe that with the association's continued cooperation a practical and effective solution will be found.
Inspections of Broker-Dealers in Hawaii

The Commission has received occasional complaints over the years
from citizens residing in Hawaii, alleging securities frauds and sales
of securities without registration.
Recently the complaints have increased in volume and acerbity, and at the request of the Territorial
Government of Hawaii, the Better Business Bureau, and other organizations and individuals, the Commission sent two staff members to
investigate these charges. .An attorney and an accountant arrived
early in 1949 and promptly found evidences of fraud in the sale of
securities, and sales of securities without registration, by a score of
persons and organizations. The attorney then returned to Washington to report on the situation, and the accountant remained to follow
up additional leads and to inspect broker-dealers whose activities
had not been checked in the 15 years' existence of the Commission.
The accountant's investigations disclosed that several brokerdealers were engaged in business without registration.
In a number
of instances complete audits were made of registered broker-dealers
and necessary changes were effected to meet the requirements of the
securities laws. The accountant was also instrumental in causing
several organizations to increase their capital for the safety of
investors.
The Commission's representatives were able to aid in the tightening
of Hawaiian securities laws by assisting in the preparation of amendments to the existing laws. It is hoped that the amendments enacted
will increase the protection of the Hawaiian public with respect to
securities matters.
The survey in Hawaii indicates a need for the establishment of an
officeor, in the alternative, occasional trips by staff members from the
mainland in order to enforce compliance with the securities laws.
The Commission has appealed for funds in order to protect the
citizens of Hawaii adequately against fraudulent securities practices
and sales of unregistered issues.
Financial Reports

Brokers and dealers are required by rule X-17A-5 to file reports of
financial condition during each calendar year. During the 1949
fiscal year a total of 3,659 financial reports were filed. Each report
is examined to determine, among other things, whether there has
been any violation of rule X-15C3-1, which provides that the aggregate indebtedness of a broker or dealer shall not exceed 20 times his
net capital. When deficiencies are found steps are taken immediately
to secure compliance. This is an important phase of the Commission's activities in affording protection to customers.

60

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Failure to file the reports as required is an infraction of the rule and
may lead to disciplinary proceedings. Frequently, small firms doing
relatively little or no business fail to file reports on time. These are
handled' by a procedure for cancellation of registration when the
registrant's inactivity is established. Informal procedures are frequently used to procure filing by those who do not furnish reports on
time. In some instances action becomes necessary to revoke
registration.
SUPERVISION OF NASD ACTIVITY
Membership

National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) has been
the only securities association registered as such with the Commission
under section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act. In the 5-year
period ended June 30, 1949, membership in the NASD increased by
502, as shown below:

Disciplinary Actions

During the] 949 fiscal year the Commission received from the NASD
reports of final action in seven disciplinary cases involving formal
complaints against members, in addition to various interim reports or
reports of informal action. In six of these seven cases the NASD
committee having jurisdiction had found violations of rules of fair
practice and imposed various penalties on the firms, and in one instance on a registered representative also named in the complaint. In
the remaining case the committee had found that no violations had
occurred and dismissed the complaint. The penalties included expulsion in two cases; two firms were each fined $500, one of which was
also censured; two firms were censured and a registered representative
of one of them was fined $100. Such disciplinary decisions are subject to review by the Commission, on its own motion or upon application by any aggrieved person, but no such review was undertaken in
any of these cases in the 1949 fiscal year nor was any such matter
pending before the Commission at the year's end."
Comparative data on the number and outcome of disciplinary
cases, final decisions on which were received by the Commission in
each of the last five fiscal year", appear below in tabular form:

The Commission continued its practice of referring to the N ASD
facts disclosed in the course of its broker-dealer inspection program
which would indicate a possible violation of the NASD rules of fair
practice. Occasionally, independent investigations by the NASD
result in the filing of formal complaints against members. More
often, such matters are settled by informal means, such as a critical
discussion with the firm involved and the receipt of assurance that
the business practices of the firm would be altered to comply with
NASD and Commission requirements. In other instances additional
investigation indicates that no disciplinary action is appropriate.

Registered Representative Rule

The NASD adopted rules, effective January 15, 1946, which in
effect require the registration with the NASD as "registered representatives" of all partners, officers, and other employees of brokerdealer firms who, generally, do business directly with the public. IS
The broad purpose of these rules was to bind all registered represent11 Although the amendments were approved by the board of governors and by the affirmative vote of
the requisite majority of the N ASD membership, the program was attacked by Individuals and groups in
the securities Industry as inconsistent with the language Ofthe Securities Exchange Act and on the ground
that it would create a form ofsubstandard membership in which the obligations, but not the benefits of membership, were forced on persons who had no voice In the NASD. After pnblic hearing, the Commission
held the proposed amendments to be consistent with the statutory requirements and announced that It
would not disapprove them. In so aetmg, the Commission took the position that when it failed to exercise
Its veto power over proposed amendments to N ASD roles, the stetute did not require the Issuance Ofa

The increase of 1,021 registrations in the 1949 fiscal year was the
balance of 3,599 terminations of registration, 1,634 re-registrations,
and 2,986 initial registrations.
Commission Review of Actions on Membership

The qualifications for registered representative status under NASD
rules are identical with the statutory qualifications for membership.
Both provide that a petition for admission to or continuation in membership can be brought before the Commission by or on behalf of any
NASD applicant or member who controls or is controlled by a disqualified partner, officer, or employee. Such a petition may raise
the question whether it is in the public interest for the Commission
to approve, or direct, admission to or continuation in membership
notwithstanding control of the petitioner of or by a disqualified person.
In the 1949 fiscal year six such "approval or direction" cases
were decided by the Commission. a Five cases, involving six individuals, were decided on findings by the Commission that each person
was validly disqualified because he had been the "cause" of an order
of revocation of broker-dealer registration by the Commission, but
that the individuals need not be permanently excluded from the securities business due to the nature of their proposed employment and
the degree of supervision to be exercised over them. On this basis
the Commission, by order, approved the continuation in membership
of the member firms even though they employed the disqualified
persons."
The sixth case concerned J. A. Sisto & Co. The controlling partner,
JosephA. Sisto, was disqualified from membership because of expulsion
from the New York Stock Exchange in 1938 for conduct inconsistent
with just and equitable principles of trade." A petition was filed on

behalf of the firm by the NASD, together with its affirmative recommendation that the Commission approve the firm's admission to
membership. In considering the petition the Commission noted
the period of time which had elapsed since the earlier petitions and
that neither Sisto nor his firm had been involved in any proceedings
respecting their conduct in the securities business in the interim
period. Under these circumstances, and having given weight to the
findings and recommendation of the NASD, the Commission approved
the admission of the firm to membership."
CHANGES IN RULES,

REGULATIONS,

AND FORMS

During the 5 years since July 1,1944, the Commission has amended
and revised various rules, regulations, and forms under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 as changing circumstances have required.
The principal changes made during this period or now under consideration are summarized below:
Changes Made During the 1949 Fiscal Year

Revision oj registration and reporting rules.-A
thoroughgoing
revision of the rules governing the preparation, form, content and
filing of applications for registration and annual and other reports
under the Act was published on December 17, 1948. These rules are
applicable to registration and reporting by issuers having securities
listed on a national securities exchange and also to reporting by
registrants under the Securities Act of 1933 which are subject to
the reporting requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
The revision clarified and brought up to date all of the rules pertaining
to registration and reporting. The revision also abolished certain
obsolete rules and integrated into the General Rules and Regulations
certain ISenera! requirements previously contained in the several
forms WIth respect to the preparation, form, content, and filing of
applications for registration and annual and other reports.
Prior to the revision of these rules registrants under the Securities
Act of 1933 which were subject to reporting requirements were
required to file only annual reports if they had no securities listed
and registered on a national securities exchange. IS The revised
rules put such registrants on the same reporting basis as issuers
having securities listed and registered on an exchange, so that such
registrants now file in addition to annual reports the same current
and quarterly reports as are filed by listed companies.
Rule X-16B-3.-On March 6, 1949, the Commission published an
amended rule X-16B-3 which provides an exemption from section 16
(b) of the act with respect to the acquisition of certain equity securities
issued to directors and officers as a part of their remuneration.
Section 16 (b) of the act provides, in general, that where any
director or officer of the issuer of a registered equity security, or any
beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of such security, has realized
a profitl'from any purchase and sale, or sale and purchase, of any
equity security of the issuer within any period of less than six months
such profits may be recovered by the issuer.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The exemption provided by the amended rule is subject to several
conditions designed to limit it to bona fide bonus, profit-sharing
and similar remuneration plans. These conditions are, briefly, that
the plan must have been approved by security holders; that the
security must have been acquired solely in consideration of services;
that the amount of securities acquired by each director or officer must
have been determined by an independent committee of three or more
persons or by the board of directors; and finally, that the exemption
is not available unless the amount of funds or securities distributed
or set aside for a fiscal year pursuant to the plan is related to the net
profits of the issuer and its subsidiaries for such fiscal year.
Changes Made During the 1945-48Fiscal Years

A summary of the more significant rule changes in the 1945-48
fiscal years follows.
Adoption of Rule X-16B-4.-Another exemption from section 16 (b)
of the act is provided by rule X-16B-4, which was published by the
Commission on August 28, 1946. This rule exempts certain transactions by public utility holding companies and their subsidiaries from
the civil liability provisions of section 16 (b). The new rule exempts
from section 16 (b) any transaction by a holding company registered
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 or by any subsidiary of such a company where both the purchase and sale have been
approved or permitted by the Commission under that act.
Adoption of Rule X-160-2.-An exemption from section 16 (c) of
the act was adopted by the Commission on March 20, 1946. This
section makes it unlawful under certain circumstances for any beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any class of any equity security
which is registered on a national securities exchange, or for any
director or officer of the issuer of any such security, to sell any equity
security of that issuer if he does not own the security sold or owns the
security but does not deliver it against the sale within a specified
time. The new rule is designed to exclude from the prohibition of
section 16 (c) certain technical short positions which arise purely as
an incident to participation by one of the specified classes of persons
(or some dealer firm with which such a person is connected) in either
a primary or secondary distribution by a person in a control relationship with the issuer.
Revision of Pro:r;yRules.-On December 17, 1947, the Commission
published a completely revised edition of its proxy rules under section
14 (a) of the act and of regulation X-14. These rules are applicable
to the solicitation of proxies, authorizations, and consents with respect
to any security listed and registered on a national securities exchange.
They also apply to the solicitation of proxies by public utility holding
companies registered under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 and their subsidiaries and to investment companies registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The purpose of the revision was to clarify and simplify the rules and to make certain changes
in the requirements which the Commission's experience in administration had shown to be desirable without making any fundamental
departure from the principles of the rules as previously in effect.
Certain further amendments to these rules, adopted on November
5, 1948, effected principally a reduction in the amount of information

FIFTEENTH

REPORT

called for with respect to the remuneration of directors and officers of
issuers subject to the rules.
Qua,rterly Reports.-On
July 23, 1945, the Commission adopted a
new rule which required listed companies whose war business amounted
to more than 25 percent of total sales in the last preceding fiscal year
to file a quarterly report on Form 8-K disclosing the total volume of
unfilled orders at the beginning and end of each fiscal quarter, and the
total amount of sales during the quarter showing separately sales
made pursuant to war contracts.
This rule was intended primarily
to inform the public of the effect upon listed companies of declining
war business.
By 1946 the rule had served its purpose as a temporary postwar
measure. It was then replaced, on March 28, 1946, by a new rule
which required all listed companies to file regular quarterly reports of
their gross sales and operating revenues. These requirements were
extended on December 17, 1948, to registrants under the Securities
Act of 1933 who are required to file annual and other reports pursuant
to section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. This extension of the requirement was made in connection with the general
revision, referred to above, of the rules governing the preparation,
form, content and filing of applications for registration and annual
and other reports.
Proposed Revision of Registration and Reporting Forms

The Commission presently has under consideration a broad program
for the revision of all of its forms for registration and reporting under
the act. The purpose of this revision is to bring the requirements of
the various forms up to date and to abolish a number of forms which
are no longer necessary in the administration of the act. Several of
these forms were published in preliminary draft form on March 11,
1949, for the purpose of obtaining informed comments and suggestions
thereon.
The comments and suggestions received are now being
studied.
LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT

The issues involved in the Commission's court activities during the
last five years were somewhat different from those which had predominated during the first ten years of its existence. Some of the
early problems were solved by court determinations which crystallized
the application of the statutes to various activities.
New issues were
presented by rules adopted by the Commission; primarily by rule
X-lOB-5, which defines the scope of the anti-fraud provision of section 10 of the act, and regulation X-14, establishing standards relating
to the solicitation of proxies under section 14 (a) of the act.
Court actions during this period included: (1) Injunction actions
brought by the Commission in the Federal district courts to restrain
broker-dealers and others from violating those provisions of the act
and the Commission's rules designed to protect securityholders and
the customers of broker-dealers; (2) appellate court actions on petitions to review orders of the Commission; and (3) actions between
private parties involving the acts administered by the Commission
in which the Commission participated as amicus curiae to express its
views on questions of construction.
The substantive problems in-

66

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

volved are discussed below under the following headings: (1) The
regulation of broker-dealers; (2) section 16 (b), the recovery of insiders' short-swing profits; (3) rule X-10B-5, the antifraud provision; and (4) regulation X-14, the proxy rules. In addition there is
reported separately below the Commission's investigation of an offering of Kaiser-Frazer stock and litigation with Otis & Co. which arose
therefrom.
Broker.Dealer Cases

As a result of the Commission's broad regulatory duties with respect
to approximately 4,000 registered broker-dealers the largest single
category of judicial proceedings under the act involved breaches of
obligations to customers by such persons and by others who engaged
in business as brokers and dealers without being registered as required
by the statute.
A number of injunction actions were obtained against broker-dealers
who were doing buiness while insolvent, thereby jeopardizing customers' funds and securities." Wherever feasible, in insolvency cases,
the Commission has sought the appointment of a receiver in order to
preserve assets for customers." In one such case the family of the
broker, who had died, made an assignment of $30,000 for the benefit of
creditors."
Other cases in which the Commission obtained injunctions involved
secret profits made by a broker-dealer professing to act as agent for
his customers; 22 charging prices which bore no reasonable relationship to the current market prices; 23 wrongfully hypothecating or
converting customers' securities; 24 making misrepresentations to customers or omitting to state material facts in connection with purchases and sales of securities; 26 and failing to keep required books and
records." or refusing to permit them to be examined by the Commission's representatives."
The Commission has also obtained judgments against a number of persons to enjoin them from engaging in'
business as brokers or dealers without being registered."
A very important case from the standpoint of the relationship of
the securities dealer and his customer was Arleen W. Hughes v. S. E. O.

This case arose on a petition to the Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia to review an order of the Commission revoking the petitioner's registration as a broker-dealer. The Commission had held
that it was fraud for Mrs. Hughes, who was registered both as a
broker-dealer under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and as an
investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, to
sell her own securities to her investment advisory clients without
fully disclosing that her interests were in some respects adverse to
their interests. This disclosure, the Commission held, should have
included the capacity in which she acted, i. e., whether as principal
(dealer) or agent (broker), the cost of the securities to her, and the
current market price of such securities. Another point raised on the
appeal was whether it was lawful for the Commission to impose
greater duties of disclosure on a broker-dealer who is also a registered
investment adviser than would otherwise be the case. The Commission withheld the entry of its order of revocation for a reasonable
time to permit Mrs. Hughes to correct her methods of doing business.
Changes which she thereupon proposed were deemed inadequate as a
matter of law, however, and the order of revocation was entered,
from which the appeal was taken. The court of appeals sustained
the Commission on all the points involved. 29
Another case related to the revocation of the broker-dealer registration of Norris and Hirshberg, Ine., of Atlanta, Ga. The Commission found that the firm had engaged in activities which were illegal
under the antifraud provisions of both the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The firm had fixed prices for
a group of securities whose market it controlled without disclosing
that fact to customers, had dealt as a principal with uninformed
customers and customers who had given it powers of attorney, and
had traded excessively for accounts for which it had discretionary
powers. The firm appealed the Commission's action to the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia. in 1946. Various procedural
matters were litigated at length before the Court reached the case on
its merits. The most significant of the procedural questions was an
attempt by the petitioner to compel the Commission to include in
the transcript of record a summary of the evidence which, it alleged,
the Commission's independent staff of opinion writers had prepared
for the use of the individual commissioners. The petitioners sought
also to inquire into the decisional processes of the Commission to
determine how various items in the record to which it objected had
been treated by the Commission. The Court of Appeals denied these
requests and an application by the petitioner to the Supreme Court
for a writ of certiorari was also denied." After hearing argument on
the merits, the court affirmed the decision of the Commission, and
pointed out that the statutes involved were not designed to require
the Commission, in disciplining broker-dealers for fraudulent activities, to find every element of common law fraud." This case was
also the first court review of a Commission finding of manipulation

in the over-the-counter market as distinguished from the markets on
the national securities exchanges."
Two other cases initiated by the Commission during the past 5
years involved the manipulation of prices on securities exchanges.
In Thornton &: Go. v. S. E. G. the Commission revoked the firm's
broker-dealer registration upon finding that it had violated the antimanipulation provisions of section 9 (a) of the act in effecting "wash
sales" in two stocks traded on the Chicago Stock Exchange, raising
their prices and creating apparent trading activity, which was followed
by sales of the stocks in the over-the-counter market at prices based
on the false exchange market prices in violation of sections 10 (b)
and 15 (c) (1) of the act. The Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit, on a petition for review, affirmed the Commission's order
during the 1949 fiscal year.33 In S. E. G. v. Bennett and Federal Gorp.
the Commission sought an injunction to restrain the defendants from
manipulating the exchange market for a security while a registration
statement was pending under the Securities Act of 1933 with respect
to a proposed offering of a large block of the stock "at the market." 34
A preliminary injunction was denied, but Bennett thereafter consented
to a permanent injunction against Federal Corporation (which he
controlled) and the Commission concurred in the dismissal of the
complaint against Bennett individually.
Acker v. Schulte and Schmolka v. Schulte, which did not involve
broker-dealers, were actions under section 9 (a) of the act instituted by
stockholders of Park and Tilford, Inc. against its former president for
damages resulting from the alleged manipulation of the stock of the
company on the New York Stock Exchange. These cases resulted in
the first judicial construction of that clause of section 9 (e) which provides that the court may require an undertaking for the payment of
costs from either party in a civil action by a person damaged as a
result of a violation of section 9. The Commission, in its brief, argued
as amicus curiae that in order to preclude the statutory provision from
operating as a barrier to suits under section 9, the party seeking security for costs should be required to show by clear evidence that the suit
had been brought in bad faith. The court adopted this position."
Another new development in the broker-dealer field during the past
5 years was a series of actions brought by the Commission alleging
violation of regulation T, the regulation promulgated by the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System under section 7 (c) of the
act for the purpose of preventing excessive use of credit in purchasing
or carrying securities. The first cases of this category were three
companion actions filed by the Commission in the United States District Court at Cleveland which involved firms in Youngstown and
Cleveland, Ohio, Pittsburgh, and New York City, and several individuals and an investment company. Final judgments were entered
against all the defendants."

securities was S. E. O. v. Trapp, an injunction action brought against
an individual who was selling oil royalties after the Commission had
revoked his broker-dealer registration.
In that case the district court
in North Dakota entered an injunction which judicially established: (1)
That it is fraudulent for a dealer to sell oil royalties at prices in excess
of the probable returns to purchasers, as computed on the basis of
reasonable estimates of the recoverable oil underlying the tracts covered by the royalties; and (2) that, as the Commission had held in an
earlier administrative proceeding, it is fraudulent for a dealer to sell oil
royalties at prices bearing no reasonable relationship to his contemporaneous cost. Such practices were held to be in violation of section
15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act and sections 17 (a) (2) and
(3) of the Securities Act of 1933.37
Among the frauds uncovered in the course of the Commission's
routine inspection of broker-dealers' books and records was that
enjoined in S. E. O. v. Oaplan, Junger, Anderson &; 00.38 The following scheme was employed by the defendants: The securities trader for a
large investment company would advise accomplices in brokerage
offices in advance when the company was about to make substantial
purchases and sales of securities. On purchases, the accomplices
would use dummy accounts to buy up the securities in question and as
a result would be in a position to resell them to the investment
company at higher prices when it sought to make its purchases; on
sales, reverse steps were taken. Through this scheme, which was
operated without the knowledge of the investment company, the
individuals involved profited to the extent of approximately $300,000
from trading profits and commissions.
Cases Based on Section 16 (b) of the Act

The past 5 years have seen the emergence of section 16 (b) of the
Securities Exchange Act as an important protection to the small
stockholder against trading abuses by corporate insiders. Under that
section a stockholder of a corporation may sue in its behalf to recover
profits made by insiders as a result of short-term trading in that corporation's equity securities. Until the decision in Smolowe v. Delendo
of section 16 (b) was undeterOorporationa9 the constitutionality
mined. That case not only upheld the constitutionality of the section
but provided as a touchstone for the solution of problems of construction of the section the determination whether all "tendency to evil"
would be removed. Mostof the litigation arising under section 16 (b)
has been resolved in accordance with that criterion.
Although the Commission is not responsible for the enforcement
of section 16 (b), it has participated as amicus curiae, either at the
request of the court or on its own initiative, in actions involving
important questions of interpretation of the section. Thus, in Park
&: Tilford, Inc. v, Schulte '" it urged upon the court the necessity for
construing the act to prevent holders of convertible preferred stock
from profiting from inside information by converting their stock into

common stock prior to an expected rise in the market and thereafter
selling the common stock after the anticipated rise took place. The
question before the court was phrased in terms of whether the conversion of preferred stock into common stock by a controlling stockholder was a "purchase" within the meaning of section 16 (b). The
court held that it was a purchase, and over $400,000 was paid to
the corporation as profits realized from the trading.
In one case the court asked the Commission whether it considered
stock disposed of by gift to constitute a "sale" within the meaning
of section 16 (b). The Commission, in a letter, expressed the view
that Congress did intend to include gifts within the scope of section
16 (b), but that no profit would be recoverable unless the stock were
subsequently sold by the donee at a price higher than that which the
donor had paid for the stock. The court did not adopt the reasoning
of the Commission and held that the gift was not a sale."
On several occasions, participation by the Commission in actions
under section 16 (b) has been necessary in order to clarify the construction of other sections of the act challenged by one of the parties
in the action. Thus, it has urged that section 27 of the act should
be construed to give the federal courts exclusive jurisdiction over all
actions arising under the Securities Exchange Act and to urge that
the venue provisions be broadly construed, permitting section 16 (b)
actions to be brought wherever the transactions occurred. In these
respects the construction advanced by the Commission has been
adopted by the courts."
The information upon which private actions under section 16 (b)
are based as a rule comes from the reports of changes in ownership
which corporate insiders are required to file with the Commission
under section 16 (a). During the last 5 years the Commission for
the first time had to resort to its authority under section 21 (f) to
obtain mandatory injunctions to enforce compliance with the reporting
requirements of section 16 (a).43 These cases also constituted the
first actions brought to enjoin violations of section 20 (c), which
section makes it unlawful for corporate insiders to hinder the corporations' filing of reports regarding changes in their holdings.
The Commission has also appeared in a section 16 (b) action, where
section 16 (a) reports had not been filed within the specified time,
to support the right of a stockholder to sue more than 2 years after
the profits were realized by the insider even though the statute provides that the cause of action is barred after 2 years. The Commission successfully contended that the Congress did not intend that the
statute of limitations begin to run until the insider has disclosed his
profits, and, since the suit was brought within 2 years after the disclosure had been made in that case, that the action had been instituted
in time."

Cases Based on the Anti-fraud

71

REPORT

Provisions of Rule X-IOB-5

In 1942 the Commission adopted rule X-10B-5, which implements
section 10 of the Securities Exchange Act by prohibiting fraud in the
purchase or sale of securities. During the past 5 years this rule has
been the subject of frequent construction by the courts both in actions
instituted by the Commission and in private civil actions, in a number
of which the Commission participated as amicus curiae. The most
frequent situation in which the rule has been invoked has been that
in which controlling stockholders or the management of an issuer
sought to take advantage of smaller stockholders by purchasing their
securities from them while suppressing pertinent information concerning the corporation's business, the market value of its securities, or
other vital information.
Wherever feasible the Commission has sought to restrain such
fraudulent transactions before full consummation, to curtail injury to
minority stockholders, and in some instances this has resulted in agreement by the wrongdoing insiders to rescind the transactions."
Nevertheless, in many cases the transactions are consummated before discovery by the Cornmission."
One injunction obtained by the Commission during the 1949 fiscal
year involved an unusual scheme which operated as a fraud on brokers
and dealers." The defendant entered orders for purchases and sales
with various brokers and dealers with no intention either to pay for
the securities ordered to be purchased or to deliver the securities
ordered to be sold. If, on purchase orders, the securities increased in
value before the settlement date he would order them sold and demand
the profit; otherwise he would default. On sale orders, he would do
the opposite. As a result, losses were incurred by the brokers and
dealers on the defaulted transactions.
A significant private action during the period involving rule X-1 OB-5
was that of Kardon v. National Gypsum 00., in which the Commission
participated as amicus curiae.4B The Commission filed a brief in which
it argued that there is an individual right of action for damages
resulting from a violation of rule X-10B-5, (1) on the basis of the
general common law rule that members of a class for whose protection
a statutory duty is created may sue for injury resulting from its
breach and that the common law will supply a remedy if the statute
gives none, or, (2) under section 29 (b) of the act, which provides that
contracts in violation of the act shall be void. The Commission argued
also that Congress intended that section 10 of the act apply to the
securities of a small, closely held corporation, as well as to those of
large corporations whose securities are widely held. The district court

adopted the positions taken by the Commission, and the Kardon
decision has since been followed in a number of private actions."
Another private fraud action based on this rule is the pending case
of Speed v. Transamerica Corp.50 In connection with a motion for
summary judgment the Commission urged that there is a violation of
the rule when a controlling stockholder buys stock from minority
holders without disclosing to them material facts affecting the value
of the stock (here the greatly augmented value of the corporation's
principal asset, its tobacco inventory).
Cases Based on Regulation X-14-The

Proxy Rules

The second substantial group of cases based on rules of the Commission are those involving regulation X-14, which prescribes rules concerning the solicitation of proxies, consents, and authorizations in
connection with securities of companies SUbject either to the Securities
Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940, or the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. While several questions of
construction of the regulations were brought to the courts before the
period under review, a number of important questions have been
adjudicated during the past few years. One was the principle established in Okin v. S. E. C.51 that the proxy rules apply to a letter which
is written as the first step in a plan ending in a solicitation and which
prepares the way for its success, even though the letter itself does not
request .proxies. This principle was also applied during the current
year in S. E. C. v. Topping.52 In another case the principle was established that the Commission can obtain an injunction to restrain the
use of proxies obtained in violation of the proxy rules.53
An especially significant proxy case during the period was that of
S. E. C. v. Tramsamerica Oorp., an action brought by the Commission
to compel the defendant corporation to resolicit proxies originally
obtained as a result of solicitations which failed to include proposals
which a minority stockholder sought to have brought before the annual
meeting. It was ultimately held by the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit that the management's attempt to block the stockholder's
proposals by declining to include them in the notice of meeting was
contrary to the purpose of Congress in the Securities Exchange Act
to prevent the control of corporations by a very few persons. 54
The question whether a stockholder, rather than the Commission,
may bring an action for an injunction based on violation of the proxy
rules was raised in Phillips v. The Uniied Corporation. The Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae taking the position that the court
had jurisdiction to entertain such an action founded upon alleged
violations of the Commission's proxy rules promulgated under the
.. SlaD/n v. Germanttnon Fire Inwrance

Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, but that in the light of
the Commission's primary responsibility for the enforcement of its
rules any injunction action it might bring should take precedence and
an injunction action by a stockholder should not be entertained unless
he had exhausted his administrative
remedy by :first bringing his
complaint to the Commission. The court accepted this construction
of the act.66 Another action involving the Commission's proxy rules
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, North American Utility Securities Oorporation v. Posen, is discussed elsewhere in
this report in the section on litigation under that statute.
The position of the Commission was sustained in a number of
additional actions on the proxy rules during the last 5 years. In one
of these the Commission argued that a proxy statement is not false or
misleading simply because it fails to state all possible alternatives to
a course of action for which the management seeks approval."
In
another, the New York Supreme Court sustained the Commission's
contention that a proxy solicitation was defective when it did not
disclose that the directors elected had agreed prior to the solicitation
to resign in favor of another slate of candidates."
THE KAISER-FRAZER

INVESTIGATION
AND THE LITIGATION
WITH OTIS & CO.

One of the most extensive litigations in the history of the Commission, from the standpoint of sheer number of court proceedings
involved, has been the litigation with Otis & Co. arising out of an
investigation of a stock offering of Kaiser-Fraser Corp.
During February of 1948, a public offering of some 1,500,000 shares
of common stock of Kaiser-Frazer Corp. was withdrawn after KaiserFrazer had expended about $2,500,000 in an unsuccessful effort to
stabilize the market.
By the terms of the underwriting contract, the
3 underwriters who were participants in the offering had agreed to
take 900,000 of the shares outright and the rest on a "best efforts"
basis. One of the conditions of the contract was that there should be
no material litigation pending against Kaiser-Frazer as of 10 a. m. on
February 9, which was the settlement date under the contract.
Shortly before 10 a. m. on February 9-several days after the withdrawal of the offering-one
James F. Masterson, a Kaiser-Frazer
stockholder and Philadelphia attorney, filed a lawsuit in Detroit
charging mismanagement on the part of the officers and directors of
Kaiser-Frazer and demanding, among other things, an injunction
against the sale of the stock. On the basis, at least in part, of this
lawsuit, two of the underwriters-Otis
& Co. and First California
Corp.-refused
to go through with the contract.
Thereafter the Commission instituted a private investigation, and
soon a public investigation, into the general subject of the KaiserFrazer stock offering. The purpose of the public investigation, as set
forth in the Commission's order, wad to determine whether there had
been any violations of the securities acts and whether there was any
basis for the formulation of new rules by the Commission or for the
recommendation of new legislation to the Congress, During the

COMMISSION

spring and summer of 1948 hearings were held in various cities during
which some 5,000 pages of testimony were taken and numerous
exhibits introduced.
One of the first lawsuits filed was instituted in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of Ohio by Portsmouth Steel
Corp. (the chairman of the board of this corporation is Cyrus S. Eaton,
who is also controlling stockholder of Otis & Co.) in an attempt to
enjoin The Ohio Consolidated Telephone Co. from complying with a
Commission subpoena directing the production of certain long-distance
telephone slips. The Commission intervened, and after the service of
an amended subpoena the complaint was dismissed."
Another action was instituted at about the same time, this one by
the Commission, when two Cleveland attorneys named Harrison and
Hull, who were shown during the investigation to have inquired
about the Masterson suit at the courthouse in Detroit before the
suit was filed refused to identify their client on the ground of the
attorney-client privilege. vVhen the United States District Court
for the Eastern District of Michigan indicated it would enter an
order against the attorneys unless they testified," they revealed that
their client was Eaton.
In subsequent hearings in Washington, however, Harrison and Hull
declined to divulge their actual communications with Eaton, again on
the ground of the attorney-client privilege. The Commission instructed its presiding officer at the investigation to rule that the
privilege was unavailable because the evidence theretofore adduced
during the investigation showed prima facie that the attorneys had
been retained for a fraudulent purpose. Upon the continued refusal
of Harrison and Hull to testify, the Commission applied to the United
States District Court for the District of Columbia for an order compelling their testimony. The entire record of the investi~ation to date
was introduced as an exhibit. Otis & Co. and Eaton intervened in
this proceeding, without objection by the Commission, and filed a
counterclaim in which they demanded that the Commission be
enjoined from continuing with its public investigation. Judge Morris
of the District Court dismissed the counterclaim, but also denied the
enforcement order sought by: the Commission on the ground that the
record of the investigation did not show prima facie that the Masterson
suit had been inspired by Eaton."
In his opinion Judge Morris
emphasized that, in the absence of cross-examination in the record of
the investigation, he had subjected the record "to the strictest scrutiny
for possible ambiguity and equivocation." 61 No appeal from this
decision was taken by either side.
On August 11, 1948, while Judge Morris still had the subpoena
case under consideration, the Commission instituted a proceeding
under sections 15 (b) and 15A (1) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act
to determine whether the registration of Otis & Co. as a brokerdealer should be revoked and whether the firm should be suspended
or expelled from the National Association of Securities Dealers for
possible violations of the securities acts., Thereupon Otis & Co.,

jurisdiction of the District Court in the pending subpoena action,
obtained from Judge Letts of the United States District Court for
the District of Columbia a temporary injunction restraining the
Commission from conducting the revocation proceeding pending
Judge Morris' decision in the subpoena case."
When Judge Morris refused to compel Harrison and Hull to testify,
the Commission decided to pursue the revocation proceeding-in
which its final order, if adverse to Otis & Co., would be subject to
judicial review in an appropriate court of appeals-rather
than to
appeal Judge Morris' ruling. Thereupon Otis & Co. and Eaton
instituted a new action in the District Court for the District of
Columbia to enjoin the holding of this proceeding to the extent that
it might be concerned with the filing of the Masterson suit, on the
ground that the decision in the subpoena case was res judicata on
this question. This new action also came before Judge Morris, who,
on November 12, 1948, dismissed the complaint from the bench."
On the same day Otis & Co. appealed to the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit and obtained from that court an injunction against the Commission's proceeding pending the outcome of
the appeal.
On June 1, 1949, the Court of Appeals held that, because the complaint alleged that the Commission had no evidence that had not
already been considered by Judge Morris, and because this allegation
was admitted for purposes of the Commission's motion to dismiss
the complaint, the doctrine of resjudicata was applicable. Accordingly,
the case was remanded with instructions that the injunction be granted
unless the Commission should deny the allegation that no new evidence would be introduced at the hearing. 54 On August 9, 1949, the
Solicitor General, on behalf of the Commission, filed a petition for a
writ of certiorari in the Supreme Court, and Otis & Co. filed a brief
in opposition in due course. On October 17,1949, the Supreme Court
took the unusual step of rendering a per curiam decision lIS in which
it granted the petition for a writ of certiorari and at the same
time reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals, on the authority
of Myers v. Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, 303 U. S. 41 (1938),
and similar cases.
Concurrently there had been in progress considerable litigation in
which the Commission and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (NASD) had been joined as defendants. The NASD
is an association of securities dealers registered under provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act designed to promote just and equitable
principles of trade in the securities industry. The Cleveland District
Business Conduct Committee of the association, of which Otis & Co.
is a member, had instituted its own investigation of the circumstances
surrounding the Kaiser-Frazer stock offering shortly after the failure
of the offering, and had demanded that Otis & Co. and Eaton disclose
the communications between Eaton and his attorneys concerning the
Masterson suit .

COMMISSION

After this demand was refused, the NASD's district issued a complaint charging Otis & Co., Eaton and William R. Daley, president of
Otis & Co. (the individual respondents in their capacity as representatives of Otis & Co. registered with the NASD) with violation of a
rule of the NASD which provides that refusal of a member or registered representative to submit any required reports with regard to a
matter under investigation shall of itself be sufficient cause for suspending or cancelling membership.
At this point Otis & Co. and Eaton, instead of filing an answer to
this complaint, went to the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia, where the Commission's subpena-enforcing
action was pending before Judge Morris, and obtained from Judge
Keech and Judge Letts of that court, respectively, a restraining order
and a preliminary injunction making the NASD a party to the
subpena action for the purpose of restraining it from attempting to
obtain such communication. The subsequent decision of Judge
Morris automatically terminated this injunction. A hearing on the
complaint followed, after which the district committee ordered the
respondents suspended for a period of 2 years, unless they should
furnish the desired information sooner.
Otis & Co., Eaton, and Daley thereupon instituted a new action in
the District Court for the District of Columbia, the third in that
court. In this action they sought to compel vacation of the district
committee's suspension order and to enjoin the NASD and the Commission from taking any action to compel the disclosure of the communications in question, again on the ground that the decision of
Judgp Morris in the subpena action had rendered the subject matter
res Judicata. The Commission was joined as a defendant on the
theory that it had conspired with the NASD. The Commission and
the NASD separately moved to dismiss this new complaint on the
ground that the plaintiffs had not followed the procedure for review
of NASD disciplinary proceedings which is specifically set forth in
the Securities Exchange Act and in the NASD rules adopted thereunder. Under the act and the NASD rules any person disciplined
by a district committee of the N ASD may appeal to the board of
governors of the NASD, thence to the Commission, and thence to
the appropriate court of appeals. There are provisions for automatic
stays of the district committee's action pending review by the board
of governors and the Commission and a further stay may be sought
from the court of appeals pending judicial review of the Commission's
final order, if any. Thus, the Commission and the NASD contended,
the plaintiffs would remain in good standing in the NASD pending a
final determination by the proper court of appeals, but they could not
short-circuit the statutory method of review by seeking an injunction
in the district court.
The plaintiffs obtained postponement of the argument on the
motion to dismiss, and in the meantime took depositions on the
merits of the case over the opposition of the Commission and the
NASD and obtained a temporary restraining order against certain
alleged "publicity" on the part of the NASD.66 The motion to

PARTIIII
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY
COMPANY ACT OF 1935

HOLDING

The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was passed by
the Seventy-fourth Congress following an investigation by the
Federal Trade Commission. The Federal Trade Commission's
investigation, considered by many one of the most extensive ever
made, disclosed a variety of abuses in public-utility holding company
finance and operations. The more significant of these abuses are
enumerated in section 1 (b) of the act: (1) Inadequate disclosure
to investors of the information necessary to appraise the financial
position and earning power of the companies whose securities they
purchase; (2) the issuance of securities against fictitious and unsound
values; (3) the over-loading of the operating companies with debt
and fixed charges thus tending to prevent voluntary rate reductions;
(4) the imposition of excessive charges upon operating companies for
various services such as management, supervision of construction and
the purchase of supplies and equipment; (5) the control by holding
companies of the accounting practices and rate, dividend and other
policies of their operating subsidiaries so as to complicate or obstruct
State regulation; (6) the control of subsidiary holding companies and
operating companies through disproportionately small investment;
(7) the extension of holding company systems without relation to
economy of operations or to the integration and coordination of
related properties.
The jurisdiction of the statute embraces public-utility holding
company systems which are engaged in the electric utility business
or in the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. Fundamentally the regulatory provisions of the act fall into two basic
categories. The first deals with supervision of the financing and
operations of holding company systems. These regulations, however,
are carefully designed not to conflict with, but to supplement and
strengthen local regulation. Thus, the jurisdiction of the act does not
extend to local rate making and does not authorize the Commission
to prescribe accounting systems for operating subsidiaries, except in
a comparatively few instances where there are neither State nor other
Federal laws prescribing such accounting systems. The second area
of regulatory jurisdiction under the act provides for the geographical
integration and corporate simplification of holding company systems.
THE PUBLIC UTILITY INDUSTRY UNDER THE ACT

The properties subject to the statute at this time represent an
important segment of the electric and gas industry of the United
States, despite the divestment under section 11 of several hundred
companies during the past 14 years. On June 30, 1949, there were
registered with the Commission 46 holding company systems with
aggregate consolidated system assets of approximately $14,263,000,000.
These systems included 46 top holding companies, 26 subholding
78

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

79

companies, 274 electric and gas utility companies and 296 nonutility
companies. This made a total of 642 companies subject to the
statute on that date. At the close of the preceding fiscal year there
were 46 registered public-utility holding company systems comprising
46 top holding companies, 27 holding companies, 309 electric and gas
utility companies and 323 nonutility companies or a total of 705
companies with total system assets of $14,680,000,000.1 The decrease
in assets of some $417,000,000 represents for the most part the difference between additions, due primarily to plant expansion, on the
one hand, and the divestment during the year of nonretainable
companies and properties, on the other. Viewed from the standpoint
of the electric utility industry alone, it may be noted that of the
315 class A and class B electric utility companies 2 in operation on
December 31, 1948, with aggregate assets of $17,347,000,000, 146
companies with assets of $7,106,000,000 are presently subject to the
Holding Oompany Act. Ninety-eight companies with assets of
$6,188,000,000 were formerly subject to the Holding Oompany Act,
but are no longer under the Commission's jurisdiction as a result
of divestment under section 11. Seventy-ohe of the 315 companies
with assets aggregating $4,053,000,000 have never been subject to
the Holding Oompany Act.
REGULATION OF FINANCING AND OPERATIONS OF HOLDING
COMPANY SYSTEMS

Fourteen of the 33 sections of the act deal specifically with the
regulation of finances and operations of the holding company systems.
These provisions cover a wide range of activities and they are geared
to correction of the abuses enumerated by the Oongress in section
1 (b) of the act.
Registration of Holding Companies

Sections 4 and 5 require that holding company systems register
with the Commission and file periodic reports containing detailed data
with respect to their organization, financial structure, and operations.
This provides a background of necessary information for supervision
of specific transactions under other sections of the act and enables the
Oommission to keep abreast of significant trends and developments in
that segment of the utility industry which is subject to the act.
When a holding company registers with the Commission it files a
basic "registration statement."
Each year thereafter "annual
supplements" are filed setting forth important changes during the
year. In the twelve months ended June 30, 1949, 91 "annual supplements" were filed and examined by the staff of the Oommission.
It is necessary to take appropriate steps for registration of a holding
company under section 5 before jurisdiction can be exercised over the
company under other sections of the act.
Exemption from the Act

Rohling companies and subsidiaries which are able to comply with
certain' standards of the act may be released from the Oommission's
jurisdiction. Under section 3 if a holding company system is preI Tho data on assets subject to the act as represented m previous annual reports have been revised during
the past year. The fignres shown above are on a comparable basis.

dominantly intrastate in character, it may be exempted from the
obligations of the statute. The same applies to systems where the
holding company itself is predominantly an intrastate operating
utility company, or is only incidently or only temporarily a holding
company. Likewise, a holding company which derives no material
part of its income from sources within the United States may be
exempted from the statute. In section 2 the mechanics are established whereby the Commission, upon application, may declare that
a company is not an "electric utility company" under section 3 (a) (3),
not a "gas utility company" under section 3 (a) (4), not a "holding
company" under section 3 (a) (7) or not a subsidiary of a holding
company under section 3 (a) (8). Actions under these sections are
in the nature of declarations of status and have the effect of releasing
the applicant companies from the obligations of the act. Under
section 5 (d) a company registered as a holding company with the
Commission may, after it ceases in fact to be a holding company,
have its registration terminated by order of the Commission.
During the 14 years of the Commission's administration of the
statute, 637 applications' for exemption under section 3, declarations
for status under section 2 and applications for termination of registration under section 5 (d) have been filed with the Commission. Of
this number 200 have been granted, 349 have been withdrawn or
dismissed and 53 have been denied. As of June 30, 1949, 35 cases
were pending. Beginning about 1940 a substantial number of these
applications were allowed to continue in pending status for indefinite
periods awaiting the outcome of reorganization plans under section 11,
the consummation of which subsequently operated to render the
exemption questions moot. Sections 2 and 3 expressly provide that
the applicant shall be exempt from the obligations of the act during
pendency of the application before the Commission. This policy
resulted in substantial savings of expense on the part of both the
Commission and the applicant companies, and accounts for the comparatively large number of applications withdrawn or dismissed
during the period.
Acquisitions

Under sections 9 and 10 the acquisition of securities and utility
assets by holding companies and their subsidiaries may not be authorized by the Commission unless the following standards are met:
(1) the acquisition must not tend toward interlocking relations or
concentration of control to an extent detrimental to the public
interest or the interest of investors or consumers; (2) any consideration paid for the acquisition, including fees, commissions, and other
remuneration, must not be unreasonable; (3) the acquisition must not
complicate the capital structure or holding company system; (4) the
acquisition must not be otherwise detrimental to the public interest
or the interest of investors or consumers, or to the proper functioning
of the holding company system; (5) the acquisition must tend toward
th~. economic and efficient development of an integrated publicutility system.
The bulk of operations under sections 9 and 10 are represented by
determination of questions arising under clauses (1), (2), and (3) of
section 10 (a). During the 14 years of the Commission's adminis-

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

81

tration of the act 1,625 questions under this section have been determined. Applications were granted with respect to 1,452of the matters
presented, 159 were withdrawn or dismissed and 14 denied. During
the fiscal year applications raising 203 questions under this section
were filed. Applications with respect to 160 were approved and 73
matters were still pending determination on June 30, 1949. For the
most part these transactions are represented by holding company
acquisitions of the securities of their subsidiaries in connection with
financing and reorganizations.
Transactions within Holding Company Systems

Section 12 of the act extends Commission jurisdiction to a wide
variety of activities. It covers regulation of dividend payments,
intercompany loans and the solicitation of proxies, authorizations,
and consents. It also covers sales by one company of its holdings of
the securities of other companies, sales of utility assets, capital contributions, the acquisitions by companies of their own securities and
various transactions between affiliates. In this section" upstream"
loans from subsidiaries to their parents and "upstream" or "crossstream" loans from public utility companies to any holding company
in the same holding company system are expressly forbidden. Prior
to passage of the act these loans and other intrasystem transactions
resulted in widespread abuses in holding company systems. Activities of this character, moreover, were entirely beyond the scope of
local and State regulation.
Since passage of the act 3,825 questions under paragraphs (b), (c),
(d), and (f) of section 12 have been determined. Of this number
3,537 were decided in favor of the declarant companies, 247 were
withdrawn or dismissed and 41 were denied. During the past fiscal
year 388 questions of this character were presented in declarations
filed with the Commission. Declarations raising 294 questions were
approved, 4 dismissed and 1 denied. Two hundred and seventeen
matters under these sections were pending June 30, 1949.
Servicing Operations

As noted above one of the principal abuses of holding company
systems which is expressly described in section 1 (b) of the act was
the loading of excessive service charges by holding companies, or
their controlled service companies, upon the operating utility subsidiaries. Prior to passage of the act this problem imposed a very
burdensome task upon state commissions in their endeavors to analyze the operating expenses of local utilities in rate-making proceedings.
The solution of this question was specifically provided in section 13.
The act expressly forbids holding companies to render services to
their subsidiaries for a charge, and it requires that all services performed for any company in a holding company system by a mutual or
subsidiary service company in that system be rendered at cost fairly
and equitably allocated.
During the 14-year span of the administration of the act 77 proposals
for servicing arrangements in holding company systems pursuant to
section 13 have been presented to the Commission for consideration.
Fifty-two were approved, 1 was denied, 12 were either withdrawn or
dismissed and 12 were pending on June 30, 1949. Actions upon
proposals for servicing arrangements, however, constitute only a

82

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

part of the mechanism for regulation of service charges. Every
servicing company in a registered holding company system must file
with the Commission a comprehensive annual report of activities.
These reports are examined by the Commission's staff in order to
detect any irregularities. During the past fiscal year 49 of these
reports were filed. This device plus the statutory power of the Commission to reopen anv proceeding in which servicing arrangements
were approved has been successful in preventing a recurrence of the
abuses described in section 1 (b) of the act.
Issues of Securities, Assumptions of Liability, and Alterations of Rights

The issue and sale of securities by holding companies and their subsidiaries are regulated under sections 6 and 7 of the act. Assumptions
of liability on securities and alterations of rights of security holders
are covered by section 7. The tests which a proposed security issue,
assumption of liability or alteration of rights must meet are set forth
in section 7: (1) The security must be reasonably adapted to the
security structure of the issuer and of other companies in the same
holding company system; (2) the security must be reasonably adapted
to the earning power of the company; (3) the proposed issue must be
necessary and appropriate to the economical and efficient operation of
the company's business; (4) the fees, commissions and other remuneration paid in connection with the issue must not be unreasonable; (5)
the terms and conditions of the issue or sale of the security must not
be detrimental to the public interest or the interest of investors or
consumers.
During the fiscal year 372 applications and declarations covering
issues of securities under sections 6 and 7 and assumptions of liability
and alterations of rights under section 7 were filed with the Commission. Action was completed in 317 cases, all of which were approved.
From the date of passage of the act to June 30, 1949, 2,260 applications were approved, 150 withdrawn or dismissed and 16 denied.
These actions dealt both with securities issued for financing purposes
and with securities issued in connection with reorganizations of
holding company systems under section 11.
The most important aspect of the administration of sections 6 and 7
in recent years has been the financing of an unprecedented expansion
program for the electric and gas utility industries. It is estimated
that construction expenditures approached $2,300,000,000 during the
past fiscal year, exclusive of natural gas pipe lines. Of this total,
more than 80 percent is represented by growth of the electric utilities.
The rate of increase in electric energy sales in 1949 has slowed down
somewhat, although that output has remained consistently above the
levels of 1948, which suggests that construction expenditures are
likely to continue at a very high level for many months to come. To
provide the necessary funds for this tremendous expansion the industry maintained the heavy financing program in evidence last year.
This is demonstrated by the following tabulation showing security
sales for cash plus exchanges for refunding purposes for the fiscal
years 1948 and 1949.

, In addition, companies subject to the Holding Company Act sold notes with maturrtles
of 5 years or
more in the amounts of $79,200,000 ill IIscal year 1948 and $62,090,000 in 1949. Comparable data for eomparues
not subject to the Holding Company Act are not available.

This table embraces a high proportion of the total financing within
the industry. It will be noted that during the 2-year period financing
volume has continued unabated at the annual rate of approximately
$1,700,000,000. In addition, securities of companies not subject to
the Public Utility Holding Company Act, which were privately placed
and hence do not become a matter of record with the Commission,
would probably increase this figure by approximately $200,000,000.
Data for the fiscal year 1948 reflect the fact that approximately
25 percent of funds derived through security sales was employed for
refunding purposes. In contrast, during the fiscal year just closed,
refunding took only 5 percent of net proceeds, with the balance employed for construction purposes. Thus the general industry program for refunding debt and preferred stock issues with lower coupon
issues which had reached very large proportions in the early post war
period seems to be approaching termination and the period from
July 1, 1948, to June 30, 1949, saw financing geared almost exclusively
to new money needs. With this growth problem in the fore, management has been faced with the basic problem of maintaining a proportion of equity capital sufficient to safeguard the financial strength of
the industry. Figures for the latest fiscal year provide an encouraging
answer to this responsibility, for while the aggregate of bond and debenture financing declined about $93,000,000 as compared with fiscal
year 1948, common stock sales advanced by more than $135,000,000.
Although the proportion of security sales falling within the orbit of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act is steadily diminishing as
integration under section 11 proceeds, the volume of issues approved
remains a substantial segment of total security sales in the industry.
The following two tables set forth in summarv form security sales
approved under sections 6(b) and 7 of the act iJ1" the fiscal years 1949
and 1948. Information is provided with respect to electric and gas
utilities, registered holding companies and non utility subsidiaries of
registered holding companies. These totals include all cash sales
and refundings accomplished by direct exchanges. Excluded from
these figures are sales from portfolios and issues offered as part of a

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

85

A comparison of the totals for fiscal years 1948 and 1949 shows that
security sales by electric and gas utilities subject to the act declined
from $1,186,000,000 to $809,000,000. In view of the fact that total
industry financing has varied little in size during the 2-year period,
the contraction in the amount of approved financing is considered
attributable principally to the continuing divestment of operating
utilities. Total number of issues approved, including holding company and nonutility offerings showed, much less of a percentage
decline, however, the number being 211 in 1948 and 205 in 1949.
Of considerable significance is the noticeable change in the proportions of financing media as between the two periods. The prior
period, July 1, 1947, to June 30, 1948, reflected utility company
sales of bonds, debentures and long-term notes in the amount of
$936,000,000 or 79.0 percent of total utility offerings. However, in
the period ended June 30, 1949, sales of these types of securities declined to $536,000,000 or 66.3 percent of the total. On the other
hand, common stock sales were sharply increased from 13.0 percent
of the total in the earlier period to 24.4 percent in the fiscal year just
closed. There is some indication that the high point of bond financing related to earlier urgent needs for capacity has now been passed.
The increase in common stock financing is in direct accord with the
policy of the Commission which has consistently urged operating
companies under its jurisdiction to pace their bond offerings with a
sufficient amount of equity financing to preserve financial stabil-,
ity and a sound capitalization to assure adequate facilities for financing in future years.
A significant feature of utility financing during the fiscal year has
been the extensive employment of the rights offering procedure in the
marketing of common stocks. The practice has been followed most
frequently by companies which are now free from holding company
control and must turn to their public stockholders for equity capital.
Companies which are still holding company subsidiaries sold most of
their common stock directly to their respective parents for cash
without resort to public offering. However, from July 1, 1948, to
June 30, 1949, electric and gas utilities under jurisdiction of the
Holding Company Act did make 15 public rights offerings involving
an amount in excess of $63,000,000. In addition, registered holding
companies employed the rights procedure in 5 offerings aggregating
approximately $48,000,000. Ability of the utility industry to go
back to its stockholders for an important segment of its capital
requirements is, in a sense, a tribute to the financial strength and
investor confidence which it now enjoys.
Registered holding companies have played the major role in the
common stock financing of electric and gas utilities under the act;
they purchased shares to the extent of $135,000,000 in the fiscal
year 1948 and $150,000,000 in the past year. By thus increasing
the equity of its operating utility subsidiaries a holding company
performs one of the important functions contemplated by the statute.
In part, funds employed by holding companies for investment in
their subsidiaries have been derived from the sale of portfolio securities found by the Commission to be nonretainable under section 11.
Additional funds have been obtained by holding companies through
the offering of their own securities to the public. These offerings

86

totaled $122,000,000 during the past fiscal year. Of this amount
57 percent was represented by common stock and most of the balance
by debentures.

Historical records covering transactions between holding companies
and their subsidiaries prior to enactment of the statute are incomplete
but the available data presents a sharp contrast between the practices
of recent years and the methods employed by holding companies in
the financing of their subsidiaries prior to enactment of the statute.
During the period from 1924 to 1930, inclusive, public utility holding
companies sold approximately $4,856,000,000 of their securities to the
public. The funds received from this financing were devoted almost
entirely to the purchase of already outstanding corporate securities.
Only a negligible portion went into the construction of plant and
equipment of operating utility subsidiaries," For a period of many
years up to 1928, it was the general practice of holding companies
to furnish capital to their subsidiaries through the mechanism of
demand notes or open-account advances. Interest was often charged
on these short-term loans at rates ranging from 6 to 8 percent and in
some large systems the holding companies followed the regular practice
of compounding interest monthly.'
In its investigation the Federal Trade Commission found that in
many instances the book value of holding companies' investments
in common stocks of their subsidiaries represented highly inflationary

valuations.
This condition stemmed both from the "write-ups" in
the investment book values on the books of holding companies and
large scale "write-ups" in the property accounts of underlying subsidiaries. During the 14 years of its administration of the Holding
Oompany Act, the Commission, working jointly with the Federal
Power Oommission and state and local regulatory bodies, in proceedings arising under sections 6,7, and 11 (b) (2) has aided in the removal
from the plant accounts of subidiaries of registered holding companies'
"write-ups" aggregating approximately $1,423,000,000.
Under the terms of rule U-27, adopted April 21, 1941, every registered holding company and subsidiary thereof, which was a public
utility company and which was not required by either the Federal
Power Commission or a state commission to conform to a classification
of accounts has been required by the Commission to keep its accounts
in accordance with the designated systems adopted by this Commission
for electric and/or gas utilities.
These systems specifically provide
that plant and property accounts shall be stated at original cost.
While some field examinations were undertaken in 1945, it was not
until the latter part of 1946 that a section of original cost studies was
organized and the review of the field studies, including field examinations, was undertaken on an intensive scale. At June 30, 1949, field
examinations had been completed with respect to 10 companies, 6 of
which were located in the State of Texas, and 1 in each of the States
of New York, Delaware, Mississippi, and Florida.
Definitive orders
of the Commission approving disposition of adjustment items have
already been issued for the following companies:
Texas Power & Light Co.
Texas Electric Service Co.

Mississippi Power & Light Co.
Delaware Power & Light Co.

The adjustments to the accounts of the remaining companies are now
being processed.
Field examinations with respect to 6 additional
companies, located in the States of Texas, Iowa, Nebraska, and
Minnesota are either pending or are now being conducted.
Completed field studies for the 10 companies which have already
been examined disclose that the total properties, prior to reclassification, were recorded on their books at $372,159,252. The original
cost of such properties was determined to be only $245,672,325,
leaving a balance of $126,486,927 subject to adjustment.
Of this
latter amount it was determined that $101,116,546 should be classified
to Account 107-Plant

required to be written off

The balance of $25,370,381 was classified in

is thus subject

not representing original cost are included in the total of $1,400,000,000

structure and tend to prevent voluntary rate reductions;
The strengthening of capital structures of operating companies and
holding companies, the restoration of subsidiary companies' equities
through capital contributions by holding companies and the elimination of "write-ups" from the plant accounts of utility subsidiaries, as
accomplished through the administration of sections 6,7, and 11 (b) (2),
all have operated to bring about the effective correction of these
abuses.
Competitive Bidding

Sales of securities under these two sections and sales by holding
companies under section 12 of securities held in their investment
portfolios are generally required to be offered at competitive bidding.
This requirement is embodied in rule U-50, which was promulgated
in 1941 as a means of meeting the Commission's statutory responsibility for passing upon the reasonableness of fees and expenses and
the maintenance of competitive conditions. The events and considerations which led to the adoption of the rule were set forth in some
detail in the Seventh Annual Report.
To June 30, 1949, more than $5,320,000,000 of securities had been
sold pursuant to rule U-50, $4,360,000,000 of which were sold within
the past five fiscal years. Further analysis of this latter amount
indicates that all types of securities have been sold in substantial
volume and upon many occasions:

It was anticipated that the use of competitive bidding would bring
about a reduction in underwriting costs or "spreads," and this expectation has been amply fulfilled. A study of underwriting spreads
prevailing during the 5-year period ended January 1, 1940, revealed
that slightly over one-half of the 159 utility mortgage bond issues
studied had been sold on the basis of a 2-point spread; in only four
cases was a smaller spread found. The average spread for these 159
issues, which had been sold by traditional methods of private negotiation, was 2.49 points; i. e., $2.49 per $100 face amount of bonds.
The sharply contrasting picture under competitive bidding is shown
in the following compilation of spreads on bond issues during the
past 5 years:

Spreads on competitively sold preferred issues have averaged just
under two points while those on common stocks have averaged 5.4
percent of the public offering price.
A primary consideration in the adoption of rille U-50 was the necessity of overcoming the influence of traditional relationships between particular investment banking houses and public utility companies. These relationships seriously hindered arms-length bargaining and led, as noted above, to relatively standardized underwriting
costs on a high level. The extent to which the competitive bidding
procedure has diversified the management of security offerings is
therefore a matter of considerable importance. The table shown
below covers 24 companies whose securities have been marketed at
competitive bidding on at least 4 occasions during the past 5 fiscal
years and shows the number of managing underwriters who have
been successful in purchasing the securities of these companies.

It will be noted that in only one instance was a single manager able
to win all securities offered by a particular company over this 5-year
period. This manager had not been the traditional banker of the
company in question, and numerous other bids were submitted for
each of the issues. In only one other of the 24 companies studied was
any manager successful in purchasing as many as half of the issues
offered. Examination of the membership lists of underwriting syndicates reveals also that individual banking firms participate in offerings under widely diverse leadership. Over a period of time, nearly
all such. firms have been in competition with each other.
Rule U-50 is kept flexible by the various provisions for exemption
written into its terms. Some of these are automatic exemptions,

90

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

such as those covering security issues not exceeding $1,000,000 or
certain debt issues of less than 10 years' maturity.
In addition, the
Commission may exempt any particular issuance of securities by
order at its discretion. The great bulk of cases granted exemption
on this latter basis have involved non-underwritten sales to other
companies, individuals, stockholders, or institutional investors.
There were 69 security sales in this category. During the past 5
years only 28 underwritten sales have been exempted; 23 of these
were issues of common and preferred stock.
Acceptance of competitive bidding for public utility securities has
become considerably more widespread during the period since rule
U-50 was adopted. Competitive bidding is now regularly required
by the Interstate Commerce Commission and by 15 State regulatory
commissions. It has been employed, moreover, by a number of utility
companies under no regulatory compulsion to do so. It has been
tested under widely varying conditions and, although there are sometimes circumstances which make other methods of sale advisable, it
has been demonstrated to be highly effective in general application.
INTEGRATION AND SIMPLIFICATION OF HOLDING COMPANY
SYSTEMS

The physical integration and corporate simplification provisions of
the act are embodied principally in section 11. Section 11 (b) (1)
requires that the operations of a holding company group be limited
to one or more "integrated utility systems" and to such additional
businesses as are reasonably incidental or economically necessary or
appropriate to the operations of such systems. In section 2 (a) (29)
an "integrated utility system" is defined as one capable of economic
operation as a single coordinated system confined to a single area or
region in one or more States and not so large as to impair the advantages of localized management, efficient operation, and effectiveness
of regulation. These, in substance, are the principal statutory
requirements of physical integration. The standards covering corporate simplification are found in section 11 (b) (2), which requires action
to insure that the corporate structure or continued existence of any
company in a holding company group does not unduly or unnecessarily complicate the structure or unfairly or inequitably distribute
voting power among security holders of such holding company system.
Several years ago the Commission instituted proceedings with respect
to all of the major holding companies subject to its jurisdiction. The
orders and tentative conclusions handed down in connection with
these proceedings set forth in general terms the changes necessary to
meet the requirements of sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2).
The mechanics necessary to effectuate compliance with these
standards are contained in sections 11 (d), (e), and (f). Under section 11 (d) the Commission may apply to a court for an order compelling compliance, in which case the court may, to the extent neces-

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

91

sary, take exclusive jurisdiction and possession of the company.
Where a holding company is under the control of the courts in proceedings in bankruptcy or receivership, the debtor's plan for reorganization is required to be approved by the Commission under section 11 (f)
before action is taken thereon by the court. A holding company may
comply with the act on a voluntary basis under section 11 (e), which
requires that the Commission approve a voluntary reorganization
plan submitted pursuant to this section if it finds that the plan is (1)
necessary to effectuate the provisions of section 11 (b), and (2) fair
and equitable to the persons affected thereby. Nearly all of the
reorganizations passed upon by the Commission have been voluntary
plans filed under section 11 (e). The more drastic procedure provided
by section 11 (d) has been employed in the instance of only one holding company and, in that case, such action was requested by the company. A few cases have been processed under section 11 (f).
Prior to enactment of the statute an overwhelming majority of the
electric and gas utility companies in the United States were enmeshed
in one or more holding company systems. The independents included
a few large metropolitan companies, certain long-established utilities
in New York and New England, and the barest scattering over the
rest of the Nation. Through holding company control the electric
and gas utility companies became affiliated with an almost limitless
variety of unrelated business activities. Among these were water,
telephone, ice, street railway, coal, oil, real estate, and investment
companies. There were manufacturers of brick and tile, iron fence,
wood products, and paper. There were companies operating farms,
quarries, gas stations, parking lots, theaters, and amusement parks.
There was one coal-storage plant in Alaska and the New Orleans
Baseball Co., Inc. Furthermore, most of the electric and gas utility
companies of these holding company systems were widely scattered
among many States with little or no functional relationship with one
another. This problem of scatteration and unrelated businesses
constituted one of the major abuses enumerated by the Congress in
section 1 (b) of the act, which states "* * * the growth and extension of holding companies bears no relationship to the economy of
management and operation or the integration and coordination of
related operating properties; * * *"
During the period from June 15, 1938, to June 30, 1949, 2,152
companies at one time or another have been subject to the jurisdiction
of the Commission under the Holding Company Act. Of this number
210 were holding companies, 918 were electric and gas utility companies and 1,024 were nonutility companies. Reflecting primarily the
divestment of nonretainable properties under section 11, but also
mergers, consolidations, and exemptions from the act, there were
subject to the statute on June 30, 1949, only 642 companies. Of
this number 72 were holding companies, 274 were electric and gas
utilities, and 296 were nonutility companies. These changes, to-

I Reflects
company additions and classification adjustments
during the fiscal year •
• A few companies have been subject and not subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act at
various times during the period.
These mstances contribute
some duplication
to the reported company
totals.

In response to the physical integration standards of section 11 (b)
(1) and the corporate simplification requirements of section 11 (b) (2),

holding companies divested themselves of 44 companies having assets
of $1,749,000,000 during the past fiscal year. These companies are
no longer subject to the provisions of the act. In the previous year
111 companies, with assets of $1,244,000,000, were divested by
registered holding companies. The substantial decrease in the number of companies divested in 1949 as compared with the number
divested in the preceding fiscal year, without corresponding change
in aggregate assets divested, reflects for the most part the divestment
in October 1947 of 77 water subsidiaries of the American Water
Works & Electric Co. system. Since December 31, 1935, 661 companies, with assets of $7,965,000,000, have been removed from the
jurisdiction of the act through divestment. The following tables
present a complete record of all companies and partial segments of
utility properties which have been divested during the period December 1, 1935, to June 30, 1949, and which, as of June 30, 1949, were
not subject to the Holding Company Act.

NOTE.-It will be observed that the divestments
in thc "no longer subject" category for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1948, differ substantially
from the data covering the same period appearing at P. 58 of the
Commtssion's
fourteenth annual report. This difference re/lects pnmarily 2 major revisions in the method
of reporting "no longer subject" divestmcnts:
(a) A smaIl amount of duplication
has been ellminated;
(b) Under the method of reporting shown m the fourteenth
annual report a company with 10 subsldlaries
with eonsondated asset. of $12,COO,OOO
divested in 1 operation would appear in the table as 1 company with
assets at time of divestment
of $12,000,000. Under tbe revised method of reporting, set forth above, this
divestment
would he reported as 11 companies With assets of $12,000,000. The divestment
example cited
above to illustrate the change in method of compilation is hypothetical.

These data represent for the most part the severance from holding
company systems of companies and properties found by the Commission to be non-retainable under the standards contained in section
11 (b) (1) of the act.
Aside from the "no longer subject" divestments, 206 companies
with assets of $3,781,000,000 have been divested by one or more
holding companies, but remain subject to the statute by reason of
their relationship to another registered holding company. One hundred and forty-three of these companies with assets of approximately
$3,355,000,000 are expected to remain under the Commission's jurisdiction indefinitely as systems which, it is presently anticipated, will
ultimately complete compliance as fully integrated holding company
systems under the standards of section 11 (b). Some $28,000,000 of
assets representing partial segments of utility properties formerly
owned by nine companies likewise are expected to remain under the
Holding Company Act as parts of integrated systems. The following
tables summarize these "still subject" divestments.

GENERAL NOTE.-Attention
is invited to the fact that the data for "still subject" divestments appearing
in the above table have been compiled on a substantially drtl'erent basis from the data appearing in the
fourteenth annual report at pp. 58 and 59. The revised method of reporting eliminates certain substantial
daplications and is basically designed to show only the present status as to jurisdiction of the statute for
companies or systems which have undergone one or more complete divestment operation in the past. In
this table only the most recent divestment operation is reflected. Data in the fourteenth annual report
included all complete divestment operations a1fecting a company or system.

Contrary to popular conception, the Holding Company Act does
not contemplate the elimination of all holding companies. Sections
2 (a) (29) and 11 (b) (1) prescribe standards for the continued operation of compact and well-integrated public-utility holding company
systems subject to regulation by the Commission under other sections
of the act, as more fully described in the preceding sections of this
report, after they have completed compliance with the provisions of
the statute.
While it is too early to determine precisely which companies or
even which systems will remain subject to the Commission's continuing jurisdiction, it is estimated that some 6 or 7 billion dollars of
assets (including electric, gas, and retainable nonutility assets) may
remain subject to the act after integration proceedings have been
completed.
Present indications are that the following systems, among
others, are likely to continue under the act in this manner:
American Gas & Electric Co.
American Natural Gas Co.
Allegheny Gas Co.
Central & South West Corp.
Columbia Gas System, Inc.
Consolidated Natural Gas Co.

As noted above, many companies have been eliminated from holding
company systems as a result of proceedings designed to meet the
corporate simplification standards.
These standards have also required simplification of the security structures of many holding
companies. Some of the most complex, prolonged and bitterly contested cases before the Commission have been those in which senior
securities, particularly those of holding companies were replaced,
with common stock of a new holding company or of one or more
subsidiary companies. In these cases the rights of each class of
security holder must be carefully evaluated and the equitable equivalent of such rights must be allotted to them in cash or in new stock.
Many outstanding examples of corporate simplification have already
been brought to completion; a number of these are discussed in the
following sections of this report in connection with the narratives
relating to individual systems.

Cities Service Company

Cities Service Co. at the time of its registration in 1941 was the top
holding company in a system containing 125 companies, of which 49
were electric and gas utility companies, with consolidated assets of
approximately $1,000,000,000. This system owned or operated properties in each of the 48 States and in several foreign countries. Utility
properties were held by three subholding companies, Cities Service
Power & Light Co., Federal Light & Traction Co., and Arkansas
Natural Gas Corp., each controlling one or more utility systems.
In proceedings under section 11(b) of the act, the Commission found
that Cities should be limited in its operations to those of a single integrated gas utility system and required Cities to dispose of its other
interests." However, Cities expressed a desire to retain instead its
nonutility businesses and accordingly the Commission modified its
11 (b)(l) order so as to permit Cities to effect compliance by disposing
of all of its utility interests."

ANNUAL REPORT

Cities Service Power & Light Co., pursuant to a plan approved on
March 14, 1944,7simplified its corporate structure by eliminating its
debentures and preferred stock. In August 1946, Power & Light
liquidated and dissolved, transferring to Cities its portfolio holdings,"
These consisted of an interest of approximately 65 percent in Federal
Light & Traction Co., the common stocks of Ohio Public Service Co.,
Spokane Gas & Fuel Co., The Toledo Edison Co., Doniphan County
Light & Power Co. (all operating utility companies) and other miscellaneous holdings.
Federal Light & Traction Co. has likewise completed liquidation
proceedings. A number of its smaller properties were sold to individuals or other private purchasers and the stock of Tucson Gas, Electric
Light & Power Co. was sold to underwriters for public distribution.
Federal also merged four of its subsidiaries to form Public Service Co.
of New Mexico and the stock of this company was distributed to
Federal's common stockholders in the course of the liquidation. Federal distributed to its preferred stockholders $100 per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends and deposited in escrow an amount equivalent to the full premium of $10 per share plus interest for a period of
approximately 3 years on the aggregate premium pending the determination of whether or not the preferred stockholders are entitled to
receive more than par plus accrued dividends.
Arkansas Natural Gas Corp. has filed an application to comply with
the Commission's outstanding order under section 11(b)(l) providing
for the disposition of the gas distribution properties of its only gas
utility subsidiary, Arkansas Louisiana Gas CO.9 This application, filed
in May 1948, is still pending and has since been consolidated with a
proceeding instituted by the Commission to determine what action, if
any, is required to be taken by Arkansas Natural Gas Corp. to comply
with the requirements of section l1(b)(2).
On April 24, 1947, the Commission approved a section l1(e) plan
filed by Cities Service Co. for the simplification of its corporate structure which provided for the issuance of approximately $115,000,000
principal amount of new debentures to the holders of Cities' outstanding preferred and preference stocks representing a principal amount
equivalent to the redemption prices of the three series of preferred
and preference stocks plus accumulated dividend arrears of approximately $50,000,000.10 In addition, provision was made for the immediate retirement of approximately $40,000,000 of the company's
outstanding long term debt and for the application of anticipated
proceeds from the disposition of utility subsidiary companies to the
retirement of the remaining long term debt and toward the reduction
in the amount of the new debentures. Since the consummation of
that plan in June 1947, Cities has disposed of its interest in the common stock of Public Service Co. of New Mexcio (acquired through
liquidation of Federal Light & Traction Co.) and used the proceeds
together with cash to retire approximately $9,000,000 of its outstanding debt. On April 12, 1949, Cities disposed of a portion of its interest
in Ohio Public Service Co., an electric utility subsidiary. These

proceeds are likewise required to be applied toward reduction of
Cities' debt.
The Commonwealth & Southern Corporation.

At the time of its registration as a public utility holding company
in March 1938 The Commonwealth & Southern Corp. controlled a
holding company system consisting of some 43 companies. Its principal subsidiaries were 11 public utility comapnies, all of which rendred electric service and some of which also furnished gas, transportation, and other services. These companies conducted their operations
in 5 northern and 6 southern States. Although some of the electric
properties in the South were interconnected, the northern electric
properties for the most part were situated in separate and distinct
areas. The publicly-held securities of the subsidiaries, consisting
primarily of bonds and preferred stocks, aggregated about $711,000,000, while Commonwealth's own debt securities and preferred
stock totaled about $52,000,000 and $150,000,000, respectively. Thus
the system had outstanding an extremely large amount of senior
securities ranking ahead of Commonwealth's common stock. Dividends on this common stock had not been paid since March 1932 and
dividends on the cumulative preferred stock had been paid at a reduced rate for several years, resulting in dividend arrearages of about
$18,000,000.
Since 1938 all of the transportation companies and nearly all of the
small nonutility companies have been eliminated from the holding
company system. Commonwealth also has sold its interests in three
former public utility subsidiaries which conducted operations in
Tennessee, South Carolina, and Indiana. A section 11(e) plan approved By this Commission on August 1,1947,11 resulted in the creation
of The Southern Co. as a public utility holding company, and the
transfer to it of Commonwealth's investments in the utility subsidiaries
which conduct integrated electric utility operations in Georiga, Alabama, Florida, and Mississippi. In its order approving that plan, the
Commission, among other things, ordered Commonwealth to dispose
of its interest in all the northern subsidiary companies.
Another section 11 plan of Commonwealth, dated July 30, 1947,
provides for the retirement of Commonwealth's preferred stock by
exchanging for it the common stocks of Consumers Power Co. and
Centrallllinois Light Co. together with $1 per share in cash. This
plan also provides that Commonwealth's remaining assets, chiefly
consisting of the common stocks of The Southern Co. and a substantial
portion of the common stock of Ohio Edison Co., be distributed to
Commonwealth's common stockholders and that Commonwealth
be dissolved. The last-mentioned plan was approved by this Commission 12 and by the District Court of the United States for the
District of Delaware which directed that the plan be consummated."
Commonwealth has indicated its intention to make the initial distribution under this plan on or about October 1, 1949.
Upon the consummation of this plan, Commonwealth will have
disposed of all its investments in subsidiary companies and will have
been dissolved. As contrasted with its holding company system of 43

companies in 1938, there will remain a number of independent companies and two nonaffiliated holding company systems: one consisting
of Ohio Edison Co. with Pennsylvania Power Co. as its subsidiary; the
other consisting of The Southern Co. with five subsidiary companies.
Electric Bond & Share Co.

The Electric Bond & Share Co. ("Bond and Share") system is the
largest which has registered under the Holding Company Act. At the
time of its registration under the act in 1938, it controlled 121 domestic
subsidiaries including 5 major subholding companies with combined
assets of nearly 3* billion dollars. These subholding companies were
American & Foreign Power Co., Inc. (Foreign Power), American Gas
& Electric Co. (American Gas), American Power & Light Co.
(American), Electric Power & Light Corp. (Electric), and National
Power & Light Co. (National).
Of these, American Gas ceased
to be a subsidiary of Bond and Share in March 1947, National
has disposed of substantially all of its interest in electric and gas
utility subsidiaries and Electric as of the end of the 1949 fiscal year
was in the process of dissolution pursuant to a plan approved by the
Commission. In addition, Bond and Share has filed plans providing
for the retirement of its preferred stocks and the divestment of all of
its public utility investments in the United States in order to become,
prospectively, an investment company.
Pursuant to plans filed in 1945 and 1946 and approved by the
Commission and by the district court, Bond and Share has paid $100
per share, or an aggregate amount of $104,328,000, to the holders of
its $5 and $6 preferred stocks and in addition has delivered to each of
such holders a certificate evidencing the right to receive any additional
amounts which the Commission or the courts may approve or direct."
On April 7, 1947, Bond and Share filed plan II-B in which it proposed
that no further payment be made to holders of the preferred stock
certificates. 10 Hearings on this plan have been completed, the matter
has been briefed and argued and is presently before the Commission
for decision. A portion of the funds required for the payments to
preferred stockholders was derived from the disposition by Bond and
Share of its holdings in American Gas and in Pennsylvania Power &
Light Co. Both of these companies thereupon ceased to be subsidiaries
of Bond and Share. In the latter part of 1948, Bond and Share also
disposed of its holdings of the common stock of Carolina Power &
Light Co., through a sale to the public and distribution to its common
stockholders."
National Power & Light; Co.

On August 23, 1941, pursuant to proceedings instituted by the
Commission, National was ordered to dissolve because it constituted
an undue and unnecessary complexity in the Bond and Share system."
At the time of the issuance of this order, National had 27 subsidiaries,
9 of which were public utility companies. Substantial progress has
been. made in bringing about National's dissolution. All of its longterm debt has been retired through the use of treasury cash and its

preferred stock was retired at $100 per share, partly through a voluntary exchange for common stock of Houston Lighting & Power Co.
and in part by cash derived from sale of the Houston stock." In May
1946, the Commission approved a plan for the settlement of all suits
and claims against Bond and Share by or on behalf of National, its
subsidiaries and certain former subsidiaries through payment of
$750,000 by Bond and Share." This settlement was subsequently
approved by the United States district court and in August 1946
National distributed the common stocks of Pennsylvania Power &
Light Co., Carolina Power & Light Co., and Birmingham Electric
Co., its remaining principal subsidiaries, pro rata to its common stockholders. Thus Bond and Share, which owned 46 percent of National's
common stock, received 46 percent of the stocks distributed.
In
preparation for these distributions Pennsylvania, Carolina, and
Birmingham were reorganized to conform their accounts and structures
to the requirements of the act. After the distribution of these companies, National's only remaining subsidiaries were Lehigh Valley
Transit Co., The Memphis Street Railway Co. (Memphis) and Memphis Generating Co. (Memphis Generating). On August 17, 1948, the
Commission approved a plan for the reorganization of Lehigh Valley,"
which was subsequently approved by the United States district court."
Under the plan, Lehigh Valley's debt was retired by the payment of its
principal amount and its capital stocks were reclassified into a new
common stock. On March 22, 1949, the Commission approved a plan
for the reorganization of Memphis," which was subsequently approved
by the United States district court." Under this plan, National was
paid approximately $327,000 for its interest in the common stock and
Memphis' preferred stock was reclassified into a new class of common
stock. A plan for the reorganization and disposition of Memphis
Generating is pending.
American Power & Light Co.

On August 22, 1942, American and Electric were ordered to dissolve
on grounds similar to those set forth with respect to National."
The
Commission order was appealed by both American and Electric and
subsequently affirmed by the United States Circuit Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit on May 17, 1944, and by the United States
Supreme Court on November 25, 1946.
At the time of the issuance of the dissolution order, American
controlled directly or indirectly 35 subsidiaries, 16 of which were
public utility companies. American's capital structure consisted of
long-term debt, 2 classes of cumulative preferred stock with dividend
arrearages of more than $35,000,000, and common stock. Considerable progress has also been made in resolving American's problems
under section 11. All of American's long-term debt has been retired.
In addition, American has disposed of its interest in Nebraska Power
Co., Central Arizona Light & Power Co. and New Mexico Electric
Service Co. plus certain minor properties. Plans for the sale in

July 1949 of all of American's interest in Kansas Gas & Electric Co.
were completed at the close of the fiscal year. Its remaining subsidiaries, with the sole exception of Portland Gas & Coke Co., have
been recapitalized to conform their accounts and structures to the
requirements of the act in order to be ready for disposition. In
October 1945, the Commission approved the formation by American
of a new Texas holding company which acquired from American its
interest in Texas Electric Service Co. and Texas Power & Light Co.
and, from Electric, the latter's interest in Dallas Power & Light CO.25
On April 24, 1947, the Commission authorized the merger of two of
American's subsidiaries; namely, Northwestern Electric Co. and
Pacific Power & Light Co. and the retirement of the two companies'
preferred stocks through a new preferred stock issue by Pacific, the
survivor.P Subsequently Pacific refunded its debt and the debt of
Northwestern which had been assumed under the merger agreement."
American and Bond and Share have filed a joint plan providing
for the reorganization of American." This plan is in substitution for
an earlier plan which was withdrawn because of a change in market
conditions. The present plan, in summary, provides for the settlement of all suits and claims against Bond and Share by and on behalf
of American, its subsidiaries and certain former subsidiaries for a
cash payment of $2,500,000 and the allocation of American's assets
among its preferred and common stockholders in the ratio of 82 percent to the preferred and 18 percent to the common. The division
of assets is proposed to be effected, under the plan, through the direct
distribution of the common stocks of four of American's direct subsidiaries and the reclassification of American's present stocks into a
single class of common stock. Hearings on this plan have been completed and the plan, as of the end of the fiscal year, was under consideration by the Commission. The plan had the support of all representatives of American stockholders who participated in the proceedings.
Electric Power & Light Corp.

At the time of the issuance of the Commission's dissolution order,
Electric controlled directly or indirectly 24 subsidiary companies, 10
of which were public utility companies under the act. Electric's
capital structure consisted of long-term debt, three classes of cumulative preferred stock with aggregate arrearages in excess of $53,000,000, common stock and option warrants entitling the holders, without
limitation as to time, to purchase shares of common stock at $25 a
share. The resolution of Electric's problems under section 11 has
been substantially completed. Electric has disposed of its holdings
in Idaho Power CO.29and Dallas Railway & Terminal CO.30through
sales to the public and its holdings in Dallas Power & Light Co. were
sold to the new Texas holding company organized by American. Its
holdings in Utah Power & Light Co. were disposed of pursuant to a

a new common stock." United Gas Corp., Electric's principal subsidiary, was reorganized under section 11 in a proceeding which
resolved all claims of United and Electric against Bond and Share
arising out of the formation and financing of United." In 1945
Electric retired its outstanding long-term debt with the proceeds
derived from the disposition of properties described above and from
retained earnings. In addition, the accounts and structures of Electric's remaining subsidiaries have been brought into compliance with
the requirements of the act.
On March 2, 1949, the Commission approved a plan of dissolution
filed by Electric," This plan was filed in substitution for a joint plan
filed by Electric and Bond and Share in July 1946 and subsequently
withdrawn because of changed market conditions. The present plan
provides in summary for the creation of a new holding company to
acquire and hold the common stocks of the electric utility subsidiaries
of Electric, subject to a reservation of jurisdiction under section 11
(b) (1) as to what properties of the subsidiaries may ultimately be
retainable; the settlement of all suits and claims against Bond and
Share by and on behalf of Electric, its subsidiaries, and certain former
subsidiaries for a cash payment of $2,200,000; the distribution of
Electric's assets among its security holders; and the dissolution of
Electric. This plan was approved by the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York and is in the process of
consummation.
American Gas & Electric Co.

At the time American Gas registered under the act its properties
were divided, generally speaking, into three groups; namely, the
Central System, operating in Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, Ohio,
Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia, the South Jersey System and
the Northeast Pennsylvania System. Proceedings on an application
filed by American Gas requesting approval of the continuance of its
Central System together with the South Jersey and Northeast Pennsylvania Systems were consolidated with proceedings instituted by
the Commission under section 11 (b) (1) in 1939. On December 28,
1945, the Commission concluded that the properties comprising the
Central System formed an integrated electric system and were retainable under the act but that other properties must be divested if the
Central System were to be retained." Accordingly, in April 1946
American Gas sold to die public its holdings of the common stock
of Scranton Electric CO.35and subsequently disposed of its holdings
of the common stock of Atlantic City Electric Co., partly through a
sale to the public and partly through dividend distributions to its
common stockholders." As a result of these dispositions, American
Gas has fully complied with the Commission's order. The Commission has approved the acquisition by American Gas of the common
stock of Indiana Service CO.37and, in August 1948, the acquisition of

The Commission held that the electric properties of both companies
might properly be considered a part of the Central System. In 1946
American Gas was denied authority to enter a bid for Continental
Gas & Electric Corp.'s holdings of 99.17 percent of the common stock
of Columbus & Southern Ohio Electric Co. The stock was sold to the
public shortly thereafter for $39,900,000. The Commission concluded
that the holding company system of American Gas would exceed the
limits of "bigness" permitted by sections 10 and 11 if the proposed
acquisition of Columbus and Southern was approved.
American & Foreign Power Co., Inc.

Foreign Power controls a mutual service company and 70 subsidiary
companies located in Central and South America, Cuba, Mexico,
China, and India. Since the operations of all Foreign Power's subsidiaries are in foreign countries, the Commission's principal concern
is with respect to the simplification of the company's corporate structure and its relationship to Bond and Share. Foreign Power's capital
structure at December 31, 1948, consisted of debentures, serial notes,
three classes of preferred stock with dividend arrearages of some
$390,000,000, common stock, and option warrants. Bond and Share
holds all the serial notes and substantial blocks of the junior securities.
On October 24, 1944, Foreign Power and Bond and Share filed a
plan for the reorganization of Foreign Power. After extensive hearings, this plan was amended by the two companies and on November
19, 1947, the Commission approved such amended plan after the filing
of certain additional modifications." The plan, as approved by the
Commission, was subsequently approved by the United States District
Court for the District of Maine." However, because the company
could not effectuate the financing necessary to consummate the plan,
both the district court and the Commission vacated their orders
approving it. On May 2, 1949, the Commission issued an order pursuant to section 11(b) (2) of the act requiring Bond and Share and
Foreign Power to take steps to reorganize Foreign Power in such a
manner that its resulting capital structure will consist only of common
stock plus such amount of debt as will meet the applicable standards
of the act."
At the end of the fiscal year there was pending before the Commission an application by Foreign Power and Bond and Share in which
it was proposed that Bond and Share would transfer to Foreign Power
$19,500,000 principal amount of past due 6 percent debentures of
Cuban Electric Co., a subsidiary of Foreign Power, in exchange for
a $19,500,000 note of Foreign Power to bear interest at the rate of
6 percent per annum." The stated purpose of the application is to
facilitate the carrying out of a reorganization plan for foreign Power's
Cuban subsidiaries and to provide Foreign Power with marketable
securities which it could sell to obtain cash to meet the needs of its
subsidiaries.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Engineers Public Service Company

Events in the current fiscal year have brought substantially to a
close the problems confronting this major public-utility holding company system. At the time of registration, Engineers Public Service
Co. was a conspicuous example of geographical scatteration.
Through
its 20 subsidiaries, including 2 intermediate holding companies, it
carried on operations in the States of Virginia, North Carolina,
Georgia, Florida, Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, Wyoming, South
Dakota, Nebraska, Kansas, Missouri, Iowa, and Washington, and in
Canada and Mexico. Operations included not only the electric and
gas businesses but also such nonutility businesses as transportation,
ice, steam and telephone. Proceedings were instituted under section
11(b) (1) of the act and the Commission directed, after hearings, that
Engineers retain only one of its subsidiaries, Virginia Electric &
Power Co., or, if the company elected, Gulf States Utilities CO.43
Engineers contested the Commission's order in the courts but, while
review proceedings were pending, proceeded to divest itself by sale of
many of its properties. One major operating subsidiary, Puget
Sound Power & Light Co., was reorganized and Engineers' remaining
interest therein was sold. The two sub-holding companies were
eliminated. A portion of the proceeds of these sales was used by
Engineers to acquire Virginia Public Service Co. which adjoined and
was interconnected with the properties of Virginia Electric & Power
Co., its largest subsidiary. The properties so acquired were merged
into the latter company. '
By 1945 the Engineers system had been reduced to three operating
companies, each soundly financed and capable of standing upon its
own feet. These companies were Virginia Electric & Power Co.
operating in Virginia, West Virginia, and North Carolina, Gulf States
Utilities Co., in Louisiana and Texas, and EI Paso Electric Oo., in
Texas and New Mexico. In that year, Engineers filed a voluntary
plan under section l1(e) of the act which provided that Engineers'
preferred stock should be retired by the payment of cash and that the
remaining assets should be distributed to its common stockholders,
after which Engineers would liquidate and dissolve. The EI Paso
stock was distributed to the common stockholders of Engineers, as
was the major portion of the stock of Virginia Electric & Power Co.
The stock of Gulf States Utilities Co. was offered to common stockholders of Engineers on a subscription basis.
The principal question which arose in connection with the plan
involved the amount of cash to be paid to preferred stockholders of
Engineers. The company originally proposed that the preferred
stock be retired by the payment of an amount equal to the involuntary
liquidation price, $100 per share plus accrued dividends. Certain
preferred stockholders contended that the preferred stock should
receive amounts equal to the call prices, which were $105 for the $5
preferred and $110 for the $5.50 and $6 series. The latter position
was sustained by the Commission, which held that while the charter
provisions did not control, the fair investment value of the preferred
stock was not less than the respective call prices." Engineers acfa 12 S. E. C 41.

The balance of the stock of Virginia Electric & Power Co. retained
by Engineers is now being sold, leaving Engineers with no substantial
asset other than cash. This cash will be distributed to the common
stockholders upon dissolution of the company.
General Public Utilities Corp.

This company is the top holding company emerging from reorganization of the former Associated Gas & Electric System. Associated
Gas & Electric Co. and its immediate subsidiary Associated Gas &
Electric Corp. registered as holding companies on March 28, 1938.
At that time the system consisted of 164 companies, including 11 subholding companies, and was unequalled for the complexity of its
corporate structure. Four of the utility companies were as many as
6 tiers of companies removed from the top holding company. The
system was engaged in business in 26 States scattered from Maine to
Arizona and in the Philippine Islands; the businesses included such
diverse activities as electric, gas, water, ice, street railway, bUS,heating, hotel, insurance, real estate, engineering, marine towing, toll
bridge, coal mining, and ferry operations. Associated Gas & Electric
Co. itself had outstanding 10 different kinds of fixed-interest debt
obligations, several series of income debentures, a number of securities
variously known as convertible debenture certificates, convertible
certificates, and convertible obligations, two different classes of preferred stock, a class A stock, a class B stock, a common stock and
warrants to purchase common stock. Most of Associated's subsidiaries also had senior securities outstanding in the hands of the public.
The consolidated assets of the system were stated at a little over
$1,000,000,000 and the corporate assets of Associated Gas & Electric
itself were stated at approximately $450,000,000.
In 1940, Associated Gas & Electric Co. and Associated Gas &
Electric Corp. filed petitions for reorganization pursuant to chapter
X of the Bankruptcy Act. In 1942, pursuant to the provisions of
section 11 (b) (1) of the act, the trustees of Associated Gas & Electric
Corp. were ordered to divest themselves of all their interests in some
114 companies located primarily outside the 3 States of New York,
Pennsylvania, and New Jersey, no determination being made at that
time of the status of the majority of the properties in these States."
Of these 114 companies III have been divested. Included in the 3
remaining companies are 2 operating in the Philippine Islands as to
which our divestment order has been temporarily suspended." Just
prior to the close of the fiscal year the Oommission ordered the section
11 (b) (1) proceedings reconvened for the purpose of determining what
properties located in Pennsylvania and New Jersey, and incidental
businesses related thereto, may be retained under the standards of the
act.48 All but 3 New York properties have already been divested
and preparations are being made for the disposition of these 3 as well.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

As at January 1, 1946, a comprehensive plan of reorganization of
Associated Gas & Electric Co. and Associated Gas & Electric Corp.
was consummated pursuant to chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act and
section 11 (f) of the Holding Company Act. In place of the two
companies and their many securities there was substituted a single
company, General Public Utilities Corp. (GPU), which had a security
structure consisting of 10 year convertible debentures, bank loans,
and common stock. The debentures were redeemed in 1947, however, and at June 30, 1949, GPU had outstanding only $3,950,000 of
notes payable to banks, all due within approximately 6 years, and
common stock having a book equity of approximately $122,000,000.
After consummation of the plan of reorganization, GPU's assets
consisted primarily of securities of three subholding companies which
in turn had outstanding in the hands of the public approximately
$80,000,000 of senior securities. These publicly held securities have
been reduced to $32,000,000 through the dissolution of two of these
companies and the retirement of substantial amounts of senior
securities by the third. Plans are presently pending which should
result in the retirement of the remaining subholding company's senior
securities and make possible the dissolution of the company if such
action should be deemed necessary or advisable at that time.
. The operating subsidiaries of General Public Utilities have all
restated their accounts to eliminate inflationary items and have been
refinanced in a manner which enables them to raise new money for
construction purposes on a sound and economic basis.
International Hydro-Electric System-New England Electric System

At the time of registration, International Hydro-Electric System(IHES), a Massachusetts voluntary association, owned directly
Gatineau Power Co., a Canadian public utility company, and two
wholesale electric utilities operating in the United States. It also
owned the equity in New England Power Association, which since its
reorganization is known as New England Electric System (NEES).
NEES was a holding company in its own right and while the managements of the two companies were interrelated they functioned separately. Accordingly the reorganizations of the two companies were
handled in separate proceedings.
•

Originally, IHES had outstanding debentures due in 1944, preferred
stock, class A stock, class B stock, and common stock. The company
was in a precarious financial position, having a huge earned surplus
deficit. Operationally it performed no functions for its subsidiaries.
Voting control was vested in the stock junior to the preferred stock.
Moreover, NEES, its subsidiary holding company, had two layers
of intermediate holding companies beneath it, with the result that
the corporate structures of both IHES and NEES violated the
"great-grandfather clause" of section 11 (b) (2) of the act.
The Commission initiated proceedings under section 11 (b) (2)
with respect to IRES. The first important step in these proceedings
was to cause the cancellation of the class B and common stock. Subsequently, in 1942, the Commission directed IHES to liquidate and
dissolve." However, many system problems had to be resolved before
the portfolio of IHES could be distributed. Among these were litigato

tion of claims on behalf of IRES against its former parent, International Paper Co., the reorganization of NEES, and the merger of
IRES's two New York subsidiaries into a single company. These
matters were not fully disposed of until 1947, when the reorganization
of NEES was completed and the sum of $10,000,000, together with
other considerations, was finally paid to IRES in settlement of the
claims against International Paper Co. The separate reorganization
of NEES was itself a major operation. NEES had five subholding
companies, in two tiers, over its operating subsidiaries. Under a
voluntary plan filed under section 11 (e) of the act the subholding
companies were eliminated by the retirement of their securities in
exchange for cash or new common stock of NEES. W NEES emerged
from the reorganization with a single issue of debt and common stock,
which replaced 18 classes of old securities. IRES now owns only 8
percent of the common stock of NEES, and is no longer a holding
company with respect to it.
It is contemplated that NEES will continue indefinitely as a registered holding company. During the current fiscal year the Commission has entertained numerous applications by NEES and its subsidiaries relating principally to the financing problems of the NEES
system. Also, Green Mountain Power Corp., a subsidiary of NEES
operating in Vermont, has itself filed a voluntary plan of reorganization.
Meanwhile, hearings on various plans for the liquidation and dissolution of IRES are going forward. An application has been made
by a class A stockholder of IRES seeking to have the Commission
modify its dissolution order of 1942 in order to permit IRES to continue as a corporate entity rather than to dissolve.
The Middle West Corp.

The Middle West Corp. (Middle West), successor in bankruptcy to
Middle West Utilities Co., registered under the Holding Company
Act in December 1935. At that time it had 152 subsidiaries, including
62 electric or gas utility companies and fifteen subholding companies.
Sixteen of the 152 subsidiaries were themselves in process of reorganization under the Bankruptcy Act, and these in turn controlled an
additional 74 of the system companies.
As a result of proceedings under section 11 (b) (1) of the act, Middle
West was ordered to sever its relations with all properties, operations
and companies except Central Illinois Public Service Co. and its subsidiaries and Kentucky Utilities Co. and its subsidiaries, jurisdiction
being reserved to consider the retainability of these oompanies."
In 1947, however, the management of Middle West decided to dissolve the corporation and a resolution was presented to stockholders,
who voted in favor of the dissolution. Pursuant to this decision,
Middle West distributed to its stockholders its principal assets, consisting of the common stocks of Central Illinois Public Service Co.,
Kentucky Utilities Co., Public Service Co. of Indiana and Wisconsin
Power & Light CO.52 Many of its smaller properties were sold or
merged into other companies in the system. Middle West has now

disposed of substantially all of its assets. Declarations are pending
before the Commission covering the disposition of its holdings of
common stock of Upper Peninsula Power Co. and of its interest in
four service companies.
In April 1946, the Commission approved the creation of the Central
& South West Corp. system," which is comprised of four electric
utility companies of substantial size. The new system was formed by
merging two subholding companies which between them had four outstanding issues of 6 and 7 percent preferred stock with dividend arrearages totaling about $16,000,000. These shares were retired at the
redemption price plus accrued dividends. The merger also resulted in
increasing combined common equity from 9.5 percent of total capitalization and surplus to 29.5 percent. The new Central & South West
Corp. continues to be subject to the act as a registered holding company controlling an integrated electric system.
Midland United Co. and Midland Utilities Co.

Midland United Co. and its subsidiary, Midland Utilities Co.,
which had been part of the Insull utility empire, filed voluntary petitions for reorganization pursuant to section 77B of the Bankruptcy
Act on June 9, 1934. The trustees of the respective estates registered
as holding companies under the Public Utility Holding Company Act
of 1935 on December 1, 1935. At that time the Midland United
System was comprised of 27 companies and Midland Utilities Co., in
turn, had an additional 18 subsidiaries.
At the time of the filing of the bankruptcy petitions, Midland
United had outstanding secured demand notes, two classes of preferred
stock, both in arrears as to dividends, and common stock. Midland
Utilities had outstanding both secured and unsecured demand notes,
debentures on which there was accumulated unpaid interest, two
classes of preferred stock, both in arrears as to dividends, and common
stock. In addition, there were intercompany claims between the two
companies as well as claims against the estates by various affiliated
and nonaffiliated interests.
Various plans were considered by the reorganization court and by
this Commission and numerous hearings with respect to such plans
were held. The final plan of reorganization was approved by this
Commission in late 1944, and was confirmed by the reorganization
court on April 7, 1945. This plan, which was thereafter consummated, proposed the recapitalization of both companies on a onestock basis with complete liquidation to follow within :five years.
The liquidation of both companies has now been completed.
New England Gas & Electric Association

New England Gas & Electric Association, a Massachusetts trust,
registered as a holding company in 1938 and in 1941 was made the
subject of proceedings under section 11 (b) (2) of the act. At that
time the company's capitalization consisted of five debenture issues,
four of which matured in the years 1947 to 1950, two classes of preferred shares with large dividend arrearages, and common shares.
There was little or no equity for the second preferred and common
stock of New England. Furthermore, under the terms of its declara$3

tion of trust its shares were all nonvoting and vested in the holders no
right or power to elect or remove its trustees, directors, or officers
or to control them in the management of its affairs. The trustees
were self-perpetuating and they in turn appointed or removed officers
and directors.
The system consistedjofj l O electric utilities,' 7 gas:utilities, 2 gas
and electric utilities, a steam-heating company and 2 service companies.
The utility subsidiaries rendered service in the States of Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, and Maine. New England's investments in its subsidiaries were carried at approximately double the related net assets
of the subsidiaries at the dates of their acquisition.
Subsequent to the institution of section 11 (b) (2) proceedings the
trustees of Associated Gas & Electric Co. and Associated Gas &
Electric Corp. asserted claims in the amount of approximately $30,000,000 against New England arising from various transactions between the two systems. It appeared to the Commission that before
a determination could be made with respect to the recapitalization of
New England the validity and rank of the asserted claims would have
to be resolved, and the proceedings under section 11 (b) (2) were
broadened accordingly.
Mter conclusion of very lengthy hearings, but before a decision
of the Commission with respect to the claims, numerous discussions
were held by the parties looking toward a recapitalization plan which
would resolve the section 11 (b) (2) problems and also the complex
claims and counterclaims between New England and the Associated
system. A plan of recapitalization acceptable to the various parties
in the proceeding was then filed and approved by the Commission 64
and by the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts." Due to adverse market conditions, however, this plan was not
consummated. In the following year an alternate plan was approved
by the Commission 56 and was consummated during April 1947.
The alternate plan substituted for the complex capitalization of
New England a capital structure consisting of collateral trust bonds,
preferred stock and common stock. It corrected the lack of voting
power by extending to the proposed shares full voting rights, including
the right to elect trustees annually. The plan also provided for a settlement of the enormous contingent debt liabilities resulting from the
claims litigation and restated the carrying value of New England's
investments in its subsidiaries at approximately $50,000,000, representing related net asset value as shown by the books of the subsidiary
companies.
New England Public Service Co.

This company at the time of its registration had five major operating
subsidiaries, of which two operated in Maine, one in New Hampshire
and two in New Hampshire and Vermont. It also owned, through an
industrial subsidiary, five textile mills, a paper company, and a forest
products manufacturing company. The company was heavily overcapitalized, having outstanding two classes of prior lien preferred
stock and, junior thereto, four classes of preferred stock. All these

liquidate and dissolve.57 The company did not appeal this decision
and has elected to dissolve. It has merged Cumberland County
Power & Light Co. into Central Maine Power Co. and has caused
Public Service Co. of New Hampshire to acquire the New Hampshire
properties of Twin State Gas & Electric Co. and Central Vermont
Public Service Corp. to acquire the Vermont properties of that company. The industrial companies were sold for cash.
A plan filed by the company under section 11 (e) of the act provided
for the retirement of the prior lien stock by the payment of amounts
equal to the voluntary redemption prices, $120 per share for the $7
series and $110 per share for the $6 series, in each case with accrued
dividends. A portion of the cash required was derived from the sale
of the company's interest in its nonutility properties and the balance
from a hank loan. Due to the pendency in the courts of the Engineers
Public Service Co. case, the Commission approved the retirement of
the preferred by the payment for each share of prior lien of $100 per
share and the deposit of the difference in escrow, reserving for future
determination what additional amounts, if any, should be paid on the
prior lien stock." This plan was approved by the district court."

one-third of the former company's common stock. During the current fiscal year the Commission approved a plan for the partialli2,uidation of this company by distribution of cash to its shareholders.

The North American Co.

At its registration in 1937,the North American Co. was the top holding company in a system which through several subholding companies
controlled 36 utility and 46 nonutility subsidiaries. Electric utility
operations were conducted by system companies in 10 States and the
District of Columbia; gas utility operations were conducted in 9 States.
The consolidated balance sheet of North American and its subsidiaries
showed assets of over $900,000,000, and through the direct and indirect ownership of securities North American controlled an empire
whose aggregate value was stated to be approximately $2,200,000,000.
During the last 5 years, North American has taken substantial steps
toward compliance with the Commission's section 11 (b) (1) order,
which was issued in 1942.61 By a number of means, including dividend
payments in portfolio securities, outright distribution, issuance of
purchase warrants to its stockholders and sale at competitive bidding,

sale by North American of its holdings in Capital Transit Co., and
the proposed transfer of Missouri Power & Light Co. to Union

Concurrently with its divestments, North American has eliminated
all of its debt and preferred stock and presently has an all common

Northern States Power Co.

Northern States Power Co., a Delaware corporation, had as its only
substantial asset the common stock of Northern States Power Co., a
Minnesota corporation. The Delaware company had been organized
prior to the passage of the Holding Company Act, largely for the
purpose of avoiding a provision for double stockholders' liability then
contained in the Minnesota corporation law. This provision was later
repealed and for many years the Delaware company performed no
function other than to hold the Minnesota company stock.
The Minnesota company, on the other hand, is a substantial
holding-operating company, engaged, either directly or through subsidiaries, in the gas and electric business in the States of Minnesota,
Wisconsin, North Dakota, and South Dakota, and, to a minor extent,
in illinois.
The Delaware company filed various plans for its liquidation and
dissolution. The principal question arose as to the proportions in
which its principal asset, the common stock of the Minnesota company, should be distributed among its four classes of security holders.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission approved a plan giving
to the 7 percent preferred 41.05 percent, to the 6 percent preferred
36.94 percent, to the class A common stock 18.82 percent and to the
class B common stock 3.19 precent."

great variety of nonutility businesses, including such nonrelated
enterprises as machinery manufacturing, motion picture theater,
wood products manufacturing, railroad transportation, coal production, and oil production. As a result of its top-heavy capital structure-consisting of two series of debentures, preferred stock (with
large dividend arrearages) and three classes of common stock-:U~ilities Power went into bankruptcy in 1937. In 1938, the COmmISSIOn
instituted proceedings against the Utilities Power system under the
integration provisions of section 11 (b) (1) of the act-the first of such
proceedings to be instituted by the Commission.
Emergmg as Utilities Power's successor pursuant to a plan of
reorganization approved by the Commission and by the district court,
Ogden Corp. was committed to a program of divestment of its interests in utility properties, so that it would cease to be a public
utility holding company under the act." Ogden's initial outstanding
securities, which were distributed among the creditors and preferred
stockholders of Utilities Power in the latter's bankruptcy reorganization, consisted of debentures,' preferred stock and common stock.
With the proceeds from the sale or other disposition of public utility
investments, Ogden, as early as 1940, redeemed for cash its entire
outstanding debentures and preferred stocks and has since made
substantial cash distributions to holders of its common stock.
Ogden also caused the reorganization of certain of its utility subsidiaries so as to simplify their capital structures, eliminate dividend
arrearages, and place them on a sound financial basis. Thus, Derby
Gas & Electric Corporation was reorganized in 1942 ;67 The Laclede
Gas Light Co. was reorganized in 1945;68 and Interstate Power Co.
was reorganized in 1948.69 In addition, Central States Power &
Light Corp. disposed of all its physical utility properties and its
liquid assets have been distributed to its security holders and to
certain security holders of its parent company, Central States Utilities
Corp., pursuant to a plan of liquidation and dissolution of both
companies approved by the Commission in July 1947.70
Since its inception in 1940 Ogden has divested itself of direct or
indirect public utility interests With book assets of over $1.50,000,000.
Among the principal divestments were the sale of Ogden's investment
in Indianapolis Power & Light Corp., its interest in the reorganized
Derby company, and of the reorganized Laclede company. In addition, Ogden disposed of investments in numerous nonutility subsidiaries through outright sale or dissolution of such subsidiaries.
Following the reorganization of Interstate, referred to above, certain
shares of new common stock of Interstate, together with cash, were
placed in escrow pending resolution of subordination questions regarding Ogden's former holdings in Interstate, under the principles of the
Deep Rocle case." In June 1949 the Commission approved a plan for

of the escrowed stock and cash to public holders of Interstate's old
debentures and preferred stocks and to Ogden."
The matter is pending in the District Court of the United States for the District of Delaware. Pursuant to the plan, Ogden is committed to disposition of its
holdings in Interstate's new common stock within a year from the
effective date of the plan.
Ogden having disposed of all its interests in public utility properties
(with the single exception of its interest in Interstate which, as noted
above, is destined for early disposition) the Commission, in August
1948, granted an application pursuant to section 5 (d) of the act
declaring Ogden to be no longer a registered holding company, subject
to certain conditions and reservations."
Shortly thereafter, Ogden
registered with the Commission as an investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940.
Of the entire former Utilities Power system, only Derby Gas &
Electric Corp. (with present total consolidated assets of approximately
$15,800,000) and Interstate Power Co. (with present total consolidated assets of approximately $49,000,000) remain subject to the act
as registered holding companies.
Standard Power & Light Corp. and Standard Gas & Electric Co.

The Standard holding company system presented in extreme degree
the evils of corporate pyramiding and scatteration of properties which
the integration and simplification provisions of the act were designed
to eliminate.
Standard Power, through its subsidiary, Standard Gas,
controlled at that time 104 active subsidiaries whose operations Were
conducted in 20 different States and Mexico, and the system contained
9 registered holding companies. At June 30, 1949, the number of
active subsidiaries had been reduced to 66 companies (including 43
street railway companies) operating in 8 States, and the number of
registered holding companies to 3. The system presently comprises
Philadelphia Co. and its subsidiaries, Wisconsin Public Service Corp.,
Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co., Louisville Gas & Electric Co., and
Market Street Railway Co., an inactive company in process of dissolution. Substantially all of the proceeds from divestments together with
undistributed earnings of Standard Gas were applied to the reduction
of Standard Gas' indebtedness from some $71,000,000 in 1940 to
$9,800,000 as of June 30, 1949. On December 31, 1948, the Commission entered an order requiring either the liquidation of Standard
Gas or its recapitalization on an all-eommon stock structure.f
In 1947, extensive hearings were held on the status under section 11
of Standard Gas' principal subsidiary, Philadelphia Co. That company is a holding company whose principal subsidiaries are engaged
in serving the Pittsburgh area with electricity (Duquesne Light Co.),
natural gas (Equitable Gas Co.) and street railway and bus transportation (Pittsburgh Railways Co. and its underliers).
In June 1948,
the Commission ordered Philadelphia Co. to dispose of its interests
in the. natural gas utility and the transportation businesses and thereafter to liquidate and dissolve," Standard and Philadelphia Co. filed

Appeals for the District of Columbia. Briefs were filed and oral
argument was had on May 19, 1949. As of the end of the fiscal year
the matter was pending decision by the court.
In late 1948, Standard Gas filed a voluntary plan for the simplification of the capital structure of Philadelphia Co., providing for the
retirement of Philadelphia Co.'s $36,000,000 of funded debt and
$40,000,000 of preferred stocks. Hearings on that plan were commenced in April 1949 and have been adjourned to October 1949 to
permit Standard to prepare and file amendments.
An important development in the compliance by Standard Gas &
Electric Co. with section 11 occurred in May 1949, when a compromise
plan for the reorganization of Pittsburgh Railways Co., which has been
in bankruptcy since 1938, was announced." The transit system in
Pittsburgh is operated by Pittsburgh Railways Co. under complex
lease and operating agreements. It is owned by 55 separate corporations which have 42 security issues outstanding in the hands of the
public and some 80 other security issues held by Philadelphia Company and its subsidiaries. Philadelphia Co. and Pittsburgh Railways,
in addition, have guaranteed or are otherwise obligated to pay rentals,
bond interest, taxes and other obligations of some of the underlying
companies. Under the plan, a single company would be formed which
would replace all of the existing companies, and would have a simple
capital structure consisting of common stock and not to exceed
$6,000,000 of bonds. During the last fiscal year two major voluntary
simplification plans of subholding companies in the Standard System-Louisville Gas & Electric Co. and Northern States Power Co.,
both Delaware holding companies superimposed upon operating utilities having the same names-were consummated, marking the culmination of extensive hearings and lengthy court proceedings. Those
companies are now in the process of liquidation.
Perhaps the most significant recent development in the system,
from the point of view of stockholders, was the resumption in early
1949 of regular quarterly dividends on the senior preferred stocks of
Standard Gas for the first time since 1934, made possible by the substantial improvement in the system's ear~
in recent years and the
refunding of Standard Gas' bank loan. This, in turn, made possible
the resumption, for the first time since 1935, of regular quarterly
dividends on the preferred stock of Standard Power.
The United Light & Railways Co.

On February 18, 1938, The United Light & Power Co. registered
as a holding company with a system comprised of 10 holding companies, 7 of which were registered holding companies, 21 electric and
gas utility subsidiari~ 20 nonutility subsidiaries, and a service company. In 1941 the Commission directed the dissolution of United
Light & Power Co. and United American Co., a subholding company."
By a subsequent order the Commission directed the divestment of the
interests of United Light & Power Co. and the subholding companies
in 22 subsidiaries in order to comply with the standards of section 11
of the act."

After a series of transactions designed to enable Light and Power to
comply with:the:outstanding order of dissolution, the Commission approved a plan which provided, in substance, for the distribution of
Light and Power's remaining investment, the common stock of United
Light & Railways Co., to its common stockholders."
The residual
net assets of Light and Power were transferred to Railways, and Light
and Power was dissolved. Thus, Railways became the system's top
holding company with two principal subholding company systems,
Continental Gas & Electric Corp. and American Light & Traction Co.
In June 1947 Railways and Light & Traction filed a plan which
provided, among other things, for the divestment by Railways of its
entire interest in Light & Traction and the continuation of the latter as
a registered holding company holding an integrated gas utility system.
Light & Traction had, in the interim, embarked on a program to finance
and construct a large interstate natural gas pipe line from the operating
areas of its natural gas subsidiaries to fields in the Hugoton area.
Other more important provisions of thelplan provided for the divestment of the common stock of Detroit "Edison Co. held by Light &
Traction and Railways and the retirement of the preferred stocks of
the two holding companies.
On February 17, 1949, Railways and Continental publicly announced
their intention to liquidate and dissolve and a plan under section 11 (e)
was accordingly filed with the Commission on May 31, 1949.80 The
liquidation and dissolution of the two companies will be accomplished,
after retirement of their debt, by the distribution of the common stocks
of subsidiary companies to common stockholders of Railways and to a
small minority interest holding common stock of Continental.
If the
proposed dissolutions are consummated, there will remain of the complex holding and subholding company system of The United Light &
Power Co. only an integrated gas utility system held by Light and
Traction, which has changed its name to American Natural Gas Co.
United Corp.

The United Corp. registered as a holding company in March 1938,
at which time its portfolio was largely comprised of the common stock
of four holding company subsidiaries. These subsidiaries, with the
percentage of voting control held by United, were as follows: The
United Gas Improvement Co., 26.2 percent; Public Service Corp.
of New Jersey, 13.9 percent; Niagara Hudson Power Corp., 23.4 percent; and Columbia Gas & Electric Corp. (now the Columbia Gas
System, Inc.), 19.6 percent.
In June 1941, the Commission instituted proceedings with respect to
United under sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) of the act. At that time
the 125 companies in the United System operated in 22 States and in
Canada. Their combined total assets approximated $2,765,000,000.
Subsequently, the Commission ordered that United change its existing
capitalization, which consisted of preferred and common stocks, to one
class of stock and that it cease to be a holding company." United
has since retired all of its preference stock by exchanging for it portfolio

There is pending before the Commission a plan for the distribution to

Niagara Hudson Power Corp.

In 1942 the Commission instituted proceedings under section 11
(b) (2) with respect to Niagara Hudson, its subholding company,
Buffalo Niagara and Eastern Power Corp. (BNE), and their 18 subsidiary companies. Subsequently, a plan was filed pursuant to section
11 (e) of the act providing, among other things, for the consolidation of
BNE and its 3 principal public-utility subsidiaries, the dissolution of
Niagara Hudson and the payment of accrued and unpaid preferred
dividends. This plan, however, was disapproved by the Public
Service Commission of the State of New York. Thereafter the
Commission issued an order requiring BNE to recapitalize on a one
stock basis."
BNE and Niagara Hudson then filed plans providing for the consolidation of BNE and certain of its subsidiaries into Buffalo Niagara
Electric Corp. as a surviving company."
To accomplish the reorganization Niagara Hudson used approximately $63,000,000 in retiring the
publicly held second preferred stock of BNE at its call price plus
accrued dividends. These funds were obtained from bank loans,
treasury cash and proceeds from the.sale:of certain of Niagara Hudson's
portfolio securities.
At the end of the 1949 fiscal year there were pending before the
Commission plans providing, among other things, for the consolidation into a single operating company of Niagara Hudson's principal
subsidiaries; namely, the new Buffalo Niagara Electric Corp., Central N ew York Power Corp., and N ew York Power & Light Corp.;
the reclassification of the common stock of the new operating company
into class A and common stocks; the exchange of class A stock for the
outstanding preferred stocks of Niagara Hudson j the offering of the
common stock of the new operating company to Niagara Hudson's
own common stockholders on a subscription basis; and the eventual
dissolution of Niagara Hudson. 85
The Columbia Gas System, Inc.

Columbia registered as a holding company in January 1938. There

In 1941, the Commission instituted proceedings with regard to
Columbia and several of its subsidiaries. including Columbia Oil &
Gasoline Corp. The plan involved, among other things, the sale by
Columbia Oil & Gasoline Corp. of its interest in Panhandle Eastern
Pipe Line Co., the transfer of its five oil and gasoline subsidiaries to
Columbia, and its subsequent liquidation. The Commission approved this plan 86 and consummation thereof had the effect of
divorcing Panhandle Eastern from the Columbia System, a step which
the Commission had found to be necessary under section 11 (b) (1).87
The plan also extricated some of the companies and other interested
parties from the problems which they faced under the antitrust
laws, and terminated a complex tangle of private litigation.
After further proceedings under sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2)
with regard to Columbia and its remaining subsidiaries, the Commission found that Columbia could retain the distribution operations of
the Charleston, Pittsburgh and Columbus groups of gas properties,
as well as the production and transmission properties owned and
operated by the companies within each group." The Commission
further found that certain other properties, including the properties
owned by the Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. and the Dayton Power
& Light Co. were not retain able by Columbia and should be divested.
Columbia has fully complied with this order and anticipates continued
existence as a holding company controlling an integrated gas system.
Since 1946, Columbia has issued and sold $78,000,000 principal amount
of debentures in order to obtain funds for construction purposes and
has raised new equity money through the issue and sale to its stockholders of 2,568,300 shares of additional common stock at $10 per
share.
The United Gas Improvement Co.

United Gas Improvement Company (UGI) registered as a holding
company in March 1938 with approximately 50 subsidiary companies
engaged in the electric, gas, and miscellaneous businesses. After
section 11 (b) (1) proceedings, the Oommission defined its integrated
system as the electric properties in the Pennsylvania, Delaware, and
Maryland area, and orders of divestment were issued on the basis of
this interpretation."
Thereafter voluntary plans under section 11
(e) were filed by UGI and its subsidiary, Philadelphia Electric 00.,
for the purpose of enabling the UGI system to effect partial compliance with section 11 (b). Pursuant to this plan, which was approved
by the Commission P" UGI distributed to its preferred and common
stockholders $30,600,000 in cash and substantially all its stockholdings
in Philadelphia Electric and in Public Service Corp. of New Jersey.
The consummation of this plan and the retirement of UGI's preferred stock made possible the further distribution of investments and
cash to its common stockholders. It also made possible an exchange
of properties between UGI and nonaffiliated holding company systems, out of which evolved the present holding company system of
Delaware Power & Light Co.

UGI later distributed to its stockholders its holdings of Delaware
Power & Light Co. and exchanged for approximately 750,000 shares
of its outstanding capital stock its portfolio holdings of securities of
4 public utility holding 'companies; namely, American Water Works
& Electric Co., Inc., The Commonwealth & Southern Corp., Niagara
Hudson Power Corp. and Public Service Corp. of New Jersey.
As of December 31, 1948, the UGI system consisted of five gas
utility companies, one gas and electric company and five nonutility
companies.
Public Service Corp. of New Jersey

Public Service Corp. of New Jersey for more than 40 years had been
a holding company with respect to numerous electric, gas, and transportation subsidiaries operating primarily in the State of New Jersey.
While it had been subject to the provisions of the act as a subsidiary
of United Corp., it was, until 1946, exempted by rule from registration as a holding company. On June 12, 1946, the Commission revoked the exemption and instituted proceedings under sections
11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) with respect to the system}" shortly thereafter Public Service registered as a holding company. At that time
Public Service had four utility subsidiaries, chief of which were
Public Service Electric & Gas Co. (PEG), and a transportation subsidiary, Public Service Coordinated Transport (Transport) which in
turn had four nonutility subsidiaries.
At December 31, 1946, Public Service had outstanding $19,087,455
face amount of 6 percent perpetual interest bearing certificates secured primarily by noncallable preferred stocks of PEG and Transport with an aggregate par or stated value of more than twice the
face value of the perpetuals. At the same date Public Service also
had outstanding $160,000,000 aggregate par or stated value of noncallable preferred stocks bearing dividend rates of $8, $7, $6, and 5
percent as well as $112,000,000 stated value of common stock. In
addition to these high cost, noncallable and perpetual securities which
constituted an unparalleled stranglehold on system growth and
expansion, numerous other classes and series of securities were held
within the system.
As a result of a plan consummated on July 1, 1948, Public Service
was dissolved and its security holders received securities of PEG,
the principal operating company, in exchange for those of Public
Service.92 Substantially all perpetual and noncallable securities were
eliminated, thus clearing the way for future system financing on an
economical basis. Inflationary items in the accounts of the subsidiaries were either eliminated or subjected to a program of amortization. Several subsidiary companies were recapitalized, one was sold,
and two were merged, the stock of the merged company being distributed to the Public Service common stockholders. PEG and its
transportation subsidiaries are no longer subject to the provisions of
the act.

The system of American Water Works & Electric Co., Inc. was comprised, at the date of registration, of 14 subholding companies (in.
eluding 4 which were also operating companies), 14 electric or gas
utility companies and 122 nonutility companies, most of which were
water companies.
In 1947 American was liquidated and dissolved, resulting in the
payment and discharge of $13,850,000 principal amount of corporate
mdebtedness of American and of $19,986,800 aggregate par value
of corporate preferred stocks. There is still pending for the decision
of the Commission the treatment to be accorded the holders of certificates issued to the preferred stock in lieu of any additional payment over voluntary liquidation price of $100 per share. The redemption premium applicable to this preferred stock was $10 per
share. (Holding Company Act releases Nos. 7091 and 7208.).
This liquidation also resulted in the divestment of 70 water companies and the payment and discharge of preferred stocks plus arrears
of a subsidiary aggregating in excess of $4,000,000. West Penn
Electric Co. is now the top holding company in the system and
controls 20 direct and indirect subsidiary companies engaged in
electric, gas, transportation, and certain minor businesses in sections
of Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Maryland, Virginia, and Ohio.
The major operating utility operations of West Penn Electric have
been consolidated ill three companies, Monongahela Power Co.,
West Penn Power Co., and the Potomac Edison CO.
COOPERATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY
AUTHORITIES

It is the established policy- of the Commission to seek effective
cooperation with State commissions in all matters where their respective jurisdictions complement each other and in all other cases where
such cooperation is desirable and appropriate.
Because the work of holding company simplification and integration
is progressing at a good pace, large numbers of electric and gas utility
operating companies have been divested and accordingly have passed
from the jurisdiction of the Commission under the Holding Company
A.ct. However, mutual problems of regulation continue to arise
and in these instances, every effort is made to encourage exchange
of ideas and information in furtherance of the policy of cooperation
so clearly reflected in various sections of the Holding Company Act.
Most instances of cooperation during the past year have involved
questions related to the capital structures of particular companies.
The Commission has consistently stood for conservative capitalization
and adequate common equity. In the recent case involving Wisconsin Public Service Corp., the assistance of the State commission
has been particularly helpful in this respect. Application was made
by the company in April 1949 for the issuance of $3,000,000 bank
loans, one-half for immediate issuance with the balance to be sold
in August. The application also reflected the eventual need for
$8,000,000 of permanent financing but offered no indication as to
how such financing would be accomplished. Because of the marginal
equity ratio of Wisconsin, the staff expressed concern to the company
over the absence of any indicated common stock financing in the near

120

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

future. It also advised a staff member of the Wisconsin Public
Service Commission regarding the particular application and related
aspects of the capitalization picture. Final scheduling of the financial
program for Wisconsin Public Service Corp. has not yet been acc0D!p~
lished but the two commissions have a common objective ill seeking
an improved equity ratio for the company- and further conferences
are in prospect. In this connection it should be noted that over the
past several years the staff of this Commission haa worked closely
with the staff of the Wisconsin Commission on the problems of a
number of Wisconsin companies.
The matter of appropriate financial structure was also discussed in
February 1949 between the staff of this Commission and members of
the Vermont Public Service Commission in respect to Green Mountain
Power Corp., a subsidiary of New England Electric System. Arrearages had accumulated on the preferred stock in amount sufficient to
give that stock voting control and the company was in need of financial
reorganization. Another problem was the presence of substantial
amounts of excess over original cost in the property accounts. These
and other features were considered in conference and it was indicated
that no final action would be taken by the Commission until the views
of the Vermont Commission had been presented.
The staff of the Commission also had the benefit of discussion in
October 1948 with representatives of the Public Service Commission
of Indiana on matters relating to the acquisition by Ohio Valley Gas
Co. of three gas companies from United Public Utilities Corp. and the
resultant financial structure of Ohio Valley. As a result of these conferences joint recommendations for changes in the proposal were
agreed upon as a condition precedent to its approval. The changes
were designed to achieve an objective of the Indiana Commission's
representatives, who wished to see the transactions result in the purchasing company owning the properties of the three gas companies
rather than their securities. It was also expected that these revisions
would conserve cash for construction. The joint recommendations
were then discussed with representatives of the purchasing company
who altered their proposal in such manner as to make it acceptable to
both commissions. Changes made in the proposed bond indenture
aided the company in securing a more flexible instrument and a
lowered cost of its debt money.
Another instance of cooperative effort involves the allplication by
Appalachian Electric Power Co. for approval of a proposal to establish
a line of credit with four banks amounting to $18,000,000. In setting
this matter down for hearing the Commission set forth, as among the
Issues to be considered, the future financing plans of Appalachian and
its parent company, American Gas & Electric Co., and the extent to
which the proposed construction program will be financed by equity
capital. Since this matter is of considerable interest to local authorities, the commissions in each of the States in which American Gas
operates were served with notice of the hearing and the Virginia State
Corporation Commission indicated that it intended to have an observer
present at the proceedings.
Other instances of cooperation during the past year were related to
problems involved in the Commission's administration of section 11
and other provisions of the Holding Company Act. For example,

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

121

there has been pending before this Commission since late 1947 a proposal by American Power & Light Co. to contribute to the Washington
Water Power Co. its holdings of all of the common stock of Pacific
Power & Light Co.
Simultaneously with the application made to the Commission for
authority to acquire the Pacific stock, a similar application was made
by Washington to the Washington Department of Public Utilities (now
Public Service Commission). In a decision dated March 9, 1948, the
Washington Commission refused to permit the acquisition, holding
that approval would have created a holding company relationship
which in the opinion of that commission constituted an unnecessary
corporate complexity. On April 8, 1948, American filed with the
Commission a plan which, among other things, called for a further
application to the Washington department by Washington for permission to acquire the common stock of Pacific. In the alternative
the plan proposed that American be continued in existence to hold the
common stocks of Pacific and Washington. This, of course, raises a
question of modification of the Commission's order of August 22, 1942,
which directed the dissolution of American. Since the proposal vitally
affected utilities operating in both Washington and Oregon, the
Washington department, through its attorney general, was upon
application made a party to the proceeding and while no representative
of the attorney general appeared, a letter from him was read into the
record indicating the Washington department's deep concern with that
part of the plan relating to Washington.
His letter was also made
available to counsel for each of the parties and participants.
In September of 1948 all of the exhibits received during the proceeding, numbering in the aggregate over 100, were sent to the attorney general at his request, together with copies of those parts of the
transcript containing testimony relating to the Washington company.
Subsequently, the chairman of the new Washington Public Service
Commission and the Oregon Commissioner of Public Utilities jointly
wired the Commission setting forth their views as to those parts of
the plan which touched on the relinquishment by American of control
over Washington and Pacific. Throughout this period a number of
conferences have been held between members of the Commission
staff and representatives of the Oregon Commissioner and the Washington Commission, pertaining to this problem and related matters
affecting the Washington and Pacific companies.
The Commission also had discussions with the Public Service Commission of Utah during March 1949. The Utah commission, acting
in collaboration with local Rural Electrification Administration cooperatives, requested this Commission to defer for 2 months proceedings in the United States District Court for the Southern DIStrict of
New York for approval of a plan involving the reorganization of
Washington Gas & Electric Co. The additional time was requested
in order to enable the cooperatives to make studies preparatory to
submission of a bid for the acquisition of Washington's sole subsidiary, Southern Utah Power Co. Discussions between the staffs
of the-two Commissions served to satisfy the Utah commission that
the procedures contemplated would assure the cooperative organizations the desired amount of time.
In October 1948 the Commission received communications from the

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

common counsel of Detroit, Mich., and from the city manager of
Madison, Wis., with respect to a. proposal of Michigan-Wisconsin
Pipeline Co. to sell $66,000,000 of Its first-mortgage bonds .. Though
it was found necessary to exempt this sale of bonds from Its usual
competitive bidding requirements, the petitions of these city governments in favor of the bidding procedure were carefully weighed in
the findings and opinion of the Commission.
Corporation counsel
for the city of Detroit also appeared as a party in these proceedings.
LITIGATION

ARISING UNDER THE ACT

Toward the end of the fiscal year the Supreme Court sustained the
Commission on major issues of law governing the consideration and
enforcement of plans submitted pursuant to section 11 (e) of the
Holding Company Act. In a case posing fundamental questions
concerning the Commission's valuation technique and the scope of
review by the district courts which had been the subject of differing
opinions within the Commission and strong attack from outside, the
Supreme Court directed enforcement of a section 11 (e) plan as
approved by the Commission, reversing the court of appeals and the
district court."
Because of the far-reaching importance of this case,
it is discussed below in relation to the development of the principles
adopted by the Supreme Court.
During the year district courts of the United States entered orders
enforcing voluntary plans approved by the Commission under section
11 (e) of the act in 14 cases. In 12 of these cases the plans were
declared effective and were consummated during the course of the
year, or were in process of being consummated at the close of the year.
In one case the order of the court was vacated at the instance of the
Commission, where changed circumstances had rendered the plan not
feasible. Appeals were taken from four of the enforcement orders.
In two of these cases motions were made for a stay of the district
court's orders, and in each case the motion was denied. At the close
of the fiscal year one of the appeals had been dismissed on stipulation,
and the others were pending.
In three cases, petitions were filed with the courts of appeals
pursuant to section 24 (a) of the act to review orders entered by the
Commission. In one such case, the Philadelphia Co. petitioned for
review of the Commission's order under section 11 (b) of the act
directing the company to divest itself of its interests in gas and transportation operations and to dissolve."
Stay of the Commission's
order was granted pending determination of the appeal, which had not
been decided at the close of the fiscal year. Thereafter the Commission's order was affirmed.95:" A second petition, to review an order
of the Commission denying a committee's request for authority to
solicit funds from stockholders," had not been perfected at the end
of the fiscal year. The third petition involved the propriety of the
Commission's determination that preferred stockholders of a holding
company subsidiary merged into an affiliated company were entitled

to receive more than the liquidation preferences of their stock. .After
the end of the fiscal year the Commission's order was affirmed."
During the fiscal year two appeals from orders of the United States
district courts approving section 11 (e) plans, pending at the commencement of the year, were disposed of, in the one case by affirmance
of the district court order," and in the other by dismissal on stipulation.
At the commencement of the fiscal year there were pending before
the court of appeals six petitions for review of Commission orders
under the act. In three such cases the orders were affirmed, in one
the petition was dismissed, in another a Commission motion to dismiss
was pending at the end of year, and in the sixth the Commission's
order was reversed. In that case the court of appeals held that the
Commission had denied the Philadelphia Co. procedural due process in
that the company had not been afforded an opportunity to adduce
evidence in opposition to a proposed amendment to rule U-49 (c)
of the Commission's General Rules of Practice under the Public
Utility Holding Company Act.DD
The Supreme Court granted
certiorari, but prior to hearing, the decision of the Court of Appeals
was vacated on joint motion of counsel, the company having submitted
to the amended rule and the matter having become moot.'
A list of all cases in which administration of the Holding Company
act was an issue and the status of those cases at June 30, 1949, is
set forth in the appendix. The following section discusses the Commission's record in the courts in proceedings for the enforcement
of section 11 (e) plans, in relation to the Supreme Court decision
mentioned above.
ENFORCEMENT PROCEEDINGS UNDER SECTION 11 (E) OF THE ACT

In enacting the Holding Company Act, Congress recognized that
the problems in holding company systems were so extensive and the
task of simplification so complicated that legislative action alone
without administrative supervision would not effectively meet the
situation.
The enforcement of the act, therefore, was entrusted
to the Commission. Thus section 11 (b) directs the Commission to
determine what action should be taken by registered holding companies
to meet the standards of the act. The Commission may, under
section 11 (d), apply to a court to enforce an order issued by the
Commission under section 11 (b), and in such cases the court is given
power over the company and its assets to enforce the order of the
Commission in accordance with a plan which shall have been approved
by it.
Congress recognized, however, that it was desirable to encourage
voluntary compliance with the act by the various holding company
systems. Under section 11 (e) registered holding companies and their
subsidiaries are permitted to file voluntary plans designed to meet
the requirement of section 11 (b), and it is this voluntary cooperative
route to effectuate compliance which has been followed in most cases.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Section 11 (e) of the act provides that if after notice and opportunity
for hearing the Commission finds a plan, as submitted or as modified,
necessary to effectuate the provisions of section 11 (b) and fair and equitable to the persons affected by the plan, the Commission shall make
an order approving the plan and at the request of the company may
apply to a district court of the United States to enforce and carry out
the provisions of the plan. If the court, upon such application and
after notice of opportunity for hearing, approves the plan as fair
and equitable and appropriate to effectuate the provisions of section 11,
the court then enters an order enforcing and carrying out the plan.
Whether a plan satisfies the standards of the act in respect of
"necessity" is a question primarily for Commission determination,"
To be necessary within the meaning of section 11 (e) of the act a plan
need not by itself effectuate complete compliance with the requirements of section 11. It is sufficient if the plan provides a suitable
and expeditious means for achieving results necessary under section
11 (b), although different means might have been chosen and further
steps may be necessary,"
In Electric Power &: Light Oorporation,' a plan was found necessary
wherein it was proposed, inter alia, that a new holding company be
organized which would, prima facie, meet the integration standards
of the act, even though objecting stockholders urged other methods of
effectuating compliance with the Commission's prior order directing
the holding company to dissolve.
In cases arising under the Bankruptcy Act the Supreme Court
held, as urged by the Commission, that in order to be "fair and
equitable" a plan must satisfy the "absolute priority" standard;
that is, the full priority of senior securities must be compensated
before junior security holders may participate in the reorganization,"
In the application of the absolute priority standard to the requirement
that a plan under section 11 (e) of the act must be fair and equitable,
the Commission has evolved what has come to be known as the
"investment value" doctrine. In brief, this holds that the measure
of equitable equivalence for purposes of simplification proceedings
compelled by the Holding Company Act is the value of the securities
on the basis of a going business and not as though a liquidation were
taking place," except as it appears that liquidation could and would
have taken place apart from the compulsion of section 11.7
Since the passage of the act, the Commission has filed applications
with United States district courts for the enforcement of 80 such voluntary plans, of which 3 were pending as of June 30,1949. In 75 cases
the plans were approved by the district court.
In the 2 cases where
approval was refused by the district court the court was reversed, in
1 case by the court of appeals," and in the other by the Supreme Court,"
Appeals from enforcement orders of district courts were taken in 16

cases, of which 6 were dismissed or discontinued, 8 were affirmed, and
as of June 30, 1949, 2 were pending." In 5 cases petitions for writs
of certiorari were filed to seek review of decisions of courts of appeals
affirming enforcement orders of the district courts. In 4 cases the
petitions were denied and, in the fifth, the decision of the court of
appeals was affirmed. Thus, every case heretofore decided on the
Commission's applications for court enforcement of section 11 (e)
plans has resulted in court approval of the plan.
Before it may issue an enforcement order, the district court must
find that the plan is fair and equitable to the persons affected and
appropriate to effectuate section, 11 of the act. Accordingly, the
court orders a hearing on these issues and directs that notice be given
of such hearing to the security holders affected by the plan. The
enforcement proceeding is based upon the record made before the
Commission, containing all the evidence relating to the plan. Until
the decision of the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in the
Engineers case, the courts had consistently held that an enforcement
proceeding under section 11 (e) did not constitute a trial de novo.
The doubts raised by the Engineers case as to the scope of review by
the enforcement court, and the nature of the hearing in the enforcement court, were resolved by the decision of the Supreme Court
reversing the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Supreme
Court held that the scope of review of the district court in enforcement proceedings under section 11 (e) of the act is identical with the
review process prescribed in section 24 (a) of the act, relating to petitions to a court of appeals to review orders of the Commission; that
is, the decision of the Commission is to be sustained if supported by
substantial evidence and not contrary to law.
The determination of what constitutes fair and equitable treatment under the standards of section 11 (e) often involves review of
intercorporate transactions to ascertain whether there has been such
wrongdoing on the part of the parent as to require subordination of
its claims to those of other security holders under the doctrine of
Taylor v. Standard Gas and Electric Oompany.ll These "Deep Rock"
matters have formed an integral part of many plans filed under section 11 (e) of the act." The jurisdiction of the Commission to approve
claims settlements in the context of a section 11 (e) plan even though
such settlements are not the result of arm's-length bargaining was
affirmed during the year by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit." The courts during the year also upheld the Commission's
approval of two plans embodying similar settlements of claims and
involving other problems of allocations of assets.l" In all three cases
court actions had been instituted based on the alleged wrongdoing by
the parent company; consummation of the plans would in effect dispose of that litigation. After the decision in the North American
case the district court held that dividends paid by Illinois Power

Company on the shares of its common stock allocated to public stockholders of North American Light &: Power Company should be distributed to such stockholders along with the Illinois Power Company
stock."
In two other contested decisions decided during the fiscal year the
courts enforced plans, approved by the Commission, providing for
the retirement of holding company preferred stocks by distributions
of common shares of subsidiary companies."
In re National Power &:
Light Company 17 the district court upheld the' Commission's determination with respect to the amount of the fee payable by the company to counsel representing a security holder in a reorganization
involving primarily settlement of claims and upheld the exclusive
iurisdiction of the Commission to pass on such fees.
In the above cases involving allocations of new or portfolio securities to the security holders of holding companies, as in the Otis case,
application of the investment value doctrine required determination of equitable equivalence between the rights surrendered and the
securities given in compensation therefor, involving primarily comparisons of the amount and quality of earnings applicable to the securities
retired by the plans with the amount and quality of earnings applicable to the securities to be distributed under the plans. In such cases
it is held that a dollar valuation need not be placed upon either the
old or the new securities. The valuation problem was presented in
somewhat different form in plans providing for the retirement of senior
securities by payments in cash.
In such cases the Commission held, with court approval, that
redemption premiums as such are not payable, and that where the
investment value of the securities being surrendered is not in excess
of the involuntary liquidation preference or face amount, payment
of that or a lesser amount is fair and equitable. IS In American Power
&: Light Company 19 the Commission held that application of the
investment value theory called for the payment of an amount equal
to the voluntary call price of callable debentures being retired pursuant
to section 11 (e) plan, where the investment value of the debentures
was at least equal to the call price, and for payment of a somewhat
greater amount with respect to debentures which would not be callable
until some time after the effective date of the plan. In a subsequent
case 20 the Commission held unfair a plan calling for the retirement of
a noncallable preferred stock by payment in cash at the liquidation
preference.
In the Engineers case the Commission approved a plan
calling for the retirement of preferred stocks at an amount equal to
the call price, where it found that the investment value of those

stocks was at least equal to that amount. The district court, on the
Commission's application for enforcement, found the plan unfair in
that regard, and held that no more than the involuntary liquidation
preference might be paid. The district court in its decision considered
as controlling certain factors which it grouped under the term "colloquial
equities." The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit held that the
district court had no power to amend the plan, but approved the
district court's rejection of the investment value doctrine as applied
by the Commission. The Supreme Court, on June 27, 1949, reversed
the court of appeals and held that investment value was the proper
basis for evaluating the prior claim of preferred stockholders in a
liquidation compelled by the Holding Company Act.
Other Court Decisions during the Fiscal Year

In South Carolina Public Service Authority v. S. E. 0.21 the court
of appeals affirmed an order of the Commission which granted exemption from its competitive bidding rule to The Commonwealth &
Southern Company with respect to the sale of all the common stock
of South Carolina Power Company. Assuming without deciding that
petitioner, a public authority, was a "party aggrieved" by the
Commission's order, the court of appeals found that a higher offer of
the petitioner for the stock afforded no justification for upsetting that
order, in view of a decision of the South Carolina Supreme Court that
the petitioner had no power to make a purchase of this character.
In North American Utility Securities Oorporation v. Posen 22 the
company sought an injunction against the individual defendants to
prevent their solicitation of authorizations from its stockholders to
represent them in connection with a plan of reorganization pending
before the Commission, claiming that such solicitation would violate
Section 11 (g) of the act. The Commission, which had authorized
the solicitation, intervened as a party defendant and moved for dismissal of the complaint. The district court dismissed the complaint
on the merits, and on appeal the order was affirmed.
SUMMARY OF LmGATION

UNDER THE HOLDING COMPANY ACT

The over-all impact of court litigation upon the administration of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act during the 14 years of its
existence may also be summarized by statistical measurement. A
total of 246 civil and criminal proceedings, exclusive of Bankruptcy
Act proceedings, in which the validity or enforcement of the statute
was in issue, have been initiated in the courts. Litigation has been
completed with respect to 234 of these proceedings; the remaining 12
were pending on June 30, 1949.
Petitions to Review Orders of the Conunission

Seventy of the 246 proceedings initiated were petitions to United
States courts of appeals to review orders of the Commission as provided

In the proceeding remanded to the Commission, the Commission in
effect reaffirmed its previous order upon different grounds, and was
ultimately upheld by the United States Supreme Court." One of the
two proceedings vacated as moot involved an order of the court of
appeals which had disapproved action of the Commission in amending
a rule; 25 in the other proceeding the court of appeals had affirmed in
part and reversed in part an order of the Commission." In both
instances the companies concerned undertook to comply with the
Commission action under review while the proceedings were pending
in the Supreme Court.
The one Commission order ultimately reversed 27 had exempted
International Paper & Power Co., from certain provisions of the
act in respect of certain specific transactions to be consummated
during the pendency of, and after Commission decision on, the company's pending application for a general exemption. Thereafter the
Commission disposed of the pending application by entry of an order
declaring International not to be a holding company."

of Reorganization

Plans under

Section 11

Eighty-six of the 246 proceedings were initiated by applications by
the Commission to United States district courts for orders enforcing
plans of reorganization under sections 11(d) and (e) of the act. One
of the 86 proceedings was based upon an application of the Commission, filed at the request of a registered holding company, to enforce
an order directing dissolution of the company. The district court

appeals had refused to dismiss the petition to review, rejecting the Commission's contention that no reviewable "order" within the meaning of section 24(a) of the act was mvolved [PhUadelphla Co. v. 8. E. C., 164 F.

On 1 application for enforcement, not included among applications granted, the court entered an order
enforcing certain uncontested provisions of the plan during the fiscal year; the proceeding was pending on
June 30, 1949,with respect to 8 contested provisioa or the plan.
I

In five of the eight cases where district court orders were affirmed
by the courts of appeals, review was sought in the United States
Supreme Court, but in four cases the petitions were denied; in the
fifth case the order of the court of appeals was affirmed." One of the
enforcement orders was subsequently vacated at the request of the
Commission and others, upon a showing of material changes in circumstances during the course of the litigation."
Notice of appeal
from the remand was filed but the appeal had not been perfected prior
to June 30, 1949. Another enforcement order was vacated at the
request of the Commission and upon approval by the district court of
an alternate plan."
In one of the two proceedings in which the district court denied an
application of the Commission for an order of enforcement, the court
of appeals reversed the order of the district court, and review was
denied by the United States Supreme Court. sa Upon a showing of
material changes in circumstances during the pendency of this litigation, the district court, with the concurrence of the Commission, subsequently remanded the plan to the Commission for further consideration. An appeal from the remand order was dismissed by the court of
appeals. In the second proceeding involving denial of the Commission's application, the district court disapproved an important aspect
of the plan but ordered enforcement of the plan as modified." On
appeal from that portion of the order disapproving part of the plan,
the court of appeals upheld the district court in that regard, but reversed on the ground that the district court should have remanded the
plan to the Commission." ~The United States Supreme Court reversed
the order of the court of appeals, and directed enforcement of the
entire plan as approved by the Commiesion."

Supp. 928 (S. D. N. Y., 1943).

Inone of the seven cases in which permanent injunctions were granted,
an appeal was taken and the injunction was finally affirmed by the
United States Supreme Court."
In a second of these cases, an order
of the district court granting a temporary injunction was affirmed by
the court of appeals prior to the granting of a final injunction by the
district court.40 In a third case, the court of appeals affirmed the
order of the district court with modifications."
In all of the proceedings dismissed or discontinued, that action
was taken upon the motion, or with the consent or acquiescence, of the
Commission. One such proceeding revolved around an order of the
Commission revoking an exemption previously granted to a holding
company. The court of appeals affirmed an order of the district court
denying an injunction to prevent consummation of a plan of reorganization which had been put into effect while the revocation proceeding
was pending."
The courts enjoined the company from carrying out
the reorganization plan pending final disposition of the case. The
company registered with the Commission while the matter was under
consideration by the Supreme Court and, upon unopposed motion of
counsel for the Commission, the judgment of the court of appeals was
vacated and the proceeding remanded to the district court with instructions to dismiss the complaint as moot.v
Two proceedings were dismissed following entry of a temporary
restraining order or preliminary injunction; in each case the Commission decided the results it sought had been accomplished.
Three
proceedings were dismissed after they had become moot, one before
any action had been taken by the court, one after denial of a temporary
injunction, and the other after the court of appeals had reversed a
district court order refusing injunctive relief."

The three proceedings for declaratory judgments in which the act
was held inapplicable involved companies in reorganization under
the Bankruptcy Act when the Holding Company Act became law.
The district court order holding that the act was unconstitutional 45
was reversed by the court of appeals; the Supreme Court denied
review."
Plaintiffs appealed from the dismissal of one of the injunction
actions against the Commission, and from two of the injunction
actions against other persons in which the Commission intervened
as a party defendant. In each case (two of them decided before and
one after the end of the fiscal year) the court of appeals affirmed the
decision of the district court."
The Commission appeared as amicus curiae or as intervenor in the
listed cases where relief was sought for corporate mismanagement

PART IV
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANK-

RUPTCY ACT
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended in 1938, governs
the reorganization of corporations (other than railroads) in the
Federal courts. The Oommission (at the request or with the approval
of the court) participates in proceedings thereunder to provide
independent expert assistance in the proceedings, and upon submission to it of plans of reorganization to prepare formal advisory
reports on such plans. The Commission has no statutory right of
appeal in any such proceeding, although it may participate in appeals
taken by others.
The Commission does not administer chapter X. It acts in a
purely advisory capacity. It has no authority either to veto or to
require the adoption of a plan of reorganization or to render a decision
on any other issue in the proceeding. The facilities of its technical
staff and its impartial recommendations are placed at the services
of the judge and the security holders, affording them the views of
experts in a highly complex area of corporate law and finance.
THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

During the 5-year period from July 1, 1944, to June 30, 1949, the
Commission participated as a party in the chapter X reorganization
of 188 companies with aggregate stated assets of $2,201,388,000 and
aggregate stated indebtedness of $1,526,599,000. During the 5-year
period the Commission filed notices of appearance in proceedings
involving 56 companies (with aggregate stated assets of $442,538,000
and aggre~ate stated indebtedness of $413,778,000). Eleven of these
participations were at the request of the judge; 35 were upon approval
by the judge of the Commission's motion to participate.
Proceedings involving 93 debtors were terminated during the
5-year period, so that as of June 30, 1949, the Commission was participating in proceedings involving 95 companies with aggregate stated
assets of $1,586,111,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $1,049,915,000.
During the past fiscal year the Oommission participated in proceedings involving the reorganization of 101 companies 1 whose stated
assets were $1,670,445,000 and aggregate indebtedness, $1,163,049,000.2
During the year the Commission filed its notice of appearance in 9
new chapter X proceedings. Three were filed at the request of the
judge. In 6 the judge approved the Commission's motion to participate. These 9 new proceedings involved 13 companies (9 principal
and 4 subsidiary debtors) with aggregate stated assets of $108,390,000
and aggregate stated indebtedness of $99,417,000. Proceedings involving 5 principal debtors were closed during the year.

COMMISSION

Problems Involving the Trusteeship

One of the objectives of chapter X, in amending its predecessor
statute section 77B, was to make adequate provisions for trusteeships.
The law now requires that an independent trustee be appointed where
the corporation is of substantial size.' The trustee is required to be
primarily responsible for the operation of the corporation's business
during the proceeding, to examine and evaluate the reasons for the
debtor's financial difficulties, to appraise the ability and fidelity of its
management and to formulate and file a plan of reorganization.
The
independent trustee was thus made the focal point of the reorganization process and, by reason of his duties, it is obvious that the success
of the reorganization depends largely upon the thoroughness, skill,
and loyalty with which he performs his tasks. A prominent part of
the Commission's work under chapter X has involved its concern with
the functions of the trustee.
The Commission has continued its policy of careful examination
of the qualifications of trustees in the light of the standards of disinterestedness prescribed by the statute for trustees and their counsel.
In several cases, sufficient evidence of conflicting interests was developed to warrant an appearance by the Commission before the court
for the purpose of urging the removal of trustees.
In a pending proceeding the Commission sought the removal of the so-called disinterested trustee upon the grounds, among others, that he was director
and stockholder of a bank which had financial dealings with the debtor
and which acted as indenture trustee for certain issues of the debtor's
securities, that he had permitted an officer of the debtor, associated
with the parent company of the debtor for many years, to assume a
leading role in the preparation of an investigation report by the
trustee as to whether claims existed against the parent company, and
that the trustee in other ways had abdicated his responsibilities to
the management of the debtor and the parent company." The Special
Master to whom the Commission's application was referred concluded
that the trustee should be removed from office. Thereafter the trustee
resigned.
In proceedings involving two debtors 4. the Commission objected
to the final accounts of a trustee who had resigned, and urged that
he be surcharged upon the ground, among others, that he had knowingly
permitted certain of his employees to trade in the securities of the
debtors and their subsidiaries.
The Special Master agreed that trading in these securities was a breach of fiduciary duty and that the
trustee's knowledge and acquiescence rendered him culpable and liable
for surcharge to the extent of the profits. The- district court has
approved the recommendation of the Special Master and an appeal is
pending. In another case," the Commission asked that a former
trustee be surcharged on the ground that he had been negligent and
faithless in that he had obtained services and supplies from the debtor
without payment and that he had authorized unnecessary expenses
and received "kick-backs."
The district court agreed that the evidence showed negligence and a low fiduciary standard but not that
the trustee received "kick-backs."
It held that because of his ineffi• In re Pittsburgh RalllDau, co., W. D. Pa.

cient and negligent management he was not entitled to compensation
for his services ill operating the debtor and that he must be surcharged
for the amount found to have been received by him. However, since
there was no finding of malfeasance, the court permitted him a fec
for that part of his services which had been devoted to the formulation of an acceptable plan of reorganization.
Under chapter X the court may designate as an additional trustee
an officer, director or employee of the debtor for the sole purpose of
assisting in the operation of the business. The Commission has urged
that this should be done only in the exceptional case, since the services of
an executive of the debtor may be obtained by employing such executive.
The Commission has found it increasingly necessary during the
past 5 years to prevent encroachment by the additional trustee upon
the special functions delegated to the independent trustee, such as
the investigation of the affairs of the corporation and corporate causes
of action, the preparation of a report of such investigation, and the
formulation of a plan of reorganization.
Although the responsibilities
of the additional trustee do not assume the proportion of those of the
disinterested trustee, his key position in assuming joint responsibilitywith the independent trustee for operations of the debtor, and his
resultant close association with the independent trustee, make it
essential that he also be free from interests which are materially adverse
to those of the estate or of any class of security holder. Durin~ the
past 5 years the Commission has taken steps to have the additional
trustee resign or be removed because of conflicting or adverse interests,
particularly on the ground of the existence of causes of action on behalf
of the estate against him or against the management.
In these cases
the additional trustee usually tendered his resignation after informal
conferences.
Problems in the Administration of tbe Estate

Frequently during the past 5 years the question has been presented of the adequacy of the independent trustee's investigation of
the debtor's operations and of the reasons for its financial plight.
In several cases, the Commission advocated the retention by the
trustee of an independent expert qualified to appraise the debtor's
property, make valuations, or report upon the efficiency of the debtor's
operations."
In administrative matters, the Commission has attempted to discourage hazardous speculation. In the case of a real estate and mortgage holding corporation having a large, matured debenture issue,
the Commission successfully argued that pending the adoption of a
plan of reorganization the trustees should maintain a high degree of
liquidity; pursue a conservative course with respect to making new
investments, subject to court approval on notice to the parties; and
generally abstain from buying new mortgages which are by their
nature not ordinarily liquid. In another case involving a large
investment company whose major holdings consisted of the common
stocks' of two subsidiary investment companies, the Oornmission
urged that the speculative character of the enterprise be reduced by
the retirement of senior preferred stock and debt by the subsidiaries

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and subsequently by the liquidation and dissolution of one of the
subsidiary companies. The first part of this program was carried
out and the second part is pending before the court.
Another administrative problem is the accumulation by many
debtors of substantial amounts of cash in excess of operational requirements. In these cases the Commission has urged that at least partial
payments be made to creditors on account of their claims against the
estate. In several cases the power of the district court to authorize
such distribution in advance of a plan of reorganization was questioned before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In one
case a stay was denied and the appeal withdrawn 7 and in another
case the order for distribution was affirmed without opinion." Recently the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit handed down a
written opinion, holding that the district court had the power to
direct interim distributions."
One of the important functions of the trustee is to investigate
possible claims against the old management or other persons and to
assure their diligent prosecution. During the past 5 years the
Commission has not only helped trustees in their investigation of
possible causes of action, but has undertaken its own investigation.
Where trustees have neglected this duty or have been less than
thorough, the Commission has asked the court to direct the trustee
in order to get adequate results.
In several cases the investigation made by the Commission, or in
which the Commission assisted, was the basis for compromises and
settlements favorable to the estate and to public bondholders. In
some cases, the settlement was arrived at after suit was commenced.
Such compromises have resulted in either the disallowance or reduction of claims against the estate thereby increasing the participation
of public investors, or in the recovery of funds which would inure to
the benefit of the public investors. Although the Commission has
opposed inadequate offers of compromise, it is generally in favor of
the compromise of disputes as a method of reaching a fair and equitable result.
Responsibilities of Fiduciaries

The Commission is concerned with the qualifications of indenture
trustees, committees, attorneys, and other representatives of security
holders. The Commission has brought several proceedings to disqualify committees whose members were in conflicting positions. In
one case the Commission sought to disqualify members of a committee
upon the ground that, having served as directors of the debtor and
having joined in the submission of the debtor's voluntary plan proposed to bondholders prior to the chapter X proceeding, they had
developed such a close affinity with the debtor and its controlling
persons that they were not in a position to give exclusive loyalty to
bondholders. The district court agreed With this position." In
another case the Commission urged that a committee for bondholders
be disqualified because it had been organized and sponsored by the
controlling interests of the debtor. It was pointed out that the

members of this committee would necessarily be called upon to
review the conduct of the previous management. The court sustained
this view, holding that representatives of security holders must be
free of conflicting interest, must give loyal and disinterested service,
and that a fair conclusion from an the circumstances was that the
committee was primarily formed to represent the management interests and not the public bondholders." The court also agreed that
withdrawal by the management interests from the committee did not
change the situation. The court also sustained the Commission's
position that trading in the debtor's bonds by a committee member
was a basis for disqualification.
A far-reaching decision, in which the Supreme Court sustained the
views of the Commission in the field of fiduciary law, was handed
down in the case of Young v. The Higbee 00.12 In the reorganization
proceedings involving The Higbee Company, two preferred stockholders appealed in their own names from the order of confirmation
of a plan of reorganization, seeking greater participation for preferred
stockholders under the plan. Subsequently the stockholders sold their
stock, for an amount far in excess of its market value, to certain
creditors who were anxious to consummate the plan, and the appeal
was then dismissed. Another preferred stock holder, who had unsuccessfully sought to intervene and prosecute the appeal, filed a petition
seeking to have the selling stockholders account for the excess they
had received over the market value of their stock. The court held
that the selling stockholders owed an obligation to other stockholders
of their class to act in good faith even though they had prosecuted
the appeals in their own names, that since they in effect had settled
an appeal in which all other preferred stockholders were interested,
the fruits of the settlement properly belonged to the entire class.
The court also held that the chapter X court had ample jurisdiction
to require an accounting.
Another aspect of the conduct of fiduciaries which assumed importance during the past 5 years involved the buying or selling of claims
against or stock interests in the debtor. Trading in securities of 8
debtor in reorganization by trustees, directors, attorneys, committee
members, or other fiduciaries is a practice generally condemned by
the courts and the Commission in opinions and reports. The aecess to inside information and, frequently, the influence over the
course of reorganization which may be possessed by these fiduciaries highlight the conflict of interest engendered when a fiduciary
deals in the subject matter of his trust. They are cogent reasons for
strict enforcement of judicial sanctions. One sanction discussed
hereinafter, which the Commission has invoked is the denial of any
fees or reimbursement of expenses. IS
Another sanction is the prevention of profit to fiduciaries by limiting
any claim they might have against the company to the cost of the
claim or by requiring them to account for any profits made in trading
securities of the company. This sanction has been applied, at the
instance of the Commission, to the directors of a corporation in

reorganization under section 77B, where the debtor was continued in
possession."
The court held that directors who, -during their' incumbency,
purchased bonds of the corporation in reorganization should be
limited to cost because of the breach of trust involved. In another
case the Commission sought limitation to cost where an individual
acquired bonds with the aid of an indenture trustee for bondholders
through activities which appeared to constitute a breach of the
latter's fiduciary obligation." The court entered an order limiting
the purchaser to the cost of his bonds. Trading by a committee
member in the securities of the subsidiaries of a debtor corporation was
discountenanced by the Commission in another case and a satisfactory
settlement involving payment of his profits to the company was
approved by the court." The application of the same rule has been
advocated by the Commission in a series of cases during the past five
years where the fiduciary purchased at a discount claims against the
corporation prior to the inception of chapter X proceedings but during
a period when the corporation was insolvent. In the Commission's
view the fundamental basis for the rule, the clash of adverse interests
created by the trading in claims against the debtor, is equally applicable whether the corporation is insolvent and in need of rehabilitation
or is actually undergoing judicial reorganization. The Commission
has urged that the rule be applied to directors and officers of the
insolvent corporation, a managing agent having supervision of its
affairs, members of a bondholders' committee, and near relatives or
business associates of such fiduciaries. Such cases have in several
instances been disposed of by compromise and settlement."
The
matters are pending in other eases," one before the Supreme Court."
Apart from special cases, however, the Commission has taken the
position that security holders are to be treated equally regardless of
when or at what price their securities were purchased. The Commission has successfully opposed an investigation into purchases of
securities at less than par by public security holders." The Commission argued that the reasons for the rule against such purchases by
fiduciaries did not apply to members of the public and pointed out
that, unless trading by the public were unimpeded, securities of
companies in reorganization would become unmarketable-no
one
would purchase securities if the price actually paid would become the
maximum he could recover from the estate.
Activities with Respect to Allowances

A major objective of the Commission in its advisory capacity is to
protect the estate from exorbitant and inequitable charges, and, at
the same time, to seek fair compensation for applicants so as to
encourage legitimate creditor and stockholder participation in the
reorganization process.

The Commission itself receives no allowances from estates in
reorganization and presents a wholly disinterested and impartial view.
The Commission endeavors to obtain a limitation of the aggregate fees paid in anyone case to an amount which the estate can
feasibly or should fairly pay. Fee applications are carefully studied
and recommendations are made to the end that unnecessary duplication of services and nonbeneficial efforts shall not be recompensed
and that applicants shall be regarded on the basis of their relative
contribution to the administration of the estate and the adoption of
a plan of reorganization.
Specific recommendations are made to the
courts in cases in which the Commission has been a party and is
familiar with the services of the various parties and with all significant
developments in the case.
An important question that arose during the past 5 years involved
the extent of the jurisdiction of the chapter X court with respect to
fees. Contending that complete judicial scrutiny over the granting
of all fees in respect of the reorganization was essential to assure the
fairness of the reorganization, to prevent abuses, and to supervise
effectively the activities of representatives of security holders in the
proceeding, the Commission urged that the chapter X court had the
power and duty to pass upon the reasonableness of a fee agreement
between attorneys and a stockholders' committee even though such
fees were to be paid by members of the committee and not directly
out of the estate." In this case the district court held that it had no
jurisdiction to pass on the agreement and an appeal to the court of
appeals was dismissed for lack of prosecution.
The issue again arose
in a suit to enforce the agreement and the Commission participated,
as amicus curiae, in an appeal to the Court of Appeals of the State of
N ew York from the denial of a motion to dismiss the complaint. That
court, upholding the Commission's position, reversed the lower court's
decision 22 and the case was taken to the Supreme Court upon a writ
of certiorari. The Commission again filed a brief as amicus curiae.
The Supreme Court held that it was the aim of chapter X to expand
judicial control over reorganization fees and expenses and that since
the determination of allowances is made an integral part of the process
of confirmation of a plan of reorganization, which is exclusively entrusted to the bankruptcy court, it may not be delegated to a State
court.23
A subject that has been of considerable significance during the past
proceedings is the mat5 years in the field of allowances in chapter
ter of freedom from conflicting interest as a prerequisite for receiving
an allowance. The Commission has contended that fees be granted
only for disinterested services rendered to the estate or security holders. In a number of cases during the past 5 years the Commission
successfully opposed the allowance of fees to persons who represented
interests adverse to those of the estate or the security holders, either
as a prospective purchaser of the debtor's property, as prospective
underwriter of its securities, as landlord, or as tenant." In these cases

the Commission argued that, despite the fact that the services of applicants may have incidentally benefited the estate or contributed to
a plan of reorganization, they were rendered for the purpose of advancing special interests of their clients which were distinct and
different from that of the estate or other security holders. Under
these circumstances, the Commission was of the view that they should
look to their clients and not to the estate for their compensation.
The denial of allowances as a prophylactic measure to the end that
fiduciaries and representatives of security holders maintain appropriate
standards of conduct has been mentioned above. Specific applications
of this doctrine have continued to occupy the Commission's attention
during the past 5 years. The Commission has opposed the granting
of fees to applicants in various cases where as fiduciaries they occupied
conflicting positions. For example, the Commission successfully opposed an allowance where an indenture trustee acted as such at the
instance of a bondholders' committee."
In an analogous situation,
the Commission successfully objected to any allowance to the former
president of a debtor for services he had rendered as additional trustee
because investigation disclosed that he had participated in various
acts of mismanagement while acting as president, causing loss to the
corporation."
In another case, the Commission objected to any allowance to an
attorney for stockholders on the ground that he had disclosed private
information regarding the reorganization proceeding to his brotherin-law on the basis of which his brother-in-law had purchased stock
of the debtor. The Commission also pointed out that the attorney
had proposed a plan of reorganization under which his mother-in-law
would participate in and profit from the financing of a new common
stock issue. On appeal from a denial of a fee by the district court Zl
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that although the
disclosure by the attorney to his brother-in-law was a breach of trust,
it was an error to deny any compensation to the attorney as a matter
of law, but rather that it was within the discretion of the court as to
how much the fee earned by the attorney should be reduced because
of this breach."
The Court of Appeals indicated that the attorney
had a personal interest, as distinguished from a financial interest, in
the underwriting participation of his mother-in-law and that this
interest was not sufficient to bar him from compensation in view of
the disclosure made to the court of the relationship.
The application of section 249, and the equitable principle which it
codifies-the denial of compensation to an attorney or other representative of security holders who has traded in securities of the
debtor-has
been a recurrent problem in chapter X cases during the
past 5 years. In several cases, the Commission took the position
that purchases of sales of securities by near relatives of a fiduciary
come within the application of the rule. In two cases the Commission's contention was upheld," in two cases it was not,30 and others

are pending. In another case the Commission successfully opposed
an applicant's narrow interpretation of section 249 which would have
made its provisions inapplicable to attorneys who represent individual
creditors or stockholders as distinguished from committees or indenture trustees." The Commission has also been upheld in its
contention that trading in the securities of the subsidiary of a debtor
came within the scope of the statutory prohibition, particularly where
the subsidiary had claims against the parent and other adverse interests existed.32 Section 249 has also been held applicable to another
situation where the interest was an indirect one."
INSTITUTION OF CHAPTER X PROCEEDINGS AND JURISDICTION
OF THE COURT

The Commission has participated in various cases during the past
5 years, as a party or as amicus curiae, in order to establish the
jurisdiction of the chapter X courts over the entire reorganization
process to the complete extent intended by the statute.
In one group of cases, the Commission took steps to assure that the
investor safeguards of chapter X were not evaded and nullified by the
improper resort of a corporation to chapter XI.34 In accordance with
the decision of the Supreme Court in Securities and Exchange Oommission v. U. S. Realty and Improvement 00., 310 U. S. 434 (1940),
the Commission sought the dismissal of chapter XI proceedings
because the corporation had a substantial class of public security
holders. It was the Commission's position that the provisions of
chapter XI, intended for the relatively small company, do not contain
the safeguards necessary to protect large classes of public investors
in the consummation of a fair, equitable, and feasible plan of reorganization. In one of these cases," the resort to chapter XI was apparently an attempt to raise money through the sale of stock without
registration under the Securities Act under the exemption afforded
by chapter XI in connection with a plan of arrangement.
During the past 5 years, the Commission participated in a group
of cases involving the question of "good faith" in the filing of a
petition as a prerequisite to approval of the petition by the court.
The Commission's view in some of these cases was that the pendency
of a prior state court proceeding was not a bar to a chapter X proceeding since the prior proceeding did not contain safeguards for
investors comparable with those in chapter X. However, the courts
felt in these cases that the prior state court proceedings would serve
the interests of security holders sufficiently." In another case, the
Commission supported the district court's approval of the petition
against objection to the jurisdiction of the court on the ground that
the debtor was a nonprofit corporation which had been dissolved
under State law. The Commission argued that .the business enterprise conducted by the state court receiver was an "unincorporated
association" under the Bankruptcy Act and entitled to the benefits

COMMISSION

of the reorganization statute, but the Court of Appeals concluded
that there was no corporate entity and reversed the lower court's
ruling."
The legal sufficiency of the petition for reorganization arose
in other cases. In one," the Commission urged that the petition
showed a need for reorganization to avoid sacri fiee of values through
a forced sale, that chapter X contained appropriatejsafeguards
and
flexibility to protect investors, and that a plan could involve either
a sale of property at a fair upset price and a distribution of the proceeds or the issuance of new securities in a reorganized corporation
which would acquire the assets of the debtor. The Court of Appeals
affirmed this position. In another case," the Commission successfully argued in opposition to a motion to dismiss the petition, maintaining that secured creditors were proper parties to file a petition
for reorganization and that the petition alleged sufficient facts to
show preferential payments as an "act of bankruptcy."
On the
other hand, where the evidence failed to show sufficient facts to spell
out "insolvency" or "acts of bankruptcy," the Commission successfully urged dismissal of the petition."
During the past 5 years, two important aspects of the jurisdiction
of the chapter X court were settled in cases in which the Commission
actively participated-cases
involving claims both on behalf of the
estate and against the estate. In a case involving a suit for $39,000,000 by chapter X trustees against directors, officers, and the controlling
stockholder of the debtor, the Commission appeared as amicus curiae
and supported the trustees' contention that the chapter X court had
jurisdiction regardless of diversity of citizenship.
The Commission
urged that Congress had purposely modified the Bankruptcy Act to
afford the reorganization trustee a wider choice of forum than the
bankruptcy trustee, having in mind the typical suit involving diversion of assets and related misconduct ~
 insiders in large corporations
which have a national public interest.
The Supreme Court upheld
this broad interpretation
of the statute.
In another chapter X
proceeding in which the Commission actively participated, the summary jurisdiction of the chapter X court to determine the ownership
of securities in or claims against the debtor and to enjoin interference
with the exercise of this jurisdiction was sustained."
The Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit also sustained the position of the Commission that the district court had the power to restrain the transfer
of claims against the estate in order to preserve its jurisdiction over
the claims and to protect the estate against the loss of asserted equitable defenses.
A similar question of the jurisdiction of the chapter X court arose
in a case where the court had approved and allowed the settlement of
claims against the debtor by its subsidiary.v Certain stockholders
of the subidiary brought suit against the subsidiary in another court

issued an order restraining the stockholders' suit and requiring the
stockholders to submit the issues raised in the reorganization proceeding. The Commission supported the motion on the ground that
the chapter X court had exclusive jurisdiction over the allowance of
claims against the estate and that the stockholders were in effect
interfering with the reorganization proceeding. After hearing the
objections to the settlement, the court overruled them.
The extent of the chapter X court's jurisdiction over reorganization
matters was broadly defined in another decision during the past 5
years. In the proceedings involving Pittsburgh Railways Co., the
Commission actively supported a petition to have the court assert
jurisdiction for purposes of reorganization over various subsidiary
companies and associated companies, which were not nominally
before the court, in order to effectuate a complete reorganization of
the Pittsburgh transit system. The Commission, calling attention
to the urgent necessity of a system-wide reorganization, argued that
the separate corporate entities of the so-called underlier companies
should be disregarded to achieve a workable plan under the facts of
this case where the enterprise had always been conducted as a unit,
operations Were unified, and the affairs of the companies inextricably
intermingled. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit sustained
this position and reversed the district court which had denied the

petition.t'

PLANS OF REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER X

The ultimate objective of the reorganization is the formulation and
consummation of a fair and feasible plan of reorganization. Accordingly, the most important function of the Commission under chapter
X is to aid the courts in achieving this objective.
Fairness

Underlying the Commission's approach to the problems of fairness
or reorganization plans under chapter X is the cardinal principle that
full recognition must be accorded to claims in the order of their legal
and contractual priority, either in cash or new securities, and that
junior claimants may participate only to the extent that the debtor's
properties have value after the satisfaction of prior claims or to the
extent that they make a fresh contribution necessary to the reorganization of the debtor. A valuation of the debtor's assets is essential
to provide a basis for judging the fairness as well as the feasibility of
proposed plans of reorganization. The Commission has continued
to recommend that the proper method of valuation for reorganization
purposes is primarily an appropriate capitalization of reasonably
prospective earnings. These principles as to the recognition of priorities and as to valuation, laid down iIf a series of Supreme Court decisions, are firmly established. Nevertheless, the Commission has
been called on during the past 5 years to reiterate the arguments
originally' advanced in support of these principles. For example, in
the reorganization proceedings involving the Chicago transit system,
junior security holders relied upon a rate base valuation of the properties, upon a price fixed by a formula in the original franchises of the

debtors in 1907, upon book values, and upon a hypothetical condemnation figure, in an attempt to reach a substantially higher figure than
a proposed purchase price for the properties and the valuation estimated by the Commission. Replying to these contentions, the Commission indicated in its advisory report that reorganization values are
dependent upon probable future earnings and that, on the basis of the
record and the applicable rules of priority, the junior security holders
should be denied any participation.
The plan was amended accordingly and approved by the district court and affirmed by the Court
of Appeals."
In connection with the fairness of plans and the treatment of claims
against the estate, the Commission has been concerned with situations
where mismanagement or other misconduct on the part of a parent
company or a controlling person required that the claim of such person
be subordinated to the claims of the public investors or that participation be limited to cost. Such matters must be given full consideration
since they form an integral part of the concept of the "fair and
equitable" plan.
The increasing prosperity of business during the past 5 years has
enabled various debtor corporations to solve their financial problems
and in many cases has shaped the course of the reorganization.
In a
number of cases, it was felt that a sale of the assets of the debtor would
be more beneficial for security holders than a plan involving the exchange of new securities for old securities. The legal basis forlPlans
involving sales has been affirmed in various cases in which the Commission was an active participant in supporting the power of the chapter X court."
The relative prosperity of debtor corporations was also reflected
during the past five years in an increasing number of cases dealing

mission successfully urged the general equitable rule that, where full
payment is ultimately made, prior partial payments are to be applied
first to accrued interest and then to principal.
Following its policy
of according to senior creditors all their contractual rights before
participation by junior creditors, the Commission supported the claim
of first mortgage bondholders to interest on overdue interest as
provided for under the terms of the mortgage indenture in the proceedings involving Inland Gas Corp. The Supreme Court, however,
in Vanston Bondholders Protective Committee v. Green, 329 U. S. 156
(1946), adopting an approach to the problem which had not been
argued by any of the parties, held that it would be inequitable to
permit the payment of interest on interest under the circumstances
of the case." The Court held that the failure to make interest

statement:
"The validity. as a matter of public polley, of a covenant for Interest on Interest, as applied to Interest
accruing since the date of a Federal equity receivership or bankruptcy proceedings, might conceivably
be regarded as a proper subject for Independent decision by the Federal court. even In the absence of direct
legislation. The consequence of such a holding would be to alford greater uniformity and certainty In
dealing with a problem which appears to be arismg with Increasing frequency In reorganlsanon proceedings
and occasionally In the Stale courts. We recognize, however. that there Is no precedent for such a rule.
The closest analogy would appear to be those cases holding that the equitable status of certain claims fa a
matter of bankruptcy law."

payments promptly was the result of judicial action and bondholders
should not receive added compensation by way of penalty.
The Commission was not successful in another case involving the
payment of interest to creditors. The Commission urged in that
case that the aggregate claim of principal and interest which had
accrued prior to the commencement of the proceeding should be
treated as though it were a judgment against the estate. Such a
judgment would carry interest on the over-all amount up to the
date of payment and would include interest on the interest which had
accrued prior to the date of the proceeding. The Commission argued
that the filing of the petition for reorganization restrained creditors
from pursuing their usual remedy by way of judgment and execution,
but this stay should not be utilized to affect the substantive rights
which would normally follow when creditors obtain a judgment.
The district court sustained the Commission's view but the court of
appeals reversed, holding that interest was not payable on that portion of the claim which represented unpaid interest accrued prior to
the date of the chapter X petition, citing the Vanston case.48 Another
issue in that case was settled by the court's holding that interest on
the principal amount of the claim continued to accrue, after the
institution of chapter X proceedings, at the contract rather than the
legal or "judgment" rate where the covenant was to pay interest
until the principal "shall be duly paid."
In two subsequent cases the Commission was sustained in its
position regarding interest. In Empire Trust Co. v. Equitable Office
Building Oorp., a debenture provision for the payment of interest at
5 percent "until such principal shall be paid" was likewise construed
as fixing the postmaturity rate applicable during the pendency of the
reorganization proceeding and as negativing the 6 percent legal rate
which might otherwise have been applicable."
In Delatour v.
Prudence Realization Oorp., where guaranteed certificates of participation in a 6 percent mortgage issued by the debtor provided for the
remission of only 5~ percent interest to the public certificate holders
by the guarantor servicing-agent, the public certificate holders were
nevertheless allowed the 6 percent mortgage interest to the exclusion
of the guarantor following default on the guaranty.ro The court
held that the one-half percent interest represented compensation due
the guarantor for its guaranty and for servicing the mortgage, both
of which terminated upon default.
Feasibility

That reorganizations are often attributable to a lack of feasibility
in prior reorganizations is attested by the fact that numerous chapter
X proceedings involve companies which had previously been "reorganized" in equity receivership cases or under section 77B. In order to
avoid a similar record as to chapter X cases, with its attendant expense
and injury to investors, the Commission gives a great deal of attention
to the economic soundness and feasibility of plans. In this connection
the Cominission is particularly concerned with the adequacy of working capital: the relationship of funded debt and the capital structure

as a whole to property values; the adequacy of corporate earning power
in relation to interest and dividend requirements; the necessity for
capital expenditures; and the effect of the new capitalization upon the
company's prospective credit. During the past 5 years the Commission has continued to encounter opposition on the part of representatives of security holders who are reluctant to scale down debt because
they desire to retain tax deductions based on interest payments.
These parties are disposed to base values and capital structures upon
inflated earnings because they either overlook the extent to which
earnings are inflated or hope they will continue long enough to permit
debt to be reduced to manageable proportions. In most cases, even
where the Commission's view of a feasible debt issue has not been
accepted, the debt adopted under the plan of reorganization was
reduced to a much greater extent than desired originally by the parties.
Modification of Plan

The Equitable Office Building case presented the problem of amending a plan after it had been approved and confirmed by the court and
was about to be consummated by the transfer of assets to a new
reorganized company and by the distribution of new securities. Two
common stockholders, dissatisfied with the small amount of new common stock allotted to them under the plan, presented a financing
proposal under which stockholders would receive rights to buy the
stock of the new company, an underwriter would buy an unsubscribed
shares, and the proceeds would be used to pay debenture holders in
full. The marked improvement in the real estate market made this
proposal possible. Debenture holders opposed this proposal since the
market price of debentures had risen far above the amount due on the
debentures, reflecting the market's appraisal of the increase in values.
The Commission supported the stockholders' petition to amend the
plan on the ground that debenture holders had no vested rights under
the plan prior to consummation of the plan and that stockholders
should be permitted to salvage whatever equity existed. The court
of appeals sustained the petition of the stockholders, holding that
even after confirmation debenture holders had no legally protected
interest beyond principal and interest due them. 51
Consummation

of Plan

Frequently, the plan of reorganization contains provisions relating
to the terms to be incorporated in corporate charters, bylaws, trust
indentures, and other instruments which are to govern the internal
structure of the reorganized debtor. In other cases these details are
left for the approval of the court upon consummation of the plan. In
both cases, the Commission pays careful attention to these matters
and endeavors to obtain the inclusion of protective features and safeguards for investors. Among numerous other matters, the Commission has urged and generally favored provisions for cumulative voting
for directors, pre-emptive rights for stockholders, provisions making
lists of stockholders available for inspection, the ratification by stockholders of the selection of auditors, and, in certain instances, a limitation upon compensation for management.
The USe of the voting
trust as a control device has been suggested in various cases in which
the Commission participated.

unusual circumstances of the case, the Commission has opposed the
voting trust because it disenfranchises stockholders who are entitled
to a voice in the management of the enterprise. In those cases where
the Commission has agreed that a voting trust was necessary in the
interests of security holders, or where the voting trust was adopted
over the Commission's objection, the Commission has sought to have
the voting trust agreement contain appropriate safeguards in the
interests of investors.
ADVISORY REPORTS

The preparation of advisory reports pursuant to section 172 of
chapter X represents only a small part of the activities of the Commission in chapter X proceedings. Nevertheless, because of their
wide distribution and because they are usually filed in the larger cases,
which have a greater public interest, the advisory reports occupy a
prominent position in the reorganization field. They are a principal
means of contact between the Commission and the public in chapter
X matters. Generally speaking, an advisory report is prepared only
in connection with a proceeding involving a large public interest and
in which significant problems exist. The Commission has not filed
formal advisory reports in the bulk of the cases in which it has participated, but in all these cases it has advised the court in detail, orally
or by memorandum, of its views with respect to the various plans of
reorganization proposed in the proceeding.
During the past 5 years the Commission has filed eight advisory and
six supplemental reports. During the 1949 fiscal year, the Commission prepared three advisory reports, in the proceedings involving
Inland Gas Corp. and American Fuel & Power Co., Aireon Manufacturing Corp., and International Railway Co.

PARTjV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE 1;RUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
The term Utrust indenture" when applied to corporate debt securities refers to an instrument underlying the securities in which covenants of the issuer for the protection of the security holder are set
forth. A" trustee," usually a large bank, is commonly designated to
perform certain acts on behalf of the security holders. Before passage
of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 the usual provisions in indentures
exculpating trustees so fully exonerated them from any responsibilities
to perform their duties that one court said that the term" trustee" is
a "misnomer" (Haggard v. Chase National Bank, 287 N. Y. S. 541, 570)
and the Oommission, in part VI of its Protective Oommittee Study
(1936)-relating
to corporate trustees--stated
that the uso-called
trustee" was "merely a clerical agency." The act operates by requiring the inclusion in indentures to be qualified of specified provisions
which provide means by which the rights of holders of securities
issued under such indentures may be protected and enforced. These
provisions relate primarily to the corporate trustee who must not
possess conflicting interests; must not after default, or within 4 months
prior thereto, improve his position as a creditor to the detriment of the
indenture securities; must make annual and periodic reports to bondholders; must maintain bondholders lists to provide a method of communication between bondholders as to their rights under the indenture
and the bonds; and must be authorized to file suits and proofs of
claims on behalf of the bondholders. The act outlaws exculpatory
clauses used in the past to eliminate the liability of the indenture
trustee to his indenture security holders and imposes on the trustee,
after default, the duty to exercise the rights and powers vested in it,
and to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a
prudent man would use in the conduct of his own affairs. Specified
evidence must be supplied by the obligor to the indenture trustee with
respect to the recording of the indenture and with respect to conditions
precedent to action to be taken by the trustee at the request of the
obligor.
The provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture
Act are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933 of securities to be issued under a trust indenture is not permitted to become effectrve unless the indenture conforms to the requirements expressed in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and such an
indenture is automatically "qualified" when registration becomes
effective as to the securities themselves.' An application for qualification of an indenture covering securities not required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which is filed with the Commission under the Trust Indenture Act, is processed substantially as
though such application were a registration statement filed pursuant
to the Securities Act of 1933.
The exemption provtslons of the act Incorporate most of the aremptlons contained in the Securities Act
1933and include several additional exemptions.

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

The significance of the act in defining rights under indentures is
illustrated in The Continental Bank &: Trust Co. of New York v. The
First National Petroleum Trust,! decided in 1946. The case involved
an interpretation of an indenture qualified under the Trust Indenture
Act. The indenture trustee sought to recover certain items of
overdue interest upon debentures. Intervenors, representing a
majority in amount of outstanding debentures, directed the trustee
not to bring any proceedings for a stated period and to waive the
default. A motion of the Commission for leave to appear, file a
brief and present oral arguments, as amicus curiae, was granted.
The court decided that an interpretation of the indenture qualified
under the act necessarily involves an interpretation of the act. With
respect to the attempt of the holders of a majority of outstanding
debentures to postpone and waive default in the interest payment,
the opinion stated that such action was contrary to the mandatory
provisions of section 316 (b) of the act which expressly prohibits
impairment of the right of a debenture holder to receive payment of
interest except where, under section 316 (a) (2), holders of not less
than 75 percent in principal amount of outstanding debentures consent to postponement for not more than 3 years.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
ACT OF 1940

COMPANY

The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires registration of and
regulates investment companies-companies
engaged primarily in
the business of investing, reinvesting, and trading in securities.
Among other things, the act requires disclosure of the finances and
investment policies of these companies in order to afford investors
full and complete information with respect to their activities; prohibits such companies from changing the nature of their business or
their investment policies without the approval of the stockholders;
bars persons guilty of security frauds from serving as officers and
directors of such companies; regulates the means of custody of the
assets of investment companies and requires the bonding of officers
and directors having access to such assets; prevents underwriters,
investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies; requires management contracts
in the first instance to be submitted to security holders for their
approval; prohibits transactions between such companies and their
officers and directors except on the approval of the Commission;
forbids the issuance of senior securities of such companies except
in specified instances; and prohibits pyramiding of such companies and
cross-ownership of their securities.
The Commission is authorized
to prepare advisory reports upon plans of reorganizations of registered
investment companies upon request of such companies or 25 percent
of their stockholders and to mstitute proceedings to enjoin such
plans if they are grossly unfair. The act also requires face amount
certificate compsmes to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity
payments upon their certificates.
REGISTRATION

UNDER TIlE ACT

During the past 5 years, 69 new investment companies have been
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940-predominantly open-end management companies (companies which redeem
their shares on presentation by the stockholders).
During the same
5-year period about 185 registered management open-end and management closed-end investment companies reported to the Commission
sales to the public of approximately $1,500,000,000 of their securities,
and redemptions and retirements of approximately $800,000,000,
leaving a net investment in such compames over the period by the
public of approximately $700,000,000. As of June 30, 1949, 358
investment companies were registered under the act. They have
total assets of approximately
$3,700,000,000. These companies

Types and Investment Policies of Companies Fonned

As indicated above most of the investment companies formed during
the last 5-year period have been of the open-end type, investing
primarily in common stocks although there was some tendency to
adopt a "balanced" investment policy, a policy which would require
the investment portfolios of the companies to include a specified
minimum of cash, bonds, or preferred stocks. In other cases, new investment companies have adopted so-called formula timing plans
whereby common stocks would be bought or sold at predetermined
levels of stock market averages. Another company, in a variation
from usual investment policies, has stipulated that normally at least
50 percent of its assets would be invested in so-called small companies, defined as companies -each with net worth of less than $15,000,000. One company has adopted a policy of limiting its investments as much as possible to securities of companies doing business
in the investment company's State of incorporation.
One of the closed-end management companies formed during the
last 5 fiscal years is American Research & Development Corp.
Formed in 1946, the company announced and has carried forward a
policy of supplying venture capital to industry. Its management
includes professors at the Harvard School of Business Administration
as well as staff members of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. At its inception the company desired to raise capital primarily from insurance companies and other investment companies.
Although it was not contemplated that anyone investment company
would mvest more than 5 percent of its assets in the new company,
it was desired to permit individual investment companies to acquire
more than 5 percent of the voting securities of the new company.
This proposal ran counter to the antipyramiding provisions of the act.
The new company applied to the Commission for an order excepting
the new company from this prohibition of the act. Because of the
nature of the new company's proposed investment policies and the
fact that no one investment company would be in a position to exercise
control over the new company, the Commission granted the application.'
On its initial offering of securities American Research & Development Corp. raised approximately $3,000,000, of which 10 percent was

FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

contributed by insurance companies and 20 percent by investment
companies. These capital funds were invested in a wide variety of
new enterprises in various developmental stages, including a company
engaged in the manufacture of atomic radiation detecting devices,
and radioactive isotopes; a company engaged in catching, deveining
and freezing shrimp and other shell fish; a company engaged in tuna
fishing and canning in the south seas; and companies engaged in
developing new inventions, such as house heating devices based on
the principle of jet combustion.
During the last fiscal year a second offering of the new company's
securities was made to the general public in an amount which, if all
sold, would realize to the company an additional $4,000,000 of capital
for investment in new enterprises.
Selling Literature

The act requires literature (other than the statutory prospectus)
used in selling open-end investment company shares to be filed with
the Commission within 10 days after such literature is first employed
as selling material. During the last 5 years increasing use was made
in such literature of charts and schedules purporting to depict the
performance records of open-end companies. Many of these depictions appeared to be misleading and inaccurate in material aspects.
Accordingly, during the 1949 fiscal year the Commission, in a public
release, commented upon aspects in which it deemed these charts and
schedules to be misleading. As a result of this release, representatives of the Commission's staff and of the National Association of
Securities Dealers and the National Association of Investment Companies held a series of conferences in which a more uniform and
accurate method of portraying the performance of investment companies was evolved to serve as a guide to the industry in general. In
an attempt to remove misleading comparisons from selling literature
conferences are now in progress in respect of charts and graphs purporting to compare the performance of investment companies with
that of well-known stock market averages.

APPLICATIONS FILED

Another function of the Commission in administering the act is to
pass on applications by investment companies for exemptions from
its provisions. The act permits exemption under appropriate standards. An example of the type of relief sought is the case of American
Research and Development Corporation which has already been
described.
On May 23, 1947, the Commission adopted rule N-5, which provides, in all but a limited number of cases, for a simplified procedure
designed to expedite the disposition of uncontested proceedings
initiated by application or upon the Commission's own motion
pursuant to any section of the act or any rwe or regulation thereunder.
The rule makes provision for the publication in the Federal Register
of the initiation of such proceedings and affords ample opportunity
for any interested person to request a hearing.
The most numerous of the applications filed arise out of the provisions of the statute which forbid, in the absence of approval by the
Commission, purchases or sales of property or securities among investment companies and their affiliated persons. To approve such
transactions the Commission must find that they are fair as to price
and involve no overreaching. As a result the applications involve
unusual questions of valuation and inside influence. For example,
an investment company filed an application to sell a controlling block
of stock in a bank to an affiliated person. After consideration of a
record containing complex financial statistics in respect of, among
other things, the earning power and nature of the assets of the bank,
its competitive standing among banks in the same locality, the nature
of its loans and other transactions, and the market value of its stock
compared to that of other banks, the Commission concluded that the
company had not sustained the burden of proof that the price was
fair and therefore denied the application. Subsequently, a new
application was filed fixing a higher price for the securities and this
application was granted.
Data of the nature and disposition of various applications filed
under the act during the 1945-49 fiscal years follow:

CHANGES IN RULES

The act, in numerous instances, authorizes the Commission, within
standards set by Congress, to prescribe rules and regulations to insure
the protection of security holders of investment companies. Important
instances of such exercise of the Commission's rule-making power over
these companies during the past 5 years have been in connection with
the custody of their portfolio assets, the bonding of their employees
having access to such assets, and pension and profit-sharing plans.
The act permits investment companies to maintain their assets in
the custody of a bank or in their own custody. In the latter case the
Commission may by rule prescribe the conditions of such custody.
The act, however, does not define "custody of a bank" as against
custody of its assets by the company itself. Accordingly, the Commission during the last 5 years has amended its custody rule to
define "custody of a bank" as custody subject to the investment
company's direction but without power in the company's officers or
employees to withdraw such assets on their mere receipt given to the
bank.
A new rule promulgated by the Commission during the last 5 years
requires the bonding of officers and employees of investment companies
who have access to their assets or the general power to direct the disposition of such assets. The rule leaves to the best judgment of the
management of the investment company the amount and conditions
of the bond. However, the bond is required to be filed with the

156

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Commission, and the Commission, after hearing, can direct an increase
in the amount of the bond or prescribe other conditions for the protection of investors. An analysis by the Commission of the bonds
filed will enable the Commission to determine standards for bonding
in the light of the total assets of the companies and other factors.
Rule N-17D-l-Bonus,

Profit-sharing, and Pension Plans

On February 6, 1946, the Commission adopted a new rule regarding
bonus, profit-sharing and pension plans provided by registered investment companies and their controlled companies for their directors,
officers, and other affiliated persons. The rule provides that prior to
the submission of any such plan to security holders for approval, or if
not so submitted prior to the adoption thereof, an application regarding the plan shall be filed with the Commission, which has 10 days to
scrutinize the plan and determine whether or not a hearing should be
held thereon. The purpose of the rule is to protect registered investment companies and their controlled companies and the security
holders of such companies against contribution to such plans on an
unfair and inequitable basis. The rule provides that~the Commission
will, in passing upon such applications, be guided by the standards
contained in the various pertinent sections of the act.
The type of situation which rule N-17D-l was designed to meet is
illustrated by the following case: The management of a group of
closely affiliated investment companies proposed that each investment company in the group adopt an "employees incentive profitsharing plan and trust."
The proposed profit-sharing plan provided
that each investment company should contribute the lesser of (a)
15 percent of the available profits of the investment company or (b)
an amount which represented three times the contributions made by
officers or employees. This latter amount was to be cumulative,
provided that in anyone year the investment company should not
contribute more than 15 percent of its available profits. The employee
contribution was fixed at an amount each employee might elect, but
to constitute not less than 2 percent nor more than 5 percent of the
salary received by such employee during the year in which the contribution is made. The proposed plan made no provision for the
payment of dividend arrearages by the companies before they could
make their contributions to the plan, although at least one of the
investment companies involved had dividend arrearages outstanding
on its preferred stock. The plan also permitted officers and employees
to include unrealized gains on securities as company "profits" for the
purpose of calculating each company's contribution to the plan.
After consideration of the provisions of rule N-17D-l, the management determined not to submit the proposed profit-sharing plan to
the Commission under the rule. The plan was thereafter abandoned.
Rule N-28B-I-Insured

Real Estate Loans

On June 7, 1946, the Commission adopted rule N-28B-l, which
authorizes real estate loans partially or wholly guaranteed under the
Servicemen's Readjustment Act (the so-called GI bill) as qualified
investments for face amount certificate companies. Such companies
are authorized to invest only in investments of a kind in which life
insurance companies are permitted to invest in under the provisions

157

FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT

of the Code of the District of Columbia and in such other investments
as the Commission may authorize as qualified investments.
At the
time of the adoption of this rule insurance companies were not authorized by the Code of the District of Columbia to invest in loans guaranteed under the GI bill but were so authorized by the GI bill itself.
The effect of the new rule was to extend a similar authorization to face
amount certificate companies.
LITIGATION

UNDER THE INVESTMENT

COMPANY Acr

There has been little need to resort to the courts for enforcement
of the provisions of the act. During the last five fiscal years the
Commission began injunctive action to restrain violations of the act
in three cases. In two of these, S. E. O. v, Otis, et all! and S. E. O.
v. First Investment 00. oj Ooncord, N. H.,3 the courts, acting under
section 36 of the act, enjoined officers and directors of registered
investment companies from further serving in such capacities on the
grounds that they had been guilty of gross misconduct and gross
abuse of trust in connection with their management of the companies
involved. In the Otis case, involving British Type Investors, Inc.,
the Commission agreed to dismiss its complaint after the defendants
agreed to a reorganization of the company and to make restitution of
benefits acquired by them aggregating over $1,000,000 in value. In
the case against First Investment Co. of Concord, N. H., a liquidating
agent was appointed to wind up the affairs of the company.
In the
third case, S. E. O. v. Aldred Investment Trust." the Commission sought
and obtained the appointment of receivers to safeguard the interests
of investors.
In the Aldred case, Gordon B. Hanlon, for less than $20,000, acquired
a majority of Aldred's common stock. The stock itself had no asset
value but gave Hanlon control of approximately $2,500,000 in assets.
Aldred had a funded debt of $5,900,000 and had been insolvent since
1937. Absent a default in interest, the shareholders could not terminate the trust until the year 2002. Earnings were insufficient to meet
the trust's interest requirements.
To prevent default in interest
and possible termination of the trust, a large proportion of interest
was paid out of capital. Various plans of reorganization proposed
by Hanlon, giving him ownership of equity securities, were never
effectuated because the Commission considered them to be unfair to
the debenture holders. Thereafter, without adequately informing
the trust's security holders, Hanlon radically changed Aldred's
investment policy by selling approximately one-third of the trust's
choicest securities in order to obtain funds with which to acquire
majority control of Suffolk Downs race track. .After an extended
trial the district court entered a judgment permanently enjoining
Hanlon and certain other defendants from serving as officers and
trustees of Aldred. The judgment also provided for the appointment
of receivers with power either to reorganize or liquidate the trust in
the interest of investors. The decision of the district court was
approved by the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

and an application for a writ of certiorari was denied by the United
States Supreme Court.
In S. E. C. v. First Investment Company of Concord, New Hampshire,
the Commission sought an injunction to restrain Charles L. Jackman
from serving or acting in the capacity of officer, director, member of
the advisory board or investment adviser of the company or of any
other registered investment company and to enjoin all defendants
permanently from violating section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and rule X-lOB-5 thereunder.
The complaint alleged
that Jackman, while serving as president and director of the company,
has been guilty of gross misconduct and gross abuse of trust within the
meaning of section 36 of the act. It was further alleged that Jackman
operated and managed the company for his own benefit to the detriment of investors and had caused First Investment's stockholders to
sell their securities to his nominee by false and misleading information
regarding the company's financial condition.
The purchases were
made at from $6 to $6.75 per share, without disclosure that the stock
had an asset coverage of from $18 to $20 per share. In addition, the
company did not file with the Commission or submit to its stockholders
any of the financial reports required by the Investment Company Act.
It was further alleged that Jackman caused the company to engage in
numerous financial transactions with corporations controlled by him in
violation of various sections of the Investment Company Act. Defendants consented to an injunction under the terms of which Jackman
was permanently prohibited from serving the company or any other
registered investment company in any capacity and defendants were
permanently restrained from engaging in any acts or practices in violation of section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act and rille X-IOB-5
in the manner described in the complaint. Jackman also agreed to
make restitution.
In S. E. C. v. Otis, et 01., the Commission alleged that the officers
and directors of British Type Investors, Inc., through control of the
company's class B stock (which had no asset value but carried all
voting rights), engaged in a series of transactions to dilute the asset
value of the class A stock for their own benefit. Class A stockholders
had no voice in the management of the company, although they had
the only equity position. It was also alleged that Automatic Products,
Inc., an investment company controlled by British, had failed to
register as an investment company in violation of the act. After the
Commission filed its complaint, defendants agreed to make restitution
and to a reorganization of British to give its class A stockholders the
right to elect five of its seven directors, and Automatic filed notification of registration.
The action was then dismissed on stipulation,

PART VII
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS
ACT OF 1940

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
investment advisers, persons engaged for compensation in the business
of advising others with respect to securities.
The Commission is
empowered to deny registration to or revoke registration of such
advisers if they have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct
in connection with security transactions or have made false statements
in their applications for registration.
The act also makes it unlawful
for investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud
or deceit; requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of their
interest in transactions executed for their clients; prohibits profitsharing arrangements; and, in effect, prevents assignment of investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

Approximately 230 registered investment advisers represent in their
applications that they engage exclusively in supervising their clients'
investments on the basis of the individual needs of each client. The
services of about 226 others are chiefly through publicatiors of various
types. 234 investment advisers are registered also 8S broker", and dealers in securities. Most of the remainder offer various combinations of
investment services.
Administrative Proceedings

One proceeding was instituted during the 1949 fiscal year to revoke
or deny registration under the act. This action was based on a decree
entered on December 23, 1948, by the Supreme Court of the State of
New York for New York County enjoining Frederic N. Goldsmith,
doing business as F. N. Goldsmith Financial Service, from acting as an
investment adviser, broker, or dealer in that State. The Commission,
which was conducting an investigation of Goldsmith at the time the
action was brought in the State court, thereafter instituted proceedings
to determine whether Goldsmith's registration should be revoked or
suspended.
The case in N ew York evoked considerable newspaper
publicity, in which it was reported that Goldsmith's weekly financial
letter for stock trading involved coded advice picked up from comic
862940--50----12

159

160

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

strips and humor columns and that Goldsmith had said that he had
learned about the code at a seance from the spirit of a one-time market
speculator. The case was pending at the end of the fiscal year.
The Commission revoked the registration of an investment adviser
in one other proceeding during the last 5 years. Investment Registry
of America, Inc., had been registered as a broker and dealer and also as
an investment adviser. On January 10, 1946, the Commission, after
notice and hearing, ordered both registrations revoked. The revocation of registration as investment adviser was based on misrepresentation in the application for registration.
In that application Investment Registry of America, Ino., had declared that its contract with
customers provided for a maximum fee of 5 percent of the securities
which it selected for its customers. This, the Commission found, was a
material misrepresentation in willful violation of section 207 of the
Investment A.dvisers A.ct, for the "selection" fee frequently ran as
high as 9 percent. The increased rate was usually hidden as "charges"
in the confirmations which the :firm sent to its clients.
Investigations

The powers of the Commission under the act are limited. It has
the power, however, to make investigations when it appears that the act
has been or is about to be violated, and has the power of subpoena
to aid its investigations. When an investigation establishes violations
of the act, the Commission may seek to enjoin such violations and
may take disciplinary action.
The Commission has received a substantial number of complaints
against certain investment advisers whose advice consists chiefly of
predictions and recommendations furnished in bulletins, market letters,
and other publications issued periodically and sold at a regular subscription price. The number of such complaints generally increases,
as might well be expected, during periods of market decline. In some
cases these publications purport to analyze market conditions and to
predict future trends. In other cases, they recommend the purchase
of particular stocks on the prediction that the price of the stock will
rise. Frequently, such recommendations are accompanied by information about the issuer of the stock and by various comparisons with other
stocks, purporting to show a basis for the prediction that the market
price of the recommended stock will rise. Subscribers have complained frequently that they suffered losses by following such advice.
The Commission investigates these complaints whenever it has reasonable grounds to believe that the recommendations and predictions
are tainted with bad faith or made without foundation, or that the
adviser's activities are fraudulent in any other respect. The mere
fact, however, that advice given has turned out to be worthless is not
sufficient basis for investigation.
The Commission has no power to inspect the books and records of
investment advisers, as it has with respect to brokers and dealers. Its
powers to deny and revoke investment adviser registrations are more
limited than its powers to deny and revoke broker-dealer registrations.
Because of these limitations, as pointed out in more detail in the tenth
annual report, a broad field intimately related to the securities markets
is left unprotected and unsupervised, and the Commission's efforts
to enforce the act are greatly curtailed.

FIFTEENTH ANNUAL REPORT
UTlGATlON

UNDER THE INVESTMENT

161

ADVISERS ACT

The most important court action to date involving a registered
investment adviser is that of Arleen W. Hughes v, S. E. C.I Mrs.
Hughes was registered both as a broker-dealer under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and as an investment adviser under the Investment Advisers Act. In her capacity as a dealer, she sold securities
which she owned to her investment advisory clients after she had
advised them, in her capacity as an investment adviser, to invest in
such securities.
She failed to make adequate disclosure of her ownership of the securities and of other facts concerning her personal interest
in the transactions.
The Commission revoked her registration as a
broker-dealer after finding that it constituted fraud for her to sell
her own securities to her investment advisory clients without disclosure
that her interests were in some respects adverse to their interests.
Mrs. Hughes thereafter petitioned the court to review the Commission's action. The case is more fully described in part II of this
report in the section on litigation under the Securities Exchange Act.
Two injunction actions have been brought under the Investment
Advisers Act during the past 5 years. In one the Commission, after
agreeing to the opening of a final judgment which had been entered
with the consent of the defendant, did not oppose a dismissal of the
action when it appeared that the provable facts would not support

OF THE COMMISSION UNDER THE
VARIOUS STATUTES

THE COMMISSION IN THE COURTS
Civil Proceedings

Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared
before a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae,
during the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of
the year, are contained in appendix tables 26 to 35.
At the beginning of the 1949 fiscal year 21 injunctive and related
enforcement proceedings instituted by the Commission in connection
with fraudulent and other illegal practices in the sale of securities
were pending before the courts; 18 additional proceedings were
instituted during the year and 19 cases were disposed of, so tha~ 20
of such proceedings were pending at the end of the year. In addition,
the Commission participated in a large number of reorganization
cases under the Bankruptcy Act; in 19 proceedings in the district
courts under section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act and in 31 miscellaneous actions, usually as amicus curiae or
intervenor, to advise the court of its views regarding the construction
of provisions of statutes administered by the Commission which were
involved in private lawsuits. The Commission also participated in
47 appeals. Of these, 13 came before the courts on petition for
review of an administrative order; 8 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission had taken an active part; 6 were
appeals in actions brought by or against the Commission; 10 were
appeals from orders entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public
Utility Holding Company Act; and 10 were appeals in cases in which
the Commission appeared as amicus curiae or intervenor.
The significant aspects of the Commission's litigation over the
past 5 years are discussed in the sections of this report devoted to the
respective' statutes administered by the Commission. Most basic
questions of constitutionality under the acts were determined prior
to the last 5 years, but in 1946 the constitutionality of the integration
and dissolution provisions of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act was sustained by the Supreme Court. Since then most of the
cases under that act have arisen in connection with decisions of the
Commission ruling upon the fairness and equity of the plans filed
under section 11 (e) of the act. Cases under the other acts have
dealt not with major constitutional issues but with problems incident
to enforcement.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General who may
institute criminal proceedings. The Commission, largely through its
regional offices, investigates suspected violations and, in cases where
the facts appear to warrant criminal proceedings, prepares detailed
reports which are forwarded to the Attorney General. When it is
162

FIFTEE~

~AL

REPORT

163

decided to institute criminal proceedings, the Commission may assign
such of its employees as have participated in the investigation to
assist in the preparation of the case for presentation to the grand
jury, in the conduct of the trial, and in the preparation of briefs on
appeal. Parole reports relating to convicted offenders are prepared
by the Commission's staff. Where the investigation discloses violations of statutes other than those administered by the Commission,
reference is made to the appropriate Federal or State agency.
Up to June 30, 1949, indictments had been returned against 2,564
defendants in 432 cases developed by the Commission. By the end
of the 1949 fiscal year, 403 of these cases had been disposed of as to
1 or more defendants and convictions had been obtained in 355
cases-over 88 percent of such cases-against
a total of 1,251 defendants.' During the past 5 years 89 indictments were returned against
248 defendants and convictions were obtained against 160 defendants.
Twenty-two of such indictments, involving 47 defendants, were
returned during the last fiscal year."
In the criminal appeals decided in the last five years, judgments of
conviction were affirmed as to 54 defendants and reversed as to only
8 defendants."
In addition, appeals were dismissed as to 5 defendants
and 4 others withdrew their appeals. At the close of the fiscal year,
2 criminal cases involving 5 defendants were still pending in the
appellate courts.
The criminal cases developed by the Commission during the past
5 years were extremely varied in nature, although they continue to
reflect the same general patterns described in the Tenth Annual Report.
For the most part they involved fraud in the promotion of new
businesses, inventions, and fraternal organizations; fraudulent schemes
in connection with the sale of oil and gas interests and mining ventures; "front money" schemes; frauds perpetrated by brokers and
dealers in securities and their representatives; frauds in whisky warehouse receipts transactions; and fraudulent purchases and sales of
securities by corporate "insiders."
The victims of the schemes
employed in these cases resided in almost every state in the country.
Generally, the perpetration of these frauds was accompanied by the
willful avoidance of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
1933, which are designed to provide investors with a full and fair
disclosure of material facts about the securities being sold. A substantial number of the fraud cases, therefore, also charged violation of
the registration provisions of that act. Other violations presented
included the manipulation of the price of stock registered on a national
securities exchange, the filing of false reports by a corporation whose
securities were registered on such an exchange, and failure to keep
required books and records and the filing of false financial statements
by registered broker-dealers.
A more detailed discussion of certain
of the cases prosecuted during the period is contained below.
I In a number of the 48remalnlng cases, which resulted in acqulttals or dismissals as to all defendants, the
indictments were dIsmlssed because of the death of the defendants involved .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The indictment returned during the past year in U. S. v. Preston
T. Tucker et al. (N. D. Ill.) contains charges of fraud arising out of the
postwar promotion of the "Tucker" automobile, in connection with
which approximately 28 million dollars was raised from the public.
The indictment in this case alleges that the defendants, as part of a
scheme to defraud in the sale of class A common stock of the Tucker
Corp., the sale of dealer and distributor franchises for the "Tucker"
automobile, and the sale of luggage and accessories for use in it, caused
to be disseminated, by means of an extensive advertising and publicity campaign, various false and fraudulent representations including, among others, representations as to the various features embodied
in the automobile, the status of its development and production,
and the imminence of mass production.
In addition, the indictment alleges that the defendants caused the
corporation to exhibit to the public automobiles which were falsely
described as containing the various advertised features, willfully concealing the fact that automobiles shown did not contain many of the
important advertised features and that many of the components contained in these automobiles were known by them to be unworkable
and unsatisfactory.
The indictment also charges that the defendants
caused the Tucker Corp. to expend substantial amounts of the monies
obtained from investors for the personal benefit and profit of the
defendants."
Prior to the return of this indictment, the Commission had conducted a series of inquiries into the affairs of the Tucker Corp. as a
result of certain filings made by the corporation with the Commission.
In May 1947 a registration statement was filed under the Securities
Act of 1933 relating to a proposed public offering of 4,000,000 shares
of the Tucker class A common stock, $1 par value, to be offered to the
public at $5 a share for a total of $20,000,000. The proceeds were to
be used for the mass-production of a medium-priced automobile, to
be known as the "Tucker," featuring a rear engine and other innovations departing substantially from conventional automobile design.
The Commission instituted stop-order proceedings alleging misstatements and omissions to state material fact in regard to numerous
items of required information in the registration statement, financial
statements, the accountants' certificate, certain exhibits, and the
prospectus.
In the course of these proceedings, it appeared that
the prospectus and registration statement as originally filed failed to
disclose adequately and accurately the names of all promoters and the
amount of consideration received directly or indirectly from the company by each promoter, officer, and director; the stage of development of the mechanical features of the proposed automobile; the
status of the company's patent position; the application of the proceeds of the proposed offering and the company's working capital
requirements; the business experience of the executive officers; the
nature and the extent of the interest of Preston Tucker, president of
the corporation, in Ypsilanti Machine & Tool Co.; the interests of
affiliates and other persons in property acquired by the company;
material litigation ; the scope-of the audit and the auditing procedures
f TnaI of these charges commenced on October 4, 1949. Snbseqnent to the preparation of this report the
Jnry retnmed a verdict of not gnDty as to all defendants.

followed by the certifying accountants; and the failure of the accounts to reflect all liabilities of the company.
During the course of and after the close of hearings in the stoporder proceedings, the corporation filed material amendments which,
on the basis of all of the information then available to the Commission, appeared to correct satisfactorily the material deficiencies previously contained in the registration statement. The Commission
thereupon issued an opinion stating that for this reason the proceedings would be dismissed and the registration statement, as amended,
would be permitted to become effective," In its opinion the CommiSSIOndiscussed the facts adduced in the proceedings and noted the
contrast between the information set forth in the amended prospectus
and the statements made in the corporation's previous publicity
regarding its plans, many of which statements appeared to be grossly
misleading and, in many cases, false. Accordingly, the Commission
specifically warned the prospective investor of the danger of relying
upon past judgments based on prior literature concerning Tucker
Corp. in determining whether to purchase the securities. The
opinion also pointed out the limits of the Commission's jurisdiction
which, under the Securities Act, is restricted to requiring that all
pertinent information be supplied so as to enable the investor to make
an informed judgment. It was emphasized that in permitting the
registration statement, as amended, to become effective, the Commission was in no way "passing on the merit or lack of merit of the
securities offered, the registrant's product or the possibility of success
or failure of the enterprise."
On May 10, 1948, Tucker Corp. filed with the Commission its first
annual report pursuant to section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. On the basis of the information contained in this report,
as well as certain other information received from various other
sources since the date of the stop-order opinion, the Commission, on
May 28, 1948, authorized an investigation to determine whether
certain provisions of the Securities Act and Securities Exchange Act
had been violated by the Tucker Corp., Preston Tucker, and the
underwriting firm of Floyd D. Cerf Co., Inc. The facts discovered
in the course of this investigation were referred to the Attorney General with a recommendation for criminal prosecution.
In U. S. v. Pam A. Schumpert et at. (M. D. Tenn.), indictments
were based upon the fraudulent sale of stock in the promotion of a
small-loan company." The defendants were charged, among other
things, with employing the "Ponzi" type of swindle/ causmg the
corporation to pay "dividends" without disclosing that such "dividends" had not been earned but were paid out of capital and were a
partial return of the investment. Shortly after the close of the last
fiscal year, Paul A. Schumpert, the principal defendant pleaded guilty
and was sentenced to 22 years imprisonment.
Some of the other cases in which convictions were obtained for the
fraudulent promotion of new businesses or inventions are U. S. v.
J Securities Act release No. 3236(1947)•
• An addltionallndictment Involving the same type of promotion In connection with another arnall-losn

The employment of "front money" schemes designed to defraud
persons desirous of obtaining capital for the financing of new businesses or the expansion of established ones was involved in U. S. v,
Amster Leonard et al. (E. D. Mich.) and U. S. v. Ocie O. Walker
(N. D. Texas). The defendants in these cases were convicted of
fraudulently inducing persons seeking new capital to pay over "advance fees" or "front money" upon the false representation that
they would be assisted in raising the necessary capital, when in
fact the defendants knew they could not and did not intend to raise
any such new capital.
A number of convictions were obtained in cases involving the
promotion of mining ventures.
In the perpetration of this type of
fraud false representations generally are made as to the ownership of
the mining properties which are the subject of the promotion; the
amount of commercial ore deposits contained in such properties; and
the use which is to be made of the monies received from investors.
Cases of this type included U. S. v. Harry J. Mallen (N. D. Ill.)

James A. Allen et
(E. D. Wash.)9 (silver mine); and U. 8. v. F. E.
Nemec et al. (E. D. Wash.)lO (gold properties);" In the Nemec case
the indictment charged also that the defendants fraudulently claimed
that they had acquired a secret process for the recovery of gold and
other metals and that this process had been invented by one of the
defendants who was falsely described as a nuclear physicist, eminent
chemical engineer, and key atomic scientist in the development of the
atomic bomb at the Hanford project."
Similar to the mining frauds are those perpetrated in connection
with the sale of oil, gas, and other mineral interests.
Typical cases
are U. 8. v. James F. Boyer et al. (S. D. Fla.) and U. 8. v, Aubrey M.
Poynter et al. (E. D. La.)13 in which the principal defendants were
convicted on charges of employing what is colloquially described as a
"reloading" scheme.'! In these cases it was charged, among other
things, that the defendants induced investors to make repeated purchases of oil leases by causing fictitious offers to be made to investors
for their holdings at prices which would have yielded them tremendous
profits. The offers, however, were conditioned upon the investors
obtaining additional leases from the defendants.
After investors
made such additional purchases, the offers ceased and investors were
unable to locate the offerors, who, in fact, were accomplices in th«
scheme.
Fraudulent sales of securities of alleged fraternal associations formed
the basis for the convictions in U. S. v. Hugh G. Oarruthere et al.
(N. D.
and U. 8. v. Preston E. Douglass (N. D. ill.).16 The
Oarruihere case involved the promotion of the N eological Foundation,
which was represented as having been organized for the spiritual
improvement and economic self-betterment of persons who joined the
foundation and adhered to its so-called "neological" course of training.
Carruthers was charged with fraudulently converting funds obtained
from members of the foundation for the alleged purpose of carrying on
various business enterprises to be operated by the foundation, including the manufacture and sale of hair shampoo and a tonic laxative, a
course of instruction in personal development, and a daily newspaper.
In the Douglass case, the defendant was charged with selling"stock"
of the Frederick Douglass Afro-American Cooperative Industry
Builders Association, Inc., a nonprofit Illinois corporation (which was
prohibited by statute from issuing stock) by means of false representations.
Douglass obtained funds by telling investors that the
association had been organized for the purposes of improving the eco-

nomic status and welfare of the Negro race and to furnish investors
with employment in cooperative stores and on farms which the
association was to develop and establish. In truth, the defendant
utilized the enterprise solely for his personal benefit.
The convictions obtained in U. S. v. Gilbert M. Bates (N. D. Iowa);
U. S. v. Stanley Grayson et al. (S. D. N. Y.); U. S. v. Clarence Everett
Martin (N. D. Ill.): U. S. v. Maxwell Goldberg et al. (D. Mass.):
U. S. v. W. R. Hempstead 00. et al. (D. R.I.); and U. S. v. Kenneth
Leo Bauer et al. (D. N. J.) are among those pertaining to frauds committed by securities brokers and dealers and their representatives."
In the Bates case the defendant was convicted for fraud predicated
upon the sale of securities to uninformed customers at prices not
reasonably related to the prevailing market prices, without appropriate disclosure. The indictment in the Grayson case charged a fraudulent "switch" scheme, wherein investors were induced to divulge
lists of their securities on the pretense that the defendants would,
after analysis, provide them with free investment advice." Thereafter, investors were induced to sell such securities and to purchase
from the defendants various fractional undivided interests in oil, gas,
and other mineral rights at prices substantially in excess of the maximum recoverable returns which it was estimated investors could obtain
from the mineral assets underlying such securities. In the Martin
case the defendant was charged with employing a scheme to defraud
representatives of the estates of deceased and incompetent persons
in that he falsely represented that he would dispose of the securities
owned by these estates at current market prices, but instead concealed
the true current market value of such securities and purchased them
for his own account at prices less than the prevailing market prices.
The fraudulent practiced charged in the Goldberg case included the
unauthorized pledging of customers' securities, forgery of customers'
checks, and the sale of spurious stock certificates and debentures.
The defendants in the Hempstead case were convicted of fraud based,
in part, upon the operation of a securities business While insolvent.
The fraud for which convictions were obtained in U. S. v. Kenneth
Leo Bauer et al. (D. N. J.) was found in the solicitation of customers'
orders for the purchase and sale of securities, the deliberate and willful
failure to execute such orders, and the subsequent conversion of
customers' monies and securities."
II Other such fraud cases were U. S. v, Guaramv UnduwrUtr. d al, (S. D. Fla.), (unreasonable spreads);
U. S. v. Florida Bond and Share, Inc., d al (S. D. Fla.), (unreasonable spreads and secret profits); U. S. v.
Samuel S. Altxandtr, d al. (S. D. N. Y.), (mJsrepresentations In sale of oll royalties and charging excessive prices without adequate disclosure); U. S. v. Edwin P Woodman (D. Mass.), (insolvency and conversion of customers' securtties): U. S. v. Charles J. CaUanan (D. Mass.) (conversion of customers' seeuritles); U. S. v. Arthur EdWin DaVt (S. D. Fla ), (conversion of customers' securities); U. S. v. Arthur
Briscoe WlUan (N. D., Ill.) (conversion of customers' securities); U. S. v. Wtu. E. Turner (W. D. Wisc.)
(conversion of customers' funds and securities); and U. S. v. Arthur L. AU(lUItlne (N. D. Iowa) (conversion of customers' funds and securities). The convictions obtained in the Altxandtr, Woad?'llln,
Hemp8tead and CaUanan cases were based not only upon fraud but also upon the failure of the registered
broker-deiiiers involved to keep the books and records required by the Becuritles Exchange Act of 1934
and the rules thereunder, and in the three cases last mentioned) the fllln~ of false financial statementa with
the Commission under that act. U. S. v. Gltn J. Hildebrand IS. D. Ill.) Is another instance of conviction
obtained for failure to keep books and records.
17 A fraudulent "switch" scheme involving transactions
In whisky warehouse receipts resulted In the
conviction of a number of defendanta In U. S. v. Mark A. Fruman tt al. (N. D. E. D. m.). The defendanta were charged with Induclng owners or whisky warehouse receipts to exchange them for bottling con.
tracts, with a corporation organized by the defendants. by falsely representing that the whisky would be
bottled, rectified and sold for the Investors for a small fee, whereas in: fact the defendants sold or hypothecated the warehouse receipts and converted the proceeds to their own use. U. S. v, Frank L. Rran d al.
(E. D. N. C.) also Involved convictions for fraud in connection with whisky warehouse receipt transactions.
11 In contrast to these cases is U. S. v. John N. Landberg (E D. Pa.), involving a customer who perpetrated a fraud on securities brokers. For details of the scheme see S. E. O. v. Landberg (8. D. N.

In U. S. v. Edgar M. Griswold (N. D. Ohio); U. S. v. EUis R. Taylor
(N. D. nu, and U. S. v. WiUiam A. Hancock (S. D. N. Y.) convictions were obtained for fraudulent conduct in connection with the
purchase of securities in violation of section lOeb) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and rule X-10B-5 thereunder.
In the Griswold
case, the defendant was convicted on charges of defrauding various
persons, principally tavern owners, in transactions relating to the
stock of a prominent distilling company,
Whisky purchase rights
had been attached to the stock. Griswold was charged with falsely
representing to purchasers that the stock would be worthless after
the whisky rights were exercised and that it could not be retained by
the purchasers after such exercise. It was further established that
Griswold obtained the stock for his own use and benefit by virtue of
these false representations and his failure to disclose that even after
the exercise of the whisky rights the stock had a market value of not
less than $24 a share.
The Taylor case involved the fraudulent acquisition of securities
from minority holders by a corporate insider. Taylor. who was
president of the corporation involved, was convicted on charges that
he purchased the stock of minority stockholders by falsely representing the value of the shares and the financial condition of the corporation and by the concealment of his identity as the actual purchaser of
the stock and of [facts known to him but not to the sellers as to the
true value of the shares. In the Hancock case, the defendant was
charged with employing a scheme to defraud an investment company
which employed him as a securities trader. According to the indictment, Hancock deliberately delayed placing orders for the purchase
and sale of securities for his company until after he had informed his
accomplices of the prices and amounts of the securities orders that he
intended to enter on behalf of the company, which enabled his accomplices to buy or sell such securities in dummy accounts and in turn to
sell them to or purchase them from the investment company at profits
of approximately $300,000.19
The fraudulent sale of stock by a corporate insider is charged in the
indictments recently returned ill U. S. v. Serge Rubinstein et al.
(S. D. N. Y.) in which the defendant Rubinstein is alleged to have
obtained an illegal profit of approximately $3,000,000 in the sale of
his stock in a corporation of which he was president.
According to
the indictments, the scheme to defraud involved the dissemination
of various false representations intended to establish the favorable
financial condition, earnings, and business potentialities of the corporation involved in order to facilitate the sale of his own stock in the
corporation.
Rubinstein, concealed his activities by falsely representing that he neither had sold nor intended, for a specified future
period, to sell any of his stock.
U. S. v. Albert B. Windt et at. (N. D. Cal.) involved the manipulation of the stock of a mining company listed on the San Francisco
Mining Exchange.
The defendants were convicted of raising and
conspiring to raise the market price of the stock through a series of
mampulative transactions designed to create the appearance of active

trading and intended to raise the price of such stock so as to induce
others to purchase the stock at higher prices.
In U. 8. v. Liggett &; Myers Tobacco 00. et 01. (E. D. Pa.) the corporation, whose securities were registered on a national securities
exchange, was convicted of making false and misleading statements
in annual reports required to be filed by it under section ] 3 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The corporation was charged with
willfully concealing facts relating to the existence of a profit-sharing
plan for certain officers and employees of the company.
During the past 5 years the Commission has continued to receive
a flood of complaints and inquiries from members of the public, state
authorities, and Better Business Bureaus regarding the activities of
a fringe group of stock promoters operating out of Toronto, Canada,
who have been selling securities to residents of the United States in
willful violation of our securities laws. These promotions are conducted by a numerically small group which is in no way representative
of the vast majority of persons engaged in the securities business in
Canada."
Nevertheless, the activities of these offenders have
resulted in extremely larg-e dollar amount losses to United States
investors. The Commission has conducted investigations of these
unlawful promotions wherever possible. Indictments, for the most
part secret, have been obtained ill a number of cases based primarily
upon the employment of schemes to defraud in the sale of securities.
However, existing treaty arrangements between Canada and this
country do not permit the extradition of the violators, and, consequently, it has been virtually impossible to bring the cases to trial."
In 1941 the Commission, recognizing this weakness in enforcement
structure, initiated, in conjunction with the State "Department and
the Department of Justice, efforts to secure a new treaty with Canada
which would permit the extradition of persons violating Federal and
State securities laws. The treaty was ratified by the United States
in May 1942, but has not yet been ratified by the Canadian
Parliament.
'
,
Two cases of this type made public during the past year demonstrate
the lack of effective sanctions in this area of enforcement. In U. 8.
v. Albert Edward DePalma (N. D. Ohio) and U.8. v. Noel H. K1WWles
(E. D. N. Y.) indictments were returned charging that the defendants
had sold Canadian mining stocks to United States investors by means
of false representations and as part of a scheme to defraud. DePalma
and Knowles, who are residents of Canada, were apprehended within
the United States and released on bonds of $50,000 and $25,000
respectively. Both defendants, however, forfeited their bail and fled
to Canada rather than stand trial on the fraud charges. Their return
to this country cannot be secured under our existing treaty with
Canada.
The Commission has endeavored also to meet the problem by turning over to the Post Office Department information gathered in the
course of the investigations conducted in these cases. As a result, a
10 Every year millions of dollars worth of securlties are olfered in this country by Oanadian issuers in full
compliance with our laws.

number of "fictitious name and fraud orders" have been issued recently
which, in effect, close the mails to communications addressed to the
violaters covered by the orders. It seems plain, however, that
revision-of existing extradition arrangements with Canada is necessary
if investors in this country are to be provided with effective protection
against securities frauds originating in Canada.
COMPLAINTS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

During the 1949 fiscal year the Commission received 7,048 items of
mail concerned with alleged securities violations.
These communications are classified administratively
as "complaint enforcement"
correspondence.
While they relate to complaints and alleged violations of various laws administered by the Commission, the bulk of them
deals with the enforcement of the Securities Act of 1933 and the registration provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
This material constitutes an important source of information concerning possible securities violations.
Investigations made by the
Commission's staff and contacts maintained with other governmental
or private agencies provide additional sources of such information.
Where it appears on the basis of any such data that any securities
violation may have occurred, the Commission conducts appropriate
investigations by means of correspondence or the assignment of cases
to field investigators to ascertain the facts of the particular case.
The extent of the investigatory activities of the Commission during
the past year under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934; sections 12 (e) and (h) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935; the Investment Company Act of 1940; and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 is reflected in the following table:

Securities Violations File

To assist in the enforcement of the statutes which it administers,
and to provide a further means of preventing fraud in the purchase and
sale of securities, the Commission has established a securities violations file. This file is a clearing house of information about persons
charged with violations of Federal and State securities statutes.
It is
kept up to date through the cooperation of the United States Post
Office Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and

172

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

probation officials, State securities commissions, Federal and State
prosecuting attorneys, police officials, members of the National Asso.
ciation of Better Business Bureaus, Ino., and members of the United
States Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the 1949 fiscal year this
file contained data about 51,165 persons against whom Federal or
State action had been taken in connection with securities violations.
During the past year alone additional items of information relating
to 5,577 persons were added to these files, including information concerning 2,065 persons not previously identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearing house of information.
During
the past year, in connection with the maintenance of the files, the
Commission received 4,670 "securities violations" letters or reports
(apart from those mentioned above which are classified as "complaint
enforcement")
and dispatched 3,421 communications in turn to
cooperating agencies.
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Successive reports of the Commission have called attention to the
fact that the detailed provisions of the several acts administered by
the Commission recognize the importance of adequate financial statements and their certification by independent public accountants in
ensuring the availability of information necessary for the protection
of investors and in the conduct of the Commission's work under the
acts. These acts grant the Commission broad authority to prescribe,
among other matters, the form and content of financial statements
required to be filed by registrants subject to the Securities Act of
1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to prescribe uniform
systems of accounts for registrants subject to the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, and to provide for a reasonable degree
of uniformity in accounting policies and principles to be followed by
registered investment companies in maintaining their accounting
records and in preparing financial statements required by the Investment Company Act of 1940. Acting under this authority the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for certain public
utility holding companies and for public utility mutual and subsidiary
service companies. The principal accounting requirements prescribed
under the acts of 1933, 1934, and 1940 are set forth in regulation S-X,
which governs the form and content of most financial statements
filed under these acts. In addition, under the Securities Exchange
Act, rules have been adopted governing record keeping, financial reporting, and the auditing of the books of exchange members, brokers,
and dealers.
Part X of the Commission's tenth annual report described the
development of the Commission's accounting requirements and noted
that in this process much assistance was found in the experience and

by a completely integrated body of accounting principles and a detailed statement of auditing procedures despite notable progress in
these fields reflected in publications by such groups as the American
Accounting Association and the American Institute of Accountants,
the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners and
by this Commission and other governmental agencies.
Examination of Financial Statements

Assurance that generally accepted accounting principles and standards of auditing (where certified financial statements are required) are
observed is basic in many of the Commission's activities under all of the
acts and in all of the major operating divisions of the Commission.
Such assurance is sought through the activities of the Commission's
accounting staff which is so organized as to permit expeditious handling
of accounting work and to ensure uniformity of treatment of the problems that arise in the work of all the divisions. A substantial part
of this work involves the examination of the financial statements and
other accounting data included in material filed with the Commission.
Questions raised ordinarily are brought to the attention of the registrant by letter. Solutions may then be reached by conference or
correspondence.
The solution may be the satisfaction of the staff
with the material as filed or the filing of amendments to comply with
our rules and regulations; very rarely is resort taken to a formal proceeding to resolve a conflict in views.
It should be noted that members of the Commission's accounting
staff are always available to advise prospective registrants and their
accountants, in conference or by correspondence prior to filing, with
respect to interpretation and application of the Commission's accointing requirements to particular situations.
Valuable time and expense
may be saved by this procedure when unique problems are recognized
or where registrants and certifying accountants are without previous
experience with Commission procedures.
Public Discussion of Accounting Problems

Some indication of the influence of the Commission's work in
accounting is found in the numerous inquiries on accounting subjects
received from companies and accountants not subject to our jurisdiction. Inquiries also include requests from teachers and students of
accounting for assistance in research projects and for copies of Accounting Series releases and regulations for use in college classes in
accounting and auditing.
A singular request of this type warrants
specific comment here. Recognizing a professional obligation to
public accountants who participated actively in the war, the American
Institute of Accountants prepared a refresher course for public accountants.
This course, published in 1945 under the title "Contemporary Accounting," covered developments during the war in the
various fields of accounting and auditing.
The Commission made a
contribution to this work in the form of a chapter on "Requirements
of the Securities and Exchange Commission" prepared by the then
chief accountant and a member of his staff. Believing that such
public discussion of the Commission's work in accounting is helpful
to present and prospective registrants and to their accountants,
members of the Commission and the chief accountant have accepted
invitations to appear at accounting conferences and meetings of

174

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

various accounting organizations on numerous occasions. Such occasions afford an excellent opportunity to discuss current trends in the
development of accounting principles, auditing standards, financial
reportmg practices and professional ethics in accounting. Comments
received assist materially in the continuous reappraisal of our accounting rules and regulations and in their administration.
A review of the Commission's annual reports for the fiscal years
ended June 30, 1945, 1946, 1947, and 1948 and of the papers referred
to in the preceding paragraph reveal that the following topics have
been considered during the 5-year period: historical versus earning
power concept of the income statement; relation between finanoial
and tax accounting practices; corporate consolidations, reorganizations and mergers; termination and renegotiation of war contracts;
war and postwar reserves; charges and credits to earned surplus (a
problem under almost continuous discussion); reporting of so-called
"tax savings" or "charges in lieu of taxes"; accounting for emergency
war facilities: the single step income statement; the statement of
financial position versus the orthodox form of balance sheet; public
utility depreciation; employees' pensions; inventory reserves for future
price declines; depreciation and current price levels, development of
new terminology for reserves and surplus; improvements in form of
financial statements; problems arising from the use of the "lifo"
(last-in first-out) method of inventory valuation; and buy-sell-lease
financing. A mere listing of these items is sufficient to emphasize the
cyclical character of some of the persistent accounting problems and
the influence of the closing year of the war and reconversion period.
Some of the problems created by the war (such as reserves for
reconversion) were relatively short lived and were disposed of to a
large extent during the 5-year period under review. The varying
accounting treatments given to emergency war facilities have had a
more lingering influence. Where the emergency facilities were used
only during the war period and could not be converted to peace time
use, the accelerated amortization applied appears to have been appropriate accounting. Where, however, war plants were written off but
converted to peacetime use with full efficiency, the post war years
benefit from the use of the property without the burden of a depreciation charge. Where postwar use of the properties was anticipated
and normal depreciation rates were used for accounting purposes
although full emergency facility amortization was claimed during the
war period for tax purposes, the postwar period bears a depreciation
charge from which no tax benefit is derived. Further accounting
complications developed in both of these situations when postwar
plant additions were made at excessive construction costs. It is clear
that in this postwar period both intraindustry and interindustry comparisons of financial results are seriously affected by these differences
ill accounting treatment of plant costs.
Full disclosure of the methods
employed in accounting for fully depreeiated assets (whether yrewar,
war emergency':or postwar) and postwar additions is essentia in the
absence of uniform treatment throughout industry. These problems
have not proven as simple as many commentators on the subject
have suggested. In any case, the Commission has given aerious
consideration to these problems as subsequent paragraphs will
disclose.

Revisions of Regulation S-X and Forms

Regulation S-X, the Commission's principal accounting regulation
under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
and the Investment Company Act of 1940, was adopted in 1940.
In addition to minor technical changes and the recognition of certain
temporary conditions growing out of the war, two major changes
were made in this regulation during the period under review. After
approximately 5 years' experience in examining financial statements
of management investment companies filed pursuant to the accounting
requirements laid down in article 6 of the regulation, a complete
revision was proposed and submitted to interested parties for comment. Extensive comments were received and carefully considered
and a formal public conference was held following which remaining
problems were discussed with representatives of the industry. The
revised article 6 in effect since 1946 has resulted in substantial uniformity in the accounting practices of the companies affected and in
more informative and useful financial statements for investors.
A corresponding accounting regulation for face-amount certificate
companies was proposed last year as article 68.22 This proposal is
still under discussion with persons who will be governed by its provisions.
The most recent change in regulation S-X is the inclusion of a new
article 5-A 23 referred to in last year's report and adopted early in this
fiscal year. This new article provides for simplified financial statements for commercial, industrial and mining companies in the promotional, exploratory or development stage previously provided for only
in Securities Act registration forms for these companies, extending
the use of such simplified statements to applications for registration
on Form 10 and to annual reports on Forms 10-K and 1-MD under
the Securities Exchange Act for companies of the type indicated.
In previous reports and elsewhere in this report comment may be
found as to revision of forms and the elimination of those found to be
obsolete. In addition to the program of revision of the forms most
widely used, regulation S-X is undergoing a thorough reappraisal
with a view to the elimination of obsolete material and the incorporation of provisions relating to accounting terminology and financial
statement disclosure developed in the last few years. This program
is a major undertaking and will require careful consideration of a
number of controversial and complex problems involving accounting
principles and auditing standards, as well as the form and content of
financial statements.
Incidental to the above program the Commission has received
suggestions to the effect that financial statements contained in published reports to stockholders should be accepted in lieu of the financial
statements required by certain of our forms. Apparently those
making these suggestions have overlooked the fact that a similar
previous suggestion was adopted in amendments to Form lo-K for
commercial, industrial and utility companies and to Form N-30A-1
for investment companies. Accounting Series Release No. 41 adopted
December 22, 1942, dealt with the accounting aspects of these

amendments. Briefly, the amendments permit companies to file
copies of their regular annual reports to stockholders in place of
certain of the financial statements required to be filed by such forms,
if the financial statements included in the annual report to stockholders substantially conform to the requirements of regulation S-X.
The release discusses in some detail the interpretation to be given to
the words "substantially conform." Despite this provision intended
to simplify compliance as well as to encourage high standards in financial statements furnished to stockholders, only a few registrants have
taken advantage of this rule.
The requirements of rule X-13A-13 and Form 8-K for the filing
with the Commission of a quarterly report of sales may also be
satisfied by the filing in lieu thereof of a copy of the published report
to stockholders provided such report contains as a minimum the total
amount of gross sales less discounts, returns and allowances, and
operating revenues. Although a representative list of corporations
has taken advantage of this permission, the use of the alternative has
not been as widespread as was expected.
Review of Commission Decisions

Reports for the past 4 years have contained detailed consideration
of Commission decisions involving points of accounting and auditing
of particular interest to accountants. A brie(summary will indicate
the nature of the problems encountered.
The close of the war and reconversion to peacetime activity and
expansion in industry produced several cases in which inventories
were found to be overstated due to overoptimism, improper accounting
methods or other causes." A number of similar cases were observed
and corrected as a result of the Commission's regular examining
procedure and without formal Commission action or published opinion.
In one of the published cases in which the misleading financial statements had been certified by independent public accountants, the
Commission deemed it necessary, by a separate action, to inquire
into the auditing procedures followed by the accountants and into
other circumstances having a bearing upon the failure to detect the
substantial overvaluation of the inventories in question. In this
proceeding the accountants stipulated that the statements of fact
and conclusions based thereon in the Commission's published report
might be considered as evidence. While the hearing officer found
all of the parties at fault in some degree, the Commission adopted his
recommendation that in view of the remedial measures taken by the
accounting firm to strengthen its control procedures, and, further,
in view of the prior adverse publicity and certain mitigating circumstances, the proceedings should be dismissed with the recommendation
that the public, and particularly the accounting profession, be informed that when a firm of public accountants permits a report or
certificate to be executed in its name the Commission will hold such
firm fully accountable. This was done by publication of the findings
of the hearing examiner." The following comment on this opinion
is quoted from the June 1949 number of The New York Certified.
Public Accountant: "The tenor of the opinion is far more important

to accountants generally than is the result reached on the specific
facts, since the admonitions included a strong invitation to all practitioners to review their existing organizational
procedures and
practices, and where indicated to take appropriate remedial measures."
It is believed that the opinion has had this beneficial effect and will
help to strengthen the protection which certification of financial
statements by independent public accountants is intended to afford
to investors.
A second class of cases involving accounting which has led to Commission opinions during the past five years arose in connection with
promotional enterprises.
These cases usually reveal failures to
disclose significant information concerning the relationship of the
promoters to the enterprise, omission of liabilities from the balance
sheets, overstatement or improper description of assets and inappropriate and misleading accountants' certificates." A situation of this
kind briefly described in the Thirteenth Annual Report. " resulted
in a proceeding under rule II (e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice
as a result of which the firm of certified public accountants and the
partner in charge of the engagement were found to have engaged in
improper professional conduct under our rules. Briefly, the partner
in question attached the firm's certificate to a balance sheet which
contained certain misstatements
of assets and liabilities, including
the improper showing among the assets of a leasehold at $100,000,
an amount equal to the par value of the common stock issued therefor,
when it was admitted that this amount was an overstatement.
The
opinion concluded "that it was improper to indicate that the stock
had been issued at its full par value, whereas, in fact, it had been
issued at a discount."
The accountants' certificate was held to be
false and misleading in that it was couched in terms which implied
the existence of an accounting system and accounting records when in
fact there were no books of account, no accounting system and no
accounting records other than a few vouchers and rough notes in the
certifying accountants' own files. In addition, it was found that the
partner, and therefore the firm, was not independent as represented
and required by the Securities Act of 1933 because the partner had
become so enmeshed in the promotion of the enterprise that he was
in reality a promoter rather than an independent certified public
aeoountant."
A third class of cases revealed situations in which inadequate or
misleading financial statements were employed to assist the management in a program of acquiring the company's securities at less than
their fair value.29
A fourth group of accounting cases arises in the administration
of the rules governing securities brokers and dealers. Difficulties were
encountered in this field of regulation largely because of the large
number of small firms and the fact that many of the required audits
were performed by accountants unfamiliar with the Commission's
requirements and apparently not well trained in the improved procedures of brokerage auditing practice.

profession have aided in our efforts to improve the quality of brokerdealer audits and reports."
In addition the Commission's staff,
through correspondence and direct contact by regional office representatives, has devoted considerable time to explaining to brokers
and dealers and their accountants the reporting auditing requirements
of the pertinent rule X-17A-5 and Form X-17A-5, which have
been in effect since 1943, where it was apparent that inexperience
rather than deliberate evasion was the cause of the unsatisfactory
reports filed. Nevertheless, our investigations not infrequently
disclose failure to keep proper books and records specified under
rule X-17A-3 and willful violation of our reporting requirements
referred to above. A case of this kind which resulted in disciplinary
action against the certifying public accountants was described in last
year's report." Two cases reported in Commission opinions this year
resulting in withdrawal or revocation of broker-dealer registrations
did not involve public accountants."
Other cases reviewed in past
reports during this period are cited in the margin."
Current Problems in Accounting and Auditing

In a preceding paragraph several representative accounting problems considered in the past five years were mentioned. Detailed
reconsideration of those matters which have been discussed at some
length in prior years' reports would not appear to be necessary here.
However, changing business conditions not only create new problems
in accounting, but often call for reexamination of old problems.
A persistent problem in reporting has been that of reflecting possible
adverse business developments in the future. Accounting devices
used include the creation of general purpose contingency reserves and
reserves designated for special purposes such as possible future price
declines in inventories and for replacement of plant assets in periods
of higher price levels. As stated in our fourteenth annual report,
administrative policy on this question has been that provisions of this
type should be reflected as appropriations of surplus and should be
reported in the surplus statement rather than on the profit and loss
statement. This view encountered resistance from certain registrants
and their accountants due in part to the equivocal position taken in
several research bulletins issued by the Committee on Accounting
Procedure of the American Institute of Accountants and to which
position our chief accountant had taken exception. As indicated in
our last report, the Institute committee recognized that considerable
confusion in the reporting of operating results was created by the
optional reporting methods permitted under their bulletins and sought
to remedy the situation by the adoption of a new bulletin 34 in which
the option permitting appropriation from net income was withdrawn.
Minority dissents to the bulletin and developments in practice
since its publication indicate that its subject matter is still controversial. However, the majority view of the committee reflects a policy,
consistent with that of the Commission, that the income statement
should show net income for the period without additions or deductions

of items which are properly excluded from the determination of net
income such as the types of provisions for future events mentioned
above. This policy is reflected in rule 5-03-16 of regulation S-X
which provides that the final caption on profit and loss or income statements shall be Nat Income or Loss.
Mentioned in last year's report was an example of the application
of the replacement theory of depreciation as compared to the generally
accepted accounting concept that depreciation is the amortization of
the cost of :fixed assets over their anticipated useful lives. A small
number of registrants applied some departure from the accepted
principle in reports filed with the Commission during the year. Exception was taken in all of these cases, and conferences, in which
representatives of registrants, the Commission and the staff participated, were held to consider the general question and its application
in particular cases. The conclusion reached was that depreciation
charges in financial statements filed with the Commission should continue to be based upon cost. Revisions of financial statements on
file have been made in accordance with this conclusion. In some cases
accounting recognition has been given to the high rates of production
enjoyed in postwar years by accelerating depreciation charges in
periods during which productive capacity was used in excess of normal
average production over a representative period of years. Similarly,
the amortization of plant costs incurred to capture a temporarily expanded demand was deemed to comply with the generally applicable
accounting principle of matching costs with revenues. In such cases
a clear explanation of the circumstances justifying the early amortization of costs has been obtained. The policy adopted by the Commission is consistent with that adopted by representative professional
accounting groups in this country 36 and ill Great Britain."
In the Commission's thirteenth annual report attention was called
to the practice of accepting, prior to that time, accountants' certificates
accompanying financial statements of public utility companies in
which the accountants avoided expression of an opinion with respect
to the adequacy of the provision and the reserve for depreciation.
Since that time Commission policy has been to require that in the
event of inadequacy of either the provision or the reserve the accountant must make clear his position as to both. A related problem is the
proper disclosure of the reserve for depreciation in the balance sheet.
Because of a custom of long standing in the utility industry pursuant
to which such reserves were shown grouped with other reserves on the
liability side of the balance sheet in accordance with yrescribed uniform
systems of accounts adopted by the various federa and state regulatory bodies, this Commission's regulation S-X which prescribes the
form and content of financial statements to be filed under the acts
contains, for such companies, an exception to the general rule that
valuation and qualifying reserves shall be shown separately in the
statements as deductions from the specific assets to which they apply.
However, the general rule has had wide acceptance among accountants for many years and it would appear that it should now be applied

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

to public utility companies since the uniform system of accounts
promulgated by the National Association of Railroad and Utilities
Commissioners now permits, but does not require, the deduction of
reserves for depreciation, depletion and amortization from the related
asset accounts on the balance sheet. Some states and the Federal
Power Commission, the Interstate Commerce Commission and the
Civil Aeronautics Board, adopted this treatment of the reserve as a
requirement.
A requirement to this effect is being considered in
connection with the amendment of regulation S-X now in process.
The use of the word "reserve" in the foregoing discussion prompts
a reference to a movement in accounting circles which should have
the support of all concerned. There has been much lay criticism of
certain technical terms used in accounting. Two terms that have
received the brunt of the attack are "reserve" and "surplus." The
accounting staff has discussed the matter with representatives of the
accounting profession and in response to specific inquiries has indicated
that there is no barrier in the Commission's present accounting requirements to the adoption of properly descriptive substitute terminology
in financial statements filed with the Commission. In addition, the
chief accountant of the Commission has publicly endorsed the movement. A recent review of a number of reports to stockholders indicates a growing acceptance of these proposals to adopt new terminology intended to be more illuminating.
Briefly, it is proposed to restrict the term "reserve" to appropriations
of surplus which should be shown as part of the stockholders' equity
in the balance sheet. The term would not be used to designate
accounts properly classified as liabilities or as deductions from assets.
Clear-cut distinctions are difficult in some cases but substantial improvements have been made in financial statements filed with the
Commission.
Some large corporations have approached the abandonment of the
term "surplus" with caution, adopting the device of using both the
old and new terms, showing one or the other in parentheses. New
terms found in published reports include "net income retained for
use in the business," "profit employed in the business," "income
retained in the business," "net earnings retained for use in the business," "accumulated earnings-in use in the business," "reinvestment
of profits," and "earnings employed in the business." Corporate
financial history in many individual cases will present complications
which will require special disclosure. A common example is the
situation in which earnings have been capitalized by the payment of
stock dividends or by an increase in the stated value of any class of
outstanding shares. Consideration must also be given to the proper
presentation of appropriations from surplus to create reserves or to
indicate restrictions on surplus from a variety of causes. An unqualified use of the suggested substitute terms would appear to be
technically incorrect and misleading when earnings have been capitalized or appropriated and shown otherwise than as a part of the
recaptioned earned surplus. The phrases men tioned above connote
that a given account represents all of the earnings which have been
retained. In order for a balance sheet using such terminology to be
accurate and meaningful the account thus captioned must be pre-

FIFTEENTH

REPORT

sented in a manner which will reflect all earnings retained in the business, even though capitalized, or otherwise appropriated.
A problem actively discussed during the year grows out of a form
of financing which has had a rapid postwar growth in popularity.
There are several variations found, but a common example involves
the construction of a building, its immediate sale to a second party
accompanied by a long-term lease back to the seller, usually with
renewal options. In some cases a third party, usually an insurance
company or an educational institution, lends the necessary funds to

the lessor-owner of the real estate builds to specifications furnished by
the lessee. The device is common in the chain store field but is not
restricted to it. The problem for the accountant when faced with
these situations is to determine how much disclosure is necessary for
the investor to interpret properly the effect upon the financial condition of the company.
-

The Commission's practice with respect to the treatment of these
situations depends upon the terms of the contracts.
There are,
basically, three types of contracts.
Some are simple lease arrangements containing no provision for acquisition by the tenant of title
to the property.
Specific instructions for the reporting of long-term
leases, including those of the type under discussion, are now prescribed in item 5 of rule 12-16 of regulation S-X, dealing with "Supplementary Profit and Loss Information," which requires a statement
of the aggregate annual amount, if significant, of the rentals upon all
real property now leased to the registrant and its subsidiaries for
terms expiring more than three years after the date of filing, and the
number of such leases. If the rentals are conditional the minimum
annual amount thereof is to be stated.
It is also essential, in view of
the fixed commitment involved, that adequate information with
respect to such leases be submitted as supplemental information to
the balance sheet, preferablyl,in:the
form of a footnote keyed to a
caption in the, balance sheet.
A second type of contract involves the purchase or repurchase of
the property by the lessee, and provides that the periodic payments
made under the agreement will be applied against the purchase price
of the property. Such arrangements are clearly purchase or repurchase
contracts, and should be shown at their full contract cost, less appropriate allowance for depreciation, on the asset side of the lessee's
balance sheet, with the liability under the purchase contract reflected
under an appropriate caption on the liability side. Here, again,
adequate information
concerning such arrangements
should be
appropriately disclosed.
The third type of contract incorporates an agreement which permits
but does not obligate the lessee to acquire title to the property either
during the life of the lease or upon its termination.
In these situations
it is necessary to go beyond the form of such contracts and determine
whether, in substance, the lessee actually intends to acquire the
prope~.
Among the factors to be weighed in reaching a decision are:
1. Whether the rentals are to be applied against the purchase price,
and if so, whether they are out of line with rentals under leases not
containing acquisition provisions]

182

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

2. The estimated value of the property at the time the purchase
option becomes exercisable as compared with the agreed purchase
price, if any;
.
3. Whether the contract provides for an extension of the lease
period, and the amount of the rentals to be paid during the extended
period.
If it is determined, after consideration of all the factors in a particular case, that the agreement is in fact a purchase or repurchase contract.
it follows that it must be reflected in the balance sheet as in the second
type of case. If, on the other hand, the agreement constitutes a bona
fide lease arrangement, it will be necessary only to submit the required
information as a supplement to the financial statements as in the first
example.
Most, of the articles concerning "net-lease" financing appearing in
various financial and accounting publications either do not refer to
some of the significant problems inherent in this practice, or give
them only passing mention.
One of the principal problems to the
lessee is, of course, the fixed commitment for a long term of years.
In the cases which have come to our attention the arrangements do
not appear to he subject to adjustment to conform to changes in
business conditions, a situation which may present considerable
hazard in periods of declining business activity.
A case in point is that of the Childs Co. The Commission', advisory
report 37 on the propo.ed plans of reorganization of this company
discloses that the "need for cash to repay bank loans caused the company to dispose of a number of its best properties and take back leases
at rentals which later proved burdensome."
Among the factors
enumerated by the trustee as contributing to the chain's financial
difficulties were excessive rentals paid by many of the stores and
obsolete restaurant locations which were impossible to abandon
because of lease obligations.
It is true, of course, that the purchase of property subject to a
mortgage also commits the mortgagor to periodic payments of interest
and to repayment of the principal amount. However, the number of
such commitments which may be incurred by anyone mortgagor is
somewhat restricted by virtue of the fact that ordinarily a mortgage
cannot be obtained for the full value of the property, and the purchaser
must provide the balance himself. Because this restriction is not
present in the typical "sell-lease" transaction, and there is a real
danger that the lessee will commit himself for payments which he will
be unable to meet under adverse conditions, full disclosure of such
lease obligation, is necessary in order to make the financial statements
not misleading.
DIVISION OF OPINION WRITING

The Division of Opinion Writing aids the Commission in the preparation of findings, opinions, and orders promulgated by the Commission in contested and other cases and controversies arising under
the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Holding Company Act of 1935, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act

of 1940. These statutes provide for a wide variety of administrative
proceedings which require quasi-judicial determination by the Commission. Formal opinions are issued in all cases where the nature of
the matter to be decided, whether substantive or procedural, is of
sufficient importance to warrant a formal expression of views.
The Division of Opinion Writing is an independent staff officewhich
is directly responsible to the Commission. It receives all assignments
and instructions from and makes recommendations and submits its
work to the Commission directly. It is headed by a director, who is
assisted by an assistant director, supervising attorneys and a staff
of drafting attorneys and a financial analyst.
While engaged in the preparation of opinions assigned to the
Division of Opinion Writing, the members of this Division are completely isolated from members of the operating division actively
participating in the proceedings and it is an invariable rule that
those assigned to prepare such an opinion must not have had any
prior participation in any phase of the proceedings with respect to
which the opinion is to be prepared. Commission experts are from
time to time consulted on technical problems arising in the course of
the preparation of opinions and findings, but these experts are never
individuals who have participated in the preparation of the case or
testified at the hearing.
The director or assistant director of the Division of Opinion Writing
together with the members of the staff of the Division who are assigned
to work on a particular case, attend the oral argument of the cases
before the Commission and frequently keep abreast of current hearings. Prior to the oral argument, the Division makes a preliminary
review of the record and prepares and submits to the Commission a
summary of the facts and issues raised in the hearings before the
hearing officer, as well as in any proposed findings and supporting
briefs, the hearing officer's recommended decision, and exceptions
thereto taken by the parties. Following oral argument or, if no oral
argument has been held, then at such time as the case is ready for
decision, the Division of Opinion Writing is instructed by the Commission respecting the nature and content of the opinion and order
to be prepared.
In preparing the draft of the Commission's formal opinion, the
entire record in the proceedings is read by a member of the staff of
the Division of Opinion Writing and in some cases he also prepares
a narrative abstract of the record. Upon completion of a draft
opinion and abstract of the record, and after their review and revision
within the Division of Opinion Writing, they are submitted to the
Commission. If the study of the record in the case by the Division
of Opinion Writing has revealed evidence of violations warranting a
reference to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution, or has disclosed the desirability or the need for any changes in administrative
procedures or techniques, appropriate recommendations are made
to the Commission at the time the draft opinion in the case is submitted.
The draft opinion as submitted may be modified, amended, or completely rewritten in accordance with the Commission's final instructions. When the opinion accurately expresses the views and conclusions of the Commission, it is adopted and promulgated as the

184

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

official decision of the Commission. In some cases concurring or
dissenting opinions are issued by individual Commissioners who wish
to express their separate views on matters covered by the opinion
adopted by the majority of the Commission. In such cases the
Division of Opinion Writing is occasionally instructed to prepare
drafts of such concurring or dissenting opinions and confers respecting
them with the individual Commissioners involved, submits drafts
directly to them, and makes such modifications and revisions as are
directed.
The findings of fact, opinions, and orders adopted and promulgated
by the Commission serve as an aid and guide to the bench and bar.
With minor exceptions (e. g., certain opinions dealing with requests
for confidential treatment) all are publicly released and distributed to
representatives of the press and persons on the Commission's mailing
list. In addition, the findings and opinions are printed and published
by the Government Printing Office in bound volumes under the title
"Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
The Division of Opinion Writing uses a system of drafting and
reviewing attorneys to check and recheck against the record, in order
that the cases assigned to it receive the meticulous consideration which
their importance and substantial nature require, and to ensure that
the findings and opinion of the Commission will reflect with complete
correctness the facts in the record and the applicable law. The Commission believes this to be the only effective way to achieve consistent
accuracy in dealing with cases having the technical complexities that
characterize the matters it is required to decide.
The foregoing represents the primary function of the Division of
Opinion Writing-to aid in the preparation of findings, opinions, and
orders promulgated by the Commission in contested cases arising
under the statutes it administers. The creation of the Division of
Opinion Writing as an independent staff unit in 1942 was based on the
view that the fair exercise of the Commission's adjudicatory functions
in many types of cases made it appropriate that it be assisted in that
function by members of its staff who were independent of any other
employees who participated in any of the investigative or prosecutory
functions of the Commission. Originally initiated as a matter of
Commission policy, this arrangement's desirability was subsequently
given express recognition in the specific provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act which in certain types of cases require that there
be a complete separation of function between quasi-prosecutory
functions and quasi-judicial functions. The existence of the Division
of Opinion Writing thus made it possible for the Commission even
before the passage of the Administrative Procedure Act to meet fully
the separation of function requirements contained in Sections 5 (c),
7 and 8 of that act.
Following the adoption of the Administrative Procedure Act in
June 1946, the Commission's Rules of Practice and procedure were
revised in order to effect full compliance with the provisions of the act.
Revised Rules of Practice were adopted effective September 11, 1946,
when most provisions of the act became effective, and there were
also prepared for publication in the Federal Register, as required by

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

185

the act, descriptions of the Commission's organization and procedures,
lists of forms, and a compilation of interpretative opinions theretofore
issued for the guidance of the public. These materials were prepared
under the joint direction of the Division of Opinion Writing and the
Office of the General Counsel.
The Commission, through its revised Rules of Practice, has sought
to provide a flexible procedure which will be suited to the needs and
desires of the participants in the proceeding before it, as well as guarantee them the procedural safeguards required by the general principles
of due process and the provisions of the Administrative Procedure Act.
Thus, in many instances the Commission, at the request of some
participants, has availed itself of the assistance of the Division of
Opinion Writing in the preparation of its findings even though separation of functions was not technically required by law. Further, under
rule III of the Commission's Rules of Practice, the moving party may,
subject to contrary determination by the Commission, specify the
procedures considered necessary or appropriate in the proceedings,
with particular reference to (1) whether there should be a recommended decision by a hearing officer; (2) whether there should be a
recommended decision by any other responsible officer of the Commission; (3) whether the interested Division of the Commission's
staff, or only the Division of Opinion Writing, may assist in the
preparation of the Commission's decision and (4) whether there should
be a 30-day waiting period between the issuance of the Commission's
order and the date it is to become effective. Other parties may object
to the procedures or specify other procedures, but in the absence of
such objection or specification of additional procedures may be deemed
to have waived objection to the specified procedure and to the omission
of any procedure not specified.
In addition to its primary function, the Division of Opinion Writing
is also given assignments of a general nature which are not inconsistent
with the objective of the separation of the investigatory and quasijudicial functions. Thus, the Division has been assigned continuing
joint responsibility with the Office of the General Counsel in dealing
with problems arising under the Administrative Procedure Act. It
has also been given the responsibility of preparing a compilation of
administrative decisions and other authorities under the various
statutes administered by the Commission, and from time to time it is
given other special assignments by the Commission.
The Division of Opinion Writing also assists the operating divisions
of the Commission in the preparation of opinions in certain uncontested cases where participation by the operating division in the decisional process is proper under the Administrative Procedure Act. In
some instances members of the Division of Opinion Writing are also
assigned to assist the Office of the General Counsel in connection
with court appeals taken from Commission decisions initially drafted
in the Division. '
Some of the more significant opinions issued by the Commission
during the year are commented upon in this report under the discussions of the various statutes.

INTERNATIONAL

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

FINANCIAL

AND ECONOMIC

MATTERS

Registration statements covering $15,353,450 of securities issued
by foreign companies were filed during the fiscal year 1949. Because
of the withdrawal of one statement covering an offering of $7,500,000
of securities of a Canadian oil company, only $7,853,450 of securities
of foreign issuers were effectively registered.
Upon the outbreak of World War II the national securities
exchanges suspended dealings in all securities of German, Japanese,
Italian, and other axis origins. Shortly thereafter the Commission,
upon cousultation with the Departments of State and Treasury,
requested that brokers and dealers refrain from effecting transactions
in these securities. Following the filing of a registration statement
by the Republic of Italy in December 1947, covering an offer of
exchange for the outstanding dollar bonds of the Kingdom of Italy
and certain municipal and corporate obligations, the Commission
withdrew its request as to Italian securities.
In recognition of the interest of United Stat-es bondholders and
upon request of the securities exchanges upon which the bonds were
traded, the Commission has consulted with the Departments of State,
Treasury, Justice, and the Army as to the questions involved in the
eventual resumption of trading in German, Japanese, and other
former axis issues. Events which have taken place since these bonds
were suspended from trading have been reviewed. The uncertain
status of prewar dollar obligations of Germany and Japan, the lack
of a peace treaty with either country, and the substantial dollar
obligations they have incurred during the period of occupation have
been noted. The Commission has concurred in the conclusion that it
would not be in the interest of United States foreign policy or of
public investors to approve the resumption of trading in German or
Japanese securities at this time.
The Commission maintains, through its Adviser on Foreign Investment, facilities for liaison with other agencies which might have
jurisdiction over or interest in problems of foreign finance. The
Commission has continued its representation on the Staff Committee
of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and
Financial Problems. It has continued to cooperate with other agencies
concerned with the development of the Government's foreign economic
program through the Executive Committee on Economic Foreign
Policy and its subcommittees on Foreign Investment Policy, Private
Monopolies and Cartels, and the United Nations Economic Subcommittee. The Commission is represented also on the Federal Committee
on International Statistics formed to advise and assist the United
States member of the United Nations Statistical Commission.
In furtherance of the European Recovery Program, the Commission
participated in the preparation for presentation to the Congress of
documents on the financial problems of the program through membership on the Financial Policy Subcommittee of the Correlation Committee on ERP. At the request of the Administrator for Economic
Cooperation, the Commission's Adviser on Foreign Investment prepared a statement on private United States investments in foreign
countries, and the prospects for private investment in certain ERP

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

187

countries. This statement was submitted in connection with the
hearings on H. R. 2362 (a bill to Amend the Economic Cooperation
Act of 1948) before the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of
Representatives.
The Commission has also contributed to the formulation and
implementation of the President's Point IV Program for the provision
of technical assistance to and the encouragement of private investment
in underdeveloped countries. In this connection the Adviser on
Foreign Investment has participated as a member of the working
groups on the financial aspects of the program, assisting in the drafting
of principles for the investment clauses of treaties to provide prospective United States investors with guaranties through the ExportImport Bank against risks peculiar to foreign investments.
The Commission, through the office of its Adviser on Foreign
Investment, maintains a constant surveillance of foreign exchange
regulations and capital controls of other countries, noting particularly
the effect of such regulations and controls upon United States investors
abroad. One of the purposes of this review is to be assured that
accurate disclosure of foreign exchange controls is made in registration statements and prospectuses used in connection with public
offerings of foreign securities in the United States. During the year
the Commission has had occasion to bring to the notice of the Department of State for appropriate action instances of apparent or potential
violation of the Securities Act of 1933 in the offering of foreign securities. The Commission continues to maintain surveillance of the
transactions in outstanding securities effected by foreigners in the
securities markets under the Commission's jurisdiction.
The Commission, as a member of the Board of Visitors of the
Foreign Bondholders Protective Council Inc., continued consultation
with the Department of State on problems referred to the Board by
officers of the Council. Upon the invitation of the United States
Governor of the International Bank and Monetary Fund, the Ohairman of the Commission and the Adviser on Foreign Investment took
part in the third annual meeting of these institutions held in Washington in September of 1948.
At the request of representatives of the National Advisory Council
on International Monetary and Financial Problems, the Oommission
gave consideration to legislation to afford certain conditional exemptions from the Securities Acts for obligations issued or guaranteed by
the bank. (See discussion, above, under the section dealing with the
Securities Act.)
ADVISORY AND INTERPRETATIVE

ASSISTANCE

Constant requests by attorneys, accountants, persons engaged in
specialized fields of the securities business, and members of the general
public in connection with the acts administered by the Commission
has made an interpretative and advisory service an important part
of the Commission's work. New problems arise continuously as
changes in patterns of financing and business conditions present novel
situations. When the frequency and importance of inquiries and the
proper administration of the statutes dictate, interpretations of

188

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

general application are circulated in release form and are also published
in the Federal Register.
Representatives
of new enterprises and small business ventures
constantly seek guidance and assistance under the various acts
which the Commission administers.
For the most part, these inquiries involve the applicability of exemptions from the registration
provisions of the Securities Act, including the availability of special
exemptions for small issues of securities. Many small issuers have
thus received timely advice which enables them to comply with the
applicable statute with a minimum of effort and expense.
In order to avoid violating the acts administered by the Commission, those who must comply with these acts often seek preliminary
advice from the Commission concerning the application of the statutory provisions to proposed transactions.
This preliminary advice
has frequently proved mutually helpful to the securities industry and
to the Commission, inasmuch as it tends to avoid needless effort,
expense, and delay that might otherwise be necessary to correct
what would have been defective filinga by the registrant.
Among the more frequent inquiries received are those which relate
to questions of control of an issuer by a particular person for the
purpose of determining whether registration of the issuer's stock is
required under the Securities Act to cover sales by him; whether a
particular offering is public or private; whether a company is an
investment company, and the applicability of the various sections of
the Investment Company Act to proposed transactions; questions of
the extent to which brokers, dealers, investment advisers, statistical
agencies, and others may properly disseminate information about
securities free of the prospectus requirements of sections 5 and 10 of
the Securities Act; the manner and degree to which stabilization may
be maintained with respect to the market prices of outstanding
securities while a registered offering is in progress; and to whether
the disposition of various types of interests, such as membership in a
cooperative housing project, participation in pension funds, and the
like, constitute offers of securities within the meaning of the Securities

Act.
The volume and nature of the interpretations
rendered in the
Commission's ten regional offices have followed the pattern of those
rendered by the staff at the central office. Each regional office is
advised concerning inquiries received in the central office originating
from persons located in the region covered by the respective regional
office, and each office is advised also of all interpretations involving
unique situations.
In addition, to assure uniformity of interpretations, the central office makes a complete review of interpretations
given by the regional offices.
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS,
REPORTS, OR DOCUMENTS

The Commission is empowered to grant confidential treatment,
upon application by registrants, to information contained in reports,
applications, or documents which they are required to file under the
Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public

FIFTEENTH

189

ANNUAL REPORT

Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Investment Company
Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Under the
Securities Act of 1933 the Commission has adopted rule 580, which
provides that information as to material contracts, or portions thereof,
will be held confidential by the Commission if it determines that disclosure would impair the value of the contracts and is not necessary
for the protection of investors. The other four statutes referred to,
in general empower the Commission to hold confidential under certain conditions any information contained in any reports required
to be filed under those statutes.
Disclosure of information confidentially filed under the latter statutes is made only when the Commission determines that disclosure is in the public interest.
The following table indicates the number of applications received
and acted upon during the 1949 fiscal year and the number pending
at its close:

A marked drop in the number of applications filed occurred in the
1949 fiscal year. This resulted particularly from the revision in
November 1948, of item 7-A of regulation X-14, which reduced the
amount of information about the remuneration of officers and directors called for in proxy soliciting material-information
frequently
made the subject of requests for confidential treatment.
The consequent drop in applications relating to proxy soliciting material
amounted to more than 75 percent.
Registrants may obtain a private hearing by the Commission under
rule X-24B-2 to offer arguments in support of their applications.
Out of 105 applications denied or withdrawn during the past 5 years,
there were 6 in which such hearings were requested and conducted.
In each of these cases the registrant, after the hearing, withdrew application for confidential treatment.
Registrants may also seek
judicial review of decisions made by the Commission adverse to them,
but no such petitions for such judicial review have been filed during
the past several years.
STATISTICS

AND SPECIAL

STUDIES

Saving Study

The Commission continued its series of quarterly releases on the
volume and composition of saving by individuals in the United
States. These releases show the aggregate volume of individuals'
saving; that is, the increase in their assets less the increase in their

190

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

liabilities, exclusive of gains or losses from revaluation of assets.
The figures also show the components contributing to this total,
such as changes in securities, cash, insurance, consumers' indebtedness, and consumers' durable goods.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of
all United States corporations, exclusive of banks and insurance
companies, was continued. These releases show the principal components of current assets and current liabilities and an abbreviated
analysis of the sources and uses of corporate funds. Semiannual
supplementary tables were also released showing a detailed breakdown of current assets and liabilities for various industry and size
groups of corporations registered with the Commission.
The Commission, together with the Federal Trade Commission,
continued the joint series of quarterly industrial financial reports.
These reports were developed as an extension of the working capital
series and present a complete balance sheet and abbreviated income
account for all manufacturing corporations in the United States.
In addition, data are given for various size groups of corporations
and for minor industry groups. It is planned to extend this report
to cover nonmanufacturing corporations as well.
The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce,
continued also the joint series of quarterly releases on plant and
equipment expenditures by United States business other than agriculture. Shortly after the close .)f each quarter, these releases present
industry totals on the actual capital expenditures of that quarter
and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. These data
provide a useful index of present and future activity in the capitalgoods industries and capital markets and a valuable barometer of
business activity in general.
Survey of American Listed Corporations

During the 1949 fiscal year the Commission again released for
public and Government use the annual financial, operating and statiscal data filed with the Commission by registrants reporting under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933.
These data are summarized in a series of reports known as the "Survey of American Listed Corporations" showing individual data for
each company as well as industry totals for 1,891 companies in 157
industry groups. The object of these compilations of reports has
been to make more readily available to the investor, to the general
public, and to Government bureaus and agencies some of the financial information filed with the Commission. The survey as presently
constructed covers approximately 2,000 corporations of which about
1,350 are manufacturing companies.
The results of the survey have been presented in two forms, individual industry reports and special statistical studies. The individual industry reports contain both combined and individual data for
registrants from 1934 to 1947, inclusive. A postwar study was made
of the industry classifications used in the survey reports and as a
result the industry groupings were increased to reflect finer categories.
The new groupings were first published in the 1945-46 survey series.

FIFTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

191

The most recent series of reports, Data on Profits and Operations
Including Surplus 1946-47, was completed in the current fiscal year.
This series, consisting of 7 volumes (volumes 1 to 5 cover manufacturing industry groups and volumes 6 and 7 cover nonmanufacturing
industry groups), summarized 1,891 companies in 157 industry
groups. The 1946-47 series of surveys also contains a brief analysis
of dividends plus a tabulation of reserves showing the number of
companies and the dollar amounts and types of reserves created either
by charges to income or surplus. The data included are presented
on an over-all basis, covering all registrants, and are then presented
on an individual basis for each of the registrants comprising the
group, with all figures given on a comparative basis with the preceding
year. Principal items furnished in these reports on profits and operations, including surplus, are annual data on sales; costs and/or operating expenses; operating profits; net profit before income taxes; net
profit after income taxes; depreciation, depletion, amortization, etc.;
maintenance and repairs; selling, general, and administrative expenses; earned surplus at the beginning of the period; additions to
earned surplus (including net profit after income taxes); deductions
from earned surplus (other than dividends); dividends charged to
earned surplus, and earned surplus at the end of the period. Also
included are capital surplus at the beginning of the period; capital
surplus at the end of the period; and net worth at the beginning of
each period covered. In addition each item in the profit and loss
account is shown as a percentage of net sales, and net profit before
and after income taxes as a percentage of net worth. The data presented for the manufacturing industry groups supplement previous
reports on Data on Profits and Operations beginning with the year
1936. The data for the nonmanufacturing industry groups supplement previous reports beginning with the year 1942. Surplus was
presented for the first time in the 1945-46 series.
A summary presenting a condensed profit and loss statement for
the most recent 10-year period from 1938 to 1947 was also publicly
released for all manufacturing companies and a similar summary was
released for a 5-year period from 1942 to 1946 for nonmanufacturing.
In previous years summaries were made of other important financial
items. Thus, in the 1943-44 and 1944-45 series of surveys a tabulation was made showing data on termination and renegotiation of war
contracts. In the 1944-45 series two additional analyses were made,
which resulted in a summary of charges for depreciation and amortization of emergency facilities and for war costs, losses, and expenses.
During the 1945 fiscal year the Commission also published a series of
survey releases which covered balance sheet data for the years 1939
to 1943, inclusive.
Until 1942 most reports of the survey were made available to the
public, but at present, due to budgetary limitations, it is necessary to
limit distribution to depository libraries. Copies of all reports, however, have also been made available for general use in the offices of
the Commission in Washington, D. C., and in the Commission's
regional offices. Photocopies may also be obtained of all or part of
these reports.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

InvestInent Company Data

Data for closed-end and open-end management investment companies were compiled and released to the public quarterly.
These
reports show, in tabular form, aggregate figures for the purchases and
sales in both shares and dollars of the registrants' capital stock and
of their own funded debt; portfolio changes during the period, comprising purchases, sales, and balance of change in their portfolio; and
the nature of their assets at the close of the quarter. The items included in these assets are cash and cash items, Government securities,
securities of other investment companies, other securities, other
assets, and total assets.
The data in the published tables were obtained fromquarterlyreports filed pursuant to sections 13 or 15 (d) ofthe Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 and section 30 (b) (1) of the Investment Company Act of
1940. Such reports are filed by management investment companies
registered under the latter act, except companies which issue periodic
payment plan certificates or which are sponsors or depositors of companies issuing such certificates. The reports are filed by fiscal quarters, and in most cases these correspond with calendar quarters; when
the fiscal quarter is not a calendar quarter, the data are grouped with
the calendar quarter to which the reported quarter most closely
corresponds.
Distribution of Registrants by Independent Accounting Firms

During the 1948 fiscal year a study was made of the distribution
of registrants by independent public accounting firms certifying
financial statements for 1946. The study included 2,265 registrants,
with aggregate assets of 100 billion dollars, which file annual reports
with the Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
the Securities Act of 1933. These firms' reports were certified by 416
independent public accounting firms. They were classified by aggregate assets of registrants served, showing the number of registrants,
number of industry groups, and the percentage of total number of
registrants covered. Also shown are a break-down of accounting
firms by interval, the number of firms certified to, and the aggregate
assets of these registrants.
Quarterly Sales Data

Under rule X-13A-13 companies filing annual reports on Form
10K were required to file quarterly sales data. These sales data were
compiled and released by the Commission and covered approximately
1,400 companies in 157 industry groups. The data have been released
quarterly in two forms, first in the aggregate, showing the comparable
totals for most companies, with a break-down of manufacturing, retail
trade and" all others" for the last eight calendar quarters, and second
for each individual company and for each industry group for the
current calendar quarter, the comparable quarter of the previous year
and the quarter previous to the current quarter. During 1948 under
rule X-15D-13 companies filing annual reports on Form 1MD were
also required to file quarterly sales data. As a result thereof the
coverage of the quarterly sales data has been increased to include
approximately 350 additional companies.

FIFTEENTH

Financial Highlights

Another report, Financial Highlights,' was released by the Commission for the first time during the 1949 fiscal year. The survey is
a compilation of significant operating and balance sheet items for
1,322 corporations covering the years 1948 and 1947. This summary
presents net sales, net income, current assets, current liabilities, inventories, land, buildings and equipment (net), total assets, and
capital stock and surplus (net worth) with computations of the current ratio, working capital, and return on net worth. A further
break-down of the summary total is made to show aggregates for
manufacturing, nonmanufacturing, and retail trade. The study
presents combined figures for the most current financial data available
from the financial statements submitted by registrants under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933.

The preceding 5-year period has presented unusual problems in
the administration of the personnel program. The Commission has
shared with all agencies the difficulties arising out of the war and has
had, in addition, to face the problems presented by the return of its
central office from Philadelphia. The Division of Personnel is the
staff organization responsible for the administrative aspects of the
personnel program. Its regular work embraces employment, placement, and separation; job evaluation and classification; employee
relations and services; training; operation of various committees and
boards such as the Committee of Expert Examiners (which conducts
examinations for positions peculiar to the Securities and Exchange
Commission); wage administration; the uniform efficiency rating
system; Commission regulations governing the personal securities

194

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

and commodities transactions of its employees; and processing, recording and reporting of all personnel matters. In addition the Division
is responsiblelfor3the. conduct of pre-appointment character investigations; leave administration and accounting; and the maintenance of
an emergency medical unit staffed by a registered nurse.
Additions to the responsibilities of that Division during the past
5 or 6 years have included: (a) Administration of an employee
suggestion program; (b) administrative work for the Commission's
committee of Expert Examiners; (c) administrative work in connection with the Federal Employees' Loyalty Program; (d) wage administration for duplicating shop employees under wage board procedures; (e) the extension of the uniform efficiency rating system and
the statutory job classification plan to cover virtually all employees;
and (f) preparation of more comprehensive reports required by agencies of the legislative and executive branches of government.
The staff of the Division of Personnel has gone down from 27 in
1943 to 16 as of June 30, 1949. This represents a reduction of 41
percent as compared to a reduction of 15 percent in the total staff of
the Commission during that period. This economy in operation has
been accomplished by the intensification of individual effort, the
elimination of records and procedures not absolutely required and
constant simplification of remaining functions. This reduction in
staff is particularly significant if consideration is given to the added
duties and responsibilities imposed upon the Division of Personnel
during the past 5 or 6 years.
Five years ago, the Commission's personnel was on a wartrme basis.
After the cessation of hostilities the Commission was faced with the
problem of reemploying those men and women who had served in
the armed forces. Despite the fact that total employment remained
approximately 500 employees less than during the prewar period, all
veterans seeking reemployment were restored promptly to the active
rolls. In all more than 300 veterans were reemployed. A number of
veterans, although eligible for reemployment, preferred to seek
, employment in other agencies or in private industry.
In May 1946, the President issued an Executive order authorizing
the return of Federal employment to a peacetime basis. Under this
Executive order, the Securities and Exchange Commission accorded
the opportunity to its war service professional and technical employees
to compete for permanent civil service status. At present, approximately 89 percent of the staff has permanent civil service status or
permanent tenure, the remaining 11 percent being composed primarily of recent additions to the staff in nonprofessional positions.
In January 1948 the Headquarters Office of the Commission was
removed from Philadelphia, Pa., to Washington, D. C. Although
the Commission lost very few of its professional employees (48 percent
of present executive, professional, and technical personnel have 10
or more years of service with the Commission), the move resulted in a
considerable turn-over in the clerical and stenographic brackets. The
replacement of those employees unable to move to Washington with
the Commission was accomplished with a minimum of disruption of
day-to-day work.
