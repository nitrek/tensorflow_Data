In the Matter of

ORDER APPROVING
USE OF FAIR FUND TO PAY
OUTSTANDING AND REMAINING
FEES AND EXPENSES

On May 20, 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) issued
an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-and-Desist Orders Pursuant to Sections 15(b)(4),
15(b)(6), 15B(c)(4), 17A(c)(3) and 17A(c)(4)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Sections 203(e), 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Sections 9(b)
and 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Order”) (Exchange Act Release No.
49741) against Strong Capital Management, Inc., Strong Investor Services, Inc., Strong
Investments, Inc., Richard S. Strong, Thomas A. Hooker, Jr. and Anthony J. D’Amato
(collectively, “Respondents”). The Commission found, among other things, that Richard
Strong and two hedge funds engaged in frequent trading of certain Strong mutual funds at
various times from 1998 through 2003, where such trading was neither consistent with the
funds’ prospectuses and the Strong entities’ policies nor disclosed to the funds’ board of
directors and shareholders. The Order directed Respondents to pay $140.8 million in
monetary sanctions. On March 9, 2005, the Commission issued an Order Directing

Appointment of Tax Administrator, appointing Damasco & Associates LLP as the Tax
Administrator.1 On September 29, 2005, the Commission issued an Order Creating a Fair
Fund with the vast majority of these funds for a distribution to injured investors (the “Strong
Fair Fund”). 2
On September 14, 2009, the Commission issued an Order Approving Distribution
Plan, Appointing an Administrator, and Waiving Bond (Exchange Act Release No. 60667).
The Commission subsequently issued three orders directing the disbursement of the Strong
Fair Fund.3
The Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) provides that the Respondent entities pay all fees and
costs associated with administration of the Plan. However, the Respondent entities have
undergone a complete liquidation, are no longer in business and no additional funds are
available.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A.

the Strong Fair Fund shall pay the Fund Administrator’s outstanding fees and
expenses in the amount of $105,000;

B.

at the direction of the Assistant Director of the Office of Distributions, the
Strong Fair Fund shall pay the Fund Administrator’s remaining fees and
expenses from the Strong Fair Fund for services needed prior to the termination
of the fund and discharge of the Fund Administrator;

C.

the Strong Fair Fund shall pay the Tax Administrator’s outstanding fees and
expenses to date totaling $4,425.68 from the Strong Fair Fund; and

D.

at the direction of the Assistant Director of the Office of Distributions, the
Strong Fair Fund shall pay the Tax Administrator’s remaining fees and

Exchange Act Rel. No. 51341 (Mar. 9, 2005).
Since Respondent Thomas A. Hooker, Jr. was not ordered to pay disgorgement, his civil money penalty
payment of $50,000 could not be included in the Fair Fund under the Commission’s Fair Fund authority at that
time.
