In the Matter of

ORDER FOLLOWING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

MARK A. LOPEZ
On February 24, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Thereafter, I postponed the hearing in this matter and held a telephonic
prehearing conference on March 21, 2016, at which Respondent and counsel for the Division of
Enforcement appeared.
During the conference, the parties indicated that they had discussed settlement. If the
parties reach an agreement in principle to a settlement on all major terms, they may file a joint
motion to stay the proceeding pursuant to Commission Rule of Practice 161(c)(2), 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.161(c)(2). If no such motion is filed by April 20, 2016, I will set a procedural schedule to
resolve this matter by summary disposition. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.250.
Also during the conference, I determined that although information available from the
Office of the Secretary indicates that the OIP was delivered to Respondent’s correctional
institution on February 29, Respondent was not served with the OIP until March 14, 2016.
Respondent’s answer is therefore due by April 4, 2016, if the proceeding has not been stayed or
resolved by then. See OIP at 4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(a), .220(b). If Respondent fails to timely
file an answer, he may be deemed in default and the proceeding determined against him. OIP at
4; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
