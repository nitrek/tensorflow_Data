In the Matter of
ZPR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT, INC.,
and MAX E. ZAVANELLI

ORDER DENYING MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION
On October 30, 2015, we found ZPR Investment Management, Inc. (“ZPRIM”), and its
former president and owner, Max E. Zavanelli (“Zavanelli”), liable for, among other things,
ZPRIM’s false or misleading claims of compliance with the Global Investment Performance
Standards (“GIPS”) in magazine advertisements and newsletters that failed to provide returns
information required by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. 1 Respondents seek reconsideration of
our findings that the misrepresentations in these documents were material, that they acted with
scienter, and that Zavanelli should be barred from the securities industry. 2 They assert that the
First Circuit’s decision in Flannery v. SEC, decided after our opinion, supports these arguments.3
We deny Respondents’ motion because they revisit arguments that we already rejected in our
opinion. We also explain why Flannery does not require a different result.
I.

Background

In our October 30, 2015 opinion, we found that ZPRIM falsely or misleadingly claimed
compliance with GIPS in magazine advertisements and newsletters that failed to provide the

ZPR Inv. Mgmt., Inc., Investment Advisers Act Release No. 4249 (Oct. 30, 2015),
https://www.sec.gov/litigation/opinions/2015/ia-4249.pdf (“Slip Op.”) at 3 (explaining that
ZPRIM “violated Advisers Act Sections 206(1), (2), and (4), and Advisers Act Rule 206(4)1(a)(5) through its false or misleading claims of GIPS compliance in the magazine articles and
newsletters,” that Zavanelli aided, abetted, and caused these violations, and that Zavanelli
directly violated Sections 206(1) and (2) with respect to them).

We also censured ZPRIM, imposed cease-and-desist orders, and ordered ZPRIM and
Zavanelli to pay, respectively, $250,000 and $570,000 civil money penalties.

returns information required by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines. 4 The GIPS are “universal,
voluntary standards to be used by investment managers for quantifying and presenting
investment performance that ensure fair representation, full disclosure, and apples-to-apples
comparisons.” 5 Under GIPS, if a firm chooses to advertise that it is GIPS-compliant and
includes performance data in the advertisement, it must disclose specified returns in its
advertisements.6 The version of the GIPS in place during the relevant period required such firms
to provide “(1) period-to-date composite performance results and (2) either one-, three-, and fiveyear cumulative annualized composite returns or five years of annual composite returns.” 7
We found that, although ZPRIM claimed compliance with GIPS in magazine
advertisements and newsletters that included performance information, its claims were false or
misleading because ZPRIM did not include the returns that the GIPS Advertising Guidelines
required to be disclosed in those advertisements:8
1. In late 2008 advertisements, ZPRIM disclosed only five, ten, and 20-year
cumulative and ten-year annualized returns, which all exceeded its
benchmark, rather than the year-to-date and one, three, and five-year
annualized returns (or five years of annual returns) required by the
Guidelines.9 The returns ZPRIM disclosed ranged from 14.21% (10-year
annualized) to 1187.05% (20-year compounded).10 If ZPRIM had followed
the Guidelines, it would have shown negative period-to-date returns
(from -17.02% to -18.42%) that underperformed its benchmark. 11
2. In 2011 advertisements, ZPRIM touted “28 Years of Portfolio Management
by MAX ZAVANELLI” and proclaimed that it was “THE #1 MANAGER” or
“TRIPLE #1” “FOR THE 3rd TIME.” But ZPRIM disclosed only returns
over periods that showed ZPR beating all other “TOP 10 MANAGERS,” and
failed to include other data required by the Guidelines. 12

Morningstar reports because it falsely claimed that an independent GIPS verifier had verified its
results “to the present,” after that verifier had resigned, and because ZPRIM had denied the
existence of a Commission investigation of which it had been notified. Id. at 31-35.

3. In 2009 newsletters distributed to clients and prospective clients, ZPRIM also
cherry picked favorable data, or included data intended to support a point
regarding the performance of its composites, without including the
information required by the Guidelines.13
ZPRIM never disclosed that it had failed to follow the GIPS Advertising
Guidelines and that its claims of compliance with them were false. 14
Applying the well-established materiality standard,15 we found that Respondents’
undisclosed failure to comply with the GIPS Advertising Guidelines was material for two
reasons.16 First, compliance with the Guidelines performs an important independent role: it
“ensures that, where a firm claims compliance and discloses financial results, those results are
complete, fairly presented, and comparable to those of other firms.” 17 By including a claim of
GIPS compliance in an advertisement, a firm represents that the results it discloses are consistent
with the Advertising Guidelines and benefits from this claim. Indeed, Zavanelli agreed that it
was “very important” for marketing to institutional clients to claim GIPS compliance, and he
testified that he wanted to be “measured on a GIPS basis” so that ZPRIM could have “bragging
rights” based on its performance. 18 Yet, in its violative advertisements, ZPRIM claimed these
bragging rights without complying with the Advertising Guidelines. We found this material
because “[i]n deciding whether to entrust their money to ZPRIM, potential clients would have
considered it significant that ZPRIM had not complied with the Advertising Guidelines (as it had
represented) and had not disclosed a track record of performance comparable to a firm that had
done so.”19
Second, we found that “ZPRIM’s false claim of compliance with GIPS in its 2008
magazine advertisements is also material because if ZPRIM had complied with the Advertising
Guidelines, it would have disclosed that its SCV composite was losing money and significantly

underperforming its benchmark, the Russell 2000.” 20 “A reasonable investor would have
considered the omitted performance information significant to its investment decision.” 21
We also considered Respondents’ argument that ZPRIM’s false or misleading claims of
GIPS compliance were immaterial because ZPRIM purportedly disclosed the returns information
that it omitted from its advertisements by other means, i.e., its website and information sent to
potential clients who inquired about its services. We rejected this argument for three reasons.
First, by claiming GIPS compliance in its advertisements, ZPRIM represented that they
included all the performance information required by GIPS. We concluded that “[i]nvestors
should not be required to search for additional information that a firm represents it has already
provided through its claims of GIPS compliance.” 22
Second, we rejected an underlying assumption of Respondents’ argument: that by
providing or making available by other means the returns data it omitted from its advertisements
ZPRIM introduced “corrective disclosures” into the total mix of information that cured its false
or misleading claims of GIPS compliance. 23 Instead, we found that ZPRIM “did not correct”
those claims because it never publicly acknowledged that they “were false, distributed corrected
advertisements addressing [them], or even directed recipients of its advertisement to the
information required by the Guidelines that it omitted from the advertisements.” 24 Providing the
data omitted from the advertisements through other means could not cure ZPRIM’s false or
misleading claims of GIPS compliance because it did not speak to that compliance.
Third, we explained that “[e]ven if we were inclined to consider information outside the
advertisements and found that the exact information omitted from the advertisements was
available online or otherwise, we do not believe that ZPRIM adequately drew attention to it
here.”25

argument.

On November 16, 2015, Respondents moved for reconsideration of our opinion;26 they
filed a supplemental brief arguing that Flannery supported reconsideration on January 6, 2016. 27
II.

Analysis

Reconsideration is an “extraordinary” remedy28 “designed to correct manifest errors of
law or fact or permit the presentation of newly discovered evidence.” 29 A party “may not use a
motion for reconsideration to reiterate arguments previously made or to cite authority previously
available.”30 Reconsideration motions are thus granted only in exceptional cases. 31
Respondents fail to meet this standard because they raise three principal arguments that
we already addressed and rejected in our opinion. They argue that (1) their misrepresentations
regarding GIPS compliance were not material given that the total mix of information available to
investors purportedly contained the information they omitted from their advertisements; (2) the
evidence did not support our findings that they acted with scienter; and (3) imposing an industry
bar against Zavanelli was not in the public interest. We addressed each of these arguments at
length in our opinion and found them to be without merit.32
The First Circuit decided Flannery after we issued our opinion in this case. Respondents
contend that Flannery reinforces the arguments that they made based on the disclosure of
information outside their advertisements. According to Respondents, Flannery strengthens their
argument that ZPRIM’s false claims of GIPS compliance were not material because, by

providing additional data to potential investors and on its website, ZPRIM otherwise provided or
made available the returns data that the GIPS Advertising Guidelines required it to include in its
advertisements. Because Flannery had not been decided when we issued our opinion, we write
to clarify that it provides no basis for reconsideration.
A.

Flannery has no bearing on liability under the Advisers Act.

In Flannery, the Commission found that a respondent had made a material
misrepresentation with scienter in a slide presentation that asserted that a fund typically was 55%
invested in asset-backed securities (“ABS”), although its actual exposure to ABS at the time was
around 100% of its portfolio and had exceeded 55% for several quarters. 33 The First Circuit,
however, concluded that the record supported only a “thin” showing of materiality with respect
to this “typical portfolio slide” based on a number of considerations, including that information
about the “actual percent[age] of sector investment” for the fund that showed it was 100%
invested in ABS had been made available to clients six weeks before the presentation was
made.34 The Court concluded that this “marginal” materiality showing,35 when considered in
light of other evidence in the record,36 could not support a showing of recklessness sufficient to
establish scienter, and it vacated our order finding the respondent liable and imposing
sanctions.37
Respondents argue that finding the information they omitted from their advertisements to
be material despite the availability of that information from other sources is “contrary to
Flannery.” But Flannery emphasized that it “d[id] not suggest that the mere availability of
accurate information negates an inaccurate statement”; rather, the Court limited its holding to the
33

Flannery, 2014 WL 7145625, at *19-24.

34

810 F.3d at 11. The Court also found that additional facts weighed against a finding of
materiality: the specific purpose of the meeting at which the slide was presented, that the slide at
issue was but one of 20 slides in the presentation, that it was not mentioned in a
contemporaneous report prepared by a consultant who attended the meeting, and certain expert
testimony. Id.
35

Id. at 4, 9-10.

36

The Court recited that the respondent testified that “in his experience investors did not
focus on sector breakdown when making their investment decisions and that [fund] investors did
not focus on how much of [its] investment was in ABS versus [mortgage-backed securities],” he
“did not recall ever discussing the Typical Portfolio Slide or being asked a question about the
actual sector breakdown when presenting the slide,” and “[h]e did not update the Typical
Portfolio Slide’s sector breakdowns because he did not think the typical sector breakdowns were
important to investors.” 810 F.3d at 11-12. The Court also observed that “[t]o the extent that an
investor would want to know the actual sector breakdowns, [the respondent] would bring notes
with ‘the accurate information’ so that he could answer any questions that arose.” Id. at 12.
37

Id. at 4, 12, 14. The Court also vacated our findings of liability and sanctions issued
against the other respondent in the case.

7
narrow circumstances of the case. 38 Flannery has no bearing on our conclusion that
Respondents’ misrepresentations were material for a fundamental reason: unlike in Flannery,
Respondents in this case made material misrepresentations in advertisements disseminated to the
general public, and the Advisers Act and rules thereunder prohibit such misrepresentations in
advertisements to clients or prospective clients.
Advisers Act Section 206(1) prohibits investment advisers from “directly or indirectly . . .
employ[ing] any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client.” 39
Section 206(2) includes a “broad proscription against ‘any . . . practice . . . which operates . . . as
a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client.’” 40 And Section 206(4) simply prohibits
“any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative,” 41 and
in conjunction with Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5), bars registered investment advisers from publishing,
circulating, or distributing “any advertisement . . . [w]hich contains any untrue statement of a
material fact, or which is otherwise false or misleading.” 42
We have recognized previously that Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5)
together “prohibit investment advisers from misstating material facts or omitting facts necessary
to make a prior statement non-misleading in promotional literature and other communications to
clients or prospective clients.” 43 Indeed, we adopted Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) to “foreclose[e] the use
of advertisements which have a tendency to mislead or deceive clients or prospective clients.” 44
That is exactly the type of advertisement that Respondents employed here.

Respondents’ false claims of GIPS compliance are squarely within the prohibitions of
Section 206 and Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5).45 By claiming GIPS compliance, Respondents
misrepresented to prospective clients that ZPRIM complied with the GIPS Advertising
Guidelines. As we stated in our opinion, in “deciding whether to entrust their money to ZPRIM,
potential clients would have considered it significant that ZPRIM had not complied with the
Advertising Guidelines (as it had represented) and had not disclosed a track record of
performance comparable to a firm that had done so.”46 Zavanelli conceded that GIPS
compliance was “very important” for marketing to institutional clients, and he wanted ZPRIM to
be “measured on a GIPS basis” so that it could claim “bragging rights” based on its
performance.47 Nonetheless, ZPRIM never publicly acknowledged that its claims of GIPS
compliance in its advertisements were false or otherwise corrected them. 48 Because Respondents
employed materially misleading misrepresentations about a core fact—compliance with GIPS—
in their advertisements, they employed a device or artifice to defraud prospective clients and
engaged in a practice that operated as a fraud on prospective clients. Respondents also engaged
in a fraudulent act by publishing, circulating, and distributing advertisements containing material
misstatements.
1. The information Respondents may have provided in subsequent
disclosures does not render the misstatements in the advertisements
immaterial.
Respondents argue that their misrepresentations were immaterial because they provided
the information they omitted from their advertisements “in subsequent disclosures” that they sent
to prospective clients who read those advertisements and contacted ZPRIM. Subsequent
disclosures cannot render a misstatement in an advertisement immaterial to prospective clients.
Prospective clients who do not respond to the advertisement or otherwise seek more information
are left with only the false advertisement. Providing additional information only to prospective
clients who respond to a false advertisement cannot render the initial misrepresentation in the

45

Although Rule 206(4)-1(a)(5) applies to registered investment advisers only, we found
that Zavanelli aided, abetted, and caused ZPRIM’s violations of the rule with respect to the
magazine advertisements and newsletters. Slip Op. at 36-37.

(D.D.C. 1997) (recognizing that “[c]ompliance with AIMR,” the predecessor of GIPS, “has
importance for a firm’s reputation,” and concluding that “to advertise oneself as meeting such an
important industry standard while knowingly being out of compliance is false advertising”).
47

9
advertisement itself immaterial. And we have never held that, for purposes of Section 206,49
only the persons who respond to a misleading advertisement are prospective clients. 50
We also believe that the subsequent disclosures provided to prospective clients who
responded to the advertisement did not render the misstatements therein immaterial as to those
prospective clients. When a prospective client decides whether to respond to an advertisement,
he cannot consider information he does not have, and that an adviser provides only after contact.
When a prospective client responds to a materially false advertisement, it is reasonable to believe
that the prospective client has been influenced by the misrepresentation in the advertisement.
The adviser’s false statement has succeeded because it has garnered interest, regardless of
whether the adviser later provides enough information for an astute individual to detect its
misstatement.
Accordingly, we think it appropriate to look to the content of the advertisement in
determining materiality and to exclude subsequent communications delivered only to those
individuals who respond. Respondents attempted to attract or retain clients through false
advertising; they cannot avoid liability on the basis that they later provided only to the very
customers who they attracted through their misstatements the information that they failed to
disclose in their advertisements. We therefore reject Respondents’ argument that the
misrepresentations in the advertisements were immaterial, even accepting their premise that,

49

Advisers Act Sections 206(1) and (2) prohibit certain conduct by investment advisers
with respect to “any client or prospective client.” See 15 U.S.C. § 80b-6(1) (prohibiting
“employ[ing] any device, scheme, or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client”); 15
U.S.C. § 80b-6(2) (prohibiting “engag[ing] in any transaction, practice, or course of business
which operates as a fraud or deceit upon any client or prospective client”); cf. 15 U.S.C. § 80b6(4) (prohibiting “any act, practice, or course of business which is fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative” without requiring nexus to “any client or prospective client”); 17 C.F.R.
§ 275.206(4)-1(a)(5) (prohibiting investment advisers from “publish[ing], circulat[ing], or
distribut[ing]” certain advertisements without reference to clients or prospective clients).

10
“each and every prospective client of ZPRIM was given full and fair disclosure of all required
performance results of the firm before they decided to select ZPRIM as their adviser.”51
Respondents’ argument also fails for an additional reason: their assertion that all relevant
information was provided “immediately” to clients who responded has scant support in the
record. Our opinion recognized that prospective clients did not receive a GIPS-compliant
presentation until they received contracts to retain ZPRIM and that it “would have been
important to potential investors to receive the information at issue to be able to compare
performance numbers before they reached this advanced stage.” 52 Respondents assert that
ZPRIM sent out a package containing the missing performance returns to prospective clients
who contacted its marketing agent for more information, well before sending them a contract
with the formal GIPS-compliant presentation we referenced in our opinion. The record does not
substantiate these assertions.
Respondents rely on a single email dated August 12, 2008, that ZPRIM sent an individual
who contacted its marketing agent. The email predates the advertisements at issue, and the
person who sent it did not testify at the hearing. ZPRIM’s marketing agent testified that he
believed ZPRIM sent out various materials but he did not describe them with specificity, and he
initially testified that he did not know what ZPRIM sent prospective clients. And for his part,
Zavanelli testified that ZPRIM sent out “many different packages” and agreed that “the materials
that were sent changed over time” and that he did not know what materials were actually sent to
potential clients because he was not copied on each mailing. ZPRIM also changed its
advertisements over time to remove information required by the GIPS Advertising Guidelines.
We cannot infer from one email that ZPRIM consistently provided all information that it omitted
from its advertisements.
Respondents believe that so long as a prospective client eventually gets all relevant
information before making an ultimate investment decision there can be no material
misrepresentation and no violation. While this might defeat reliance or harm in a private
securities fraud action, it is not a bar to liability in a Commission enforcement proceeding under
the Advisers Act. 53 Liability under Advisers Act Section 206 does not require that the fraudulent
conduct occur in connection with the offer, purchase, or sale of securities. 54 To the contrary,
51

Respondents do not explain, or cite to anything in the record to demonstrate, how they
can be sure that no prospective clients decided to select ZPRIM on the basis of its false
advertisements.

terms of the effect or potential effect of prohibited conduct on the client”).

11
Section 206 includes within its scope misrepresentations that are not specific to a client
investment decision.55
2. The information Respondents may have provided on their website does
not render the misstatements in their advertisements immaterial.
Respondents also argue that their misrepresentations were immaterial because the
advertisements “disclosed the firm’s website which . . . contained all of the information required
by the” Advertising Guidelines. In our opinion, we noted that “ZPRIM did not mention that its
website contained financial information that it had omitted from its magazine advertisements.” 56
And, as discussed below, the mere availability of accurate information is insufficient to render
false information that an investment adviser provides to clients or potential clients immaterial.
“Investment advisers are fiduciaries whose actions must be governed by the highest
standards of conduct.” 57 Respondents present a materiality argument that is inimical to their
fiduciary obligations. They assert that an investment adviser may solicit clients on the basis of
false or misleading representations so long as the adviser makes available information sufficient
for a prospective client to detect the adviser’s misrepresentation elsewhere. We disagree.
On this point, the opinion in SEC v. Bolla is instructive.58 That case involved an
investment adviser firm (WIN) with two principals (Bolla and Radano). After Bolla was barred
from association with any investment adviser, Radano and WIN failed to disclose the bar to
clients or made misleading statements regarding Bolla’s status. Radano argued that these
statements and omissions were not material because when he spoke with one client, she was

already aware of the bar. The court rejected this argument because the standards applicable to
investment advisers require more than just the availability of the truth through other means:
Given the fiduciary duties owed by an investment adviser to his clients and the
necessary foundation of truth and ethical action underlying the relationship, to
take up Defendants’ suggestion and allow an investment adviser to freely lie or
omit information to his clients—as long as they know that he cannot be trusted—
is to court the absurd and undermine the basis of Section 206. 59
Unlike in Bolla, Respondents do not assert that the readers of their advertisements were
already aware that ZPRIM’s claims of GIPS compliance were false or misleading when they read
them. Rather, Respondents argue that their advertisements disclosed the firm’s website and the
website contained the omitted information represented to be in their advertisements. The same
rationale that caused the court to reject the materiality argument in Bolla supports rejecting
Respondents’ argument here: the fiduciary duty owed by an investment adviser does not
countenance the adviser making a misrepresentation in an advertisement to attract clients even
where the prospective client might be able to discern that the statement was false through
information available elsewhere.
Moreover, Respondents’ argument is weaker than the argument the court rejected in
Bolla. In Bolla, the defendants relied on a client’s actual knowledge of a bar, but here
Respondents point to disclosures on its website that merely could have alerted potential clients to
the truth. As we said in our opinion, “ZPRIM did not sufficiently bring to investors’ attention
the information it contends cures its misrepresentations.” 60 Rather, “ZPRIM generically
referenced its website in its advertisements but did not specify what information was available on
the website or otherwise direct investors to it for specific information.” 61 “Put another way, the
law does not put the onus on investors to seek out disclosures; it puts the obligation to provide
disclosures on people who solicit and manage investors’ money.” 62

Flannery is distinguishable on its facts.

In addition to having no bearing on liability under the Advisers Act, Flannery is
distinguishable on its facts. We reject Respondents’ assertion that they are in “the exact situation
addressed by Flannery.” Flannery addressed a slide that disclosed “typical” holdings. The court
concluded that “when a slide is labeled ‘typical,’ and where a reasonable investor would not rely
on one slide but instead would conduct due diligence when making an investment decision, the
availability of actual and accurate information is relevant.”63 Here, ZPRIM’s misrepresentations
in its advertisements concerned the actual performance returns. By claiming compliance with
GIPS, ZPRIM represented that it had provided in its advertisements all the actual performance
information required by the Guidelines, although it had not. Investors “should not be required to
search for additional information that a firm represents it has already provided through its claims
of GIPS compliance.” 64
We also reject Respondents’ assertion that Flannery supports finding their
misrepresentations to be immaterial in light of “the absence of any existing or prospective
ZPRIM clients called by the Division to testify” about materiality. Although the Flannery court
found that the absence of investor testimony supported its conclusions regarding the materiality
(or lack thereof) of the representations, Flannery did not establish a requirement that investor
testimony must be used to establish materiality. 65 Rather, it concluded that the evidence as a
whole indicated that there were either no material misrepresentations or that the evidence of
materiality was thin. Here, testimony established that “ZPRIM decided to become GIPScompliant so it could compete for institutional clients,” that “many institutional investors will not
consider investment advisers unless they provide GIPS-compliant returns,” and that Zavanelli
himself agreed that GIPS compliance was “very important” for marketing to institutional
clients.66 Indeed, before ZPRIM finalized its late 2008 advertisements, Zavanelli “specifically
instructed” that the advertisements “retain the footnote claiming GIPS compliance.”67 Investors
did not need to testify as to the misrepresentations’ materiality in light of this other evidence.
Finally, we reject Respondents’ assertion that “the Flannery court would also find that
there was a lack of substantial evidence that” they acted recklessly. Flannery held that the “thin
materiality showing” could not support finding reckless conduct. In contrast, the evidence of
materiality in this case is substantial: “By failing to provide the returns required by the
Guidelines, Respondents denied potential clients information necessary to make informed

investment decisions, while representing that ZPRIM offered the benefits of GIPS
compliance.” 68 And the evidence in this case also demonstrated that Respondents acted not
simply recklessly but also “intentionally” and “knowingly” in falsely claiming compliance with
GIPS.69 Flannery provides no basis for us to reconsider either the findings that Respondents’
misrepresentations were material or that they acted with scienter.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that ZPR Investment Management, Inc., and Max E.
Zavanelli’s motion for reconsideration is denied.
