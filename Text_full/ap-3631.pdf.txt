In the Matter of
ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

SHREYANS DESAI

On January 5, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section
203(f) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Desai was served with the OIP on January 11,
2016, at Federal Medical Center Devens in Ayer, Massachusetts. Shreyans Desai, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3603, 2016 SEC LEXIS 529 (ALJ Feb. 11, 2016).
The OIP alleges that the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey in
SEC v. Desai, 2:11-cv-05597
(1) entered a default judgment on October 3, 2012, against Shreysiddh Capital LLC
(SSC), a company Desai founded and of which he was President and CEO, and
ordered SSC to disgorge $116,858.29, plus prejudgment interest of $13,865.33; and
(2) entered a final judgment on November 30, 2015, against Desai enjoining him from
future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933; Sections 10(b) and
15(a) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, and Sections 206(1) and
206(2) of the Advisers Act.
The OIP alleges further that Desai pled guilty to two counts of wire fraud in United States
v. Desai, 2:12-cr-05597 (D.N.J.) and on December 5, 2014, he was sentenced to a 15-month
prison term followed by three years of supervised release and ordered to pay restitution in the
amount of $121,260.
On February 3, 2016, Desai, appearing pro se, moved to postpone the hearing for 90 to
180 days, representing that he: (1) does not have access to evidence; (2) has only limited access
to witnesses and experts; (3) is still in proceedings with respect to the criminal proceeding; and

1

(4) needs additional time to review the “SEC’s new admittance that there is only one victim in
the alleged fraud conspiracy.”
On February 10, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed the Declaration of Christina M.
McGill with exhibits A-D. The Division opposes Desai’s request for a postponement. It
represents that it has made repeated calls and sent several letters to Desai, which he has not
answered. The Division requests that I order Desai to file an answer, and states that once the
answer is filed, it will request leave to file a motion for summary disposition.
Desai participated in a telephonic prehearing conference held on February 18, 2016. At
the prehearing conference, Desai represented that: (1) he has no records from his civil or criminal
proceedings and cannot access the investigative file on a disk; and (2) he is to be released to a
halfway house on March 17 and from federal custody on April 30, 2016. I RULED that I would
consider Desai’s February 3 petition, as his answer, and I ORDERED Desai to make a filing by
April 10, 2016, stating whether he had obtained legal counsel and describing the evidence he
would present if I ordered the in-person hearing that he has requested. The Division will request
that Desai receive a bar to the full extent allowed by Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and
Section 203(f) of the Advisers Act.
I explained to Desai that the case law allows this administrative proceeding to continue
despite appeals in underlying district court actions and he would not be allowed to contest those
findings in this proceeding. I erred in saying that this proceeding was based only on the final
judgment in the underlying civil action. The OIP alleges two civil judgments, one against SSC
and one against Desai, and one criminal action. There is significant case law that a motion for
summary disposition is appropriate in this “follow-on” proceeding where the Division can show
that the alleged underlying court rulings do, in fact, exist. See, e.g., Jeffrey L. Gibson, Exchange
Act Release No. 57266, 2008 SEC LEXIS 236, at *19-20 & nn.21-24 (Feb. 4, 2008). However,
given that Respondent is pro se and currently incarcerated, I am allowing Respondent ample
time to review his files and discuss with an attorney to give him a full opportunity to present
evidence that a permanent bar against him would not be in the public interest.
I will issue an order on how we will move the proceeding to resolution after I receive the
filing from Desai due by April 10, 2016.
