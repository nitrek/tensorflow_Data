ORDER STAYING
PROCEEDING AS TO
LUIGI AGOSTINI

On January 12, 2016, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit entered a
stay of this proceeding as to Respondent Luigi Agostini. See Agostini v. SEC, No. 15-4114 (2d
Cir., appeal filed Dec. 22, 2015). As such, this proceeding is STAYED as to Agostini.
My January 8 order remains in effect as to Respondent Edward M. Daspin, and the inperson hearing scheduled for February 11 to address certain issues unique to Daspin shall move
forward as scheduled. See Edward M. Daspin, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3481, 2016
SEC LEXIS 72. At the conclusion of the February 11 hearing, I will entertain discussions
concerning whether to stay the proceeding as to Daspin.
