In the Matter of

ORDER APPOINTING A FUND
ADMINISTRATOR AND APPROVING
FUND ADMINISTRATOR BOND

On May 1, 2012, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Sections 15(b) and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and
Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order against UBS Financial Services
Inc. of Puerto Rico (“UBS PR”). Exchange Act Release No. 66893 (May 1, 2012). The
Commission ordered the creation of a Fair Fund for a distribution pursuant to Section 308(a) of
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, and also ordered that UBS PR pay disgorgement
of $11,500,000.00, prejudgment interest of $1,109,739.94, and a civil money penalty of
$14,000,000.00 for a total payment of $26,609,739.94 (“Fair Fund”).
The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) now seeks the appointment of A.B. Data
Ltd. (“A.B. Data”) as the fund administrator and the approval of a fund administrator bond in
the amount of $26,609,739.94 that is equal to amount of the Fair Fund. Division staff formed a
committee to recommend an appointment of a fund administrator and solicited proposals from
candidates, reviewed and evaluated each candidate’s proposal and determined that A.B. Data’s
proposal provided the best value to the Fair Fund for the planned distribution.

Accordingly, pursuant to Rules 1105(a) and 1105(c) of the Commission’s Rules on
Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that
A.B. Data is appointed as the fund administrator, and A.B. Data shall obtain a bond in the
manner prescribed in Rule 1105(c) in the approved amount of $26,609,739.94.
By the Commission.
