COMPLAINT
Plaintiff, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
“Commission”), brings this action against Daniel C. Ustian (“Ustian” or the
“Defendant”) and alleges for its complaint against him as follows:

SUMMARY OF ALLEGATIONS
1.

From late 2010 through 2012, Defendant Ustian, the then-President and

Chief Executive Officer of Navistar International Corporation (“Navistar”) led a
campaign of deception. The deception was manifested in Ustian’s and Navistar’s
fraudulent statements to the public about Navistar’s ability to meet the Environmental
Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) deadline to comply with rigorous emission standards for
heavy-duty diesel truck engines.
2.

These emission standards were not news to Navistar, a publicly-traded

truck, bus and diesel engine manufacturer headquartered in Lisle, Illinois. The EPA had
issued the standards in 2001 to ultimately limit the discharge of nitrogen oxide or “NOx”

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 2 of 57 PageID #:2

emissions from on-road heavy-duty truck engines to 0.20 grams per brake horsepower
hour (the “0.20 NOx standard”). The EPA, recognizing that the new standards would
require reconfigured engines, delayed compliance with the 0.20 NOx standard until 2010,
and allowed engine manufacturers to gradually step down NOx emissions levels over the
intervening years.
3.

Under Ustian’s direction, Navistar sought to meet this challenge by

developing engines that utilized only “exhaust gas recirculation” or “EGR” technology.
EGR-only technology reduced NOx emissions by capturing a portion of exhaust gas,
which it cooled and blended with fresh air before returning the gas back into the engine’s
cylinder.
4.

Within the company and publicly, Ustian trumpeted EGR-only technology

as important to Navistar’s financial success while relentlessly criticizing the alternative
technology adopted by Navistar’s competitors. And he put Navistar’s money and
resources where his mouth was. Under his watch, Navistar staked $700 million and tens
of thousands of hours of its engineers’ time on EGR-only technology.
5.

By 2010 when the 0.20 NOx standard went into effect, Navistar had not

certified an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard. However, Navistar was able to
continue selling engines by using emission credits that Navistar had banked from its
previous sales of earlier generations of engines.
6.

But as its limited stockpile of credits began to dwindle in 2011 and 2012,

Navistar was encountering significant engineering roadblocks in receiving EPA
certification of an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard without compromising fuel
economy and performance.

2

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 3 of 57 PageID #:3

7.

Given how critical EGR-only technology was to Navistar’s long-term

success, and Ustian’s professional reputation, Ustian needed more time to continue
development of a commercially viable 0.20 NOx EGR-only engine. If the truth about the
increasingly difficult development and EPA certification process came to light, serious
consequences were likely to follow. Navistar’s customers could defect, its stock price
could suffer, and it could be forced to abandon EGR-only technology altogether.
8.

Rather than tell the public the truth and face these consequences, Ustian

engaged in a progressively desperate and fraudulent scheme to deceive the investing
public into believing that EPA certification of a competitive EGR-only engine that met
the 0.20 NOx standard was right around the corner. The deception was manifested in
Ustian’s and Navistar’s statements in conference calls with analysts, in press releases,
and in reports filed with the SEC.
9.

With Ustian’s knowledge, during 2011 and 2012 Navistar submitted three

applications to the EPA for certification of a heavy-duty diesel EGR-only engine at the
0.20 NOx standard. Unknown to the investing public, the first such application included
an engine that Ustian knew Navistar could never sell — even if it were certified by the
EPA. Ustian and Navistar filed this application anyhow to deceive the public about
Navistar’s progress in developing a certifiable and commercially competitive EGR-only
engine that met the 0.20 NOx standard.
10.

Once it became clear that the EPA would not approve this first

application, Navistar followed up with two additional applications in 2012. As Ustian
and Navistar knew, the EPA quickly made clear that these applications were also
deficient and unlikely to receive approval without significant modifications.

3

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 4 of 57 PageID #:4

11.

As was well known to Ustian and Navistar, Navistar’s engineers were

having difficulty developing and certifying an EGR-only engine that could meet the 0.20
NOx standard without sacrificing fuel economy and other performance features,
discussions with the EPA were at an impasse, and Navistar’s applications were going
nowhere.
12.

Nonetheless, from 2010 through 2012, instead of coming clean with the

public regarding the difficulties Navistar was experiencing in developing and certifying a
competitive EGR-only engine, Ustian engaged in a coverup. During this period, Ustian
and Navistar made false and misleading public statements that led investors to believe
that Navistar’s efforts to produce a commercially competitive EGR-only engine meeting
the 0.20 NOx standard were proceeding without major engineering or EPA roadblocks.
13.

By mid-2012, the costs and difficulties of development and certification of

the 0.20 NOx EGR-only engine became too great, Navistar’s stockpile of emissions
credits was running out, and the truth could no longer be suppressed. In July 2012,
Navistar announced it was abandoning its EGR-only technology and adopting the
alternative technology used by Navistar’s competitors. Navistar’s stock price
plummeted, and shortly thereafter its Board of Directors sought and secured Ustian’s
resignation.
14.

Through the activities alleged in this Complaint, Ustian, directly or

indirectly, has engaged in transactions, acts, practices or courses of business which
constitute violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15
U.S.C. § 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange

4

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 5 of 57 PageID #:5

Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 [17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5] promulgated
thereunder.
15.

Ustian also, directly or indirectly, has engaged in transactions, acts,

practices, and courses of business which constitute violations of Rule 13a-14 of the
Exchange Act [17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-14].
16.

Additionally, Navistar directly or indirectly, has engaged in primary

violations of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act and Rules 10b-5, 12b-20,
13a-1, 13a-11 and 13a-13 promulgated thereunder, and Ustian aided and abetted and was
a control person for Navistar’s violations of these provisions.
17.

Additionally, Navistar, directly or indirectly, has engaged in primary

violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, and Ustian aided and abetted Navistar’s
violations of these provisions.
18.

The SEC brings this action to restrain and enjoin such transactions, acts,

practices and courses of business pursuant to Sections 21(d) and 20(e) of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d) and § 78t(e)] and Section 20(b) of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C.
§ 77t(b)].
19.

The SEC seeks permanent injunctive relief against Ustian to enjoin him

from future violations of the federal securities laws, the imposition of disgorgement, with
prejudgment interest, civil penalties against Ustian, and an officer and director bar
against him.

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 7 of 57 PageID #:7

THE DEFENDANT
24.

Daniel C. Ustian, age 65, was Navistar’s President and CEO from 2003

through August 2012; Chairman of the Board of Directors from 2004 through August
2012; and a director from 2002 through August 2012. Ustian also was the President of
Navistar’s Engine Group from 1999 through 2002 and Group Vice President and General
Manager of the Engine & Foundry Group of Navistar from 1993 through 1999.
RELATED PARTY
25.

Navistar International Corporation is a Delaware corporation that

maintains its principal executive offices in Lisle, Illinois. Navistar is an international
manufacturer of commercial and military trucks, buses and diesel engines and a provider
of service parts for trucks and trailers. The Company’s stock is listed on the New York
Stock Exchange under the ticker symbol “NAV.”
FACTS
I.

Navistar Develops an “EGR-Only” Technology Different from Its
Competitors’ Technologies
26.

In 2001, pursuant to the Clean Air Act, the EPA enacted a rule requiring

new heavy-duty diesel engines to meet the 0.20 NOx standard by 2010. NOx is a
pollutant and reacts in the atmosphere to create smog and acid rain. By delaying the
effective date of the rule requiring emissions at the 0.20 NOx standard until 2010, the
EPA gave the industry nine years to innovate the necessary new technologies.
27.

To comply with the 0.20 NOx standard, Navistar and Ustian chose to rely

on EGR-only technology, which recirculates exhaust into the engine’s cylinders before
release, to reduce NOx emissions. This approach also was referred to as “in-cylinder”
technology.

7

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 8 of 57 PageID #:8

28.

All of Navistar’s major competitors adopted an alternative technology

known as selective catalytic reduction (“SCR”), which involves chemically treating
exhaust before its release.
29.

From 2001 through 2012, Navistar devoted tens of thousands of employee

hours and approximately $700 million to the development of its EGR-only technology.
As Navistar disclosed in its fiscal year 2010 annual report filed on Form 10-K,
“[f]ocusing on engine research and development in order to have a competitive advantage
using Exhaust Gas Recirculation (‘EGR’) and other technologies for compliance with
2010 emissions standards” was a key part of its long-term strategy.
30.

Navistar’s decision to rely on EGR-only technology was a high-stakes bet

for the company and Ustian. Although EGR-only technology offered the possibility of
significant advantages over SCR technology, successful commercial implementation of
EGR-only technology posed significant engineering challenges.
31.

Nonetheless, at Ustian’s direction, Navistar did not prepare a back-up plan

in case it was ultimately unsuccessful in using EGR-only technology to meet EPA
emissions standards. As Ustian stated at a September 15, 2009 conference attended by,
among others, securities analysts, “Plan B is we’re going to make Plan A work.”
32.

To make that plan work, Navistar needed EPA approval of its EGR-only

engines. A manufacturer of heavy-duty diesel engines in the United States, such as
Navistar, must obtain a certificate of conformity (“Certificate”) from the EPA each year
for each model of engine family that it sells.
33.

Using SCR technology, Navistar’s competitors had obtained Certificates

from the EPA by 2010 indicating that the engines they manufactured met the 0.20 NOx

8

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 9 of 57 PageID #:9

standard. By 2010, Navistar had not even submitted an application for certification of a
heavy-duty diesel engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
34.

Navistar’s ability to develop and certify a commercially competitive

engine at the 0.20 NOx standard was important to Navistar’s customers and to Navistar’s
investors.
35.

Ustian was actively involved in Navistar’s efforts to develop and obtain

certification of an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard, including picking the
engineering team to work on the engine development, receiving updates from the
engineers and certification team on the engine’s development status and certification
status with the EPA, helping the team solve problems, and motivating the team. From
2010 through 2012, Ustian regularly received updates from the engineering team, the
certification team and Navistar executives regarding both the status of development work
on Navistar’s EGR-only technology and Navistar’s communications with the EPA about
its applications for certification of an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
II.

Navistar Relies on Emissions Credits to Sell Engines While It Attempts to
Obtain EPA Certification
36.

Prior to 2010, Navistar had produced engines with emissions that were

cleaner than required by the EPA. This allowed Navistar to generate a “bank” of
emissions credits. Under the EPA’s emissions credits system, Navistar could use these
emissions credits to sell engines at levels higher than the 0.20 NOx standard and, in turn,
gained more time to develop and certify an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
37.

Because Navistar did not have a Certificate for a 0.20 NOx engine when

the 0.20 NOx standard went into effect on January 1, 2010, Navistar continued to sell its

9

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 10 of 57 PageID #:10

engines certified at a NOx level higher than 0.20 NOx and used emissions credits to
offset the difference in NOx.
38.

Once the 0.20 NOx standard went into effect, however, Navistar could no

longer generate additional emissions credits on engines with emissions higher than 0.20
NOx. Thus, its bank of emissions credits was limited.
39.

Navistar planned to seek EPA certification of its 13-liter EGR-only engine

at the 0.20 NOx standard first. Once it obtained a Certificate for its 13-liter EGR-only
engine, Navistar then planned to apply that same technology to seek certification of its
other engines at the 0.20 NOx standard, including its 11-liter and 15-liter engines. The
company planned to focus on certifying its 11-liter, 13-liter and 15-liter engines, known
at Navistar as the “big bore” engines, before moving onto other engine families because
it expected its emissions credits for the big bore engines to run out first.
40.

While using its limited emissions credits, Navistar continued to try to

develop its EGR-only technology and obtain a Certificate for an engine at the 0.20 NOx
standard. Navistar’s goal was to develop an EGR-only engine that emitted 0.20 NOx or
less and offered improved fuel economy, acceleration and power compared to the 0.50
NOx EGR-only engines Navistar was currently selling using emissions credits. As of
late 2010, Navistar engineers and executives had informed Ustian that this 0.20 NOx
EGR-only engine with competitive performance features was not predicted to be ready
for production until at least the end of 2012.

III.

Navistar’s 2010 Registration Statement and Ustian’s 2011 Stock Sale
41.

From 2010 through 2012, Navistar common stock was registered and

traded on the New York Stock Exchange.
42.

Navistar filed a registration statement on April 23, 2010 to register shares

of common stock under its equity compensation plan. Form S-8 registration statements
incorporate by reference certain prior filings and all subsequently filed periodic reports
until the company files a post-effective amendment terminating the offering, which
Navistar never did. Navistar’s offering pursuant to this registration statement was
ongoing through the end of 2012.
43.

Pursuant to this registration statement, Navistar issued stock-based

compensation to Ustian and its other executives, directors, and non-executive officers
between late 2010 and the summer of 2012. Ustian sold Navistar stock on April 5, 2011.
IV.

Ustian and Navistar Make Fraudulent Statements and Engage in Other
Deceptive Conduct
44.

Beginning in late 2010, as investors, analysts, Navistar’s customers and

Navistar’s competitors questioned whether Navistar could ever develop and certify a
commercially competitive EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard, Ustian and
Navistar engaged in a fraudulent scheme to conceal from the public the significant
challenges Navistar was facing in developing and certifying a commercially competitive
EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard before its emissions credits ran out. Through
his misstatements, Ustian repeatedly tried to reassure the public that Navistar’s EGR-only
engines could meet the 0.20 NOx standard while offering competitive performance
features, and that certification would occur before Navistar was at risk of running out of
emissions credits. Ustian’s and Navistar’s fraudulent scheme was intended to hide from

11

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 12 of 57 PageID #:12

the public the serious issues Navistar was encountering in developing and certifying its
EGR-only engines. This fraudulent scheme included the following:
A.

November 2010 Press Release

45.

On November 3, 2010, Navistar issued a press release regarding a facility

tour for media and securities analysts at the company’s Huntsville, Alabama engine plant
(the “November 2010 Press Release”).
46.

Ustian reviewed, approved, and provided a quote for the November 2010

Press Release.
47.

The November 2010 Press Release stated in pertinent part:

Navistar also advised that it has submitted certification to the EPA for its
MaxxForce 15 and plans to submit for EPA certification of its MaxxForce
13 at 0.2g NOx in the next few months, far ahead of when high volume
production of the 0.2g NOx-certified MaxxForce 13 would be required.
48.

The “MaxxForce 15” that Navistar and Ustian referred to in the press

release was a 15-liter engine that Navistar was submitting for certification above 0.20
NOx. Navistar had developed this engine to the point that it had competitive fuel
economy and other performance features compared to other 15-liter engines being sold in
the marketplace. Because the MaxxForce 15 engine was competitive with other 15-liter
engines in the marketplace, Navistar and Ustian intended to, and ultimately did, sell this
engine upon certification from the EPA.
49.

The “MaxxForce 13 at 0.2g NOx” that Navistar referred to in the press

release was a 13-liter engine that Navistar still was developing for certification at the
0.20 NOx standard using EGR-only technology.
50.

This 13-liter engine lacked competitive fuel economy and other

performance features compared to other 13-liter engines being sold in the marketplace.

12

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 13 of 57 PageID #:13

51.

Because the MaxxForce 13 lacked performance features competitive with

other 13-liter engines, Ustian knew that even if the EPA issued a Certificate for the
engine, Navistar could not sell the engine in the marketplace.
52.

In the context of a discussion otherwise devoted to engines being sold, or

intended to be sold, in the marketplace, the November 2010 Press Release referenced a
certification application for a 13-liter engine at the 0.20 NOx standard. In fact, Navistar
and Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that unlike the other engine referenced in the press
release, Navistar could not produce and sell that 13-liter engine in the marketplace even
if the EPA issued a Certificate for it because Navistar had not yet developed its EGRonly technology to the point that in the next few months it could obtain certification at
the 0.20 NOx standard while also offering competitive performance features.
B.

December 2010 Analyst Conference Call

53.

On December 22, 2010, Ustian and other Navistar executives conducted a

conference call with securities analysts (the “December 2010 Analyst Call”) in
conjunction with Navistar’s filing of its fiscal year 2010 annual report on Form 10-K.
54.

It was Navistar’s general practice to conduct conference calls with

securities analysts in conjunction with Navistar’s filing of its quarterly and annual reports
with the SEC. As a general matter, the securities analysts participating in these calls
periodically made recommendations to clients and others about whether to buy or sell
Navistar stock. Further, although Navistar directed the contents of these calls towards
securities analysts, Navistar permitted the investing public to listen to the calls by dialing
the number that Navistar published for the calls.

13

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 14 of 57 PageID #:14

55.

During the December 2010 Analyst Call, a securities analyst asked in

pertinent part: “[O]n the 13 liter in terms of certifying that at 0.2, what kind of timeline
do you think we are looking at there?” Ustian responded in pertinent part:
[W]e will submit that over the next couple of months I believe. . . . [W]e
would be able to show you the data that it meets 0.2 and show you how we
are able to meet it. But as far as the customers, he is not going to know the
difference. Nothing looks any different.
Later during the call, another securities analyst asked Ustian in pertinent part: “Dan, can
you talk about the fuel efficiency of your 13-liter 0.2 NOx versus an equivalent SCR 0.2
NOx engine? Do you anticipate running those comparisons?” Ustian responded in
pertinent part:
The fuel economy of the 0.2 will be better and there will be no change in
heat rejection at the same time. So this product will be even better.
When the analyst followed up with a question about whether this engine would be “better
than an equivalent SCR 0.2 NOx,” Ustian responded:
Well, our strategy has been we will be equal to any SCR – the best of any
SCR product that is out there. So we are assuming the SCR product gets a
little better too, and that is what we are going to be able to do with getting
to 0.2.
56.

Ustian deceived investors through his statements that the EGR-only

engine that Navistar planned to submit to the EPA in the next few months offered better
fuel economy and performance features than either Navistar’s current 0.50 NOx engines
or its competitors’ SCR engines. Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that as of the time he
made these statements on December 22, 2010, Navistar’s 13-liter engine was not yet
capable of limiting emissions to 0.20 NOx while also offering “better” fuel economy and
other performance features than Navistar’s competitors’ SCR engines or even fuel
economy and other performance features equal to Navistar’s existing 0.50 NOx engines

14

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 15 of 57 PageID #:15

such that the customer would not “know the difference.” Ustian also knew, but did not
disclose, that Navistar would not be able to offer these advancements in fuel economy
and performance in “the next couple of months” and thus would not be able to submit a
certification application to the EPA in the next couple of months for a 13-liter 0.20 NOx
EGR-only engine with competitive performance features that could be produced and sold
in the marketplace.
C.

2011 Certification Application

57.

On February 21, 2011, Navistar submitted an application to the EPA for

certification of a 13-liter engine at the 0.20 NOx standard using Navistar’s EGR-only
technology (the “2011 Application”). Ustian was aware of Navistar’s 2011 Application
to the EPA and was regularly updated on the development and certification work for the
2011 Application both before and after it was submitted to the EPA. Internally at
Navistar, this application was associated with Ustian and was referred to at Navistar as
“D-cert,” for “Dan-certification.”
58.

At the time the 2011 Application was submitted to the EPA, Ustian knew

that the 13-liter engine described in the 2011 Application could not be sold in the
marketplace even if the EPA issued a Certificate for it. Ustian knew that this engine
required further development work to attain the fuel economy and performance features
necessary to make it a usable, competitive engine when installed in a truck and to make it
an engine Navistar could sell.
59.

It was unusual, if not unprecedented, for Navistar to submit a certification

application to the EPA knowing that the engine that was the subject of the application
could not be sold in the marketplace even if a Certificate were granted.

15

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 16 of 57 PageID #:16

60.

In fact, at the time the 2011 Application was submitted to the EPA, the

engine described in the application could run only in the testing laboratory. In a
February 9, 2011 email regarding the engine covered by the 2011 Application, a Navistar
Senior Technical Specialist working on certification matters told other engineers in the
certification group:
I asked a bigger question. Would this engine ever be drivable in a truck
and I got laughs in response. . . . Translation you have a[n] underpowered
13 liter engine that is coughing, sputtering and wheezing like some
terminal cancer patient on a respirator.
61.

At the time the 2011 Application was submitted to the EPA, Ustian also

knew that the Application was incomplete and that the EPA told Navistar it would not
issue a Certificate without Navistar providing additional test results. In the months
before the 2011 Application was submitted to the EPA, the EPA told Navistar it would
not accept Navistar’s use of test results from its current 0.50 NOx engine to satisfy
durability testing requirements, known as Deterioration Factor testing, for its proposed
0.20 NOx engine because significant differences existed between the two engines.
62.

Despite the EPA expressly stating that it would not accept Navistar’s use

of its 0.50 NOx engine Deterioration Factor test results in its 2011 Application, Navistar
submitted the 2011 Application without conducting new Deterioration Factor testing. As
Navistar’s Chief Certification Engineer stated in a February 21, 2011 email that was
forwarded to Ustian the same day that the 2011 Application was submitted to the EPA,
“Durability data and results from the current [0.50 NOx] engine were used in the
submittal despite EPA disallowing that version of durability demonstration.”
63.

Ustian knew that the D-cert engine described in the 2011 Application

lacked performance features to be a competitive, usable engine in a truck and that the

16

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 17 of 57 PageID #:17

engine could not be put into production even if certified. For example, Navistar’s
Director of Advanced Technology told Navistar executives in a March 1, 2011 email,
[I]t has been made very clear in the reviews that I have been in that the DCert power curve is not drive-able or saleable so we need to be very
careful in how things are described to the reporter.
When Navistar’s Vice President of Powertrain Product Development forwarded this
email to Navistar’s Vice President of Integrated Product Development and suggested he
talk with Ustian about these issues with the D-cert engine, the Vice President of
Integrated Product Development responded that Ustian “totally knows it” and advised
him to “[t]ell these guys to not worry about this sh[--] and not keep sending emails to
each other.”
64.

Navistar submitted the 2011 Application to the EPA despite the fact that

Navistar never intended to sell the engine described in the application and the fact that
the 2011 Application did not have new Deterioration Factor testing results, which the
EPA told Navistar were required for a Certificate. Because the 2011 Application lacked
new Deterioration Factor testing, Ustian knew the EPA was unlikely to issue a
Certificate. Further, because the D-cert engine described in the 2011 Application was
not even drivable in a truck, Ustian knew that Navistar would never sell this engine. In
spite of these issues, Navistar submitted the 2011 Application because Ustian wanted to
use it as a marketing tool to convince investors of Navistar’s supposed progress in
developing an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard while it continued to work on
developing an engine with competitive performance features that it could put into
production.

17

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 18 of 57 PageID #:18

65.

In the weeks after Navistar submitted the 2011 Application, the EPA

responded to the 2011 Application and advised Navistar that the application did not meet
the EPA’s certification requirements. Among other concerns, the EPA continued to insist
that Navistar run new Deterioration Factor testing. During spring 2011, Navistar
engineers questioned whether they could run a Deterioration Factor test on the engine
that was the subject of the 2011 Application without the engine experiencing component
failure.
66.

By submitting the 2011 Application to the EPA for certification of an

engine that could not be driven or sold and through Navistar’s and Ustian’s public
statements about it described in paragraphs 47, 55, 70, 73 and 75 through 76, Ustian and
Navistar created the misleading impression that Navistar had successfully developed an
EGR-only engine that met the 0.20 NOx standard while attaining competitive
performance features. In fact, as Ustian knew, Navistar’s EGR-only engine was not
drivable if installed in a truck, lacked competitive performance features, could not be
sold in the marketplace even if certified by the EPA and did not meet the EPA’s
certification requirements.
67.

Analysts and investors were misled by Navistar’s submission of the 2011

Application because they understood Navistar’s and Ustian’s statements regarding the
engine covered by the 2011 Application, and the fact that Navistar had submitted the
application, to mean that Navistar currently had a 13-liter EGR-only engine with
competitive fuel economy and other performance features that could meet the 0.20 NOx
standard and that Navistar could sell the engine in the marketplace if the EPA certified it.
Analysts and investors did not know that the engine described in the 2011 Application

18

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 19 of 57 PageID #:19

was not drivable when installed in a truck and could not be put into production even if
the EPA certified it.
68.

Analysts and investors were also misled because they believed that the

2011 Application was a complete application that included the information necessary for
the EPA to approve it. Analysts and investors did not know that the 2011 Application
was incomplete and lacked necessary testing, including new Deterioration Factor testing
that the EPA expressly told Navistar was required before the 2011 Application was
submitted.
D.

March 2011 Analyst Conference Call

69.

On March 9, 2011, Ustian and other Navistar executives conducted a

conference call with securities analysts (the “March 2011 Analyst Call”) in conjunction
with Navistar’s filing of its first quarter 2011 quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
70.

During the March 2011 Analyst Call, before taking any questions from

securities analysts, Ustian addressed Navistar’s 2011 Application, stating in pertinent
part:
Now let’s talk about in-cylinder 0.2. One of our challenges, perhaps as
difficult a challenge as the technology itself, was the marketing side of our
solution, which is in-cylinder. Since we were the only ones out there, there
is a lot coming at us with this can’t work and, of course, now we are out in
the marketplace and that’s over. That argument is over. We are out there
in the marketplace. We are exceeding what we had committed to in terms
of performance and fuel economy and all that. So that’s over.
We want to get in front of the 0.2 now, because we can anticipate there is
a next one coming out that 0.2 can’t be done. So what we did is we
submitted to the EPA a certification of 0.2 to take that argument away. We
don’t plan on using this for awhile, but we are going to have it out there
on the shelf that says it can be done and we can meet the standards and get
all of the performance features, as well. So [t]hat’s what we have done.
When you hear about that, it’s not that it’s coming into production
tomorrow. It’s just to get it out there and take all that argument away.

19

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 20 of 57 PageID #:20

71.

Ustian’s statement that that the engine covered by the 2011 Application

would be “out there on the shelf that says it can be done and we can meet the standards
and get all of the performance features, as well” was false. Ustian knew, but did not
disclose, that the engine covered by the 2011 Application (the engine that was “on the
shelf”) did not meet the EPA’s certification requirements and did not yet offer
competitive performance features. In fact, Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that the
engine covered by the 2011 Application not only lacked competitive performance
features, it was not drivable or sellable.
72.

Additionally, Ustian deceived investors through his misleading

statements, “When you hear about that, it’s not that it’s coming into production
tomorrow. It’s just to get it out there and take all that argument away.” Ustian knew, but
did not disclose, that Navistar could not put the engine covered by the 2011 Application
into production even if certified because it was not drivable and did not offer competitive
fuel economy and other performance features that would allow Navistar to sell the engine
in the marketplace.
E.
73.

April 2011 Press Release
On April 5, 2011, Navistar issued a press release (the “April 2011 Press

Release”) with the headline “Navistar Receives EPA Certification for MaxxForce DT
Mid-Range Diesel Engine at 0.39g NOx” and the sub-headline “With EPA and CARB
[California Air Resources Board] Certification of MaxxForce® 15, Submission of
MaxxForce® 13 at 0.2g NOx, Company Continues to Make Strides in its In-Cylinder
Emissions Technology Path.”

20

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 21 of 57 PageID #:21

74.

Ustian reviewed and approved the April 2011 Press Release before

Navistar issued it.
75.

In the April 2011 Press Release, Navistar announced that it had received

certification for two engines at levels higher than the 0.20 NOx standard: a mid-range
diesel engine and a 15-liter engine, the “MaxxForce 15.” Navistar intended to, and did
eventually, sell both of these engines in the marketplace upon certification from the EPA
using emissions credits.
76.

In the April 2011 Press Release, Navistar then addressed its 2011

Application, stating:
In addition, Navistar also recently submitted its MaxxForce 13 at 0.20g
NOx for EPA certification, once again reiterating its prime technology
path in meeting the 0.20g NOx standard through in-cylinder technologies.
The company intends to phase-in its engines at progressively lower
emissions levels (0.4g NOx, 0.35g NOx, 0.3g NOx, 0.25g NOx, etc.) in
the years ahead in an effort to make emissions compliance as seamless as
possible to its customers.
77.

In the context of a discussion otherwise devoted to applications and

Certificates for engines being sold, or intended to be sold, in the marketplace, the April
2011 Press Release referenced the 2011 Application for certification of a 13-liter engine.
In fact, Navistar and Ustian knew but did not disclose that, unlike the other engines
referenced in the press release, the engine described in the 2011 Application did not meet
the EPA’s requirements for certification and could not be put into production even if
certified because it needed extensive development work before it would be drivable or
could offer competitive performance features to be sold.

21

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 22 of 57 PageID #:22

78.

The EPA never approved the 2011 Application. Later in 2011, Navistar,

with Ustian’s input and approval, abandoned efforts to gain approval of the 2011
Application.
79.

It was unusual, if not unprecedented, for Navistar to abandon a

certification application to the EPA after the EPA failed to approve the application, as
Navistar did with the 2011 Application.
F.

Navistar’s Projected Depletion of its Emission Credits

80.

By fall 2011, Navistar and Ustian learned that Navistar’s emissions credits

for its big bore engines could be depleted as early as February 2012. Without emissions
credits or an engine certified at the 0.20 NOx standard, Navistar would be unable to
legally sell engines from its big bore line unless the EPA instituted rule-making to allow
Navistar to pay non-conformance penalties (“NCPs”).
81.

NCPs are monetary penalties that allow a vehicle or engine manufacturer

to sell engines that do not meet the emissions standards. When the EPA institutes rulemaking for NCPs, manufacturers unable to comply with the applicable standard may
choose to pay NCPs, which are assessed on a per-engine basis.
82.

Only 40 states permit the use of NCPs. If the EPA instituted rule-making

to allow Navistar to pay NCPs, Navistar could do so in those 40 states but would have to
use its emissions credits in the other 10 states. This would allow Navistar to conserve its
emissions credits for its big bore engines and extend the anticipated depletion date
beyond the February 2012 projection.
83.

In fall 2011, Navistar communicated with the EPA about its credit status

for its big bore engines and its timing for development of a 0.20 NOx big bore EGR-only

22

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 23 of 57 PageID #:23

engine. Ustian was aware of these communications and participated in some of them.
Navistar and Ustian informed the EPA that Navistar would be unable to obtain
certification of a big bore 0.20 NOx engine by the time it expected to use its remaining
emissions credits in February 2012.
84.

As an alternative to paying NCPs, Navistar proposed that the EPA allow it

to recalibrate the software on its current 0.50 NOx engine to reduce emissions to 0.20
NOx in a testing laboratory. Navistar explained that this recalibration would only reduce
emissions to 0.20 NOx in a lab; when the engine was driving in a truck on the highway,
its emissions would be higher than 0.20 NOx. The EPA rejected this proposal.
85.

Consequently, the EPA continued to work on an interim NCP rule, which

ultimately went into effect in January 2012, to allow Navistar to pay NCPs while it
continued to try to obtain a Certificate for an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
Ustian was aware that the EPA was promulgating an interim NCP rule because the EPA
understood that Navistar could not obtain certification of a big bore EGR-only engine at
the 0.20 NOx standard before Navistar expected its big bore emissions credits to run out.
86.

Navistar engineers continued to encounter significant obstacles in

developing a 0.20 NOx EGR-only engine with improved performance features. As of fall
2011, Navistar’s engineers projected, and Ustian knew, that it would take until at least
fall 2013 before a 0.20 NOx EGR-only engine with improved performance features
would be ready to go into production.
G.

Navistar Develops a Bridge Program Engine

87.

In late 2011, Navistar began work on certifying another 13-liter EGR-only

engine at the 0.20 NOx standard that would bridge the gap between when Navistar’s big

23

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 24 of 57 PageID #:24

bore emissions credits ran out and its 0.20 NOx big bore EGR-only engines with
improved fuel economy and other performance features were expected to be ready for
production in the fall of 2013. Ustian knew this.
88.

This second engine for certification at the 0.20 NOx standard, the bridge

program engine, involved no hardware changes and no goals to improve fuel economy,
acceleration or other performance features. Instead, Navistar engineers planned to
recalibrate Navistar’s current 0.50 NOx EGR-only engines to reduce emissions in the
testing laboratory to 0.20 NOx. This recalibrated engine would include only software
changes. Ustian was aware of this bridge program to achieve certification of an EGRonly engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
89.

This bridge program engine used a technology known as dual mapping. In

the dual mapping technology used in the bridge program engine, the engine would
operate under one calibration, called Map A, while in emissions testing in a laboratory,
and would switch to another calibration, called Map B, when it sensed that the vehicle
was in motion (anything above 0.1 miles per hour). The engine could meet emissions
requirements while operating in Map A but had severely reduced fuel economy and
performance. To address this problem, the engine would switch to Map B as soon as the
vehicle was out of idle, which improved fuel economy and performance but resulted in
emissions significantly above 0.20 NOx.
H.

December 2011 Annual Report

90.

On December 20, 2011, Navistar filed its annual report for its fiscal year

2011 on Form 10-K (the “December 2011 Annual Report”) through the SEC’s publiclyavailable EDGAR document filing system.

24

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 25 of 57 PageID #:25

91.

Ustian reviewed and approved the December 2011 Annual Report before

Navistar filed it. He also signed and certified the December 2011 Annual Report in his
capacity as Navistar’s President and CEO.
92.

Navistar employees met with the EPA on December 16, 2011, four days

before Navistar filed its December 2011 Annual Report. During that meeting, Navistar
discussed its plans to submit in early 2012 a second application for certification of a 13liter engine at the 0.20 NOx standard using Navistar’s EGR-only technology. Navistar
engineers described how this proposed 0.20 NOx engine operated, including its dual
mapping technology. During the meeting, the EPA told Navistar that an engine using a
dual mapping strategy in the manner described by Navistar would not meet EPA
standards.
93.

On December 16, 2011, immediately after meeting with Navistar, an EPA

official emailed Navistar’s Vice President of Government Relations, who attended the
meeting, with “important takeaways from the meeting,” including:
First as we discussed, under the Clean Air Act and our regulations EPA
can not [sic] issue a certificate (conditional or otherwise) unless the engine
meets the [three certification] requirements. The engine described today
by the Navistar team for certification in February [2012] does not appear
to meet these requirements.
94.

Ustian received a copy of this email on December 16, 2011.

95.

In Navistar’s December 2011 Annual Report, which Navistar filed on

December 20, 2011, just four days after its December 16, 2011 meeting with the EPA,
Navistar stated in pertinent part:
We plan to submit certification applications to both EPA and CARB in the
near future. We believe that our engines meet both agencies’ certification
requirements. We are engaged in ongoing discussions with officials from
both EPA and CARB regarding potential regulatory solutions that would

25

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 26 of 57 PageID #:26

permit us to continue uninterrupted production of all of our engines. We
cannot predict the outcome of these discussions nor the effect they may
have on our business or financial condition, results of operation or cash
flows.
96.

When Navistar discussed in the December 2011 Annual Report its plans to

submit a certification application to the EPA, Navistar was referring to the certification
application for the 13-liter engine that Navistar had described to the EPA in the meeting
on December 16, 2011.
97.

The December 2011 Annual Report deceived investors through its

misleading statement, “We plan to submit certification applications to both EPA and
CARB in the near future. We believe that our engines meet both agencies’ certification
requirements.” Navistar and Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that just four days earlier,
the EPA had informed Navistar that it took the opposite view: the engine for which
Navistar was preparing to submit its new certification application did not appear to meet
the EPA’s certification requirements. They also knew, but did not disclose, that Navistar
would not be able to make all the changes the EPA said were required before submitting
a new application. For example, Navistar’s engine would continue to use dual mapping
technology to keep emissions below the 0.20 NOx standard during emissions testing in a
laboratory but above the 0.20 NOx standard when a vehicle was in motion. Navistar’s
statements in the December 2011 Annual Report conflicted with what the EPA had told
Navistar, and Navistar had conveyed to Ustian, regarding its certification proposal just
four days earlier. Any interpretation to the contrary by Ustian of the EPA’s feedback was
highly unreasonable.
98.

Additionally, the December 2011 Annual Report stated in pertinent part,

in its “Risk Factors”:

26

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 27 of 57 PageID #:27

Our solutions for meeting U.S. federal and state emissions requirements
may not be successful or may be more costly than planned.
In light of Navistar’s difficulties in developing a 0.20 NOx engine that offered
competitive performance features, the EPA’s failure to approve Navistar’s 2011
Application, and the EPA’s expression to Navistar of the agency’s concerns about
Navistar’s proposed second application, Ustian knew that Navistar already had
experienced a lack of success with its EGR-only technology. Navistar’s statements in the
December 2011 Annual Report conflicted with what the EPA had told Navistar, and
Navistar had conveyed to Ustian, regarding its certification proposal just four days
earlier. Any interpretation to the contrary by Ustian of the EPA’s feedback was highly
unreasonable.
I.

Navistar Submits a Second Certification Application to the EPA

99.

On January 31, 2012, Navistar submitted a second application to the EPA

for certification of a 13-liter engine at the 0.20 NOx standard using EGR-only technology
(the “January 2012 Application”).
100.

Ustian was aware of Navistar’s submission of the January 2012

Application and was regularly updated on the development and certification work for the
January 2012 Application both before and after it was submitted to the EPA.
101.

The EGR-only engine described in the January 2012 Application included

dual mapping technology that required the engine to switch between Map A and Map B
while in operation. During testing or in idle, the engine operated in Map A. When the
speed increased to 0.1 miles per hour (whenever it was in motion), an Auxiliary
Emissions Control Device (“AECD”), which Navistar called the Safe Operating Mode

27

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 28 of 57 PageID #:28

AECD, would engage and switch the engine to Map B, during which the engine would
operate with emissions above 0.20 NOx.
102.

On February 1, 2012, the day after Navistar submitted its January 2012

Application, during an analyst conference, Ustian compared the fuel economy and other
performance features of Navistar’s 13-liter EGR-only engine for certification at the 0.20
NOx standard to the 0.50 NOx EGR-only engines Navistar was already selling, stating in
pertinent part:
But, as far as the customer sees on 0.2, he will not know the difference.
That has always been the plan, and we are able to produce that now.
Invisible. No impact on fuel economy, no impact on performance.
103.

On February 17, 2012, the EPA provided Navistar with a written response

to Navistar’s January 2012 Application. The EPA’s written response included an email
from the EPA to Navistar and a five-page attachment to the email with the EPA’s
preliminary concerns on the January 2012 Application.
104.

Ustian was aware of the EPA’s February 17, 2012 response on or about

the date on which Navistar received it.
105.

The EPA’s February 17, 2012 email in response to Navistar’s January

2012 Application stated in pertinent part:
After reviewing your application, our preliminary view is that Navistar’s
application for a certificate of conformity raises several serious concerns
that would need to be discussed and resolved before a decision could be
made to approve the application.
106.

A five-page attachment to the email outlined the EPA’s concerns and set

forth what additional information and changes to the engine or testing protocol the EPA
likely would need from Navistar before it could approve the January 2012 Application.

28

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 29 of 57 PageID #:29

107.

One of the concerns identified by the EPA in its February 2012 response

was whether Navistar met the 0.20 NOx standard on two certification tests. The EPA
told Navistar:
[These two certification tests] appear to have been conducted without the
Safe Mode Operation AECD active.
However, based on our
understanding of this AECD, it would be active in-use . . . . When
activated, this AECD switches to a high NOx calibration which exceeds
the [Not To Exceed] limit over the entire engine operating map. Therefore,
this engine family could not possibly comply with the NOx standard over
the [two tests]. . . . We should discuss whether and how the procedures
should appropriately be changed to result in more representative
measurements. For example, Navistar could demonstrate that the engine
complies over all test cycles with the AECD active as it would be under
operating conditions typical of the cycles.
108.

The EPA also expressed concern that Navistar’s Safe Operating Mode

AECD might be a “defeat device,” or a prohibited strategy that “reduces the effectiveness
of the emission control system under conditions which may reasonably be expected to be
encountered in normal vehicle operation and use.” The EPA asked Navistar to justify
why its Safe Operating Mode AECD was not a defeat device, given that “the only time
the strategy would not be active is in the emissions test cell,” and “[i]n effect the AECD
appears to largely disable the emission control system during almost all in-use
operation.”
109.

Additional concerns that the EPA outlined in this email attachment related

to some of the same issues, such as the lack of new Deterioration Factor testing, that the
EPA had raised with Navistar in 2011 when the EPA told Navistar that it believed that
Navistar’s 2011 Application did not meet the EPA’s certification requirements.

J.

Navistar Engages Lobbyists and Contacts Elected Officials to
Pressure the EPA to Approve Its Certification Application

110.

Shortly after receiving the EPA’s response, Ustian directed his staff to

reach out to elected officials and their staffs regarding the challenges Navistar was facing
in obtaining EPA certification of an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard. Ustian
directed his staff to reach out to the elected officials and their staffs because he thought
the EPA certification process in which Navistar was engaged was proving to be a lot
tougher than it had been for Navistar in the past and was requiring more time and
resources.
111.

On February 27, 2012, Navistar provided the EPA with an eight-page

written reply and asked that its application be approved immediately. Navistar’s reply
included challenges to the EPA’s interpretation of its regulations. Navistar submitted no
new testing results and made no changes to its certification testing protocol or to the
engine covered by the January 2012 Application in response to the EPA’s February 17,
2012 response.
112.

After receiving Navistar’s reply, the EPA never indicated to Navistar that

it agreed with any of Navistar’s arguments or that its positions on Navistar’s January
2012 Application had changed from those it set forth in its February 17, 2012 response.
113.

On March 6, 2012, a Navistar employee in Government Relations

contacted an elected official’s staff to schedule a meeting to discuss Navistar’s efforts to
gain certification of an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
114.

Navistar and Ustian also engaged lobbying firms and public relations

firms to assist with their efforts to obtain certification of an EGR-only engine at the 0.20
NOx standard. On March 7, 2012, a public relations firm consultant sent Navistar’s

30

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 31 of 57 PageID #:31

Chief Communications Officer “our ideas on how to put on a full court press for the U.S.
EPA to approve our .2 engine.” The list included outreach to numerous elected officials
at the state and federal levels “to encourage EPA certification of the .2 engine.”
115.

Navistar had never hired lobbyists or public relations firms to contact

elected officials or their staff members regarding EPA certification of any other pending
certification application prior to its January 2012 Application.
K.

March 2012 Quarterly Report and Press Release

116.

On March 8, 2012, Navistar filed its quarterly report for its first fiscal

quarter of 2012 on Form 10-Q (the “March 2012 Quarterly Report”) through the SEC’s
publicly-available EDGAR document filing system.
117.

Ustian reviewed and approved the March 2012 Quarterly Report before

Navistar filed it. He also signed and certified the March 2012 Quarterly Report in his
capacity as Navistar’s President and CEO.
118.

The March 2012 Quarterly Report stated in pertinent part:

We reached a number of key milestones during the quarter that we believe
will contribute to our long-term, strategic profitability goals. Advanced
Exhaust Gas Recirculation (“EGR”), combined with other strategies, is
our solution to meet ongoing emissions requirements. We formally
submitted our 0.2g NOx in-cylinder engine certification data for our 13L
engine to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) on
January 31, 2012, and to the California Air Resources Board (“CARB”)
on February 17, 2012 (collectively, our “0.2g NOx Engine Submission”).
These submissions are under review by EPA and CARB and we are
engaged in ongoing discussions relating to our engine certification.
119.

On March 8, 2012, Navistar also issued and filed a press release regarding

its results for its first fiscal quarter of 2012 (the “March 2012 Press Release”).
120.

Ustian also reviewed and approved, and provided a quote for, the March

2012 Press Release before Navistar issued and filed it.

31

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 32 of 57 PageID #:32

121.

In Ustian’s quote for the March 2012 Press Release, he stated:

Strategically, we achieved a number of key milestones in the first quarter,
including our submission of a 0.2 NOx engine for EPA certification . . . .
122.

The March 2012 Quarterly Report and the March 2012 Press Release

deceived investors when they stated that Navistar’s January 2012 Application was among
the “milestones” that Navistar had achieved in the first quarter and when the March 2012
Quarterly Report stated that this application would “contribute” to Navistar’s “long-term
strategic profitability goals.” In fact, Navistar and Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that
Navistar already had experienced a lack of success regarding its EGR-only solution for
certification of an engine at the 0.20 NOx standard. They also knew, but did not disclose,
that the EPA did not approve the 2011 Application and had told Navistar it would not
accept aspects of the engine described in the January 2012 Application, such as the way
Navistar’s dual mapping technology operated and Navistar’s lack of new Deterioration
Factor test results. Additionally, Ustian’s assessment was that the EPA certification
process was proving to be a lot tougher for Navistar and was requiring more time and
resources than it had in the past. Navistar’s statements in the March 2012 Quarterly
Report and Ustian’s quote in the March 2012 Press Release conflicted with what the
EPA had told Navistar, and Navistar had conveyed to Ustian, regarding its January 2012
Application. Any interpretation to the contrary by Ustian of the EPA’s feedback was
highly unreasonable.

March 2012 Analyst Conference Call

123.

On March 8, 2012, Ustian and other Navistar executives conducted a

conference call with securities analysts and the investing public (the “March 2012

32

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 33 of 57 PageID #:33

Analyst Call”) in conjunction with Navistar’s filing of its first quarter 2012 quarterly
report on Form 10-Q.
124.

Before taking questions from analysts during the call, Navistar disclosed

that as part of Navistar’s revised fiscal year 2012 earnings guidance, Navistar now was
estimating that it would pay $25 million in NCPs during the fiscal year and that certain
warranty charges would impact Navistar’s financial performance.
125.

Later during the call, an analyst asked: “[T]hanks for the clarification on

the $25 million NCP hit. Dan, could you . . . let us know how many months you are
assuming the NCP payments continue for that $25 million hit?” Ustian responded:
[H]ere’s maybe a way to look at it. We have submitted for the .2 and that
goes through a process of – typically, that’s about three months, I think, is
about the average of that. When we get the certification, it still takes some
time for us to get to production on this. So what we are doing right now is
getting ready to go to production, and it will be about June before we can
get into production with that particular engine. So that kind of gives you a
framework of where it would be. As for the preciseness of it, we can’t tell
you, but our objective is to be in production on that in June.
126.

In Ustian’s response, he was referring to Navistar’s January 2012

Application for certification of a 13-liter EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard and
Navistar’s anticipated production of that engine after receiving a Certificate from the
EPA.
127.

Later during the call, another analyst asked: “[S]o it sounds like most of

these warranty issues are all engine calibrations. Is it reasonable to assume that as you
launch out the .2 engine that this [sic] potential for this to reoccur?” Ustian responded:
Well, I think that is a good question ... This is why we are taking until
June to go to production with it so that won’t happen, but I think that’s a
fair question and we are doing the actions to prevent that from happening.

33

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 34 of 57 PageID #:34

128.

Ustian misled investors and analysts through the March 2012 Analyst Call

by stating that Navistar was “taking until June” to go to production of a 13-liter EGRonly engine that would be certified at the 0.20 NOx standard and aimed “to be in
production on that in June,” based on a “typical” certification process timeline of “about
three months” from the date the certification application was submitted. In fact, Ustian
knew, but did not disclose, that the certification process for the January 2012 Application
was not typical, that the EPA had raised serious concerns about the application that
Navistar had not yet resolved despite devoting more time and work than usual to the
development and certification processes, and that Navistar and Ustian had concerns that
certification might not occur in time for production in June. Ustian’s statements during
the March 2012 Analyst Call conflicted with what the EPA had told Navistar, and
Navistar had conveyed to Ustian, regarding its January 2012 Application. Any
interpretation to the contrary by Ustian of the EPA’s feedback was highly unreasonable.
129.

Following Navistar’s March 2012 Analyst Call and March 2012 Quarterly

Report, Ustian and Navistar received analyst reports showing that investors were in fact
misled by their statements and demonstrating that their misstatements were highly
material. For example, one analyst noted in a March 9, 2012 report:
The company expects to get the EPA 13L certification sometime in AprilMay 2012, and further expects the 13L engine production to begin by June
2012. . . . Our expectation is that NAV should be able to get the EPA
certifications for 13L shortly . . . .
130.

Similarly, another analyst noted in a March 9, 2012 report:

The company is targeting June for a switch over to producing fully
compliant 13L engines. We expect the current fine guidance is protecting
against (normal) delays in the certification process. . . . We expect the
catalysts to drive the shares to begin in 2Q (with EPA certification) . . . .

M.

Ustian’s Lobbying Efforts

131.

In March 2012, Navistar executives arranged for Ustian to meet with an

elected official to ask the elected official to assist Navistar in obtaining EPA certification
of Navistar’s EGR-only engines. Ustian’s meeting with the elected official was part of a
broader effort by Navistar and Ustian to lobby public officials for assistance in obtaining
a Certificate from the EPA for an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
132.

On March 28, 2012, Ustian met with the elected official. Ustian told the

elected official that Navistar had “struggled” to get an engine certified at the 0.20 NOx
standard and that it was at a “stalemate” with the EPA. Ustian also told the elected
official that as a result of the EPA’s failure to certify a Navistar engine at the 0.20 NOx
standard, Navistar was “getting to the point where we can’t ship product.”
N.

The EPA Continues to Raise Concerns Regarding Navistar’s
Certification Application

133.

Throughout March and April 2012, the EPA advised Navistar that it

continued to have concerns about Navistar’s January 2012 Application. The EPA
repeatedly reiterated that it could not certify Navistar’s engine if it was designed to meet
the 0.20 NOx standard only in a testing laboratory and not in-use on the road. For
example, in a March 23, 2012 email that Ustian received, the EPA reiterated that “[y]ou
cannot have one emissions control configuration for taking an EPA compliance test and a
different emission control configuration for installation in a vehicle, if the differences
result in measurements that are not representative of the in-use configuration.”
134.

Navistar engineers expressed skepticism that Navistar’s EGR-only engine

could ever limit emissions to 0.20 NOx while in-use and also offer the competitive
performance features that would make it a marketable engine. Following an April 5,

35

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 36 of 57 PageID #:36

2012 meeting with the EPA discussing Navistar’s efforts to certify an EGR-only engine
at the 0.20 NOx standard, Navistar’s General Manager of Powertrain Product
Development, who was the lead engineer for the 0.20 NOx development programs,
described the engine in the January 2012 Application as “FUBAR forget about it!” based
on the EPA’s feedback.
O.

Navistar Engineers Begin Work on a New Engine for Certification,
and Navistar Withdraws Its January 2012 Application

135.

Following the April 5, 2012 EPA meeting, Navistar engineers worked on

technical changes to the EGR-only engine described in the January 2012 Application that
would result in a new certification application. One such change was a new feature to
replace the Safe Operating Mode AECD. While different from the Safe Operating Mode
AECD, this new feature continued to use dual mapping technology that resulted in the
engine’s NOx emissions being higher when it was in a vehicle in motion on the road than
when it was stationary in a laboratory. The technical changes to lower emissions came at
the expense of fuel economy and other aspects of the engine’s performance, such as
acceleration.
136.

Navistar employees and the EPA met on April 27, 2012 to discuss

Navistar’s changes to its EGR-only engine to receive certification at the 0.20 NOx
standard. During this meeting, Navistar informed the EPA of the technical changes it
made to the engine and the resulting decrease in fuel economy and performance in this
engine.
137.

As of May 2012, Ustian knew that any additional changes to the engine

that the EPA might require to certify it at the 0.20 NOx standard would result in
unacceptable performance trade-offs or require so much time for additional development

36

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 37 of 57 PageID #:37

work that Navistar would run out of emissions credits before it could receive
certification.
138.

On May 10, 2012, Navistar withdrew its January 2012 Application. It was

unusual, if not unprecedented, for Navistar to formally withdraw an application for EPA
certification of an engine.
P.

Navistar Engages More Lobbyists and Public Relations Firms to
Pressure the EPA to Certify its Engine

139.

In early May 2012, Navistar engaged additional lobbyists and public

relations firms to provide messaging advice and to contact federal and state elected
officials and their staffs regarding Navistar’s efforts to obtain certification of an EGRonly engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
140.

In a May 10, 2012 phone call with one of the public relations firms

assisting with Navistar’s efforts to obtain certification of an EGR-only engine at the 0.20
NOx standard, according to notes from one of the public relations consultants on the call,
Navistar’s Vice President of Government Relations stated in pertinent part:
In response to feedback from [an EPA official], our engineers completely
revised the calibrations for our engine and it drastically reduced
emissions, but it requires that we take a hit in fuel economy. We need
certification for our engine in May. We will be announcing our second
quarter earnings on June 5th, and we need to be able to say by then what
the agency is doing, so we need the go-ahead from the EPA this month.
141.

On May 10, 2012, Navistar’s Chief Communications Officer emailed two

public relations firms talking points that were being prepared for the lobbyists to use
when contacting elected officials and their staff members. The talking points identified a
“devastating chain of events [that] will unfold – starting immediately” if the EPA did not
grant certification, including,

37

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 38 of 57 PageID #:38

It is likely that a denial of certification would become immediate news.
Additionally, Navistar will report 2nd quarter earnings the first week of
June and its 10K [sic] financial filing MUST include a description about
the status of .2 certification. The reaction of the financial marketplace
will be swift and deep, exposing the company to myriad financial crises.
(Emphasis in original). Other predicted consequences of Navistar not receiving
certification of an engine at the 0.20 NOx standard included the inability to sell its
products in certain states, significant employee layoffs, and the possibility that “[t]he
company either disappears or is acquired by one of its FOREIGN competitors.”
(Emphasis in original). The talking points proposed as the “specific ask” that elected
officials use “your immediate influence to have higher-level EPA officials assist [an EPA
official] with granting Navistar .2 certification.”
142.

Throughout May 2012, lobbyists and public relations firms engaged by

Navistar contacted numerous elected officials at the state and federal levels and their staff
members regarding Navistar’s efforts to certify an EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx
standard.
Q.

Navistar Submits a Third Certification Application to the EPA

143.

On May 21, 2012, Navistar submitted another application for certification

of a 13-liter EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard (the “May 2012 Application”).
144.

Ustian was aware of Navistar’s submission of the May 2012 Application

to the EPA and was regularly updated on the development and certification work for the
May 2012 Application both before and after it was submitted to the EPA.
145.

Navistar estimated internally that its May 2012 Application engine had

worse fuel economy than its January 2012 Application engine. Further, the May 2012
Application engine had worse fuel economy than 13-liter engines employing SCR

38

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 39 of 57 PageID #:39

technology that were already being sold in the marketplace by its competitors. Ustian
knew these facts.
146.

As of May 2012, Ustian knew based on updates from the engineers that

Navistar’s EGR-only engine with improved fuel economy and other performance features
— the engine Navistar had been developing for years and that pre-dated the bridge
program engine that was the subject of the January 2012 Application and the May 2012
Application — was not expected to be ready for production until at least late 2013.
Navistar projected it would run out of big bore emissions credits before then, however.
147.

In May 2012, Navistar also was projecting that the engine covered by its

May 2012 Application would not be ready for production for several more months. On
May 24, 2012, Navistar’s Vice President of Government Relations sent the EPA a letter
justifying Navistar’s continued need for NCPs. In the letter, Navistar informed the EPA:
Even were EPA to approve Navistar’s one 13 liter application tomorrow,
it would still take Navistar several months to be able to ship road-ready
engines covered by the application.
(Emphasis in original.)
148.

Navistar employees met with the EPA on May 30, 2012 and June 4, 2012

to discuss the May 2012 Application. Between these meetings, Navistar sent the EPA
requested testing data and information on the engine described in its May 2012
Application, including data showing the engine’s NOx emissions when it operated in
Map A and when it operated in Map B.
149.

During the June 4, 2012 meeting, the EPA told Navistar that the EPA

continued to have serious concerns about Navistar’s May 2012 Application. The
concerns the EPA discussed included some of the same concerns that the EPA had raised

39

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 40 of 57 PageID #:40

with Navistar regarding the January 2012 Application, such as the concern that this
engine limited emissions to 0.20 NOx during testing in a laboratory but operated above
the 0.20 NOx standard when in-use on the road.
150.

At the June 4, 2012 meeting, the EPA discussed Navistar withdrawing the

May 2012 Application and NCPs being Navistar’s only option going forward. As the
meeting took place, Navistar’s lead engineer on the project, who was in attendance at the
meeting, sent emails to both his supervisor and a colleague stating that the EPA’s
response was “unequivocally NO!” to Navistar’s May 2012 Application.
151.

Immediately after leaving the June 4, 2012 EPA meeting, Navistar’s Vice

President of Government Relations, who attended the June 4, 2012 EPA meeting, called
Ustian to update him on what happened at the meeting. After he finished talking to
Ustian, Navistar’s Vice President of Government Relations updated other attendees at the
June 4, 2012 EPA meeting about his call with Ustian. After that update, Navistar’s lead
engineer sent an email (in the same e-mail chain discussed in paragraph 150) to his
supervisor and a colleague informing them:
Dan put the gag order on us. We are only allowed to say “the agency has
heard everything and will reply with a written summary.” Please
disregard my previous communication.
152.

Following the June 4, 2012 meeting, the Navistar attendees sent emails

summarizing the EPA’s feedback at the meeting. On the night of June 4, 2012,
Navistar’s Chief Certification Engineer sent an email to his colleagues describing their
discussions with the EPA earlier that day, including that the EPA’s “major concern is the
.2g design does not follow CfR [sic] part 1065.10. In-use must produce emissions same
as regulatory test cycles.” Navistar’s lead engineer on the 0.20 NOx engine development

40

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 41 of 57 PageID #:41

sent an email to his colleagues on June 5, 2012 indicating that the EPA viewed the engine
described in Navistar’s May 2012 Application as a “blatant attempt to circumvent the
regulations.”
153.

On June 5, 2012, Navistar’s Vice President of Government Relations, who

attended the June 4 meeting, emailed an EPA official, stating in pertinent part:
[W]e appreciated the opportunity to review with you and satisfactorily
answer the remaining questions that you had on our certification
yesterday. At the conclusion of the meeting we were surprised by your
comments. We would like to submit questions to you based on yesterdays
[sic] dialogue and request that you not take any further action on our .2
certification request until we receive a response to these questions.
154.

Within hours of receiving the email, the EPA official responded in an

email, stating in pertinent part:
As I said yesterday, based on the information provided, I believe that your
engine is unlikely to receive a certificate of conformity as it is currently
designed . . . As we made clear previously, 40 CFR 1065.10 requires that
engines be tested in a manner that would result in emissions rates
equivalent to those that would result using the same engine configuration
installed in a vehicle. For this engine [described in the May 2012
application], that emission result is 0.42g/hp-hr not 0.20g/hp-hr.
155.

Ustian received a copy of this email from the EPA on June 5, 2012.

R.

June 2012 Quarterly Report

156.

On June 7, 2012 — two days after Navistar and Ustian received the June

5, 2012 email from the EPA — Navistar filed its quarterly report for its second fiscal
quarter of 2012 on Form 10-Q (the “June 2012 Quarterly Report”) through the SEC’s
publicly-available EDGAR document filing system.
157.

Ustian reviewed and approved the June 2012 Quarterly Report before

Navistar filed it. He also signed and certified the Quarterly Report in his capacity as
Navistar’s President and CEO.

41

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 42 of 57 PageID #:42

158.

The June 2012 Quarterly Report stated in pertinent part:

We submitted to the EPA an application for a 0.20g NOx engine
certificate for one 13L engine family on January 31, 2012 and we
submitted a similar application to CARB on February 17, 2012, but later
withdrew both applications. In response to certain concerns raised by the
EPA, on May 21, 2012, we submitted a revised application to the EPA and
plan to submit a revised application to CARB. Certain issues raised by the
revised application are under review by the EPA, and we are engaged in
ongoing discussions relating to certification of this engine family at 0.20g
NOx.
159.

The June 2012 Quarterly Report deceived investors by stating that “in

response to certain concerns raised by the EPA” Navistar submitted the May 2012
Application and that certain “issues” raised by the revised application merely were
“under review.” In fact, just days earlier, in response to the May 2012 Application, the
EPA had informed Navistar and Ustian that Navistar’s engine was unlikely to receive
certification based on the engine’s current design. Navistar and Ustian knew that any
additional changes to the engine to address the EPA’s concerns would result in
unacceptable performance trade-offs or require so much time for additional development
work that Navistar would run out of emissions credits before it could receive
certification. Navistar’s statements in the June 2012 Quarterly Report conflicted with
what the EPA had told Navistar, and Navistar had conveyed to Ustian, regarding its May
2012 Application. Any interpretation to the contrary by Ustian of the EPA’s feedback
was highly unreasonable.
S.

June 2012 Analyst Conference Call

160.

On June 7, 2012, Ustian and other Navistar executives conducted a

conference call with securities analysts and the investing public (the “June 2012 Analyst

42

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 43 of 57 PageID #:43

Call”) in conjunction with Navistar’s filing of its second quarter 2012 quarterly report on
Form 10-Q.
161.

Before taking questions from analysts, Ustian stated in pertinent part:

We have submitted, as we spoke to you before about, an application for
certification on our Class 8 engine family, and we are continuing to work
with the EPA on that. EPA is at – for those of you that have followed us –
also has an NCP rule that they are finalizing. Frankly, we don’t want to
use that. We want to get our 0.2 certification behind us and not use the
NCP, but that is a backup that the EPA is working on. On the other hand,
we are also getting ready as soon as that certification is approved we can
go to instant production within 30 days. So, we have all the mechanisms in
place to respond quickly once we get that certification approved.
162.

When Ustian referred to “an application for certification on our Class 8

engine family,” he was referring to the May 2012 Application for certification of a 13liter EGR-only engine at the 0.20 NOx standard.
163.

Later in the call, an analyst asked: “[W]e will start with EPA engine

certification. You said in your Q that you resubmitted that, I think, in May. Do we have
any idea what the difference [is] between what you submitted in February and what you
submitted in May? And what are your views on when and if this thing gets approved?
And how much of that is built into your second-half forecast, which is just a massive
sequential improvement?” Ustian responded:
Let’s define what we did there. In working with the EPA, they asked us if
there was some spots that they wanted us to modify, and so we did that.
And we’ve been running tests on that to make sure they meet all the
requirements, not just of the EPA but our own requirements on
performance, et cetera. And so we resubmitted that back to them and
we’re in the process now of working with them on getting that certified.
So there’s where that stands. Of course, it’s hard for us since it is
somewhat out of our control to tell you exactly the timing of any of that so
I hope you can appreciate that. But that’s the process we’re in right now.

43

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 44 of 57 PageID #:44

The analyst followed-up with another question: “Last time we were talking about this
you said it would be three to four months for the approval process. Does that clock start
again now in May?” Ustian responded in pertinent part:
No, of course not. Again, it’s somewhat out of our control. But no, there is
plenty of background out there now that it shouldn’t take nearly as long. I
could argue we should have been done with this, but we are not. So we
have to go forward and get it done expeditiously. And we’re all over the
top of this every minute of every day, as you can imagine. And so now we
are in that process.
164.

Ustian deceived investors through his misleading statements on the June

2012 Analyst Call that “[i]n working with the EPA, they asked us if there was some spots
we wanted to modify, and so we did that. . . . And so we resubmitted that back to them
and we’re in the process now of working with them on getting that certified. So that’s
where that stands.” Ustian’s statements indicated that Navistar had made all of the
modifications the EPA said were required for certification and that he was unaware of
any facts indicating that the EPA would not approve its application. In fact, the EPA had
just told Navistar and Ustian days before the June 2012 Analyst Call that the May 2012
Application was unlikely to be approved based upon the current design of the engine.
Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that Navistar had not made all of the changes the EPA
said were required for certification. Ustian also knew, but did not disclose, that that any
additional changes to the engine to address the EPA’s concerns would result in
unacceptable performance trade-offs or require so much time for additional development
work that Navistar would run out of emissions credits before it could receive
certification. Ustian’s statements in the June 2012 Analyst Call conflicted with what the
EPA had told Navistar, and Navistar had conveyed to Ustian, regarding its May 2012

44

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 45 of 57 PageID #:45

Application. Any interpretation to the contrary by Ustian of the EPA’s feedback was
highly unreasonable.
165.

Ustian also deceived investors through his misleading statements during

the June 2012 Analyst Call that “we’ve been running tests on that to make sure they meet
all the requirements, not just of the EPA but our own requirements on performance, et
cetera.” Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that Navistar had made technical changes to
the engine that sacrificed fuel economy and other performance features in the engine,
making the engine’s fuel economy and other performance features worse than Navistar’s
existing 0.50 NOx engines. By telling investors that Navistar was running tests to make
sure the engine met not only the EPA’s requirements but “our own requirements on
performance, et cetera,” Ustian misled investors into believing that the engine described
in the May 2012 Application was commercially competitive when Ustian knew it had a
degradation in fuel economy and performance compared to Navistar’s current EGR-only
engines. His statement was particularly misleading given the company’s previous
statements, including those on February 1, 2012, about the fuel economy and other
performance features that its 0.20 NOx engines would have.
166.

Ustian also deceived investors through his misleading statements on the

June 2012 Analyst Call regarding the timing of certification, such as “as soon as that
certification is approved we can go into instant production within 30 days,” his assertion
that the certification clock did not restart in May — “No, of course not” —, “there is
plenty of background out there now that it shouldn’t take nearly as long” and “we have to
go forward and get it done expeditiously. And we’re all over the top of this every minute
of every day, as you can imagine.” In fact, Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that the

45

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 46 of 57 PageID #:46

EPA would not approve the engine described in the May 2012 Application as it was
currently designed, and he was aware that any additional changes to the engine to address
the EPA’s concerns would either result in unacceptable performance trade-offs or require
substantial time for additional development work. Ustian’s statements in the June 2012
Analyst Call conflicted with what the EPA had told Navistar, and Navistar had conveyed
to Ustian, regarding its May 2012 Application. Any interpretation to the contrary by
Ustian of the EPA’s feedback was highly unreasonable.
167.

Ustian’s statement, “We want to get our 0.2 certification behind us and

not use the NCP, but that is a backup that the EPA is working on. On the other hand, we
are also getting ready as soon as that certification is approved we can go into instant
production within 30 days” was false. Ustian knew, but did not disclose, that if
certification were granted immediately, Navistar could not go into production on the
engine covered by the May 2012 Application within 30 days. In fact, his statement
directly contradicted Navistar’s representation to the EPA on May 24, 2012 that it would
“still take Navistar several months to be able to ship road-ready engines” even if
certification happened the next day. Thus, his statement that Navistar “can go into
instant production within 30 days was false.” Additionally, he also deceived investors by
tying the “instant production” claim directly to concerns about the company’s continued
payment of NCPs. His statement that Navistar wanted to “not use the NCP” and that it
was only “a backup” was misleading. As the company stated in its May 24, 2012 letter to
the EPA, even if certification were awarded the next day, Navistar still would need to pay
NCPs while it prepared its engines for production.

46

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 47 of 57 PageID #:47

168.

Following Navistar’s June 2012 Analyst Call and June 2012 Quarterly

Report, Ustian and Navistar received analyst reports showing that investors were in fact
misled by their statements and demonstrating that their misstatements were highly
material. For example, one analyst noted in a June 12, 2012 report:
We believe that . . . the 13L 2010 EPA certification should happen soon. .
. . We are maintaining our OUTPERFORM rating due to NAV’s low
valuation. The year 2012 will likely continue to be a messy period due to
uncertainty and delay in the transition to EPA compliance. However, EPA
compliance should soon get resolved. . . . Management commented that
due to some concerns raised by the EPA, NAV “resubmitted data” for
certification of its 13L engines to the EPA again on May 21, 2012.
Management expects to get the certification soon, however, the expected
delay is still unclear.

Navistar Discusses Switching to SCR and Continues to
Receive Negative Feedback from the EPA

169.

In the days immediately following the June 2012 Conference Call,

Navistar engineers and Navistar senior executives advocated for Ustian to agree to
transition to an emissions solution that used SCR technology to meet the 0.20 NOx
standard. On June 8, 2012, Navistar’s Director of Finance in Global Product
Development sent Navistar’s Chief Financial Officer an analysis of the financial
ramifications of using SCR technology to meet the 0.20 NOx standard. On June 10,
2012, Navistar’s Vice President of Integrated Product Development emailed other
Navistar executives:
*Please don’t forward* I talked to [Navistar’s Vice President of
Government Relations] at length this AM. He wants to use our political
clout to convince EPA to give us time/break so that we can do SCR. He
does not think that EPA will give us a cert on [the May 2012 application].
He is very very concerned and thinking the same way as the rest of the
team.

170.

During a meeting with the Executive Committee of Navistar’s Board of

Directors held on June 11, 2012, Ustian discussed a “Plan B” for an emissions solution,
including the use of SCR technology to meet the 0.20 NOx standard.
171.

On June 15, 2012, the EPA provided Navistar with a written response to

Navistar’s May 2012 Application.
172.

The EPA’s written response included an email from the EPA to Navistar

and an eight-page attachment to the email.
173.

Ustian received a copy of the EPA’s written response on June 15, 2012.

174.

The EPA’s June 15, 2012 response to Navistar’s May 2012 Application

stated in pertinent part:
After reviewing your application, our view is that Navistar’s application
for a certificate of conformity raises several serious concerns that would
prevent EPA from being able to grant a certificate of conformity.
175.

The eight-page attachment to the email outlined the EPA’s concerns and

set forth what additional information the EPA believed it likely would need from
Navistar regarding the application. The concerns set forth in the EPA’s June 15, 2012
response were the same concerns raised by the EPA at the June 4, 2012 meeting.
176.

One concern identified by the EPA in its June 15, 2012 response related to

Navistar’s test results on the two tests that the EPA had raised concerns about in response
to the January 2012 Application. In its June 15, 2012 response, the EPA stated in
pertinent part:
With Map B active, NOx emissions over both test cycles exceed the
applicable NOx standard by 60 to 115 percent. . . . In this case, it appears
that testing without Map B active results in unrepresentative emissions
measurements [on these two tests and on a third laboratory test]. The
current Map A and Map B design results in compliance with the
applicable NOx emission standard only in the test cell and not in-use. The

48

Case: 1:16-cv-03885 Document #: 1 Filed: 03/31/16 Page 49 of 57 PageID #:49

Map B emissions appear to be very similar to Navistar’s calibration for
[its 0.50 NOx engines].
The EPA also informed Navistar that it was assessing whether the feature that switched
the engine from Map A to Map B when the engine was moving “raises potential concerns
with regard to the prohibition on defeat devices.”
177.

Another of the concerns raised by the EPA in its June 15, 2012 response

related to the lack of new Deterioration Factor testing.
V.

Navistar’s Transition to SCR Technology and Ustian’s Departure
178.

By July 2012, Navistar had failed to obtain an EPA Certificate for an

EGR-only engine that met the 0.20 NOx standard. On July 6, 2012, Navistar announced
that it would transition to a new emissions solution that incorporated SCR technology to
meet the 0.20 NOx standard.
179.

On the day of Navistar’s announcement of its transition to SCR

technology, its stock price closed more than 15 percent lower than its closing price on the
previous day.
180.

In August 2012, Navistar asked Ustian to resign from the company after

the company’s failure to obtain EPA certification at the 0.20 NOx standard for an engine
using the EGR-only technology that Ustian had so aggressively championed. The Board
of Directors asked Ustian to resign because they did not believe Ustian was capable of
leading Navistar in the development of products using SCR technology.
