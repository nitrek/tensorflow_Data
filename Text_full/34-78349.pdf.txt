In the Matter of
Franklin Bank Corporation,

ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS AND NOTICE OF HEARING
PURSUANT TO SECTION 12(j) OF THE
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary and
appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby
are, instituted pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange
Act”) against the Respondents named in the caption.
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
1.
Franklin Bank Corporation (“Franklin”) (CIK No. 1207070) was a Delaware
corporation with its headquarters in Houston, Texas. Franklin was a savings-and-loan holding
company with no significant assets other than its ownership interest in its subsidiary, Franklin
Bank, S.S.B. (“Franklin Bank”). Its common stock was registered with the Commission
pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act and was traded on NASDAQ under the symbol
“FBTX” and later under the symbol “FBTXQ” on OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”)
operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. Franklin’s preferred stock was traded on the AMEX under
the symbol “FBK-P.LF”. Franklin is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission.
Franklin has not filed an annual report since it filed a Form 10-K/A on August 31, 2007 for the
period ended December 31, 2006. The last quarterly report Franklin filed was a Form 10-Q on
December 20, 2007 for the period ended September 30, 2007. Franklin’s last report filed with
the Commission was a Form 8-K on November 12, 2008, giving notice that the company had
filed bankruptcy. The bankruptcy was closed on December 22, 2015.
2.
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and the rules promulgated thereunder require issuers
of securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 to file with the Commission current
and accurate information in periodic reports, even if the registration is voluntary under Section

12(g). Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file annual reports, and Rule 13a-13 requires
domestic issuers to file quarterly reports.
3.
As a result of the foregoing, Respondents failed to comply with Exchange Act
Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems
it necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors that public administrative proceedings
be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations contained in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford the Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
and,
B.
Whether it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months, or revoke the registration of each class of securities
registered pursuant to Section 12 of the Exchange Act of the Respondents identified in Section II
hereof, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3, and any new corporate
names of any Respondents.
IV.
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on
the questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.110].
IT IS HEREBY FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the
allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, as provided by
Rule 220(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.220(b)].
If Respondents fail to file the directed Answers, or fail to appear at a hearing after being
duly notified, the Respondents, and any successor under Exchange Act Rules 12b-2 or 12g-3,
and any new corporate names of any Respondents, may be deemed in default and the
proceedings may be determined against it upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of
which may be deemed to be true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f), and 201.310].
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent personally or by certified,
registered, or Express Mail, or by other means permitted by the Commission Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2)
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice [17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2)].

In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except
as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule
making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not
deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final
Commission action.
By the Commission.
