In the Matter of
FOX ENERGY CORP.

ORDER FOLLOWING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE
AND TO SHOW CAUSE

On December 4, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an Order
Instituting Administrative Proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission
and is delinquent in its periodic filings. I previously notified Respondent that a telephonic
prehearing conference would be held on December 29, 2015. Fox Energy Corp., Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3414, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5141 (Dec. 17, 2015).
I previously found that Respondent was served with the OIP on December 15, 2015, and
that its answer was due by December 28, 2015. Id. To date, Respondent has not filed an answer.
At the December 29, 2015, prehearing conference, the Division of Enforcement appeared, but
Respondent did not.
Accordingly, I ORDER Respondent to SHOW CAUSE by January 15, 2016, why the
registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to timely file an
answer, appear at the prehearing conference, or otherwise defend this proceeding. If Respondent
fails to respond to this Order, it will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined
against it, and the registration of its securities will be revoked. OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), .220(f), .221(f).
