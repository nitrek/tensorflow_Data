ORDER FOLLOWING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On January 6, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934.
On February 9, 2016, I held a prehearing conference of which the parties were notified.
See Wayne L. Palmer, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3526, 2016 SEC LEXIS 212 (ALJ Jan.
21, 2016) (order postponing hearing and scheduling prehearing conference). Counsel for the
Division of Enforcement appeared at the conference, but Respondent did not.
During the conference, the Division was granted leave to file a motion for sanctions by
March 1, 2016. The Division’s motion shall address what sanctions are in the public interest and
shall include a discussion of the public interest factors under Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126,
1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981), with citations to supporting
evidence. A declaration identifying and describing each exhibit should also be included.
Respondent’s opposition to the Division’s motion is due March 22, 2016, and Division’s
reply, if any, is due April 1, 2016. In addition to the required filing with the Office of the
Secretary, an electronic courtesy copy should be emailed to alj@sec.gov in PDF text-searchable
format. Exhibits should be sent as separate attachments, not a combined PDF.
