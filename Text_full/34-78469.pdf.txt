In the Matter of
JAMES F. TURNER II

ORDER DENYING REQUEST TO VACATE BARS
James F. Turner II seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated September 19, 2012 (the
"Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized statistical
rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1
The Order barred Turner from association with "any broker, dealer, investment adviser,
municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent." It did not, however, bar him from association
with an NRSRO or a municipal advisor. Accordingly, James F. Turner II's request to vacate
NRSRO and municipal advisor bars is denied.
By the Commission.
