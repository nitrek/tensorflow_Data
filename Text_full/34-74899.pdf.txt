Respondent.
Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed plan
(“Distribution Plan”) for the distribution of monies paid by Comprehensive Capital Management,
Inc. (“Respondent”) in the above-captioned matter.
On July 29, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Sections 203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order
(“Order”).1 The Order found that Respondent violated federal securities laws by failing
reasonably to supervise Timothy J. Roth, an associated person of Respondent, who
misappropriated over $16 million from investment advisory accounts managed by Respondent.
It further found that Respondent violated the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”)
books and records provisions by failing to maintain certain required records and also violated the
Advisers Act’s rules, which require firms to adopt and implement written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of the Advisers Act. The Order required
the Respondent to pay a civil money penalty of $120,000 to the Commission and created a Fair
Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.
