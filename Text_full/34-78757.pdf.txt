SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Release No. 78757 / September 2, 2016

The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) announced the temporary
suspension, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Exchange
Act"), of trading in the securities of Preston Corp. (a/k/a Preston Royalty Corp.) (“PSNP”), of
Austin, Texas, at 9:30 a.m. EDT on September 2, 2016, and terminating at 11:59 p.m. EDT on
September 16, 2016.
The Commission temporarily suspended trading in the securities of PSNP because of questions
regarding the adequacy and accuracy of available information about Preston Corp. in light of a
false statement about the permitting status of a mine in the company’s August 10, 2016 press
release and questions regarding the adequacy and accuracy of clarifications Preston Corp.
provided in a September 1, 2016, press release about the mining project. This order was
entered pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act).
The Commission cautions broker-dealers, shareholders, and prospective purchasers that they
should carefully consider the foregoing information along with all other currently available
information and any information subsequently issued by the company.
Further, brokers and dealers should be alert to the fact that, pursuant to Rule 15c2-11 under
the Exchange Act, at the termination of the trading suspension, no quotation may be entered
unless and until they have strictly complied with all of the provisions of the rule. If any broker
or dealer has any questions as to whether or not he has complied with the rule, he should not
enter any quotation but immediately contact the staff in the Division of Trading and Markets,
Office of Interpretation and Guidance, at (202) 551-5777. If any broker or dealer is uncertain as
to what is required by Rule 15c2-11, he should refrain from entering quotations relating to
Preston Corp.’s securities until such time as he has familiarized himself with the rule and is
certain that all of its provisions have been met. If any broker or dealer enters any quotation
which is in violation of the rule, the Commission will consider the need for prompt enforcement
action.
If any broker-dealer or other person has any information which may relate to this matter,
contact Valerie A. Szczepanik, Assistant Regional Director, New York Regional Office of the
Securities and Exchange Commission at (212) 336-0175.
