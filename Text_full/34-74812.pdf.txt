In the Matter of

ORDER APPROVING
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

On August 13, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Administrative and
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933, Section
21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(f) and 203(k) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, and Section 9(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, Making
Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against
Keith MacDonald Summers (“Summers”). 1 The Order found that Summers breached his
fiduciary duty and defrauded Tricoastal Capital Partners, LLC (“TCP Fund”), his advisory
fund client, and its investors between July 2009 and July 2013. The Order required that
Summers, among other things, pay disgorgement of $4,117,658.15 to the Commission, which
he partially satisfied through the transfer of the outstanding balance in TCP Fund’s brokerage
account ($1,396,322.27) and the outstanding balance of TCP Fund’s corporate bank account
($1,261.65). The remaining amount of disgorgement was deemed satisfied by the restitution
orders in R v. Summers, Information No. 12000143, provided that Summers did not withdraw
his guilty plea in R v. Summers. 2 In August 2014, a total of $1,397,583.92 was paid to the
Commission. This amount constitutes the “Disgorgement Fund.”
On March 10, 2015, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment 3 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans. 4 The Notice advised interested
persons that they could obtain a copy of the proposed Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) from the
Commission’s public website at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/fairfundlist.htm or by
submitting a written request to Susan S. Pecaro, United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-5631.

The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Plan could submit
their comments, in writing, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the Notice: (1) to
the Office of the Secretary, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street,
NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090; (2) by using the Commission’s Internet comment form
(http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.shtml); or (3) by sending an email to rulecomments@sec.gov. The Commission received no comments on the Plan.
The Disgorgement Fund is comprised of $1,397,583.92 paid by Summers to the
Commission. The Plan proposes to distribute a pro rata share of investors’ losses to those
TCP Fund clients that have been harmed by the misrepresentations, omissions, and
misappropriations described in the Order (“Eligible Clients”) according to the methodology
described in the Plan.
The Division of Enforcement now requests that the Commission approve the Plan.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 5 that the Plan is approved.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
