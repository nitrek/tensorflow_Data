On May 20, 2004, in the above-captioned matter, the Securities and Exchange
Commission (“Commission”) issued an Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and
Desist Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and Cease-andDesist Orders Pursuant to Sections 15(b)(4), 15(b)(6), 15B(c)(4), 17A(c)(3) and
17A(c)(4)(C) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Sections 203(e), 203(f), and 203(k) of
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, and Sections 9(b) and 9(f) of the Investment Company
Act of 1940 (“Order”) (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 49741). The Order directed
Respondents Strong Capital Management, Inc. (“SCM”), Richard S. Strong, and Anthony
D'Amato to pay a total of $140,750,000 in disgorgement and civil penalties, which was
placed in a Fair Fund authorized by the Commission pursuant to Section 308(a) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. The Order further directed that SCM retain an IDC to
“develop a Distribution Plan for the distribution of all of the disgorgement and penalties
provided for in the Order, and any interest or earnings thereon, according to a
methodology developed in consultation with SCM and acceptable to the staff of the
Commission and the independent directors of the investment company.” SCM retained
Professor Michael R. Gibbons to serve as the IDC. As required by the Order, Professor
Gibbons submitted a proposed plan of distribution (“Distribution Plan”) for the
distribution of the $140,750,000, plus accumulated interest, to the Division of
Enforcement, which submitted the plan to the Commission.
On June 30, 2009, the Commission published a “Notice of Proposed Distribution
Plan and Opportunity for Comment” (“Notice”) (Securities Exchange Act Release No.
60406) in connection with this proceeding pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103. This Notice advised
interested parties that they could obtain a copy of the Distribution Plan from the
Commission’s public website or by submitting a written request to Kara M. Washington

in the Commission’s Chicago Regional Office. The Notice also advised that all persons
desiring to comment on the Distribution Plan could submit their views to the Office of
the Secretary, United States Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E.,
Washington, DC 20549-1090; use the Commission’s Internet comment form
(http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.shtml); or send an e-mail to rulecomments@sec.gov no later than August 31, 2009. The Commission received no
substantive comments on the Distribution Plan.
As proposed in the Distribution Plan, eligible investors will receive a share of the
Fair Fund as calculated by the IDC. The Distribution Plan describes the procedures that
will be used to calculate the total amounts to be paid to eligible investors and distribute
those amounts to eligible investors. Eligible investors are those investors who held
shares in the following 24 mutual funds during various periods, as described in the
Distribution Plan, from 1998 through 2003: Small Company Value; All Cap Value; Large
Cap Growth; Opportunity; Government Securities; Discovery; International Stock; Asia
Pacific; Growth; Small Cap; Multi Cap Growth; Growth 20; Balanced Asset; Dow 30
Value; Large Cap Core; Overseas; Enterprise; Mid Cap Disciplined; U.S. Emerging
Growth; Technology 100; Advisor U.S. Value; Advisor Mid Cap Growth; Advisor Small
Cap Value; and High-Yield Bond.
The Division of Enforcement proposes that the Commission:
(1) approve the Distribution Plan submitted by the IDC as written;
(2) appoint PNC Global Investment Servicing, a wholly-owned subsidiary
of the PNC Financial Services Group, as the Fund Administrator as proposed by
the Distribution Plan; and
(3) waive the bond requirement of the Fund Administrator for the good
cause shown in the Distribution Plan.
Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1104, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
Distribution Plan is approved.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED, pursuant to Rules 1105(a) and (c) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1105, that
PNC Global Investment Servicing is appointed as the Fund Administrator in accordance
with the terms of the Distribution Plan and that the bond requirement is waived for good
cause shown.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
