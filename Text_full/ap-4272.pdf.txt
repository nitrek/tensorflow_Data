In the Matter of
DONALD F. (“JAY”) LATHEN, JR.,
ORDER ON MOTION TO PRECLUDE
EDEN ARC CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC, and ADVICE-OF-COUNSEL DEFENSE
EDEN ARC CAPITAL ADVISORS, LLC

Respondents want to present an advice-of-counsel defense. The Division of Enforcement
opposes Respondents’ plan. For the reasons that follow, the Division’s motion to preclude
Respondents’ defense is denied in part.
Background
Following a prehearing conference held on September 12, 2016, Respondents filed a
notice:
that the Eden Arc Respondents intend to invoke the advice of
counsel defense at the hearing in the referenced matter with respect
to (and hereby waive the attorney-client privilege with respect to
attorney-client communications, whether written, oral or
electronic, concerning) the legal advice they received concerning
and relating to the structure of, and structuring of, the Eden Arc
Respondents’ investment strategy.
Letter from Harlan Protass (Sept. 23, 2016).1 The Division of Enforcement later moved to
preclude Respondents from relying on this defense. The Division contends that Respondents’
proposed defense is irrelevant because this case is not about the structure of Respondents’
investment strategy but is instead about disclosures Respondent Donald F. Lathen made when he
redeemed securities held in various joint tenancies. Mot. at 4-5.
1

The term “Eden Arc Respondents”—as used by Respondents’ counsel in certain letters—
appears to collectively refer to all three Respondents, including Donald F. Lathen. See
Janghorbani Decl. (Sept. 26, 2016), Ex. J; Letter from Harlan Protass (Sept. 23, 2016).

Respondents contend that it is not for the Division to say what is or is not relevant. They
concede that “the Eden Arc Respondents are not asserting that they sought, received or relied on
legal advice concerning whether Mr. Lathen was required to disclose his ‘contractual regime’
when redeeming survivor’s option bonds and CDs, as the Division maintains.” Opp’n at 4; see
id. at 5 (“[T]he genesis of the Division’s argument is its misguided attempt at imposing a
requirement on Mr. Lathen to have sought legal advice that he did not seek - that is, advice
concerning the sufficiency of his disclosures to issuers of survivor’s option bonds and CDs.”). In
other words, the Eden Arc Respondents have waived any claim that they sought or relied on
advice about what disclosures Lathen was required to make.
Legal Principles
In a bench trial, “it is virtually impossible for a trial judge to commit reversible error by
receiving incompetent evidence, whether objected to or not.”2 Courts should hesitate to exclude
evidence during a bench trial and should instead “take factors that otherwise might affect . . .
admissibility into consideration in determining . . . weight.”3 Applying this principal to
administrative agencies, courts have “strongly advise[d] administrative law judges: if in doubt,
let it in.”4 Following this guidance, the Commission has held that “all evidence which ‘can
conceivably throw any light upon the controversy’ should normally be admitted.”5
Administrative “law judges should [thus] be inclusive in making evidentiary determinations.”6
The attorney-client privilege protects from disclosure certain “communications between a
client and his attorney.”7 Courts construe the attorney-client privilege narrowly “because [it] . . .
obstructs the search for the truth and” provides “benefits [that] are, at best, ‘indirect and

speculative.”’8 It is “established that if a party interjects the ‘advice of counsel’ as [a] . . .
defense, then that party waives the privilege as to all advice received concerning the same
subject matter.”9
The question of what constitutes “the same subject matter” is fact specific and necessarily
determined on a case-by-case basis.10 A party asserting advice of counsel as defense may not
selectively define the “same subject matter” in a way that prevents the party’s opponent from
determining whether the party asserting the defense provided counsel with all relevant facts and
then followed the advice in good faith.11
Because the advice-of-counsel defense operates to waive the privilege as to all advice
received concerning the same subject matter, a party asserting this defense may not “disclos[e]
[some] communications that support its position while simultaneously concealing
communications that do not.”12 It follows that a litigant may not limit the temporal reach of his
or her waiver of the attorney-client privilege to prevent disclosure of communications related to
that subject matter.13
Discussion
I reject the Division’s argument that Respondents’ defense is irrelevant and should be
disallowed. Because the defense is at least “conceivably” relevant, disallowing it would be
inconsistent with Commission precedent.14 Whether Respondents will be able to establish all of

the elements of the defense, including full disclosure to counsel and subsequent good faith
reliance on that advice,15 remains to be seen. If, as the Division suggests, Respondents’ adviceof-counsel defense misses the point, then it will not matter what Respondents discussed with
counsel about the structure of the joint tenancies. In that case, the Division is free to ignore the
defense. On the other hand, as discussed below, the Division is free to explore the circumstances
surrounding the advice Respondents sought and received.
Respondents state that they are waiving “the attorney-client privilege . . . with respect to
the entirety of the ‘transaction,’ not some portion of it – to wit, ‘the legal advice they received
concerning and relating to the structure of, and structuring of, the Eden Arc Respondents’
investment strategy.’” Opp’n at 6. The Division counters that Respondents are selectively
disclosing evidence relating to their proposed defense.
Assuming Respondents have not adopted an overly narrow construction of the “entirety
of the ‘transaction,’” i.e., one that does not includes the transaction’s conclusion, as to the
attorneys with whom Respondents discussed the “the structure of and structuring of” the joint
tenancies at issue in this case, Respondents have necessarily waived the privilege “as to all . . .
communications relating to the same subject matter.”16 And the “same subject matter” is the
joint tenancies. This means that if Respondents consulted with an attorney at any time “through
approximately February 2016”—the end of the period of alleged misconduct—about the
structure or structuring of the joint tenancies, they must disclose the name of the attorney and all
communications with that attorney about the joint tenancies.17 Put another way, once it is
established that Respondents consulted with a given attorney, the Division must be able test (1)
whether Respondents made full disclosure to that attorney; (2) what advice the attorney
provided; and (3) whether the advice given was followed in good faith.18
To the extent Respondents have not already done so, they shall forthwith disclose to the
Division every attorney they consulted, at any time “through approximately February 2016,”

OIP ¶ 2. The Division asserts that Respondents purport to limit their waiver of their
attorney-client privilege so as to exclude communications before their Fund was formed in 2011.
Respondents cannot limit their waiver in this manner. See Bd. of Trustees of Leland Stanford
Junior Univ., 237 F.R.D. at 627. Additionally, this purported limitation is inconsistent with their
counsel’s letter through which Respondents unequivocally waived their attorney-client privilege
without any such limitation. See Letter from Harlan Protass (Sept. 23, 2016). The privilege
waiver does not, however, encompass attorney-client communications related to the Division’s
investigation or this administrative proceeding. See Bowne of N.Y. City, Inc. v. AmBase Corp.,
150 F.R.D. 465, 487 (S.D.N.Y. 1993).

about “the structure of and structuring of” the joint tenancies at issue in this case.19 They shall
also disclose all communications in their possession that concern discussions with those counsel
about any aspect of the joint tenancies. In other words, if Respondent Lathen exchanged e-mails
with an attorney in which a discussion occurred about the “the structure of and structuring of”
the joint tenancies, those e-mails shall be disclosed even if they contain discussions about other
aspects of the joint tenancies. Finally, Respondents shall inform these attorneys of their waiver.
Failure to comply with the above will preclude Respondents from relying on an
advice-of-counsel defense.20
Given Respondents’ waiver, the Division may inquire of the attorneys who were
consulted, regarding their discussions with Respondents or their representatives about the joint
tenancies. This means that the Division may fully explore with the attorneys everything
Respondents or their representatives told the attorneys about the joint tenancies, what advice the
attorneys provided about the joint tenancies, and whether they know if their advice was
followed.21
Respondents should complete any disclosures required by this order by November 1,
2016. The parties are encouraged to engage in good faith negotiations about production in
compliance with this order. If such negotiations fail, the Division may renew its request for
documentary subpoenas by November 4, 2016.
