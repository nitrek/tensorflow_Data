In the Matter of
3C ADVISORS & ASSOCIATES, INC.,
STEPHEN JONES, and
DAVID PROLMAN

ORDER ON MOTION FOR
SUMMARY DISPOSITION

On January 27, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP alleges that starting in 2013, 3C Advisors &
Associates, Inc., willfully violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act by engaging in
unregistered broker activity, and that Stephen Jones and David Prolman willfully aided and
abetted and caused that violation. OIP at 1-2, 5. More specifically, the OIP asserts that 3C acted
as a broker by holding itself out as an arranger of private placements and facilitator of capital
raises, undertaking extensive responsibilities for customers, and using engagement agreements
that provided for performance fees calculated as a percentage of capital raised. Id. at 1, 3-4. The
OIP further alleges that through 3C, Jones and Prolman solicited small- and medium-sized
businesses by marketing these capital advisory services. Id. at 1-4.
3C and Jones filed their answer (Answer) on March 1, 2016, denying any violation. See
Answer at 2; 3C Advisors & Assocs., Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3751, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 1201, at *1 n.1 (ALJ Mar. 31, 2016). Prolman filed a separate answer on March 18, also
denying any violation. See Prolman Answer at 1-2; 3C Advisors & Assocs., Inc., 2016 SEC
LEXIS 1201, at *1 n.1. On March 31, I issued a scheduling and general prehearing order, which
included a briefing schedule for summary disposition motions. 3C Advisors & Assocs., Inc.,
2016 SEC LEXIS 1201, at *1.
On May 9, the Division filed its motion for summary disposition with a declaration from
Division counsel Lynn M. Dean, supported by exhibits 1-49.1 On May 23, 3C and Jones

1

After the Division filed its motion for summary disposition, I granted a joint motion by the
Division and Prolman to stay the proceeding as to him, given his agreement to a settlement now
pending Commission consideration. See 3C Advisors & Assocs., Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 3842, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1733 (ALJ May 13, 2016). Therefore, this order is
inapplicable to Prolman, and I construe the Division’s motion for summary disposition as

(Respondents) filed their opposition to the Division’s motion, with a declaration from Jones,
supported by exhibits 1-6. On June 1, the Division filed its reply.
The Division argues that 3C willfully violated Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and
contends that Jones willfully aided and abetted and caused 3C’s violation. Div. Mot. at 10-21. It
further requests sanctions against Respondents in the form of cease-and-desist orders, $160,000
in disgorgement, industry bars as to 3C and Jones,2 and civil penalties of $375,000 and $37,500
as to 3C and Jones, respectively. Id. at 21-28. Respondents argue no violation occurred because
3C did not act as a broker, but only “as a finder, connecting interested parties to one another.”
Opp. at 1.
I. Summary Disposition Standard
A motion for summary disposition may be granted if there is no genuine issue with
regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to summary disposition as
a matter of law. 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(b). The facts on summary disposition must be viewed in
the light most favorable to the non-moving party. See Jay T. Comeaux, Securities Act of 1933
Release No. 9633, 2014 SEC LEXIS 3001, at *8 (Aug. 21, 2014). However, if the moving party
establishes that it is entitled to summary disposition on the factual record, the opposing party
may not rely on bare allegations or denials, but instead must present specific facts showing a
genuine issue of material fact for resolution at a hearing. See id. Thus, summary disposition
may be appropriate in non-follow-on proceedings. E.g., S.W. Hatfield, CPA, Exchange Act
Release No. 73763, 2014 WL 6850921, at *9 (Dec. 5, 2014).
In considering the Division’s motion for summary disposition, Respondents’ Answer has
been taken as true, except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by them, by
uncontested affidavits, and by facts officially noticed pursuant to Rule of Practice 323, which
include any matter in the Commission’s public official records. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.250(a),
.323. Thus, the OIP’s allegations that were not denied by Respondents’ Answer have been
deemed true. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.220(c). Declarations that state they are made under penalty of
perjury and verified as true and correct are equivalent to affidavits. See Allen v. Potter, 152 F.
App’x 379, 382 (5th Cir. 2005).
A statement by a party, by a party’s agent, or that a party agrees is true, constitutes an
admission within the meaning of Rule of Practice 250. See Wheat, First Sec., Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 48378, 2003 WL 21990950, at *12 & n.55 (Aug. 20, 2003) (citing Federal Rule of
relating to 3C and Jones only. See Joint Stay Mot. at 1 (requesting the stay so that Prolman “may
be relieved of the obligation to oppose” the Division’s motion).
2

The Division states that such bars are authorized “if the respondent willfully violated the
federal securities laws while associated with a broker or dealer, and the suspension or bar is in
the public interest.” Div. Mot. at 23. However, for Jones, who is not alleged to be a primary
violator, aiding and abetting liability is a prerequisite for an industry bar as to him. 15 U.S.C.
§ 78o(b)(4)(E), (b)(6)(A)(i).
2

Evidence 801(d)(2)). Therefore, statements by Respondents or their agent3 in a presentation,
engagement letter, website, email, marketing materials, or investigative testimony, are all
admissions and have been considered against Respondents. See, e.g., Div. Exs. 3, 26-30, 34 (3C
marketing materials); Div. Ex. 4 (3C website); Div. Exs. 5-8, 10, 18, 41 (3C’s engagement letters
and agreements); Div. Exs. 11-12 (3C analyses for customer); Div. Exs. 13-14, 22-23, 35 (emails
from 3C); Div. Exs. 24, 39 (3C invoice and balance sheet); Div. Ex. 45 (Jones investigative
testimony). By contrast, exhibits that do not contain admissions have not been considered as
evidence against Respondents (although they have been considered in opposition to the
Division’s motion). See, e.g., Div. Exs. 15-16, 19-21, 25, 42 (emails from customers and capital
sources); Div. Exs. 46-49 (investigative testimony of Prolman and third parties).
The parties’ motion papers and all documents and exhibits of record have been fully
reviewed and carefully considered. All arguments and proposed findings and conclusions that
are inconsistent with this decision were considered and rejected.
II. Factual Background
3C is a California corporation that provides a range of consulting services to small- and
mid-sized companies, including the capital advisory services at issue in this action. OIP ¶ 1;
Answer at 2. Jones founded 3C in June 2010 and is 3C’s senior managing director. OIP ¶ 2;
Answer at 2-3. Jones organized 3C as a holding company with the goal of providing
comprehensive consulting services through various sub-LLCs, each independently operated.
OIP ¶ 4; Answer at 3. 3C has never been registered as a broker-dealer. See OIP ¶ 21; Answer at
9; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 37, 42-43, 50.
Jones has never held any securities licenses. OIP ¶ 2; Answer at 2-3. Prior to launching
3C, Jones performed valuation analysis, litigation support, and restructuring consulting for over
two decades at several consulting firms, but did not perform any of the transactional and capital
advisory services provided by those firms. OIP ¶ 2; Answer at 2-3.
Through 3C, Jones provided valuation services and litigation consulting, and planned to
have 3C offer “capital advisory services” under a sub-LLC known as the “Capital Advisory
LLC.” OIP ¶ 4; Answer at 3. Ultimately, the capital advisory business operated as a segment of
3C rather than as a sub-LLC, and did not commence operations until June 2013, when Prolman
joined the firm and became leader of that business segment. OIP ¶¶ 3, 5; Answer at 3-4.
Prolman was not a licensed broker-dealer, but had thirty years’ experience in finance and
business. Jones Decl. ¶ 46; Jones Opp. at 2.
Since Prolman joined 3C, the firm has marketed its capital advisory business and has
taken on at least five engagements to perform capital advisory services. OIP ¶ 6; Answer at 4.
3

As an employee of 3C and head of its capital advisory services business, Prolman spoke for 3C
when performing such services. 3C and Jones have acknowledged as much; for example, they
admit that statements in engagement letters and agreements prepared and signed by Prolman
were made by 3C. Compare, e.g., Answer at 5, with Div. Ex. 5 at 2-3. However, Prolman often
spoke only for himself during his investigative testimony. See generally Div. Ex. 46.
3

3C has solicited customers for those services online, at industry group meetings, and in
presentations with prospective customers, and has further marketed those services to law firms
that would introduce 3C to potential customers. OIP ¶ 7; Answer at 4; Div. Ex. 45 at 81-82.
According to 3C’s website and other marketing materials, the capital advisory services that 3C
offered included private placement of debt and equity securities, acquisition financing, growth
capital, recapitalizations, and restructuring. OIP ¶ 8; Answer at 4; see also, e.g., Div. Ex. 4; Div.
Ex. 28 at 20-21.
3C’s capital advisory engagement letters and agreements were initially prepared by
Prolman at his prior firm and then adopted by 3C. OIP ¶ 9; Answer at 5; Div. Ex. 45 at 90. In
these engagements, 3C sought to “[f]ind and introduce [q]ualified [c]apital [s]ources” to the
customer and “assist[ the customer] in connection with the preparation and dissemination, as
appropriate, of confidential materials for any potential or actual [t]ransaction.” OIP ¶ 10
(alterations in original, fifth bracket additionally altered); Answer at 5; see, e.g., Div. Ex. 5 at 23. The engagements contemplated customers raising millions of dollars through such
introductions. OIP ¶ 10; Answer at 5; Div. Ex. 5 at 1; Div. Ex. 6 at 1; Div. Ex. 10 at 1; Div. Ex.
18 at 1; Div. Ex. 41 at 1.
In its engagement documents, 3C further offered to assist customers in identifying and
negotiating with capital sources, but stated that 3C would not negotiate with any capital source
directly. E.g., Div. Ex. 5 at 2-3; Div. Ex. 6 at 2; Div. Ex. 10 at 2. However, for at least two of its
customers, 3C corresponded with the capital sources separately from the customer during
negotiations to ascertain the status of pending deals, and shared these updates with the
customers. OIP ¶ 19; Answer at 8.
3C required its capital advisory customers to pay a combination of fees. OIP ¶ 12;
Answer at 6. In addition to certain hourly fees, customers were required to pay a flat initial fee
and fees based on a percentage of financing successfully obtained; those percentages could vary
depending on whether the financing was equity versus debt, or whether the debt financing was
secured or unsecured. Div. Ex. 5 at 3; Div. Ex. 6 at 3; Div. Ex. 8 at 3; Div. Ex. 10 at 3-4; Div.
Ex. 18 at 3-4; Div. Ex. 41 at 2. Certain engagements also included a flat fee to be paid if the
customer received a financing offer. Div. Ex. 5 at 3; Div. Ex. 6 at 3; Div. Ex. 18 at 4. For one
engagement, where 3C successfully identified a source that provided the customer debt
financing, 3C received $125,000 in fees, which included a $90,000 fee based on a percentage of
the financing obtained. Div. Ex. 22 at 2-3; Div. Ex. 23 at 1-2; Div. Ex. 24; see OIP ¶ 14; Answer
at 6 (denying characterization of $90,000 as a “performance fee” but admitting it amounted to a
percentage of total funding); Opp. at 5.
Between 2013, when Prolman joined 3C, through 2014, 3C collected roughly $160,000 in
fees from five customers for its capital advisory engagements. OIP ¶ 15; Answer at 7. That
amount represented over a quarter of the firm’s total revenue of $517,420.32 for all its services
during that period. OIP ¶ 15; Answer at 7. Practically, however, this percentage may be
overstated because other revenue generated in those years may not have been collected until
later. See Jones Decl. ¶ 44.

4

In October 2014, after receiving a subpoena from the Commission, 3C removed
references to its capital advisory services from its website. OIP ¶ 20; Answer at 9. Thereafter,
the firm took on another engagement to perform capital advisory services for a distressed
company, which included “looking for capital” and “operational consulting” for that company.
OIP ¶ 20; Answer at 9; Div. Ex. 45 at 109.
III. Discussion
Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act makes it unlawful for any broker to effect
transactions in securities using interstate commerce without being registered as a broker or
associated with a registered broker. 15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)(1). “A finding of violation of Section
15(a) does not require proof of scienter.” David F. Bandimere, Securities Act Release No. 9972,
2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at *25 (Oct. 29, 2015), pet. for review docketed, No. 15-9586 (10th Cir.
Dec. 22, 2015).
Neither 3C nor Jones was a registered broker-dealer or associated with one. See OIP
¶¶ 2, 21; Answer at 2-3, 9. Moreover, Respondents do not appear to dispute that 3C used means
of interstate commerce in connection with the alleged misconduct. See, e.g., David F.
Bandimere, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at *18-19 & nn.21-22 (stating that the “interstate nexus is de
minimis and is satisfied by even tangential mailings or intrastate telephone calls” and further
noting that emails and wire transfers suffice (internal quotation marks omitted)); Div. Ex. 14
(Jones communicating with customer via email); Div. Ex. 24 (3C invoice requesting $90,000
wire transfer from customer). However, Respondents dispute the Division’s assertion that 3C
acted as a “broker,” which is defined as “any person engaged in the business of effecting
transactions in securities for the account of others.” 15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(4)(A); Answer at 2.
“In determining whether a person is ‘engaged in the business’ of effecting
transactions for others’ accounts,” a number of factors are relevant. David F. Bandimere, 2015
SEC LEXIS 4472, at *26-27. “A primary consideration is whether there has been regular
participation in securities transactions at key points in the chain of distribution,” as indicated by
“[t]he number of customers at issue, the dollar amount of transactions, and the number of
transactions effected.” Id. at *27. Additional factors include whether a person: (1) actively
solicits or recruits investors; (2) advises investors as to the merits of an investment, or opines on
its merits; (3) receives commissions, transaction-based compensation, or payment other than a
salary for selling the investments; (4) is an employee of the issuer of the securities; (5) sells, or
previously sold, the securities of other issuers; (6) is involved in negotiations between the issuer
and the investor; and (7) handles investor funds and securities. Id. at *28-29; see SEC v. George,
426 F.3d 786, 797 (6th Cir. 2005). Receiving “transaction-based compensation” is “one of the
hallmarks of being a broker-dealer.” SEC v. Kramer, 778 F. Supp. 2d 1320, 1334 (M.D. Fla.
2011) (internal citations omitted); see David F. Bandimere, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at *31-32.
A. Finder’s Exception
Before turning to the various factors relevant to broker activity noted above, I address
Respondents’ argument that 3C was a merely a “finder,” Opp. at 13-14, and the Division’s
argument that no finder’s exception exists, see Div. Reply at 5-6; Div. Mot. at 15. On the record
5

as it stands, I agree with the Division, although Respondents may renew their argument on this
point in post-hearing briefing.
Some district court cases have identified “a limited, so-called finder’s exception that
permits a person to perform a narrow scope of activities without triggering the broker/dealer
registration requirements.” David F. Bandimere, Initial Decision Release No. 507, 2013 WL
5553898, at *53 (ALJ Oct. 8, 2013) (internal quotations omitted) (citing district court cases), on
pet. for review, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472 (Oct. 29, 2015), pet. for review docketed, No. 15-9586
(10th Cir.); see also David B. Havanich, Jr., Initial Decision Release No. 935, 2016 SEC LEXIS
4, at *22 (ALJ Jan. 4, 2016) (citing district court cases), finality order, Securities Act Release
No. 10045, 2016 SEC LEXIS 668 (Feb. 23, 2016). But neither the Supreme Court nor any
federal court of appeals has recognized someone as being exempt from the Exchange Act’s
broker registration requirement merely by virtue of being a finder. See David B. Havanich, Jr.,
2016 SEC LEXIS 4, at *22. This may be explained in part by the fact that, as some of the cases
cited by Respondents suggest, the distinction between a finder and a broker is not derived from
securities law but from New York state contract law. See Jones v. Whelan, No. 99-cv-11743,
2002 WL 485729, at *7 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 29, 2002) (citing Train v. Ardshiel Assocs., Inc., 635 F.
Supp. 274, 278-79 (S.D.N.Y. 1986), aff’d, 805 F.2d 391 (2d Cir. 1986)); Warshay v. Guinness
PLC, 750 F. Supp. 628, 636 (S.D.N.Y. 1990), aff’d, 935 F.2d 1278 (2d Cir. 1991); Ne. Gen.
Corp. v. Wellington Advert., Inc., 82 N.Y.2d 158, 162-63 (1993); see also Apex Global Partners,
Inc. v. Kaye/Bassman International Corp., No. 3:09-cv-637, 2009 WL 2777869, at *3 (N.D. Tex.
Aug. 31, 2009) (a finder may need to register if its activities meet certain requirements).
The Commission has never recognized a finder’s exception. See David B. Havanich, Jr.,
2016 SEC LEXIS 4, at *22. One recent Commission opinion addressing the need for registration
under Section 15(a) does not discuss finders as a category distinct from other persons. See David
F. Bandimere, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at *25-33. The Commission’s website includes a page
affirmatively stating that a finder “may need to register as a broker, depending on a number of
factors.”
Guide to Broker-Dealer Registration, https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/
bdguide.htm#II (last accessed July 15, 2016). Some such factors are pertinent here, including
whether the person: finds investors for issuers (even in a “consultant” capacity); finds investors
for venture capital or “angel” financings, including private placements; or finds buyers and
sellers of businesses, i.e., “activities relating to mergers and acquisitions where securities are
involved.” Id.
One commonly cited treatise uses the term “finder’s exemption,” but examines at length
circumstances in which finders may still be required to register as brokers. See 15 David A.
Lipton, Broker-Dealer Regulation, at § 1.15-.21 (2016) (Lipton). Lipton relies heavily on noaction letters, which do not “have the force of law.” See generally id.; Enron Corp., 57 S.E.C.
198, 222 n.50 (2003). Lipton nonetheless concludes that four activities in which finders
commonly engage, all of which are pertinent here, make it more likely that broker registration
will be required: involvement in securities sales negotiations; discussing details of the nature of
the securities sold or making recommendations; commissions linked to sales volume; and
previous involvement in securities sales. See Lipton at § 1.16. If Respondents sufficiently
engaged in these or other types of activities indicating 3C was a broker, then even if Respondents
were finders, that status is legally meaningless.
6

Accordingly, there is limited relevance to Respondents’ contention, for example, that 3C
referred approximately twenty-eight percent of its opportunities to a registered broker-dealer.
Jones Decl. ¶ 43; see Opp. at 7; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 37-38, 42, 52; Div. Exs. 37-38; Div. Ex. 45 at 5455. The issue here is whether 3C acted as a broker through the services it did provide—whether
Respondents referred certain other business to registered brokers is irrelevant to that inquiry.
Further, Respondents’ argument that certain services or fees “were generated in and from the
non-capital advisory service components of the company,” Opp. at 10-11, is unpersuasive
because determining whether an entity acted as a broker requires “evaluat[ing] the totality of [its]
activities,” Definition of Terms in and Specific Exemptions for Banks, Savings Associations, and
Savings Banks Under Sections 3(a)(4) and 3(a)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 68
Fed. Reg. 8686, 8689 (Feb. 24, 2003) (to be codified at 17 C.F.R. pt. 240). Not examining this
totality would allow an entity to superficially divide various broker functions among its
purported business segments to avoid registration. Moreover, though 3C may have categorized
its various services and fees differently, it provided them in conjunction with each other and set
them out together in its engagement agreements with customers. See, e.g., Div. Exs. 10, 18, 41.
As such, I address the totality of 3C’s activities below.
B. Factors Relevant to Broker Activity
Customers and Transactions. As to “[t]he number of customers at issue, the dollar
amount of transactions, and the number of transactions effected,” David F. Bandimere, 2015
SEC LEXIS 4472, at *27, the record establishes only that a single 3C engagement led to one
transaction, in which the customer raised over $9 million in debt, Div. Ex. 23 at 1-2. 3C did,
however, collect fees from four other customers for its capital advisory services, and sought to
assist such customers in obtaining many millions of dollars in equity or debt. OIP ¶ 15; Answer
at 7; Div. Exs. 6-8, 18, 41.
Soliciting Investors. 3C marketed its capital advisory services on its website, in
presentations, and in industry meetings. See OIP ¶¶ 6-8; Answer at 4; Div. Ex. 3 at 18; Div. Ex.
4; Div. Exs. 26-27; Div. Ex. 28 at 20-21; Div. Ex. 30 at 10; Div. Ex. 45 at 81-82. 3C advertised
its “broad experience in placement of [debt] . . . and equity for the family enterprise and closely
held enterprises,” listed customers’ potential “Purposes [for a] Capital Raise,” and stated that
“[t]hrough its relationships with institutional and private investors, [3C] has . . . help[ed] clients
expand, effect ownership transitions, recapitalize and acquire other companies.” E.g., Div. Ex. 3
at 18; Div. Ex. 4. It is undisputed that 3C would actively “[f]ind and introduce” capital sources
(i.e., investors) for the customer and would further assist the customer “in connection with the
preparation and dissemination, as appropriate, of confidential materials for any potential or
actual [t]ransaction.” OIP ¶ 10; Answer at 5; Div. Ex. 5 at 2-3; Div. Ex. 6 at 2; see Div. Ex. 8 at
2; Div. Ex. 10 at 2; Div. Ex. 41 at 1. Respondents admit to sending “no-name teasers” about
possible investments to Prolman’s contacts, and subsequently sending non-disclosure agreements
to those contacts if they thought they would be interested. Div. Ex. 45 at 85; see Opp. at 12. In
at least one instance, Prolman sent a marketing book for a “loan request package” to a capital
source on behalf of a 3C customer. See Div. Ex. 36.

7

On the other hand, although 3C’s marketing materials discuss 3C’s ability to assist
customer-issuers in raising capital, they are not targeted at the investors from whom that capital
would come.4 The Division argues that “3C actively built a base of potential sources of capital
who could invest in its customers” by “marketing directly to the capital sources themselves.”
Div. Mot. at 4. But Respondents dispute this, contending that 3C merely connected customers to
capital sources in Prolman’s preexisting “Rolodex of contacts,” from “his 30 years in the
industry” rather than during his time at 3C. Jones Decl. ¶¶ 45-46; see Opp. at 8-9; Div. Ex. 45 at
85. And after sending out teasers, Respondents argue they would “step out” of the process.
Opp. at 12; Div. Ex. 45 at 85.
Advising or Opining to Investors as to the Merits. The evidence is not definitive on the
extent to which 3C offered advice or opinions to investor capital sources regarding the merits of
investing in the securities of 3C’s customers, or the extent to which 3C touted those merits. The
Division relies on 3C’s purported creation and dissemination of “marketing books” and shorter
“teasers.” Div. Mot. at 7; Div. Reply at 4; see Div. Ex. 9 (marketing book); Div. Ex. 17 (teaser).
Respondents admit to “building the teasers” generally, and for at least one customer, “editing and
combining the ‘deck’ and teaser.” Jones Decl. ¶¶ 61-62; see Opp. at 12 (“3C’s involvement was
limited to editing the material with regard to aesthetics, such as layout, and general industry
information.”); Div. Ex. 45 at 85 (stating that 3C will “critique [the teaser, and] . . . sometimes
we help write some if it” or provide edits or suggestions). Indeed, one engagement agreement
stated that “3C, with your assistance, will develop a [c]onfidential [i]nformation [m]emorandum
. . . and summary sheet (the “Tear Sheet”) for distribution to [capital sources].” Div. Ex. 10 at 2.
4

It bears mention that the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) has proposed “a
separate rule set” for so-called “capital acquisition brokers” that are “solely corporate financing
firms that advise companies on mergers and acquisitions, advise issuers on raising debt and
equity capital in private placements with institutional investors, or provide advisory services on a
consulting basis to companies that need assistance analyzing their strategic and financial
alternatives.” Notice of Filing of a Proposed Rule Change To Adopt the Capital Acquisition
Broker Rules, 80 Fed. Reg. 79969, 79969-70 (Dec. 23, 2015). The proposal states that such
firms “often are registered as broker-dealers because of their activities and because they may
receive transaction-based compensation,” even though they “do not engage in many of the types
of activities typically associated with traditional broker-dealers” like “handl[ing] customer funds
or securities, carry[ing] or act[ing] as an introducing broker with respect to customer accounts, or
provid[ing] products and services to retail customers.” Id. at 79970, 79974. The proposal,
therefore, “establishes a separate set of streamlined [FINRA] rules” for these firms that would
“reduce the[ir] regulatory burden . . . given their limited activities and institutional business
model.” Id. at 79974. In the proposal, FINRA does not explicitly opine on whether such firms
must currently be registered as brokers, but notes that under the new rules, “if a [capital
acquisition broker] . . . had engaged in activities [requiring it] to register as a broker or dealer
under the Exchange Act . . . FINRA could examine for and enforce all FINRA rules against such
a broker.” Id. at 77971. The Commission is currently determining whether to approve or
disapprove these proposed rules. See Order Instituting Proceedings To Determine Whether To
Approve or Disapprove Proposed Rule Change To Adopt FINRA Capital Acquisition Broker
Rules, 81 Fed. Reg. 15588 (Mar. 23, 2016).

Respondents further admit to disseminating these teasers to capital sources, but deny helping
create or disseminate the more substantial marketing books, though Prolman sent at least one to a
capital source. See OIP ¶ 17; Answer at 7-8; Opp. at 12; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 81-82; Div. Ex. 45 at 85;
Div. Ex. 36. Moreover, whether 3C substantially helped to create those materials is disputed to a
degree, as Respondents assert that “[i]t was the client’s responsibility to produce these
materials.” Opp. at 11; see Jones Decl. ¶¶ 81-82; see also OIP ¶ 17; Answer at 7-8; Div. Ex. 45
at 84-85 (“Typically it’s the responsibility of the client to do that.”). The Division also points
out that, for at least one customer, 3C “analyzed the customer’s funding needs and advised the
customer regarding funding options.” Div. Mot. at 14; see Div. Exs. 11-14, 35. But there is no
evidence that this advice and analysis was directed at investors.
3C’s Role in Negotiations between the Issuer and Investor. For several engagements,
3C stated that it would assist customers in negotiating with identified capital sources, albeit
indirectly. OIP ¶ 11; Answer at 5; Div. Ex. 5 at 3; Div. Ex. 6 at 2; Div. Ex. 10 at 2. This could
include assisting the customer “in all phases of the negotiation process, including establishment
of price, terms and structure.” Div. Ex. 5 at 3. Respondents additionally concede that for at least
two customers, 3C corresponded with capital sources separately from the customer during
negotiations to ascertain the status of the pending deal and shared updates with the customer.5
OIP ¶ 19; Answer at 8. However, one of these customers clarified that 3C’s role in negotiations
was limited, stating that 3C did not “directly [a]ffect negotiations” or “do any negotiations.”
Div. Ex. 48 at 59-60, 62.
Transaction-Related Compensation. In addition to an initial flat fee and certain hourly
fees paid regardless of any transaction, 3C’s engagement documents required customers to pay
fees based on percentages of successfully obtained financing for the customer, which could vary
depending on whether the financing was equity versus debt, or whether the debt financing was
secured or unsecured. Div. Ex. 5 at 3; Div. Ex. 6 at 3; Div. Ex. 8 at 3; Div. Ex. 10 at 4; Div. Ex.
18 at 4; Div. Ex. 41 at 2; Div. Ex. 45 at 91 (Jones testifying that percentage-based fees were
calculated “off the capital amount that the client used”). Certain of these engagements included
an additional flat fee if the customer received a financing offer. Div. Ex. 5 at 3; Div. Ex. 6 at 3;
Div. Ex. 18 at 4. Ultimately, however, 3C received transaction-based compensation only once,
where 3C successfully identified a source that provided a customer debt financing of
approximately $9.4 million; this resulted in a $90,000 fee for 3C, representing about one percent
the debt financing obtained for the customer. OIP ¶ 14; Answer at 6; Div. Ex. 22 at 2-3; Div. Ex.
23 at 1-2; Div. Ex. 24. This $90,000 constituted over half of the $160,000 in total fees 3C
collected from its five capital advisory customers. See OIP ¶ 15; Answer at 7.
Remaining Factors. As noted above, David F. Bandimere, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at
*28-29, indicates other non-exhaustive factors regarding broker status may include being an
employee of the issuer of the securities; selling, or having previously sold, the securities of other
5

The Division’s additional contentions concerning 3C’s role in these negotiations rely on the
statements of third parties rather than admissions by 3C or Jones. See Div. Mot. at 8 (citing
exhibits 15-16 and 19-21, which are emails from customers and capital sources, as well as
exhibits 48-49, which are excerpts of investigative testimony taken from 3C customers).

issuers; and handling investor funds and securities. 3C was not an employee of its issuercustomers, but rather was retained as an independent contractor.6 See Div Ex. 10 at 3; Div. Ex.
18 at 2; Div. Ex. 41 at 2. Other than the engagements discussed above, there is no evidence 3C
previously sold or attempted to sell the securities of other issuers. Nor is there evidence that 3C
handled investor funds and securities.
C. Conclusion as to Alleged Section 15(a) Violation
Viewing the evidence in the light most favorable to Respondents, there remain genuine
issues of material fact that make summary disposition inappropriate as to whether 3C acted as an
unregistered broker. Respondents genuinely dispute, among other things, the extent to which 3C
solicited and advised investors and participated in negotiations. And although Respondents have
admitted to much relevant conduct on the part of 3C, including finding investors for its
customers and editing and sending certain materials to investors, what weight I accord that
evidence is best determined within the broader factual context provided by a hearing. That
context is especially important given the multi-factored, non-exhaustive framework for analyzing
whether one has acted as a broker. See, e.g., Sun River Energy, Inc. v. Nelson, No. 11-CV-198,
2013 WL 1222391, at *5 (D. Colo. Mar. 25, 2013) (denying summary judgment, noting that
whether one acted as a broker “is a fact-intensive inquiry” and that the record required more
factual specificity to conclude “precisely what the Defendants did . . . much less conclude that
such activity constitutes ‘brokering’ as a matter of law”). Even the unequivocal evidence that 3C
received substantial transaction-based compensation—which is a strong but not dispositive
indicator of brokering activity—is only one factor to consider among many. See Kramer, 778 F.
Supp. 2d at 1334; David F. Bandimere, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472 at *31-32.
D. State of Mind: Causing and Aiding and Abetting Liability
Causing liability requires proof that: (1) there was a primary violation; (2) an act or
omission by the respondent was a cause of the violation; and (3) the respondent knew, or should
have known, that his conduct would contribute to the violation, i.e., the respondent was
negligent. Robert M. Fuller, 56 S.E.C. 976, 984 (2003), pet. denied, 95 F. App’x 361 (D.C. Cir.
2004); KPMG Peat Marwick LLP, 54 S.E.C. 1135, 1175 & n.100 (2001), pet. denied, 289 F.3d

The majority of courts view being an employee of an issuer as making one less likely to be a
broker, while others view it as making one more likely to be a broker. Compare SEC v.
Collyard, --- F. Supp. 3d ---, 2015 WL 8483258, at *4-5 (D. Minn. Dec. 9, 2015), Landegger v.
Cohen, 11-cv-1760, 2013 WL 5444052, at *6 (D. Colo. Sept. 30, 2013), SEC v. Benger, 697 F.
Supp. 2d 932, 944 (N.D. Ill. 2010), and SEC v. Martino, 255 F. Supp. 2d 268, 284 (S.D.N.Y.
2003), with SEC v. George, 426 F.3d 786, 797 (6th Cir. 2005); SEC v. Battoo, --- F. Supp. 3d ---,
2016 WL 302169, at *12 n.15 (N.D. Ill. Jan. 25, 2016). Regardless, status as an independent
contractor does not insulate a person from liability under Section 15(a). See, e.g., Joseph
Kemprowski, Exchange Act Release No. 35058, 1994 WL 684628, at *2 (Dec. 8, 1994)
(respondents employed as “independent consultants” for public relations services were brokers
where they recommended investments after contacting potential investors directly and through
registered representatives).
10

109 (D.C. Cir. 2002); see 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(a). Aiding and abetting liability requires proof that:
(1) there was a primary violation; (2) the alleged aider and abettor provided substantial assistance
to the primary violator; and (3) the alleged aider and abettor did so at least recklessly. E.g.,
Graham v. SEC, 222 F.3d 994, 1000 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Phlo Corp., Exchange Act Release No.
55562, 2007 SEC LEXIS 604, at *35 (Mar. 30, 2007). Recklessness is defined as “an extreme
departure from the standards of ordinary care . . . to the extent that the danger was either known
to the [respondent] or so obvious that the [respondent] must have been aware of it.” Toby G.
Scammell, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 3961, 2014 SEC LEXIS 4193, at *26
n.41 (Oct. 29, 2014) (ellipses and alterations in original). Thus, to establish Jones aided and
abetted 3C, the Division need not show that Jones intended or knew that 3C was acting as an
unregistered broker, see Jones Decl. ¶¶ 3, 87, but rather that Jones was or must have been aware
of the risk that 3C was acting as an unregistered broker, and disregarded that risk in an extreme
departure from the standards of ordinary care.
Having found that summary disposition is inappropriate as to 3C’s alleged primary
violation, the Division’s arguments that Jones caused and aided and abetted such a violation are
premature for now. But given that these arguments hinge on Jones’ state of mind, I preliminarily
address certain assertions by Respondents of potential relevance to that issue,7 namely:


Prolman was primarily responsible for capital advisory services and Jones did not
carry out such activities, being primarily responsible for litigation services. Opp. at
16-17; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 40, 58.



Although Jones received from Prolman a 3C business plan identifying six capital
advisory firm competitors that were all registered broker-dealers, such firms were
identified because 3C was planning to eventually have a broker-dealer component
using licensed individuals for such work. OIP ¶ 5; Answer at 3-4; Opp. at 1, 15; Div.
Ex. 29 at 4; Div. Ex. 45 at 54-55.



3C referred certain business opportunities to a registered broker-dealer rather than
take those opportunities itself. See Opp. at 7; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 37-38, 42-43, 52; Div.
Exs. 37-38.



If 3C acted as an unregistered broker, Jones did not know or intend it. Opp. at 1-2;
Jones Decl. ¶¶ 3, 87.

7

These bulleted facts are irrelevant, however, to whether 3C committed a primary violation of
Section 15(a)(1), which has no state of mind requirement. 15 U.S.C. § 78o(a)(1); see David F.
Bandimere, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4472, at *25. Regarding Respondents’ evidence of threats
purportedly made by an embittered former 3C employee, there is no indication why such
evidence is of any relevance to this proceeding, as it does not bear on Jones’ state of mind or
whether Respondents’ conduct was violative, but only speaks to how this matter may have been
brought to the Division’s attention initially. See Opp. at 3-4; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 13-20; Resp. Exs. 12. Respondents may, however, argue for the introduction of such evidence at the hearing if they
still believe it is relevant.
11



The lawyers that 3C engaged did not raise the issue of broker registration. Opp. at 4;
Jones Decl. ¶¶ 31-33.



Jones relied on certain legal advice passed on by Prolman from his prior firm
concerning engagement materials. See Opp. at 16-17; Jones Decl. ¶ 58; Div. Ex. 45
at 90-91.



A 3C employee who had experience in investment banking and licensing did not raise
the issue of broker registration, and 3C consulted another individual for compliance
issues. Opp. at 4, 6-7; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 24, 28-30, 34-36.

Even were Jones to establish these facts at a hearing, he still may have been negligent,
and perhaps even reckless, if the Division establishes a primary violation on the part of 3C.
Although Prolman led the capital advisory business, Jones formed it and founded 3C as senior
managing director. OIP ¶¶ 2-5; Answer at 2-4. He also had some role in providing services to
capital advisory customers. Div. Exs. 11, 14. Jones had previously worked in other firms’
broker-dealer segments and was at least generally aware of the broker registration requirements,
although he disclaimed further familiarity with such requirements in his investigative testimony.
See Div. Ex. 45 at 34-38, 112; Opp. at 2; Div. Ex. 32 (email from Jones, with subject line
“FINRA Registration,” stating that he was “speaking with a FINRA register BD tomorrow to
begin our process”). Indeed, if Respondents were planning to eventually develop a broker-dealer
component and knew “they had to get licensed individuals on board first,” Opp. at 15, then
Jones’ awareness of the registration requirements is all the more likely. Further, accepting that
3C had plans to develop a broker component later does not alter the fact that in January 2014,
Jones received a 3C business plan identifying six competitor firms, all broker-dealers, “in the
markets identified for 2014”—a period during which 3C’s capital advisory segment operated and
generated transaction-based compensation. OIP ¶ 5; Answer at 3-4; Div. Ex. 29 at 4; see Div.
Ex. 22 at 2-3; Div. Ex. 23 at 1-2; Div. Ex. 24. Respondents’ argument that 3C would “refer
[certain] work off” to a registered broker-dealer, and would not have done so if 3C was acting as
a broker, does not necessarily help Jones. Opp. at 7 (quoting Div. Ex. 45 at 55); Jones Decl.
¶¶ 37-38, 42-43, 52; see Div. Exs. 37-38 (emails from Jones making such referrals). On the one
hand, it may further evidence Jones’ awareness of the registration issue; on the other hand, it
indicates that Jones may have taken precautions to limit the scope of 3C’s activities.
Additionally, Respondents’ assertions regarding their reliance on the advice of counsel
are presently insufficient to constitute a legal defense for Jones. Such assertions are blunted by
Jones’ admission that 3C did not retain counsel to review its capital advisory engagement
materials or the scope of the capital advisory services it could offer. See Div. Ex. 45 at 90-91.
Indeed, the lawyers that Respondents claim to have engaged were, by Jones’ admission,
“corporate and tax lawyers” that only advised 3C through “tax and corporate partners,” as
opposed to directly. Jones Decl. ¶¶ 32, 59. Further, there is no indication that Respondents “(1)
made a complete disclosure to counsel; (2) requested counsel’s advice as to the legality of the
contemplated action; (3) received advice that it was legal; and (4) relied in good faith on that
advice.” SEC v. Savoy Indus., Inc., 665 F.2d 1310, 1314 n.28 (D.C. Cir. 1981) (listing the
required elements of the advice of counsel defense). As to the purported legal advice passed
12

along by Prolman (who is not an attorney) regarding 3C’s engagement materials, such
secondhand information does not meet the requirements of an advice of counsel defense. See id.
Similarly, Jones cannot shield himself by contending that non-lawyers—i.e., a 3C employee and
another individual—failed to raise the broker registration issue or were consulted generally for
compliance matters, as there is no evidence those individuals provided affirmative advice on
broker registration, nor is there evidence concerning “what factors and assumptions underlay”
such advice, had it been given. Scott Mathis, Exchange Act Release No. 61120, 2009 SEC
LEXIS 4376, at *24 (Dec. 7, 2009); see Opp. at 4, 6-7; Jones Decl. ¶¶ 24, 28-30, 34-36. Even
had Respondents properly retained counsel for compliance with the securities laws and satisfied
the elements of an advice of counsel defense, the defense is not a complete one and would be
unavailable to Jones with respect to causing liability because it is only available where scienter is
an element of the violation. See David M. Haber, 52 S.E.C. 201, 206 & n.15 (Apr. 5, 1995)
(further noting that the defense is not “automatic” but rather “only one factor to be considered”).
IV. Ruling
The Division’s motion for summary disposition is DENIED.
