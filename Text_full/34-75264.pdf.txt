In the Matter of
COMPREHENSIVE CAPITAL
MANAGEMENT, INC.,

ORDER APPROVING PLAN OF
DISTRIBUTION

Respondent.
On July 29, 2013, the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) issued an
Order Instituting Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections
203(e) and 203(k) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Making Findings, and Imposing
Remedial Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against Comprehensive Capital
Management, Inc. (hereafter, “CCM” or “Respondent”).1 The Order found, among other
things, that from June 2003 through February 2011, the Respondent failed reasonably to
supervise Timothy J. Roth, an associated person of CCM who misappropriated over $16
million from investment advisory accounts managed by CCM, through its failures to
reasonably implement its policies governing custody, reviews of transactions, books and
records, e-mail, and annual office audits. Further, the Order found CCM violated the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (“Advisers Act”) books and records provisions by failing to
maintain certain required records such as advisory agreements, client lists, and e-mails. In
addition, the Order found CCM violated the Advisers Act’s rules, which require firms to adopt
and implement written policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent violations of
the Advisers Act. The Order required the Respondent to pay a civil money penalty of
$120,000 to the Commission and created a Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. Pursuant to the Order, the Respondent paid the
sums ordered by the Commission, creating a $120,000 Fair Fund, which is currently on
deposit with the United States Department of the Treasury (“CCM Fair Fund”).
On May 7, 2015, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of Distribution
Transferring Fair Fund Funds to a Court-Appointed Receiver and Opportunity for Comment2
(“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement
Plans (“Commission’s Rules”).3 The Notice advised interested persons that they could obtain
a copy of proposed plan of distribution (“Distribution Plan”) from the Commission’s public
website at http://www.sec.gov/litigation/fairfundlist.htm or by submitting a written request to

Washington, DC 20549-5631.
The Notice also advised that all persons desiring to comment on the Distribution Plan
could submit their comments, in writing, no later than thirty (30) days from the date of the
Notice: (1) to the Office of the Secretary, United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090; (2) by using the Commission’s
Internet comment form (http://www.sec.gov/litigation/admin.shtml); or (3) by sending an email to rule-comments@sec.gov. The Commission received no comments on the Distribution
Plan.
The Distribution Plan proposes to transfer the CCM Fair Fund, pursuant to Rule
1102(a) of the Commission’s Rules,4 to a court-appointed receiver in the related Commission
action, SEC v. Roth, et al., Case No. 11-cv-2079 (C.D. Ill.) (the “Receiver Action”), for
distribution to injured investors in accordance with the distribution plan to be established in
the Receiver Action. The Division of Enforcement has concluded transferring the funds to the
Receiver Action for distribution is fair and reasonable under the circumstances here, because a
distribution through the Receiver Action would benefit the same investors injured as a result
of the Respondent’s misconduct and be a more efficient use of the funds intended for
distribution in this proceeding.
The Division of Enforcement therefore now requests that the Commission approve the
Distribution Plan as published.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s
Rules,5 the Distribution Plan is approved.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
