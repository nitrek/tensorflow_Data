ORDER POSTPONING HEARING AND
SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On February 17, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is scheduled to commence on March 14, 2016.
The Division of Enforcement has submitted two declarations of service, which establish that all
Respondents but Ceyoniq AG (n/k/a Ceyoniq, Inc.)1 were served with the OIP by March 1 in
accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), (iv). With the exception of Ceyoniq AG, Respondents’
answers to the OIP are due March 14, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160, .220(b). If
Respondents fail to timely file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding, they will be deemed in
default, the proceeding will be determined against them, and the registrations of their securities will be
revoked. See OIP at 3, 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
I ORDER that the March 14, 2016, hearing is POSTPONED sine die, and a telephonic
prehearing conference shall be held on April 14, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. EDT, if the proceeding has not
been resolved by then.
