The Commission’s public official files disclose that:
On May 29, 2014, Sand International, Inc. (“Respondent”) filed a Form S-1
registration statement seeking to register the offer and sale of 4 million common shares for
$0.03 per share. The registration statement was amended on July 21, 2014 and August 28,
2014 and declared effective on September 16, 2014. Respondent filed a post-effective
amendment to its registration statement on August 31, 2014, which went effective on

1.
Respondent is a revoked Nevada corporation that claims to be
headquartered in Zvirka, Ukraine.

B.

FAILURE TO COOPERATE WITH SECTION 8(e) EXAMINATION

2.
On November 5, 2015, the staff issued a subpoena to Respondent for
the production of documents. The subpoena was properly served on Respondent’s
registered agent, Incorp Services, Inc. Respondent has failed to respond to that subpoena.
3.
In January 2016, the staff attempted to contact Respondent by
telephone to discuss Respondent’s failure to respond to the subpoena. Despite the staff’s
diligent efforts to contact Respondent, the staff received no response.
4.
Respondent’s failure to respond to the staff’s subpoena constitutes a
failure to cooperate with, refusal to permit, and obstruction of the staff’s examination.
Under Section 8(e) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), “[i]f [an] issuer . . . shall
fail to cooperate, or shall obstruct or refuse to permit the making of an examination, such
conduct shall be proper ground for the issuance of a stop order.”
III.
The Commission, having considered the aforesaid, deems it appropriate that public
proceedings pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act be instituted with respect to the
Registration Statement to determine whether the allegations of the Division of Enforcement
are true; to afford the Respondent with an opportunity to establish any defenses to these
allegations; and to determine whether a stop order should issue suspending the effectiveness
of the Registration Statement referred to herein.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that public administrative proceedings be and hereby
are instituted under Section 8(d) of the Securities Act, such hearing to be commenced at
9:30 a.m. on August 16, 2016 in Hearing Room 2 at the Commission’s offices at 100 F
Street N.E., Washington, DC 20549, and to continue thereafter at such time and place as the
hearing officer may determine.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that these proceedings shall be presided over by an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order, who is authorized to perform
all duties of an Administrative Law Judge as set forth in the Commission’s Rules of Practice
or as otherwise provided by law.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Respondent shall file an Answer to the
allegations contained in this Order within ten (10) days after service of this Order, pursuant
to Rule 220 of the Commission’s Rule of Practice, 17, C.F.R. § 201.220. If the Respondent
fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly notified, the
Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against the
Respondent upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be
true as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of
Practice, 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310. This Order shall be
served forthwith upon the Respondent in accordance with Rule 141 of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.14.

2

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an
initial decision no later than 120 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to
Rule 360(a)(2) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360(a)(2). In the
absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged in the
performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as
witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule
making” withing the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C.
§ 551, it is not deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of
any final Commission action.
By the Commission.
