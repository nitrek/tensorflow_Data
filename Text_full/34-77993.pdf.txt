UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Release No. 77993 / June 3, 2016
Admin. Proc. File No. 3-16050
In the Matter of
JESSE C. LITVAK

ORDER VACATING BAR ORDER
Jesse C. Litvak seeks to vacate a Commission order barring him from associating with a
broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent,
or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.1 The order was issued in an
administrative proceeding instituted against Litvak under Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 19342 based on Litvak’s conviction for securities fraud, fraud against the
United States, and making false statements. On December 8, 2015, the United States Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed the convictions for fraud against the United States and
making false statements and vacated and remanded for a new trial on the securities fraud
charges.3
Litvak argues that the basis for the bar order against him no longer exists, and he requests
that it be vacated. Litvak represents that he has contacted the Division of Enforcement and that it
takes no position on Litvak’s request.

vacated only in “compelling circumstances.”4 We have found such compelling circumstances
where, as here, the basis for the bar imposed has been vacated.5

Litvak is hereby vacated.
By the Commission.
