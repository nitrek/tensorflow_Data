Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it necessary
and appropriate for the protection of investors to accept the Offer of Settlement submitted
by Starcore International Ventures Ltd. (a/k/a Starcore International Mines Ltd.)
(“SHVLF” or “Respondent”) pursuant to Rule 240(a) of the Rules of Practice of the
Commission, 17 C.F.R. § 201.240(a), for the purpose of settlement of these proceedings
initiated against Respondent on December 22, 2015, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”).
II.
Solely for the purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by
or on behalf of the Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without
admitting or denying the findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over
it and the subject matter of these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents
to the entry of this Order Making Findings and Revoking Registration of Securities
Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as to Starcore
International Ventures Ltd. (a/k/a Starcore International Mines Ltd.) (“Order”), as set
forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds that 1:
1.
SHVLF (CIK No. 1301713) is a British Columbia corporation
located in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada with a class of securities
registered with the Commission under Exchange Act Section 12(g). As of
December 9, 2015, the common shares of SHVLF (symbol SHVLF) were quoted
on OTC Link (formerly “Pink Sheets”) operated by OTC Markets Inc., had seven
market makers, and was eligible for the piggyback exception of Exchange Act
Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
2.
SHVLF has failed to comply with Exchange Act Section 13(a) and
Rule 13a-1 thereunder because it has not filed any periodic reports with the
Commission since the period ended April 30, 2004.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate for
the protection of investors to impose the sanction specified in Respondent’s Offer.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Exchange Act, the registration of each class of
Respondent’s securities registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12 be, and hereby
is, revoked.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary

on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
