FOREWORD
The 23rd Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Congress for the fiscal year July 1, 1956, to June 30,
1957, describes the Commission's activities during the year under
the statutes which it administers. These include supervision of the
registration of securities for sale to the public by use of the mails
and in interstate commerce, the surveillance of the exchange and
over-the-counter markets in securities, regulation of the activities of
brokers and dealers, regulation of registered public utility holding
company systems and investment companies, and litigation in the
courts.
In the fiscal year 1957 new issues of securities registered for public
sale totaled $14.6 billion, the largest amount in the Commission's
history. The number of brokers and dealers registered with the Commission at the end of the year was 4,771, representing some 200 more
than in any previous fiscal year.
In recent years the Commission has vigorously pursued an intensified Enforcement Program of discovering, preventing and punishing
fraudulent and other illegal activities in connection with transactions
in securities. Administrative and legal actions taken under this
Enforcement Program have exceeded those of any prior year. During the year there were 132 suspensions of offerings for which an
exemption provided for small issues of securities was claimed, 10 stoporder proceedings were commenced to suspend the effectiveness of
registration statements covering new issues of securities, 1,214 inspections of brokers and dealers were conducted which uncovered
1,722 violations of the securities laws and the rules thereunder, 74
revocation and denial proceedings were instituted against brokers and
dealers, 71 injunctive actions were instituted in the courts and 26
cases were referred to the Department of Justice for criminal
prosecution.
The Commission has submitted to the Congress proposals for a
comprehensive revision of various of the acts which it administers,
which proposals are now pending before the appropriate Congres,sional Committees. These proposals, as well as other pending bills
affecting the Commission, are discussed in detail in this report.

PART I
ENFORCEMENT PROGRAM
The most significant aspect of the Commission's activities during 1957 in providing protection to public investors under conditions
then existing and foreseen has been its Enforcement Program.
The Enforcement Program, under the day-to-day direction of the
Commission, has been carried out by the Commission's operating
divisions in Washington and by its 14 regional and branch offices
in principal cities throughout the Nation.
The Commission believes that there can be no substantial question as to the desirability, indeed the necessity, for the effective enforcement of the Federal securities laws. Furthermore, it is the
policy of the Commission that its enforcement activities should include such efforts and such measures as are necessary to accomplish
that objective under the conditions which exist. The Federal securities laws were enacted by the Congress for the stated purpose
of providing full and fair disclosure of the character of securities
sold in interstate and foreign commerce, preventing £rauds in the
sale thereof, preventing inequitable and unfair practices in the securities markets and for other important purposes.
Conditions at present require a more vigorous and accelerated
program including new measures of enforcement. At no time in
the Commission's experience have activity and public participation in the securities markets been so great.
The dollar volume of securities effectively registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 increased by 94 percent from $7.5 billion in
the fiscal year 1953 to $14.6 billion in the fiscal year 1957. In the
postwar years 1945 to 1950 it was $4.5 billion on the average and
in the 1930's averaged about $2.5 billion. The increase for the fiscal
years 1951 to 1957 is graphically illustrated -in a chart appended to
this part of the report.
The aggregate market value of all stock on all stock exchanges,
which never exceeded $100 billion before 1946, except briefly in
1929, increased from $111 billion at December 31, 1950, to over $262
billion at June 30, 1957. The dollar volume of securities traded on
stock exchanges rose to $34 billion in the fiscal year 1957 as compared with about $17 billion in 1953.
The number of holders of shares in publicly owned corporations
was estimated by the New York Stock Exchange to have increased
447579-58-2

2

SECURIT~ES AND EXCHANGE OOMMISSION

from 6,490,000 in early 1952 to 8,650,000 at the end of 1955 and has
probably further increased since then.
Markets such as these are accompanied by enforcement problems
unprecedented in the Commission's experience. These problems were
not encountered in the relatively quiet and disillusioned markets of
the 1930's or under the conditions of war and reconversion. By
reason of recent economic and market conditions, it appears that a
substantial segment of the public again believes that it is possible
for the unskilled to reap large and quick profits in the securities
markets and has available funds which may be used for that purpose.
As a result, there is an increase in the number of uninformed and unsophisticated investors and an increase in their willingness to purchase unknown and speculative securities, which are represented as
offering unusual opportunities for gain.
These public attitudes, in turn, increase substantially the opportunities for illicit profit in the illegal or fraudulent sale of securities and
increase also the premium upon successful evasion of the investor
safeguards provided in the Federal securities laws. As in any field
of law enforcement, the number, ingenuity, and resources of violators
increase when the potential rewards of successful violations increase,
and the potential rewards of a successful securities fraud may be
measured in the millions of dollars.
illustrative of the enforcement problems now confronting the
Commission are the matters briefly summarized below.
THE PROBLEM OF "BOILER ROOMS"

The term "boiler room" means an organization engaged in the sale
of securities primarily over the telephone, particularly the long
distance telephone, by high pressure methods ordinarily accompanied
by misrepresentation, deception or fraud. Such organizations commonly concentrate on the distribution of one or a few issues of speculative securities at a time, seeking to sell these issues in quantity by
whatever representations are necessary to make a sale.
To detect and prove fraud in telephone sales of securities is a
difficult undertaking involving the painstaking collection and verification of evidence from widely scattered sources throughout the
United States.
The Commission has utilized all available enforcement techniques
to meet the problem. As a result, it is believed that most of the larger
"boiler rooms" whose activities created such concern in the past year
are no longer in operation. In lieu thereof', there are appearing a
great number of smaller firms using the "boiler room" techniques
with only a few high pressure salesmen. This cancerous diffusion

TWENTY -THl'RD ANNUAL

REPORT

makes the enforcement work of the Commission more difficult and
requires continued emphasis upon this phase of the enforcement
program.
SALES OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES BASED ON
CLAIMED EXEMPTIONS

The Commission believes that a large but undetermined number
of securities have been sold in violation of the registration and prospectus and in some cases the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 pursuant to claimed exemptions which, in fact, were
not available. The Commission believes that these sales have been
made, in the main, under claims of exemption pursuant to the socalled "private offering" exemption and the intrastate exemption.
This is particularly applicable where an issue, or the sales procedures
to be employed, would not stand the light of the full disclosure requirements of registration. In such cases, there is incentive to attempt
avoidance of these requirements through purported reliance upon an
exemption where the limitations of the exemption are not in fact
observed. The Commission ordinarily learns of these offerings only
after they have been commenced and has no means of ascertaining
whether or not the exemption is available except by initiating an
investigation.
Recently there have been a number of instances where securities
claimed to have been issued pursuant to these exemptions were transferred through channels in Canada, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, and
other foreign countries. When this occurs, the Commission has been
handicapped in tracing the transactions and determining the facts
upon which proof of the availability or nonavailability of the claimed
exemption depends, particularly where the laws of the particular
foreign country preclude disclosure of pertinent information. There
is reason to believe that in many instances these channels are utilized
for the deliberate purpose of complicating or frustrating the Commission's investigative effort. Every effort must be, and is being,
made to discover the facts in such cases and to prevent evasion of
statutory duties by such means.
EVASION OF REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS THROUGH THE
"NO SALE" THEORY

By Commission rule No. 133, which embodies an interpretation of
long standing, the issue of securities in connection with certain types
of corporate mergers, consolidations, reclassifications of securities and
acquisitions of corporate assets has been deemed not to constitute a
"sale" of securities to stockholders of corporate parties to the trans-

4

SECURITlES

AND EXCHANGE' COMMISSION

actions. This rule has the effect of exempting issues of securities in
these transactions from the registration requirements of the Act. It
has been relied upon in a very large number of corporate transactions
consummated without registration. A substantial number of transactions allegedly exempted under the rule in fact involve violation of
the registration provisions. The enforcement problem involved is
essentially similar to that in connection with the exemptions of private offerings and intrastate sales and there is evidence that this rule
also has been abused in deliberate efforts to evade compliance with
the registration provisions.
Last year the Commission invited comment upon a proposal which
in effect would have repealed the rule and made the transactions
covered by it subject to registration. 1 A public hearing was held on
the proposal in January 1957. In March the Commission announced
that it was deferring action on this proposal pending further study
of the problems and questions which had been raised," The staff
of the Commission is continuing its study of the proposal and related
matters.
The enforcement problem of keeping transactions subject to the
rule within legitimate bounds remains and will require continued investigative and enforcement effort. Furthermore, substantial revision of the rule may ultimately prove necessary to prevent its being
used as a loophole for evasion of the registration requirements. If
this occurs, a substantial increase in the number of registration statements filed under the Securities Act and in reports filed under the Securities Exchange Act is anticipated. In this connection, the administrative burden upon the Commission and upon corporations may be
minimized, in part, by coordinating such registration requirements
with the proxy statement requirements of the Commission's rules under section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act.
CERTAIN PROBLEMS OF PROMOTIONAL

STOCK

Recent economic conditions have been relatively favorable for the
sale of promotional stocks of new ventures, particularly in fields in
which the securities of established enterprises have shown marked
gains. For example, many new insurance and finance ventures have
been promoted, particularly in the South Central, Southwestern, and
Southeastern parts of the country, and their securities have been distributed either through registration or Regulation A, or more commonly, in reliance upon the intrastate exemption. Many of these issues and the sales teclmiques employed in their distribution appear to
involve abuses and possible violations of the anti-fraud and other provisions of the Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act, which

require extensive investigation.
The large number of these promotions and the rapidity with which they have increased has placed a
most serious burden on the Commission's field enforcement personnel
charged with the conduct of such investigations.
STOP ORDER AND SUSPENSION PROCEEDINGS FOR NEW ISSUES

There has been a substantial increase in instances where issuers
filing either under the registration requirements of the Securities
Act or under the Commission's exemptive Regulation A do not appear
to be making an effort to comply in good faith with the disclosure and
other standards required for such filings. Consequently, it is necessary that the Commission, for the protection of investors, institute
stop-order proceedings or suspension orders. Each of these has been
preceded by an investigation and in many instances has required a
formal administrative
hearing. While the collection, presentation
and analysis of evidence imposes a substantial burden on the Commission's enforcement staff, nevertheless it has been possible to prevent the public sale of securities under circumstances likely to involve
fraud upon the investing public.
BROKER-DEALER INSPECTIONS

The chart appended to this part of the report shows the results of
the Commission's program of increased emphasis upon broker-dealer
inspections.
The number of registered brokers and dealers increased
from 4,053 on June 30,1953, to 4,'7'71on June 30,195'7. The Commission presently estimates that at the end of the fiscal year 1958, there will
be 5,000 registered brokers and dealers. It is estimated that this number will increase to 5,200 at the close of the fiscal year 1959. The Commission is concerned with the increase in numbers of registered brokers
and dealers. Many of the new brokers and dealers are inexperienced
and unfamiliar with the obligations owed to their customers. The
Commission has intensified its broker-dealer program.
In the fiscal
year 195'7 1,214 inspections were completed, the greatest number since
the Commission was organized.
STATISTICAL SUMMARY OF ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES

The effectiveness of an enforcement program cannot be measured
simply by statistics as to the number of investigations undertaken and
the number of formal legal and administrative proceedings commenced. Such a "yardstick" does not differentiate between the relatively simple case and the complex and time-consuming cases, which
have become increasingly prominent.
The effectiveness of an enforcement program in the last analysis is measured only by the degree

6

SECURITliES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

of compliance with the law to be achieved and this in turn, depends
in large measure on making certain that suspected violations will be
investigated and that appropriate action will be taken either to
correct or to punish violations which are discovered. Nevertheless,
certain enforcement statistics of recent years illustrate, to some
degree, the progress' achieved by the Commission, aided by the increased appropriations in the fiscal years 1957 and 1958. There
follows a comparative table of certain enforcement actions covering
the fisca.lyears 1956and 1957.

If the confidence and faith of the American public in the capital
markets are to be maintained so that the essential supply of capital
can be continued to meet the high rate of demand anticipated by
present estimates of industrial production with the resultant high
standard of living, it is essential that this agency continue its Enforcement Program by supervising the capital markets in accordance
with the standards established by the Congress in the Federal securities laws.

LEGISLATIVE ACfIVITIES
Statutory Amendments Proposed by the Commission

During 1957 the Commission submitted to the Committee on Banking and Currency of the Senate and the Committee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, which
Committees have the duty of exercising watchfulness over the execution of the securities laws pursuant to section 136 of the Legislative
Reorganization Act of 1946, proposals to amend an aggregate of
87 provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934:,the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.1 These
proposals were introduced in the Senate by Senator Frank J. Lausche,
then Chairman of the Subcommittee on Securities of the Committee
on Banking and Currency, as S. 2544, S. 2545, S. 2546, S. 2796 and
S. 2547. Subsequently, they were introduced in the House of Representatives by Representative Oren Harris, Chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce, as H. R. 9326, H. R.
9327, H. R. fl328, H. R. 9329 and H. R. 9330. The Senate bills were
referred to the Committee on Banking and Currency and the House
bills to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. No
action was taken by either Committee during the remainder of the
first session of the Congress.
The overall purpose of the Commission's proposals, the more significant of which are briefly described below, is to strengthen the
safeguards and protections afforded the public by tightening the
jurisdictional provisions, correcting certain inadequacies revealed
through administrative experience and facilitating criminal prosecutions and other enforcement activities.
While the Commission was formulating its proposals, Senator J. W.
Fulbright, Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency,
and Representative Oren Harris agreed that there would be no objection to the Commission's discussing them with representatives of the
securities industry.
On January 24, 1957, the Commission circulated a draft of proposed amendments, and a public conference
was held on February 25 and 26, 1957, at which interested persons
1 The Commission submitted

these legislative

proposals to the Congress in July and

were heard. Further conferences were then held with representatives of interested industry groups, and the comments made at the
public hearing were further explored. The Commission reexamined
its program in the light of all the comments it had received, and prepared a revised draft of amendments, which was circulated on June
17, 1957. Thereafter, another conference was held with interested
industry representatives. Conferences were also held with representatives of the Department of Justice. In addition, the Commission
received and considered written comments on both drafts which it
had circulated.
The proposals under the Securities Act of 1933 would provide a
more workable procedure in stop order proceedings relating to preeffective registration statements; clarify the jurisdictional basis of the
civil liability provisions of the statute; extend civil and criminal
liability to documents filed with the Commission in connection with
offerings exempt under section 3 (b); 2 increase to $500,000 the size
of offerings which may be exempted from registration pursuant to
section 3 (b); 8 make explicit that a registrant may withdraw his
registration statement except where the statement is subject to a
stop order or a stop order proceeding; make it clear that a showing
of past violations is a sufficient basis for injunctive relief; 4 and
make it clear that aiders and abettors may be liable in civil and
administrative proceedings,"
The proposed amendments to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
would establish as a basis for Federal jurisdiction the status of a
person as an exchange member, or a broker or dealer doing business
through a member, or a registered broker or dealer; clarify and
strengthen the statutory provisions relating to manipulation and to
the financial responsibility of brokers and dealers; authorize the
Commission to regulate by rule the borrowing, holding or lending
of customers' securities by a broker or dealer; make it clear that attempts to purchase or sell securities are covered by the anti-fraud
provisions of the statute; make unlawful under the Act the misappropriation of money or securities of, or entrusted to the care of,
an exchange member or a registered broker or dealer; implement
the provisions relating to the denial or revocation of broker and
dealer registration with respect to the basis on which such action
may be taken, the sanction which may be imposed, the conditions
under which an application for registration may be withdrawn, and
• The proposed amendment for the extension ot civil liability in connection with documentsllIed nnder sec. 3 (b) was also embodied in H. R. 173.

the postponement of the effectiveness of an application for registration; authorize the Commission to suspend or withdraw the registration of a securities exchange when the exchange has ceased to meet
the requirements of original registration;
and provide for adjudication of an insolvent broker or dealer as a bankrupt in an
injunctive proceeding instituted by the Commission.
Changes are proposed in the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 to conform certain provisions of that statute to certain of the recommendations made in connection with the Securities Act.
The proposals with reference to the Investment Company Act of
1940 would require an investment company to state as a matter of
fundamental policy, which generally could not be changed without
the consent of its stockholders, the extent to which it intends to
invest in particular types of securities and such other basic investment objectives it represents it will emphasize; strengthen the provisions requiring that there be a minimum number of independent
or nonmanagement directors; limit the extent to which a face
amount investment company may include preferred and common
stocks in its "qualified investments"; make clear the application of
the statute to an "advisory board"; and clarify the exceptions for
companies engaged in banking, insurance, small loan, factoring, discount or real estate businesses.
The proposals under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 would
expand the basis for disqualification from registration because of prior
misconduct; authorize the Commission by rule to require the keeping
of books and records and the filing of reports; permit periodic examinations of books and records; empower the Commission by rule
to define, and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent, fraudulent practices; extend criminal liability for a willful violation of a
rule or order -
of the Commission; and implement the provisions
relating to the postponement of effectiveness and withdrawal of applications for registration.
Many minor amendments are also proposed.
Proposal to Increase Registration Fees

In response to various inquiries made of the Commission by the
Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency of the Senate,
by the Chairman of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives, by the Chairman of the
Independent Offices Subcommittee of the Committee on Appropriations of the House of Representatives, and by the Bureau of the
Budget, the Commission on April 5, 1957, submitted to the Chairman
of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House
of Representatives a proposal for an amendment of section 31 of the

TWENTY -THl'RD

ANNUAL

RDPORT

13

Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which would increase the statutory
fees provided by that section. The Commission recommended introduction of this bill, stating that if the Congress desired to increase
the receipts to the Treasury of the fees provided by the Federal
securities laws this proposal would be an appropriate and feasible
method of so doing. Itwould spread the impact of the fees over all of
the investing public for whose benefit the various acts the Commission administers were enacted, without imposing any undue burden
upon any securities industry or group or class of investors.
Under existing law the fee for the registration of exchanges provided by section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is one
five-hundredths of 1 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of stock
exchange transactions (equal to 2 cents per $1,000). The Commission proposed that the exchange registration fee under the Securities
Exchange Act be increased to a rate of 5 cents per $1,000 and that
there be a similar registration fee for brokers and dealers of 5 cents
per $1,000 on transactions effected otherwise than on a national securities exchange. If the proposed fees had been in effect during the
1956 fiscal year, these, together with receipts from other fees which
the proposal does not contemplate changing, would have resulted in
receipts by the Commission of approximately $4,250,000, as against
total fees actually received of $2,053,932.
On May 27, 1957, Congressman Harris, as Chairman of the House
Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee, introduced the Commission's proposal as H. R. 7778, which was referred to that Committee. Subsequently, on July 11, 1957, Senator Lausche, as Chairman
of the Subcommittee on Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, favorably reported to the Senate an identical bill
(with two minor exceptions), as S. 2520.G The Senate passed S. 2520
on August 8, 1957, and sent it to the House on the same date, where
it was referred to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. The House Committee had taken no action on either H. R.
7778 or S. 2520 at the close of the first session of the Congress.
Registration of Unlisted Secnrities of Certain Companies Having Large Public
Investor Interest

On February 11, 1957, Senator J. W. Fulbright, Chairman of the
Committee on Banking and Currency, introduced S. 1168, a bill to
amend the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to extend the reporting
provisions of sections 12, 13 and 16 and the provisions of section 14
relating to the solicitation of proxies to certain corporations whose
securities are publicly held but are not listed and registered on a
national securities exchange. As originally introduced, the bill ap-

•

plied to corporations having more than 750 stockholders or debt securities of more than $1 million outstanding in the hands of the
public, and $2 million of assets. It would have required such corporations to register with the Commission and file with it annual and
other periodic reports now required only of corporations with listed
and registered securities. The bill would have also subjected such
corporations to the Commission's proxy rules and the insider-trading
provisions of the Act.
S. 1168, as originally introduced, was, with one exception, identical
with the August 5, 1955, print of S. 2054, introduced by Senator Fulbright in the 84th Congress, which had been favorably reported by the
Subcommittee on Securities to the Senate Committee on Banking
and Currency." The exception was that the exemption for insurance
companies contained in the August 5, 1955, print of S. 2054 was not
contained in the original draft of S. 1168. No final action on S. 2054
was taken by the Committee during the 84th Congress. However,
before that Congress adjourned, Senator Fulbright, as Chairman of
the Committee, requested the Commission to extend a study it had
previously made of those corporations which would come within the
scope of S. 2054 to include insurance companies. The study the Commission had previously submitted to the Committee did not cover
insurance companies because they were expressly exempted from
S. 2054. In compliance with the Committee's request, the Commission
sent questionnaires to more than 530 insurance companies to obtain
the data necessary for making an objective, factual appraisal of the
financial, reporting and proxy practices of insurance companies. The
Commission's study showed that deletion of the insurance company
exemption from the bill would extend the bill's coverage to approximately 169 insurance corporations having total assets of about $24
billion. Shortly after the 85th Congress convened, the Commission
submitted the supplemental report to the Committee on Banking and
Currency," and expressed the opinion that it would be consistent with
the purposes of the Federal securities laws and of the proposed bill
that the insurance company exemption be deleted.
The Commission in general supported the original draft of S. 1168
both in written comments and in hearings held before the Subcommittee on Securities. The Commission, however, urged two amendments: (1) That the applicability of the provisions of existing section
16 (b) to the corporations subject to the bill be eliminated pending
further study by the Commission, and (2) that section 15 (d) not be
repealed as provided in the bill. Subject to these amendments, the

Commission expressed the opinion that the bill would provide addi- ,
tional protection to investors in corporate securities in which there
is a broad public investor interest and which are sold and traded
in the interstate securities markets by requiring disclosure of the
business and financial facts pertaining to the corporations issuing
them, and that it would strengthen the protections against fraud
afforded to investors,"
The Committee reported the bill out to the Senate with amendments
reducing its application to companies having $10 million of assets
and more than 1,000 stockholders of record and deleting the debt
security test.lO Also the same exemption for insurance companies
as was provided in S. 2054 was added to the bill. The Commission's
suggestions with respect to sections 15 (d) and 16 (b) were adopted.
No action was taken by the Senate during the first session of the
85th Congress.
Proposals To Amend the Exemption From Registration for Small Issues

S. 810, introduced by Senator Edward F. Thye, and S. 843, by
Senator John J. Sparkman, would each amend section 3 (b) of the
Securities Act of 1933 to increase to $500,000 the $300,000maximum
limit presently authorized by this exemptive provision.
In written comments to the Senate Committee on Banking and
Currency, and in testimony before the Subcommittee on Securities,
the Commission supported both bills, pointing out that the proposed
amendment to section 3 (b) would be in the public interest generally
and that its own proposed legislative program contained a provision
substantially similar to that of these bills."
On June 14, 1957',the committee favorably reported S. 2299, a bill
substantially similar to S. 810 and S. 843.12 Subsequently, on June
26, 1957, the Senate passed S. 2299, and it was sent to the House of
Representatives where it was referred to the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce. At the request of this Committee,
the Commission submitted written comments in which it urged enactment of the bill. Hearings had not yet been scheduled by the
House Committee at the close of the first session of the Congress.

In written comments and in hearings held by the Subcommittee on
Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency, the
Commission raised no objection to the bill, pointing out that disclosure
of 5 percent ownership might serve to permit management or any
other group to determine whether substantial beneficial holdings were
being accumulated and the identity of beneficial holders accumulating
them,>
The Committee had taken no action on the bill at the close of the
first session of the Congress.

of

Securities

in Election

On March 14, 1957, Senator Capehart introduced S. 1601, a bill
directed to identifying beneficial owners in proxy contests. The bill
would add to section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 a
provision making it unlawful for any person to give or to attempt
to give a proxy to vote a security registered on a national securities
exchange at any meeting for the election or removal of directors, with
respect to which meeting proxies are solicited by opposing nominees,
unless (1) such person is the beneficial owner of the security, or (2)
the name and last known address of the beneficial owner appear on
the proxy. In addition, the bill would make it unlawful for any
person knowingly to exercise or attempt to exercise any proxy in
violation of this provision.
In a memorandum and in hearings before the Subcommittee on
Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency in May
1957, the Commission opposed S. 1601, expressing the views that (1)
there was a substantial question as to whether the bill would actually
obtain disclosure of beneficial ownership; (2) in any event, the bill
would not provide investors at the time of the execution of their
proxies with any additional information as to the beneficial ownership
of other security holders; and (3) the bill's enactment might well
impede the conduct of corporate meetings,>

A.ll of these bills were still in committee at the close of the first
session of the 85th Congress.
Other Legislative Proposals

The Commission devoted a substantial amount of time to matters
pertaining to other legislative proposals referred to it for comment
and to congressional inquiries. During the fiscal year 1957, a total
of thirty-three legislative proposals were analyzed at the request
of appropriate congressional committees, as compared with nineteen
during the preceding fiscal year. In addition, numerous congressional inquiries relating to matters other than specific legislative
proposals were received and answered.

Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary.
The Chairman presented a detailed discussion of the enforcement problems
arising out of the purchase and sale of securities in the United States
by or on behalf of persons and institutions in foreign countries. Particular attention was called to the problems arising in connection with
proxy regulations, insider-trading, manipulative practices and other
related matters. The General Counsel of the Commission presented
a statement dealing with the obtaining of information from foreign
sources, particular attention being directed to provisions of the
Swiss Banking Act and the Swiss Espionage Act.
In response to the request of the Subcommittee, the General Counsel
testified in a hearing held in New York City during June, 1957. As a
matter ancillary to the main inquiry, namely the possibility of
acquisition of control of domestic corporations by anonymous foreign
interests, the Subcommittee was interested in the experience of the
Commission in its attempts to detect the identities of those who make
use of foreign devices to circumvent the operation of the Federal
securities laws. At the request of the Subcommittee, the General
Counsel prepared and submitted a memorandum pointing out that
substantial investigatory problems are created due to the difficulty of
eliciting information from foreign sources, but indicating that the
Commission has secured desired information through other means.
Senate Subcommittee on WeHarc and Pension Funds of the
Committee on Labor and Public Welfare.v-On May 29, 1957, Commissioner Andrew Downey Orrick, then Acting Chairman of the
Commission, testified before the Subcommittee on Welfare and Pension Funds of the Senate Committee on Labor and Public WeHare
concerning S. 1122, S. 1813, and S. 2137,17 These bills, which
designate the Commission as the administering agency, provide for
the registration of employee welfare and pension funds. Similar
bills are being studied by the Committee which name other agencies
to administer them. In addition to registering, certain funds would
be required annually to report changes respecting portfolios, officers,
trustees, and other matters. The persons administering the funds
would be charged with the responsibility for filing these reports, and
the bills prescribe both civil and criminal penalties for failure to file
registrations or reports or for the violation of fiduciary duties
specifically described therein.
Previously, on March 8, 1957, the Commission had submitted a
memorandum of comments on several "Welfare and Pension Plan Disclosure bills, including S. 1122. This memorandum contained teehni11Hearlngs before the Subcommittee on Welfare and Pension Funds of the Committee

which would be incurred if the Commission were to administer
S.1122.18 At the request of the Subcommittee, the Commission prepared two supplemental memoranda. The first, submitted on June 21,
1957, expressed the Commission's views that it was not the appropriate
agency to administer the legislation, compared S. 1122 and S. 2175
and discussed the need for such legislation and its probable impact
upon the capital markets."
The second supplemental memorandum
compared a portion of the proposed legislation with provisions of the
Investment Company Act.20
No action has been taken on these bills.
Subcommittee on Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking
and Currency.-In March and again in May 1957 former Chairman
Armstrong, the other Commissioners, and several staff members appeared before the Subcommittee on Securities of the Senate Committee on Banking and Currency. At each of these hearings Chairman
Armstrong presented a statement and answered inquiries concerning
the Commission's position with respect to certain proposed securities
legislation under consideration.
Of particular concern were the provisions of Senate bills S. 594, S. 810, S. 843, S. 1168 and S. 1601. These
bills and the Commission's position thereon are discussed supra at
pages 13 to 16.
Olher Hearings.-In addition to the hearings mentioned heretofore, the Commission and staff members presented to the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee a general discussion of the
Commission's activities and the particular problems currently facing
the Commission. The Commission and various members of its staff
also appeared before the Anti-Monopoly Subcommittee of the Senate
Committee on the Judiciary.
In addition, various members of the
Commission and staff members testified in executive sessions of the

PART
REVISION

m

OF RULES AND FORMS

The Commission maintains a continuous program of reviewing
its rules, regulations and forms under the various acts in order to
keep abreast of constantly changing conditions in the securities industry. Apart from the periodic review conducted by certain staff
members specifically assigned to this task, the need for changes is
brought to the attention of the Commission in several different ways.
In some instances, changes are requested or suggested by investors
or by issuers, underwriters or their attorneys, accountants, or other
representatives.
Within the Commission, changes may be suggested
by members of the staff as a result of reviews of the operation of the
rules and regulations and the examination of material filed with the
Commission. In accordance with the Administrative Procedure Act,
most proposed new rules and forms are published prior to their adoption in order to obtain the views of all interested persons, including
issuers and various industry groups. During the 1957 fiscal year,
the Commission published for comment or adopted a number of proposed changes in its rules and forms which are described below.'
Proposed Revision of Rule 133 Under the Securities Act of 1933

This rule, which is in the form of a definition of the terms "sale,"
"offer," "offer to sell" and "offer for sale," operates to make the registration and prospectus requirements of the Securities Act of 1933 inapplicable to securities issued in connection with certain mergers, consolidations, reclassifications and transfers of assets between corporations. The statutory construction embodied in this rule was developed in the early days of the Commission," A review of the operation
of this rule led the Commission to conclude that the rule should be
reconsidered. Accordingly, in the latter part of 1956 the Commission
invited views and comments on a proposed revision of the rule which

would have the effect of rescinding the existing rule and substituting
therefor one which would define the above terms to include the
solicitation of a vote, consent or authorization of stockholders of a
corporation in favor of such mergers, consolidations, reclassifications and transfers of assets," A public hearing was held on the proposed revision in January, 1957 and in March the Commission announced that it would not adopt the proposed rule as published but
would give the matter further study and consideration! The matter
was still pending at the end of the fiscal year.

Ad~ption of Rule 434A and Amendment of Forms S-1 and S-9 Under the
Secnrities Act of 1933

Section 10 (b) of the Securities Act as amended in 1954 6 authorizes
the Commission to adopt rules and regulations permitting the use of
a prospectus which omits in part or summarizes information set forth
in the more complete prospectus required to be used in connection
with the sale of securities. Acting pursuant to this authority, the
Commission on November 26,1956, adopted rule 434A which permits
the use of a summary prospectus in the offering of securities registered on Forms S-1 or S-9 by registrants which are required to file
annual and other reports under section 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934.1 Summary prospectuses provided for by this
rule are not intended to supplant the complete prospectuses which
must be furnished to purchasers of securities registered under the Securities Act. The purpose of such prospectuses is to furnish prospective investors with a condensed or summarized statement of some of
the more important information contained in the registration statement so as to enable them to determine whether they would be interested in receiving more complete information in regard to the
securities being offered. Summary prospectuses thus facilitate the
dissemination of information in regard to registered securities and
also serve as a screening device which enables issuers, underwriters
and dealers to ascertain who is and who is not interested in receiving
the complete prospectus.
Forms 8-1 and S-9 were amended in connection with the adoption
of rule 434A so as to authorize the use of summary prospectuses in
connection with the offering of securities registered on these forms.
The amended instructions superseded the instructions as to newspaper
prospectuses previously contained in these forms since under the
amended instructions the two types of prospectuses are combined.
• SecurIties Act Release No. 3698 (October 2.1956).
Securities Act Release No. 8728 (December 17,1956).

Thus a summary prospectus may be published in a newspaper or
other periodical or printed in a form suitable for distribution in the
form of a circular, letter or otherwise.
Adoption of Note to Rnle 460 Under the Securities Act of 1933

The Commission is authorized by section 8 (a) of the Securities
Act to accelerate the effective date of a registration statement, having
due regard to the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer
theretofore available to the public, the facility with which investors
can understand the nature of and rights attaching to the securities
to be registered and their relationship to the capital structure of the
issuer, and to the public interest and the protection of investors.
Historically, the Commission has passed upon requests for acceleration on Ii case-by-case basis after consideration of all the pertinent
facts.
However, with the passage of time, certain of the principal
areas in which the Commission has refused acceleration have formed
a pattern.
Accordingly, the Commission submitted to the public a
proposed codification of certain of these bases upon which acceleration
might be denied," After a public hearing," the Commission adopted
as a note to rule 460 a codification of the principal grounds upon
which it would ordinarily deny acceleration of the effective date of
a registration statement,"
The note gives notice of the Commission's
policy against acceleration in certain cases where provision is made
for indemnification by the registrant o:f its officers, directors, or controlling persons against liabilities arising under the Securities Act,
where the registrant, a controlling person, or an underwriter is being
investigated for possible violation of the statutes administered by the
Commission, where an underwriter who is committed to purchase
securities does not meet certain standards of financial responsibility,
and where there have been transactions by persons connected with
the offering which may have artificially affected the market price of
the security being offered.
Rescission of Rnles 132, 151, and 414 Under the Securities Act of 1933

RuIe 132 was adopted prior to the 1954 amendments to the Securities Act of 1933 11 to provide for the use of so-called identifying
statements in connection with securities registered or in the process
of registration under that Act. Section 2 (10) (b) of the Act as
amended in 1954 gave the Commission explicit authority to adopt
rules providing for the use of substantially the same type of ad• Securities Act Release No. 3672 (August 9. 1956).

vertisements as those previously provided by rule 132. Acting pursuant to this authority the Commission adopted rule 134 in 1955.12
Inasmuch as this rule superseded rule 132, the latter was rescinded."
Rule 151 was adopted by the Commission not long after the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933. It defined for certain transactions
the term "issuance" as used in the former section 4 (3) of the Act
as in effect prior to July 1, 1934. Since the rule applied only to offerings commenced prior to that date, it had become obsolete and was
rescinded."
Rule 414 was adopted in connection with rule 132. It required the
filing with the registration statement of identifying statements proposed to be used pursuant to rule 132. With the rescission of that
rule, rule 414 no longer served any purpose and was rescinded."
Amendment of Rules 100, 170, and 426 Under the Securities Act of 1933

In the latter part of 1956, the Commission reprinted its General
Rules and Regulations under the Securities Act of 1933 using the
"section" designations of such rules in the Code of Federal Regulations." In order to avoid possible confusion between sections of the
Act and sections of the Code, rule 100 was amended by deleting
therefrom the definition of the term "section" which defined the term
as meaning a section of the Act.1T
Rule 170 was adopted some years ago to prohibit the use of pro
forma financial statements which give effect to the receipt and application of any part of the proceeds from the sale of the securities
being offered unless the entire issue is firmly underwritten.
The
rule was amended to make it clear that it is intended to permit the
use of such financial statements not only where there is a firm commitment to take the issue but also where there is no such commitment,
provided the underwriters have agreed to take all of the securities,
if any are taken, or to refund to public investors all subscription
payments made, if the underwriters elect not to take the issue.18
Rule 426 requires the inclusion in a prospectus for registered
securities of certain statements and information in regard to stabilizing activities. The rule was amended to require, in the case of a
rights offering to existing security holders, that the prospectus used
in conneetion with any reoffering of the unsubscribed securities to
the general public shall contain information in regard to transSecurities Act Release No. 3568 (August 29. 1955). See 21st Annual Report, p. 4.

actions effected by the issuer or the underwriters during the rights

Revision of Regulation A Under the Securities Act of 1933 and Withdrawal
of Proposed Ame~dments Thereto

Shortly after the beginning of the 1957 fiscal year, the Commission
adopted a revised regulation A which provides, subject to certain
terms and conditions, a general exemption for certain issues of securities not in excess of $300,000. A similar exemption provided by
regulation D for Canadian securities was merged into regulation A,
so that the regulation as currently in effect provides a general exemption for both domestic and Canadian securities." The revised
regulation A was described in some detail in the 22nd Annual
Report."
When the Commission adopted the revised regulation A, it announced that it had under consideration certain further amendments
of regulation A in addition to those contained in the revised regulation.22 These further amendments would have had the effect of making the exemption provided by that regulation available only to issuers and offerings meeting specific standards based either upon
the existence of a record of net earnings by the issuer or upon a limitation of the number of securities which might be issued pursuant to
the exemption. After further consideration of the matter, the Commission determined not to adopt these amendments. It also determined not to adopt a proposed amendment published in December
1955, which would have required the certification of financial statements filed under regulation A.23
With respect to the proposals which would restrict the use of reguIation A to seasoned companies and offerings of a limited number of
units, the Commission concluded that there is no public investor need
for the imposition of such restrictions at the present time. This conclusion was reached after considering the comments received in regard to the proposed amendments, most of which were opposed to
such amendments, and the Commission's experience in the administration of regulation A following its revision in July 1956. There
has been a reduction in the filings under regulation A and this fact
plus the Commission's stepped-up enforcement program led the Commission to believe that the problems to which these proposals related
are effectively dealt with by regulation A as presently in effect.
With respect to the proposal to require certified financial statements, the Commission concluded that, in view of the nature of the

disclosure requirements of regulation A and taking into account the
limited financial information which is available with respect to promotional companies as well as the added expense which certified
financial statements would impose on small businesses which use
that regulation, such requirement should not be imposed.
Withdrawal of Proposal To Amend Form 8-1

This proposed amendment related to the registration of securities
under the Securities Act of 1933 for the purpose of making a rights
offering to existing security holders by certain large, established foreign enterprises."
The amendment would have permitted such
issuers, with the exception of North American and Cuban issuers, to
furnish uncertified financial statements if certain conditions were
met. The proposed amendment was withdrawn when the Commission concluded that there appeared to be no present need for it.25
Proposed Revisions of ForJDS 8-2 and 8-3

Form 8-2 is used for registration under the Securities Act of 1933
of securities of commercial and industrial companies in the promotional or developmental stage. Form S-3 is a similar form for
mining companies in the exploratory or developmental stage. Revisions were proposed to bring the forms up to date in the light
of the Commission's experience and current administrative practice.26 In connection therewith, Form 8-11, another form for mining
companies in the exploratory stage, would be merged into Form S-3'
so that there would be only one form for use by this type of mining
companies. The proposed revisions were still under consideration at
the end of the fiscal year."
Amendment

of ForJDS S-4, 8-5 and 8-6

These forms are used for registration under the Securities Act of
1933 of securities of investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. A registration statement on any of
these forms consists of certain of the information and documents
which would be required in a registration statement under the Investment Company Act of 1940 if such a statement were currently being
filed. Registrants on this form are thus permitted to base their registration statements under the 19a3 Act in large part upon the information and documents filed with the Commissiou in the original
registration statement under the 1940 Act and in subsequent reports
filed thereunder. Such data are supplemented by information and

Form 8-4, which is used for registration of securities of closed-end

it into line with a revision of the corresponding basic Form N-8B-l
under the Investment Company Act!S A further amendment of this
form and of Form 8-5 was, at the end of the fiscal year, being considered in connection with the Commission's consideration of certain
proposed amendments to its Statement of Policy with respect to sales
literature used in the sale of investment company securities." The
Commission also has under consideration a proposed revision of Form
S-6 which is used for registration of securities of unit investment
trusts and securities of certain unincorporated management investment
companies."
Proposed Amendments to Statement of Policy Relating to Investment Company Sales Literature

The Commission continued during the fiscal year its consideration of
certain proposed amendments to its Statement of Policy relating to
sales literature used by investment companies registered under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The Statement of Policy was
adopted in 19!)()and was amended in January 1955. It is designed
to serve as a guide for issuers, underwriters and dealers in the preparation of such sales literature so as to avoid violation of the antifraud
provisions of section 17 of the Securities Act of 1933. A public hearing on the proposed amendments was held November 15, 1956. After
considering the testimony and after further consultation with industry representatives, a revised draft of the proposed amendments was
published in May 1957. At the close of the year the Commission was
considering the comments received as a result of the publication
of this draft and was continuing its discussion with industry representatives."

Securities Exchange Act. The principal purpose of the revision is
to conform the rule to the requirements of the Commission's existing
forms and to provide that the rule may not be used unless the registration statement filed as a part of the application for registration
contains substantially all of the information which would be required
by the appropriate application form."
The Commission also considered a proposed amendment to its
Form 10-K.35 This form is the principal form used for annual reports by listed companies and Securities Act registrants which are
subject to the reporting requirements under sections 13 and 15 (d) of
the Securities Exchange Act. The proposed amendment would require extractive enterprises to furnish such material information in
regard to their production, reserves, and other matters as might be
necessary to keep reasonably current the information previously reported in regard thereto."
Amendment of Forms 4, U-17-2

and N-30F-2

These forms are used by directors, officers and principal stockholders for monthly reports of their security transactions and holdings pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and the Investment Company
Act of 1940. On November 29, 1956, the Commission amended these
forms to require persons reporting thereon to identify purchases
made through the exercise of options and in private transactions.
The purpose of the amendment is to enable persons studying these
reports to distinguish between such purchases and purchases made on
the open market."
Amendment of Forms N-4lB-l and N-30A-l

These forms are used respectively for registration statements and
annual reports of management investment companies registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The Commission
adopted similar amendments to each of these forms governing the
computation of certain required ratios," At the close of the year
the Commission also had under consideration a further amendment to
Form N-8B-l which would require the registrant to supply certain
summarized income and expense data and certain percentage ratios

also be furnished in registration statements under the Securities' Act
of 1933 by management investment companies registering securities
under that Act.sDa
Amendment of Rule 17d-l

Under the Investment Company Act of 1940

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted amended rule 17d-1
designed to adapt the rule more closely to the language of section
17{d) of the Investment Company Act, which grants the Commission
regulatory powers with respect to profit sharing and joint venture
relationships between investment companies and their afflliates."
The prior rule had required Commission approval of pension and
bonus plans whether or not such plans involved profit sharing. The
amended rule applies only to profit-sharing arrangements.
Proposed Revision and Consolidation of Forms N-8B-2

and N-8B-3

This proposed revision and consolidation would result in a single
form for registration statements filed under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 by unit investment trusts which are currently issuing securities and by unincorporated management investment companies
which are issuing periodic payment plan certificates,"
The proposed
revision is the first general revision of these forms since they were
adopted in 1942. As a result of the experience gained over the intervening years and in view of the fact that the form is now used chiefly
by newly organized companies, it is proposed that these forms be simplified. Much of the historical information relating to the operations
of companies which were in existence at the time of the passage of
the Act is no longer of importance and hence the requirement for furnishing such information would be omitted under the proposed revision. Jnasmueh as the requirements for this form serve as a basis
for furnishing information required in registration statements under
the Securities Act of 1933, the proposed new form is being considered
with registration under that Act particularly in mind.
Adoption of Rule 17a-7 Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Rule 17a-8 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires all
registered brokers and dealers to make and keep current specified
books and records relating to their business. Rule 17a-4 provides
that such books and records shall be maintained in an easily accessible
place during specified periods. These books and records are subject
to inspection by representatives of the Commission under section 17

(a) of the Act. The above rules, however, were not specifically designed to make accessible to. the Commission the books and records of
foreign brokers and dealers registered with the Commission.
On July 16, 1956, the Commission adopted rule 17a-7 requiring
each nonresident broker or dealer, as defined in the rule, to maintain
in the United States, at a place designated by him in a written notice filed with the Commission, complete and current copies of the
books and records he is required to maintain under any rule adopted
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, unless he files with the
Commission a written undertaking, in substantially the form provided for in the rule, to furnish to the Commission upon demand
copies of any, all or any part of his books and records specified in the
demand."
Amendment of Rule 15c2-3 Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Rule 15c2-3 was adopted on January 11, 1954,43after validation
procedures for German bonds were established, to prohibit trading
in invalid West German securities. This rule made it unlawful for
any broker or dealer to effect any transaction in the over-the-counter
market in any security required to be validated under any applicable
law of the Federal Republic of Germany unless (a) such security was
duly validated, and (b) if such security was a dollar security, there
was attached a document of the Validation Board for German Dollar
Bonds certifying to the validation of such security. The rule was
amended on March 19, 1954,44to make it possible for brokers and
dealers to trade in interest coupons detached from German bonds
which had been duly validated. Subsequently information available
to the United States indicated that a considerable number of interest
coupons detached from unvalidaied German bonds were in the possession of lawful holders. It appeared that these bonds had been duly
repurchased or acquired by the German issuers, that the interest coupons were lawfully detached when the holders sold the bonds, and
that many of the bonds were among those which were stolen in Berlin
after the end of World War II. After the German Government
passed an ordinance providing for validation of ~uch coupons, the
Validation Board for German Dollar Bonds undertook to issue to
each registrant one instrument with respect to all such coupons of
the same issue since, because of administrative difficulties, it was not
possible for the Validation Board to issue separate validation instruments for each coupon. In order to legalize trading in such coupons
and to protect purchasers the Commission amended its rule 15c2-3 to
provide that when a broker-dealer effects a transaction in a validated

interest coupon detached from an unvalidated German dollar bond he
must deliver with the coupons the document of the Validation Board
certifying to the validation of such coupons."
Amendment of Rule 12f-2 Under the Securities Exchange Act.of 1934

Rule 12f-2 provides for the continuation of unlisted trading privileges granted to a security pursuant to section 12 (f) of the Act when
certain changes occur with respect to the security. Before the
amendment, the rule provided that a security admitted to unlisted
trading privileges would still be deemed to be the security theretofore admitted to such privileges even though certain specified changes
occurred, including changes in the par value, the number of shares
authorized, or the number of shares outstanding, and that in other
cases the exchange could file an application requesting the Commission to find that, notwithstanding such change, the security was substantially equivalent to such security.
On November 23, 1956, the Commission amended the rule 46 so that
if any change occurs with respect to a security which is not fully
listed and registered on another exchange and such change is accompanied by a major change in the capitalization of the issuer the
unlisted trading privileges will continue only if the Commission
finds, after application by the exchange that, notwithstanding the
change, the security is substantially equivalent to the security theretofore admitted to unlisted trading privileges. A "major change
in the capitalization of the issuer" is defined in the rule to mean one
where, by reason of one or more mergers, consolidations, acquisitions
of assets or securities, or similar transactions, not including a sale
of securities for cash, a stock dividend or a stock split, the number
of outstanding shares of stock of the issuer has been increased by
more than 100 percent within any 12 consecutive calendar months.
Proposal to Amend Rules 15b-8 and 17a-5 Under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934

On May 10, 1957 the Commission published its proposal to amend
rules 15b-8 and 17a-5 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.47
Paragraph (a) of rule 17a-5 requires each member, broker, and
dealer subject to the rule to file a report of financial condition
furnishing the information required on Form X-17A-5 within each
calendar year, but reports for any two consecutive years cannot be
filed within less than 4 months of each other. The proposed revision
of this paragraph of the rule would require reports to be filed as of

a date within each calendar year, except that: (a) The first report
(for others than successors) would have to be as of a date not less
than one nor more than 5 months after the broker or dealer becomes
subject to the rule, (b) reports could not be as of dates within 4
months of each other, and (0) a member, broker, or dealer who succeeds to and continues the business of a predecessor would not have
to file a report if the predecessor had filed a report as of that year.
Paragraph (b) (1) of the rule exempts from the certification requirements a member, broker, or dealer who is not required to file
a certified financial statement with any State agency or any national
securities exchange and who, during the preceding year, has not
made a practice of extending credit or holding funds or securities
of customers except as an incident to transactions promptly consummated by payment or delivery. In December 1955 the Commission published a proposal to amend paragraph (b) of this rule
to require all members, brokers, and dealers subject to the rule to
file certified reports." Many comments were received on this proposal suggesting that exemptions should be available to certain members, brokers, and dealers. Under the Commission's revised proposal, three limited exemptions from the requirement to file certified reports would be available. The first exemption would be
available to members of national securities exchanges who do not
transact business with the public, do not carry margin accounts,
credit balances; or securities for persons other than general partners
and are not required to file certified financial statements with the
exchange. The second would be available to a broker whose securities business is so limited that he has been exempt from the Commission's aggregate-indebtedness-net-capital-ratio
rule 15c3-1 by
paragraph (b) (1) thereof. The third exemption would be available
to a broker or dealer whose securities business is limited to buying
and selling evidences of indebtedness secured by liens on real estate
and has not carried margin accounts, credit balances, or securities
for securities customers.
Rule 15b-8 requires every broker or dealer who files an application for registration to file with his application duplicate original
statements of financial condition disclosing, as of a date within 30
days, the nature and amount of his assets, liabilities and net worth.
However, a partnership succeeding to and continuing the business
of another partnership registered as a broker or dealer at the time
of such succession is exempt from this requirement. Since the proposed revision of rule 17a-5 would exempt successor broker-dealers
from filing Form X-17A-5 reports for any calendar year as of which

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by use of the mails or instrumentalities in interstate commerce,
and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or other fraudulent practices
in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by requiring the
issuer of such securities to file with the Commission a registration
statement and related prospectus containing significant information
about the issuer and the offering. These documents are available for
public inspection as soon as they are filed. The registration statement must become "effective" before the securities may be sold to the
.public. In addition the prospectus must be furnished to the purchaser at or before the sale or delivery of the security. The registrant
and the underwriter are responsible for the contents of the registration statement. The Commission has no authority to control the
nature or quality of a security to be offered for public sale or to pass
upon its merits or the terms of its distribution, and its action in permitting a registration statement to become effective does not constitute approval of the securities.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Registration Statement and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may
be effected by filing with the Commission a registration statement on
the applicable form containing prescribed disclosures. A registration
statement must contain the information and be accompanied by the
documents specified in Schedule A of the Act, when relating to .a
security issued, generally speaking, by a corporation or other private
issuer, or those specified in Schedule B, when relating to a security
issued by a foreign government. Both schedules specify in considerable detail the disclosure which an investor should have available
in order that he may make an informed decision whether to buy the
security. In addition, the Act provides flexibility in its administration by empowering the Commission to classify issues, issuers and
prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase or in
certain instances vary or diminish the particular items of information
required to be disclosed in the registration statement as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the protection

of investors.

34

SECURITIES AND EXCIlAJ.~GE COMMISSION

In general the registration statement of an issuer other than a foreign government must describe such matters as the names of persons
who participate in the direction, management, or control of the
issuer's business; their security holdings and remuneration and options
or bonus and profit-sharing privileges alloted to them; the character
and size of the business enterprise, its capital structure, past history
and earnings, and its financial statements, certified by independent
accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters
made within two years or intended to be made; acquisitions of property not in the ordinary course of business, and the interest of directors, officers, and principal stockholders therein; pending or threatened legal proceedings; and the purpose to which the proceeds of the
offering are to be applied. The prospectus constitutes a part of the
registration statement and presents the more important of the required disclosures.
Examination

Procedure

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines each
registration statement for compliance with the standards of accurate
and full disclosure and usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment of any material respects in which the statement
appears to fail to conform to these requirements. The registrant is
thus afforded an opportunity to file a curative amendment. In addition, the Commission has power, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement. Information about the use of this "stop order"
power during 1957 appears below under "Stop Order Proceedings."
Time Required To Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission completes its analysis in the
shortest possible time. Congress provided for 20 days in the ordinary
case between the filing date of a registration statement or of an
amendment thereto and the time it may become effective. This waiting period is designed to provide investors with an opportunity to
become familiar with the proposed offering. Information disclosed
in the registration statement is disseminated during the waiting
period by means of the preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission is empowered to accelerate the effective date so as to shorten
the 20-day waiting period where the facts justify such action. In
exercising this power, the Commission is required by statute to take
into account the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer
theretofore available to the public, the facility with which investors
can understand the nature of and the rights conferred by the se.

curities to be registered, and their relationship to the capital structure
of the issuer, and the public interest and the protection of investors.
The median time which elapsed between the date of filing and the
effective date with respect to 766 registration statements that became
effective during the 1957 fiscal year 1 was 23 days, the same period as
in the preceding year. This time was divided among the three principal stages of the registration process approximately as follows:
(a) From date of filing registration statement to date of letter of
comment, 13 days; (b) from date of letter of comment to date of
filing first material amendment, 6 days; and (0) from date of filing
first amendment to date of filing final amendment and effective date
of registration, 4 days. All these days are calendar days, including
Saturdays, Sundays, and holidays.
VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

Securities effectively registered under the Securities Act during
1957 totaled $14.6 billion, the highest volume for any fiscal year in
the 23-year history of the Commission. Registrations have almost
doubled since 1953, when $7.5 billion of securities were registered,
reflecting annual increases of at least $1.5 billion over the 4-year
period. The chart below shows graphically the dollar amount of
effective registrations from 1935 to 1957.

The most important category of registrations, new issues to be

1957 as compared with $9.2 billion in 1956. For 1957, 47 percent of

stock and 4 percent preferred stock. Approximately 40 percent of
the volume of common stock represented securities of investment
companies.

REGISTRATION STATEMENTS FILED

During the 1957 fiscal year, 943 registration statements were filed

REGISTRATION PROCESS

Results obtained by the staff's examination of registration statements during 1957 are illustrated by the following examples.
Adjustments made because of dift'erences in determination of
income for tax and corporate reporting purposes.-As a general
principle, income for corporate reporting purposes is determined by
allocating revenues and related costs to the same accounting periods.
Certain provisions of the income tax laws depart from this concept.
The 'differences in treatment of various items of income and expense
for. .tax and reporting purposes continue to present problems in the

TWENTY-THIRD

ANN1JA'L REPORT

39

financial statements filed with the Commission. For example, a company claiming depreciation measured by the declining-balance method
for tax purposes included lesser amounts calculated by the straight
line method in its income statements included in a registration statement. The staff was of the view that as presented the improvement
in earnings shown in the statements over a 3-year period could be
seriously misleading. After amendment the earnings per share for
the most recent 2 years, the only years affected, were reduced to 70
percent for the last year and 87 percent for the preceding year of the
corresponding figures prior to amendment.
In another case preoperating expenses had been taken as a deduction
for income tax purposes, as permitted under the Internal Revenue
Code, but were treated as deferred charges to future operations for
purposes of reporting and therefore omitted as a current charge in
determining earnings per share. The issuer was required to reduce
the reported earnings by setting aside a reserve for income taxes related to these expenditures to be charged to income in future years but
no longer available as It deduction for taxes. The effect of this revision was to reduce the reported net income for the year 1956 to
$584,426 or $1.22 a common share, from $710,426 or $1.49 a common
share. Net for the quarter ended March 31, 1957, was reduced to
$63,232from $213,232as previously reported.
Restatement of earnings per share.- It is a common practice to
refer to earnings on a per share basis and it is essential that an
appropriate method of calculation be used and that the method used
be clearly stated. In one case a summary of earnings as originally
filed showed net income per share as $0.99 and $1.43 on corporate and
consolidated bases, respectively, for the most recent fiscal year as
compared with $0.03 and $0.39 for the preceding year. The registration statement was revised so as to show the consolidated amount for
the last year as $0.45 per share in the summary table. The corporate
amount was not shown in the summary table, but a note referred to
in the table in respect of the last year stated that net income per
share excluded a special credit, gain on sales of securities, amounting
to $0.99 per share, based on shares outstanding at the end of the fiscal
year, or amounting to $0.64 per share based upon shares to be outstanding as of the time of the public offering of additional shares (i. e., giving effect to conversion of certain debentures into common shares).
The note also disclosed that giving effect to conversion of debentures as
though effective at the beginning of the year, with adjustment for
interest on the debentures and related income tax effect, the $0.45
consolidated net income per share would have declined to $0.84 per
share, and on a corporate only basis would have been $0.05 per share.
In Summary, the investor obtained a picture of $0.34 net income per

40

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

share plus $0.64 special credit gain on sales of securities per share for
the last year, as compared with a net income per share figure of $1.43
as originally presented.
Adjustments in provision for depletion of oil and gas properties.-A filing under the Securities Act by a Canadian oil and gas
company included summaries of earnings which showed that the
registrant and subsidiaries, and an acquired company and its subsidiaries, had substantially higher net income in 1956 than in 1955.
In fact, substantial losses were reported for 1954 and 1955 and substantial profits for 1956. A study of the items in the summary indicated that the improvement reported was in large measure due to the
fact that the registrant's statement showed a negative or credit provision for depletion in 1956 of $62,000 compared with a charge of
$220,000 in 1955, and the acquired group's statement showed 1956
depletion charges of approximately 30 percent of the 1955 charges.
It was ascertained by the staff, that, because in 1956 estimates of recoverable oil were materially increased by new discoveries, the companies considered that provisions for depletion in prior years had
been excessive and the cumulative adjustment was reflected in the
1956 income statements. The staff took the position that annual depletion charges should be based upon known reserves, and that additional reserves discovered thereafter should be made the basis for
determining future depletion charges as oil is recovered .therefrom,
based upon adjusted costs. The financial statements were amended
in accordance with the staff's view. As a result the registrant's originally reported consolidated net income of $132,000 was converted to
a loss of $93,000and the net income of the acquired group was reduced
from the originally reported $447,000 to $300,000. As originally
filed the pro forma combined summary of earnings showed net income
of 8.33 cents per share. As adjusted, earnings were 2.98 cents per
share.
STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS

Section 8 (d) provides that, if it appears to the Corrimission at
any time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, the Commission may institute proceedings looking to the issuance
of a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement. Where such an order is issued, the offering cannot lawfully
be made, or continued if it has already begun, until the registration
statement has been amended to cure the deficiencies and the Commission has lifted the stop order. During the 1957 fiscal year 10
new proceedings were authorized by the Commission under section
R (d) of the Act and 7 such proceedings were continued from the

TWENTY-THIRD

AN1\TUALREPORT

41

preceding year. In connection with these 17 proceedings 8 stop
orders were issued during the year, one proceeding was terminated
and the registration statement permitted to become effective, and
one proceeding was terminated by withdrawal of the registration
statement. The remaining seven cases were pending as of June 30,
1957.
Two proceedings in which stop orders were issued with respect to
registration statements filed by American Republic Investors, Inc.,
and Uranium Properties, Ltd., were described in the 22d Annual
Report," The other six proceedings which resulted in the issuance
of stop orders during the year are described below, as well as a
seventh proceeding in which a stop order was issued shortly after
the end of the fiscal year.
Wyoming Gulf.Sulphur Corporation.-This
corporation filed a
registration statement with the Commission relating to a proposed
public offering by the corporation of 700,000shares for its own account
and 226,000 shares for the account of two stockholders. After hearings the Commission issued an order pursuant to section 8 (d) of the
Securities Act of 1933 suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement on the basis of findings that, among other things, the corporation failed to disclose in the registration statement the limited experience of management in marketing its product and the limited
nature of the potential market for its product,"
The corporation proposed to produce and market "soilaid," which
was obtained by treating the sulphur-bearing ores on the properties
containing about 16 percent sulphur so as to increase the sulphur
content to not less than 25 percent. This product can be used on
certain soils in the western part of the United States for the purpose
of causing them to become friable and permeable to water. Gypsum,
in abundant supply in the west, is also used for this purpose. Although the corporation's stated plans were to produce 400 tons a day
in one of its plants and 1,000 tons a day in a plant proposed to be
constructed with part of the funds obtained from £he proposed financing, only a very limited amount of sulphur-bearing ore had been
treated and in the year 1954 only 18,221 tons of sulphur were used
for soil-treatment purposes in the entire United States. This information and the fact that because of transportation costs it would be
cheaper for a purchaser residing in the west to obtain sulphur from
the Gulf Ports of .Texas than to purchase the product from the corporation were either not disclosed in the registration statement or inadequately presented.

OOMll.11'SSION

The Commission also found that the proposed method of distribution of the securities was misleading. Since the bid and asked price
of the securities at the time the registration statement was filed was
around $1 and the proposed offering price was to be not less than $2
a share, the Commission found that "it seems clear that the stock could
not be sold at $2 a share except by misrepresentations or other fraudulent means, unless the market rose appreciably." In this connection,
the Commission cited the fact that a few days before the registration
statement was filed with the Commission, a broker-dealer firm with
which a vice president of the corporation was associated circulated a
grossly false and misleading "special report" recommending the purchase of the registrant's stock.
Other areas in which the corporation either failed to disclose material information or inadequately presented information, included the
use of the proceeds from the offering, transactions with promoters,
and the history of the unsuccessful operation of the properties.
Beta Frozen Food Storage, Inc.-This
registrant was organized
in Maryland in April 1956 for the purpose of constructing and operating a frozen food storage warehouse near Baltimore. It proposed to offer through its officers, directors, employees and stockholders, and possibly also through selected brokers and dealers,
$1,750,000 principal amount of debentures at $100 per debenture.
The debentures were to be convertible into preferred stock. After
deduction of $15 per debenture, or $262,500, as selling commission.
and expenses of $50,000, net proceeds to the registrant were estimated
to be $1,437,500. Registrant was virtually without assets and was
looking entirely to the proceeds of this financing for its capital
requirements.
In connection with the proceedings brought under section 8 (d)
it was alleged that the registration statement failed. to provide adequate disclosure of the registrant's position and plans in case proceeds were inadequate to make its projected warehouse a reality since
there was no firm commitment by an underwriter or any person to purchase all or any part of the securities and hence no assurance as to
what amount of proceeds might be received; that registrant minimized or ignored competitive conditions in the industry in which it
was about to embark, falsely claiming a large demand for its specific
services based upon a nonexistent "survey," and grossly misrepresenting its outlook even to the point of predicting with little or no
basis except optimism "a gross profit of over $500,000 per year after
all salaries, wages, and maintenance and costs of operations"; that
the registration statement failed to disclose that all of the common
stock equity in the corporation was to be sold to officers and directors
for an amount not in excess of $2,500; and that the registration state-

TWENTY-THIm>

ANNUAL REPORT

ment misrepresented the business experience of the officers and
directors.
After testimony was taken at a hearing registrant consented to
the entry of a stop order suspending the effectiveness of its registration statement and such an order was entered." Subsequently
registrant filed an amendment to the registration statement purporting to correct the inadequacies and misrepresentations therein.
After consideration of the amendment the Commission found that
inadequacies and misrepresentations still existed, and the stop order
continues in effect.
.
Freedom Insurance Compauy.-This
registrant was organized in
California in 1954 for the purpose of selling all types of insurance
except life, title, and mortgage insurance. Under a registration
statement which became effective December 22, 1955, 500,000 shares
of common stock were offered at $22 per share. On July 12, 1956,
proceedings pursuant to section 8 (d) were instituted. Included in
the allegations made with respect to the registration statement were
questions as to the adequacy and accuracy of disclosure therein of
the financial resources of a corporation controlled by the promoters
of the registrant which was to perform selling and service functions
for the registrant, and the amount of the commission to be received
by such corporation under a sales and service contract on insurance
written by the registrant.
After hearings were commenced and testimony was taken, the registrant submitted a written stipulation and consent to the entry of
an order by the Commission pursuant to section 8 (d) suspending
the effectiveness of its registration statement and such order was
entered on the basis of findings and an opinion by the Commission."
The registration statement was subsequently amended in accordance
with the order and the stop order was Iifted."
Ultrasonic Corporation.-At
the close of the previous fiscal year,
the Commission had under advisement the record in the matter of
the stop order proceedings pursuant to section 8 (d) relating to a
registration statement filed by Ultrasonic Corporation (now named
Advance Industries, Inc:), as described in the 22d Annual Report,
pages 79-80. The filing covered a public offering of 200,000 shares
of common stock at $12.75, with net proceeds to the Company of
approximately $2,300,000, in addition to common stock issuable on
the exercise of warrants and the conversion of certain outstanding
bonds and debentures. The registration statement became effective
on July 22, 1954, the shares offered for cash were sold and the com• Securitillll Act Release No. 3899 (October 2,1956).

pany received the net proceeds from the underwriters.
All amendment relating to the offering and exercise price of certain warrants
was filed on August 23, 1954, and was declared effective on August
25, 1954-,

On January 18, 1951, a stop order was issued.' The record of the
proceedings showed that numerous improper adjustments on the Company's books and omissions to make necessary adjustments produced
completely unrealistic financial statements, and were the result of a
deliberate design to present optimistic figures. It was found that the
statement of income for the 6 months ended March 31, 1954, which
. was furnished unaudited in the registration statement, was substantially inaccurate and misleading in that the $49,715 profit reported
for that period was at least $900,000 in excess of the amount that
should have been shown. Among adjustments which should have
been made for that period were provisions for reserves to reduce income by $317,435 for redetermination of profits on a Government contract, for profit adjustments downward on other Government contracts, and for losses. Also cost of sales of goods manufactured by
one of the divisions of the company was reflected in the income statement for the 6 months ended March 31, 1954, on a percentage of sales
basis which was entirely unjustified. There did not appear to be actual recent support in the experience of the company for the selection
of the percentage amount of 77.3 percent used in estimating the ratio
of cost of sales to sales. The cost of sales for the 6 months' period as
computed on the improper formula of 77.3 percent of sales of the-division for the period amounted to $744,175, as compared to $936,436, as
determined by the comptroller of the company from the cost books.
Additional items questioned included inventory items not written off,
expense items improperly capitalized, and expense liabilities not
entered.
The registration statement was also deficient in failing to disclose
operating losses incurred after March 31, 1954. Profit and loss data
compiled by the accounting department of the company available
prior to the time the registration statement became effective July 22,
1954, indicated operating losses for the months of May and June 1954
aggregated $485,805. A later profit and loss statement showing losses
for May, June, and July 1954 totaling $800,182 was given to the management on August 19, 1954, before the post-effective amendment to
the registration statement was filed. The management was chargeable with knowledge that registrant was incurring large operating
losses during this period.
Universal Service Corporation, Inc.-This company, a Texas corporation, filed a registration statement covering a proposed public

offering of 500,000 shares of its 2-cent par value common stock at
$2.50 Per share, for the purpose of financing the exploration and,
if warranted, the mining of uranium, quicksilver, and other minerals, as well as gas and oil. The Commission issued a stop order
for the reasons indicated below,"
The disclosures respecting the existence of minerals in the registrant's property consisted primarily of report'S by a consulting
engineer and geologist which were included in exhibits to the registration statement and were quoted at length in the prospectus. The
Commission found that the reports were essentially misleading and
the use of the information therein in the prospectus was deceptive
to investors. The survey made by the geologist covered 68 square
miles and only a small area in a certain section was further explored.
The few samples taken from the explored area were handpicked and
showed no evidence warranting a reasonable belief that minable uranium existed. The references to the relatively high uranium content
of the selected samples, and to ore bodies and ore stockpiling were unjustified. The reports also referred to the existence of oil-bearing
boulders and claimed that they are direct evidence that oil-bearing
strata exist at depth.
This conclusion appeared to be wholly
unwarranted.
The Commission also found the registration statement deficient
in other respects. It stated that the registrant might retain an underwriter and pay a commission not to exceed 20 percent but failed
to disclose who the underwriter would be. In respect of the application of proceeds, the registration statement set forth a rough itemization of the manner in which the proceeds of the offering :were to
be spent but failed to indicate a basis for considering that so large
a sum as $1,250,000 could reasonably be expended in connection with
further work on the property. The registration statement also failed
to disclose possible civil liabilities resulting from the sale of its
securities in violation of the Securities Act.
American Investors Corporation.- The registrant, a Tennessee insurance company holding corporation, filed a registration statement
covering 4,962,500 shares of $1 par common stock to be offered at $2,
of which 962,500 shares were reserved for issuance upon exercise of
options to be granted by registrant.
Deficiencies constituting grounds
for issuance of the stop order cited in the Commission's opinion included failure to disclose (1) the plan and terms of the proposed
distribution by five promoters, four of whom were undisclosed, and
the commssions to be reallowed to sub-agents; (2) that the purpose
in setting up the holding company was to allow management greater
latitude in the investment of funds than would be permitted to an

insurance company under state law; (3) that registrant had no present
need for the total anticipated proceeds of $7,200,000 sought, and no
present plans for the use of such proceeds other than to use $300,000
to organize an operating insurance company subsidiary and to invest
in debentures, high grade securities, and nonadmitted assets for the
subsidiary; (4) that none of the persons presently associated with
registrant had any experience in the management of an investment
portfolio or in the management of insurance companies; and (5) that
options covering from 5,000 to 25,000 shares had been promised to
prominent persons without cost in order to secure their association
with registrant for the major purpose of facilitating the sale of its
securities to the public,"
Republic Cement Corporation.-This
registrant was a Delaware
corporation organized for the purpose of constructing and operating
a cement plant of 1 million barrel annual capacity near the town of
Drake, Ariz. The registration statement covered a proposed offering
of 1,050,000shares of $10 par value capital stock at $10 per share.
After hearings the Commission found that the registrant had failed
to disclose that its proposed annual output of gray cement combined
with that of a presently producing plant in its market area would
far exceed any past or present market demand and that the existing
plant had not been operating at full capacity. It further found
that the registrant's proposed output of white cement exceeded 25
percent of the annual consumption of that product in the entire
United States. The company's plant construction cost figures were
determined to be much lower than those of its competitors because
certain installations which are normally part of a cement plant were
to be eliminated, and the registrant had not provided for sufficient
storage capacity for its finished product. The Commission also found
that despite the representation in the prospectus that the registrant
had on its properties 1,851,300,000tons of limestone suitable for the
production of cement, only the most rudimentary type of exploration
had been performed on the properties, and no systematic core drilling
or sampling was used to test the continuity, depth, and quality of the
limestone.
The Commission further found that approximately 60 stockholders
who were designated as ''promoters'' were not in fact promoters as
they had not rendered any promotional services, and that the sales
of stock to them were not exempt under section 4 (1) as claimed and
were in violation of section 5 of the Securities Act.

EXAMINATIONS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by section 8 (e) of the Act to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop-order proceeding should be instituted under section 8 (d). For this purpose the
Commission is empowered to subpoena witnesses and require the
production of pertinent documents. During the 1957 fiscal year the
Commission authorized four private examinations pursuant to this
section of the Act. One additional private examination was pending
from the previous fiscal year. As of June 30,1957, one of the examinations was still pending, one had resulted in the withdrawal of the
registration statement after the institution of stop-order proceedings
under section 8 (d), two had resulted in the issuance of stop orders,
and one had been closed and the registration statement concerned
was permitted to become effective.
The Commission is also authorized by section 20 (a) of the Act to
make an investigation to determine whether any provisions of the
Act or of any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder have been or
are about to be violated. The Commission has instituted investigations under this section as an expeditious means of determining
whether a registration statement is false or misleading or omits to state
any material fact. During the 1957 fiscal year twelve such investigations were instituted. Two of such proceedings resulted in the institution of stop-order proceedings under section 8 (d) of the Act, one was
closed and the registration statement involved became effective, one
resulted in the registration statement being withdrawn, and the other
eight were pending at the end of the fiscal year.
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMALL ISSUES

Under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, the Commission is empowered from time to time by its rules and regulations, and subject
to such terms and conditions as it may prescribe therein, to add any
class of securities to the securities specifically exempted by section
3 (a) of the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the registration
provisions of the Act with respect to such additional securities is not
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors
by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of
the public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of
$300,000 upon any exemption provided by the Commission in the
exercise of this power.

Exempt

Offerings

Under

Regulation

A

The Commission's regulation A implements section 3 (b) of the
Securities Act of 1933 and permits a company to obtain not exceeding
$300,000 (including underwriting commissions) of needed capital in
anyone year :from a public offering of its securities if the company complies with the regulation. Upon complying with the regulation, a
company is exempt from the registration provisions of the Act. A
regulation A filing consists of a notification supplying basic information about the company, certain exhibits, and an offering circular
which is required to be used in offering the securities except in the
case of a company with an earnings history which is making an
offering not in excess of $50,000.
During the 1957 fiscal year, 919 notifications were filed under
regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $167,26D,900, compared
with 1,463 notifications covering proposed offerings of $273,471,548
in the 1956 fiscal year. Included in the 1957 total were 74 notifications covering stock offerings of $14,133,702 with respect to companies engaged in the exploratory oil and gas business, and 106
notifications covering offerings of $18,955,358 by mining companies.
The 106 filings by mining companies included 59 by uranium companies with proposed offerings aggregating $10,324,1!)2and 47 offern

reduction in the number of regulation A filings during the 1957fiscal
year was primarily due to substantially fewer filings by highly speculative mining companies, particularly uranium companies.

Most of the under writings were undertaken by commercial underwriters, who participated in 252 offerings in 1957, 528 in 1956, and
671 in 1955. The remaining cases where commissions were paid were
handled by officers, directors, or other persons not regularly engaged
in the securities business, who received remuneration therefor.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation D

From July 1, 1956, to August 27, 1956, the last date on which a
filing under regulation D could be made, 6 notifications were filed
under that regulation by Canadian issuers covering proposed offerings of $1,049,000. Three of these filings were made by uranium
companies. In the 1956 fiscal year there were 15 notifications filed
under regulation D covering proposed offerings of $3,367,735. After
the adoption of the revised regulation A there were, during the remainder of the 1957 fiscal year 6 notifications filed by Canadian
issuers for offerings aggregating $1,488,000. These figures are included in the regulation A totals.
Denial or Suspension of Exemption

Regulation A provides for the denial or suspension of an exemption thereunder, generally speaking, where the exemption is sought
for securities for which the regulation provides no exemption or
where the offering is not made in accordance with the terms and C0l1H7a711-G8-a

During the 1957 fiscal year, denial or suspension orders were issued
in 132 cases. During the 1956 fiscal year, 100 such orders were issued.
The names of the companies involved in the orders issued during the
1957 fiscal year are set forth in table 6 of the appendix. A few cases
are summarized below to illustrate the misrepresentations and other
noncompliance with the regulation which led to the issuance of suspension orders.
Commission tempoBackers Discount & Finance Co., Inc.-The
rarily suspended the regulation A exemption because of misleading
statements in the notification, offering circular and sales literature,
and the failure to file sales literature and reports of sales. It was
asserted in the suspension order that, among other matters, an announcement of the declaration of a quarterly dividend to stockholders which was used in connection with the offering was misleading in that there was a failure to state that the issuer's officers,
directors, and insiders had agreed to forego dividends on their holdings in order that a dividend could be paid on shares sold under
the filing and that the available earnings and surplus were insufficient
to pay the entire dividend.
Electronic Micro-Ledger Accounting Corp.-The
temporary suspension order entered in this case alleged, among other things, that
the offering circular and other sales literature did not accurately
describe the license agreement that the issuer claimed to have, the
market price for the issuer's stock, the uses to which the proceeds of
the offering were to be put, or the issuer's proposed operations and
plans.
Glory Hole, Inc.-In its order temporarily suspending the issuer's
offering, the Commission stated that it had reasonable cause to believe that the use of the offering circular would operate as a fraud
and deceit upon purchasers. Among the matters asserted in the
order were the failure to disclose the background and record of the
promoter, the past activities of the promoter and his associates in
predecessor cornpanies.jind the results of other attempts to operate the
same properties which were represented to be under purchase contract by the issuer.
North Country Uranium & Minerals, Ltd., and Hawker Uranium
Mines, Ltd.-The Commission issued its findings, opinion and order
during the 1957 fiscal year in consolidated proceedings under regulation D making permanent its orders temporarily suspending and
denying, respectively, exemptions from registration with respect to

TWENTY-THIRD

Al\TNUAiL REPORT

51

public offerings by North Country and Hawker," It found that the
two issuers were under common control and therefore the exemption
was not available for the two offerings since the applicable $300,000
limitation within one year was exceeded. The Commission also found
the notifications and offering circulars of the two issuers to be materially misleading in failing to disclose the common control and the status
and activities of the president and controlling stockholder of Hawker
in promoting North Country, in the acquisition and transfer of the
North Country claims, in the formation and financing of that company and in the conduct of its business.
Underwriters Factors Corp.-In
its order temporarily suspending
the exemption, the Commission alleged that in addition to failing to
comply with the requirements of the regulation by not disclosing
all the jurisdictions in which the securities were to be offered and
making use of unfiled sales literature, the offerors of the securities
made use of false and misleading literature and oral statements. The
misrepresentations related to the company's profits, the safety of investments in the factoring business, the dividend record of such businesses and the changes in the market price for the issuer's securities
that could be expected.
Universal Petroleum Exploration & Drilling Co.-In
its order
temporarily suspending the exemption, the Commission alleged that
the material filed under regulation A was false and misleading and
failed to disclose required information concerning the creation and
promotion of another corporation having the same principal promoter, officers, and directors as the issuer, for the purpose of constructing and exploiting the same device as the issuer. In addition
the filed material contained misleading statements concerning the
marketability of the stock, the undertaking of the president to devote
his services to the issuer, the issuer's rights to construct certain drilling rigs and the cost of constructing such rigs.
U-H Uranium Corp.-On
the basis of a stipulated record, the
Commission permanently suspended the exemption from registration
after finding that the issuer had commenced the offering prior to the
time permitted by the regulation, delivered offering circulars which
differed from the circular on file, and made false and misleading
statements concerning, among other things, the value of the issuer's
properties, the nature of uranium deposits, and the qualifications of
its geologist. In addition the Commission found that the offering
was advertised in newspapers, by pamphlets, post cards and over
television without copies of such material having been first filed with
the Commission as required by the regulation."

LITIGATION UNDER SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

The Securities Act empowers the Commission to apply to the
courts for injunctions when necessary to protect the public from
damage which may result from continued or threatened violations of
the Act. As in former years, threatened violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act have required considerable attention in the enforcement efforts of the Commission.
One of the most significant cases in recent years involving the
registration provisions of the Securities Act was S. E. O. v. Swan-

TWENTY-THilln

A1\,KUAL REPORT

53

Finch Oil Corporation, et al.
The Commission's complaint alleged that the defendants had violated and were about to violate section 5 of the Securities Act by offering and selling common stock of
Swan-Finch Oil Corp. to members of the public without having a
registration in effect with the Commission as required by the Act.
Affidavits filed in support of the Commission's motion for a temporary restraining order, which was entered by the court, indicated
that since 1954, when defendant Lowell M. Birrell apparently acquired control of Swan-Finch, the number of Swan-Finch common
shares outstanding increased from approximately 94,000 to approximately 2,800,000 as of January 31, 1957. The original shares had
been registered and listed on the American Stock Exchange. The
affidavits recited that the shares representing the increased capitalization were purportedly issued in exchange for the assets of various
corporations. These additional shares, the Commission alleged, were
then distributed to the public through various American and Canadian broker-dealers and financial firms. It was the contention of the
defendants that section 4 (1) of the Securities Act or rule 133 as
promulgated by the Commission exempted these transactions from
the registration requirements of the Act. Out of the 24 defendants
in this proceeding all but 3 consented to the entry of a final injunction
prior to the close of the fiscal year.
In the related proceedings of S. E. O. v. Doeskin Products, Inc.,
et al./5 the Commission charged a similar unlawful distribution of
Doeskin stock. Five of the seven defendants in that case consented
to the entry of a permanent injunction prior to the close of the fiscal
year.
.
In S. E. O. v. The Sire Plan Inc., and Albert lIfintze1',16 the Commission's complaint charged the defendants with offering and selling
approximately $325,000 in face amount of 9-month, 8-percent Sire
Plan Funding Notes without having a registration in effect as required
by section 5 of the Securities Act, and with having offered the notes by
means of untrue statements of material facts and omissions to state
material facts. The offers and sales were purportedly made under
the exemption from registration provided in section 3 (a) (3) of the
Act for short-term notes arising from current transactions, but it was
the Commission's contention that Congress did not intend to permit the
widespread sale of securities to the investing public in order to provide
capital for business ventures without compliance with the full and fair
disclosure requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The complaint
also charged that in offering notes the defendants referred, among

other things, to "security" and "collateral" when in fact the notes had
no collateral and were not secured."
In S. E. O. v. Miero-Moisture Oontrols, Inc., et al.,I8 another injunctive action instituted by the Commission dealing with violations
of the registration provisions, 7 registered broker-dealer firms as well
as 9 other persons and companies were named as defendants. The
affidavits filed by the Commission in support of its complaint recited,
among other things, that originally, in January 1953, Micro-Moisture
had an authorized capital of 2 million shares of common stock with
a par value of 1 cent per share. In January 1957, it had an authorized
capitalization of 7 million shares of common stock, of which 5 million
were outstanding. Except for 2 filings under the regulation A exemption from the registration provisions which covered a total of 310,000
shares, none of the corporation's shares were registered with the Commission. The increased number of outstanding shares, according to
the affidavits, resulted from an exchange of assets of Converters Acceptance Corp. of Canada for stock of Micro-Moisture, and a subsequent public distribution by certain controlling stockholders of MicroMoisture through the defendant broker-dealer firms and two residents
of Canada who were also named as defendants. The defendants
claimed that each of these transactions was exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act by virtue of the provisions
of section 4 (1) or rule 133. The court entered a preliminary injunction as to all 16 defendants.
A public distribution without registration in violation of the
Securities Act through residents of Canada and qthers was also
alleged in the complaint and affidavits filed by the Commission in
S. E. O. v. Ben FrarJclin Oil and Gas Oorporation, et
A temporary restraining order was issued by the court on motion of the
Commission.
A complaint was filed in the United States District Court for the
Northern District of Illinois, seeking to enjoin Gerald L. Reasor and
John D. Karstrom, Jr.,20 from selling fractional undivided interests
in oil and gas rights on properties located in more than 10 States
when no registration statement with respect to such securities was in
effect. The matter was pending at the end of the fiscal year. An
injunction was obtained upon similar charges in S. E. O. v. Horace
E. Watkins, doing business as Watkins Oil Oompany, et al.21

Injunctions were obtained in two cases involving investment contracts or profit-sharing arrangements. In one of these cases, S. E. O.
v, J-T -J Oompany, bu:.,22 the defendants had been offering and
selling, without registration, investment contracts relating to automobile trailers sold by the company under an arrangement by which
the company would operate and service the trailers for purchasers
under a profit-sharing arrangement. In the second case, S. E. O. v,
Mortgage Olub« Inc. and Oharles I. He1'skman,23 the complaint and
affidavits filed in conjunction with it alleged that the defendants
had offered and sold, without registration, investment contracts
evidenced by participations as club members in the placing of funds
ranging from $100 to $500 into secured small second mortgage loans
through Mortgage Clubs, Inc. In each case the defendants consented to the entry of final judgment.
In S. E. O. v, Oregon Timber Products 00., Inc., et al.24the defendants had made a filing under regulation A in connection with the
proposed offering but had used sales material in the solicitation
mailings which was not filed as required by the regulation. The
Commission alleged, among other things, that the defendants mailed
brochures and other material to 23,000 corporate executives and
directors in 18 States, soliciting the purchase of shares of the defendant corporation, without filing such material with the Commission.
A preliminary injunction has been entered as to the company and
Hubert I. O'Rourke, its president.
In S. E. O. v, J. Tom Grimmzett,f5 the Commission alleged that
Grimmett, president of American States Oil Co., received 5,391,666
of the company's 6 million authorized shares, and, since organization
of the company, sold to and through various securities dealers and
otherwise disposed of, without registration, approximately 4 million
shares of his personally owned stock. A final judgment by default
enjoining the defendant from further violations of the registration
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 was issued by the Court.
Final judgments permanently enjoining further violations of the
registration provisions of the Securities Act were also entered in

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMM!SS'ION

The Commission had one of its busiest years in connection with
its enforcement of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act.
Many of the cases brought by the Commission to stop further fraudulent activities also involved violations of the registration provisions
of the Act.
The brokerage firm of Ilurd, Jaewin ill Oosta, Inc., 30 was charged
by the Commission with fraud in the sale and distribution of stock
of Sergeant Marty Snyder Foods, Inc. According to the complaint,
the defendant had been falsely representing, among other things,
that President Eisenhower would do everything in his power to see
that Sergeant Marty Snyder's beef stew would be used by the armed
services, that President Eisenhower had endorsed it and that the beef
stew was the only product President Eisenhower had ever endorsed.
The complaint also alleged that the defendant had made several misrepresentations concerning the present and prospective market for the
Sergeant Marty Snyder products. The court entered a preliminary
illjunction with the consent of the defendant.
In S. E. O. v. Kaiser Development Oorporation Limited and. E.
David N ovelle,31 the Commission charged violations of the anti-fraud
and registration provisions of the Securities Act in connection with the
offer and sale of the capital stock of a Canadian corporation to United
States residents. It was alleged, among other things, that, in connection with the offer and sale of the defendant company's unregistered
stock, false and misleading statements were made by means of flamboyant bulletins, sales letters, reports, and brochures, and long-distance telephone calls from Regina, Canada. The statements concerned a guarantee to refund investments, the listing of the stock on
a Canadian stock exchange, the present and future market for the
shares, the results of exploration on the company's properties and the
company's practice of acquiring proven properties."
In other cases, the Commission again sought the assistance of the
courts to restrain fraud in the offer and sale of interests in oil and
gas rights to the public. In S. E. O. v. Mansfield Petroleum and Development (Iorporatioti and William O. Snowden,33 the defendants
were enjoined from making false representations and omitting to
state material facts concerning the escrowing of funds received from
investors pending the drilling of an oil well in a non producing oil and
gas tract in Nebraska.

and undivided fractional interests in oil, gas and other mineral rights
of the defendant company was enjoined. It appeared that the defendants had, among other things, made misrepresentations concerning the market price of its stock. A final judgment was also obtained
by the Commission, permanently enjoining Eldon L. Jewett and Perr
Oil Oompany 35 from further violating the anti-fraud and registration
provisions of the Securities Act in connection with the offer and sale
of interests in oil leases. Additional details of this proceeding are
contained in the 22nd Annual Report. In each case, the defendants
consented to the entry of the judgment. In the last two cases, the
defendants were also enjoined from further violations of the registration provisions of the Act.
The Commission took steps in S. E. O. v, Dealers Dlsoount and
Investment Oompany, et al.,36 to stop the offer and sale of securities
through the use of misleading comparisons. The defendants had
been comparing the capitalization, management, past operations, and
type and extent of the business of the issuers of the offered securities
with that of well-known established companies. The court permanently enjoined the defendants, who consented to the decree, from
further use of such comparisons in violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Act.
Threatened fraud in connection with the sale of securities of insurance companies was the subject of S. E. O. v, Southern Ohristian 001'poration, O. L. Edmonds, Earl E. Holliday and James T. Southerlatui S7 and S. E. O. v, Professional Investors, Inc., Insurance 001'poratioti of America, Ray O. Vaughn and lIfark H. Kroll;"
In the
Southern Ohristian case, the Commission filed a complaint alleging,
among other things, that the defendants had been offering and selling subscriptions and interim certificates for shares of common stock
in Southern Christian Life Insurance Co., a proposed Oklahoma corporation, and, in connection therewith, had been making untrue statements concerning the company's income prospects, the requirements of
the insurance laws, and the success records of other life-insurance
companies. A final judgment permanently enjoining such conduct
was entered by the court. The defendants in the Professional Investor's case were permanently enjoined from selling the common stock of
the defendant Insurance Company of America without disclosing to
prospective purchasers that the same stock could be obtained in the
market from broker-dealers at prices which were less than that at
which the defendants had been offering and selling such stock.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE ACT

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides for the registration
and regulation of securities exchanges, and the registration of securities listed on such exchanges and it establishes, for issuers of securities
so registered, financial and other reporting requirements, regulation
of proxy solicitations, and requirements with respect to trading by
directors, officers and principal security holders. The Act also provides for the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers doing
business in the over-the-counter market, contains provisions designed
to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices
on the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and authorizes
the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the use of credit in securities
transactions. The purpose of these statutory requirements is to ensure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

At the close of 1957, 14 stock exchanges were registered under the
Exchange Act as national securities exchanges: .
American Stock Exchange.
Boston Stock Exchange.
Chicago Board of Trade.

Midwest Stock Exchange.
New Orleans Stock Exchange.
New York Stock Exchange.

Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.
Philadelphia-Baltimore

became effective December 31, 1D5G, on which date the registrations
of the other two exchanges were withdrawn.
Disciplinary Actions

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission dISciplinary actions taken against members for violations of the
Securities Exchange Act or exchange rules. During the year 8 exchanges reported 42 cases of such disciplinary action. The actions
taken included fines in 12 cases, expulsion of 2 individuals from exchange membership, suspension of 5 individuals and censure of
individuals and firms.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

It is unlawful for a member of a national securities exchange or
a broker or dealer to effect any transaction in a security on such exchange unless the security is registered on that exchange under the
Securities Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration. In
general the Act exempts from registration obligations issued or
guaranteed by a State or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt
rules and regulations exempting such other securities as the Commission may find it necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public
interest or :for the protection o:f investors. Under this authority the
Commission has exempted securities o:f certain banks, certain securities secured by property or leasehold interests, certain warrants,
and, on a temporary basis, certain securities issued in substitution
for or in addition to listed securities.
Section 12 of the Exchange Act provides that an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. An application requires the
furnishing of information in regard to the issuer's business, capital
structure, the terms of its securities, the persons who manage or
control its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors,
the allotment of options, bonuses and profit-sharing plans, and
financial statements certified by independent accountants.
Form 10 is the form used Tor registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit,
and securiti.es of forei.gn governments.
Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration. These periodic reports include annual reports, semiannual reports, and current (monthly)
reports. The principal annual report form is Form 10-K which is

TWENTY-THIRD

61

AN.J\"'UALREPORT

designed to keep up to date the information furnished on Form 10.
Semiannual reports required to be furnished on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to :furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports
on Form 8-K are required to be filed for each month in which any
of certain specified events have occurred. A report on this form
deals with matters such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions or dispositions o:f assets, the institution or termination of important legal proceedings, and important changes in the
issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
As of June 30, 1957, a total of 2,256 issuers had 3,730 classes of
securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges of
which 2,667 were classified as stocks and 1,063 as bonds. Of the
2,256 issuers, 1,278 had 1,520 stock issues and 1,019 bond issues listed
and registered on the New York Stock Exchange. On a percentage
basis, the New York Stock Exchange had 57 percent of the total of
both issuers and stock issues and 96 percent of the total bond issues,
During the fiscal year 1957, a total of 83 issuers listed and
registered securities for the first time on a national securities exchange
and the listing and registration of all securities of 80 issuers was
terminated during the year. The number of applications filed ,lor
registration of various classes of securities on exchanges during the
year was 232.
The following table shows the number of annual, semiannual, and
current reports filed during the year by issuers having securities
listed and registered on national securities exchanges. The table also
shows the number of such reports filed under section 15 (d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuers obligated to file such reports by reason of their undertaking contained in one or more registration statements effective under the Securities Act of 1933for the public
offering of securities. As of June 30, 1957, there were 1,274 such
issuers, including 188 also registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940.

shares, or 92.4 percent of the total, were listed on registered exchanges,

Assets of Companies With Listed Common Stocks

As shown above, there were 2,044 common stock issues with an
aggregate market value of about $223 billion listed on registered exchanges as of December 31, 1956. The assets of the 2,027 issuers
involved were in the vicinity of $250 billion. Figures published by
the New York Stock Exchange covering 1,071 companies with 1,077
common stock issues and with assets of about $234.2 billion are used
in this compilation, the amount of assets being revised slightly upward because they were stated to be for the year-end 1955 for the
most part. Data for the remaining exchanges are from fiscal year
reports on or near December 31, 1956, and assets are compiled as
shown in the balance sheets, using company rather than consolidated
assets when both are shown. Companies whose common stocks have
only unlisted trading privileges on exchanges or are listed only on
exempted exchanges are excluded from this computation.
Foreign Stock

The market value on December 31, 1956, of all certificates representing foreign stocks on the stock exchanges was reported at about
$12.7 billion, of which $11.7 billion represents Canadian and about
$1.0 billion other foreign stocks. However, the values of the entire
Canadian stock issues are included in these figures, and a substantial
deduction would have to be made to determine the amounts held in
the United States. Most of the other foreign stocks were represented
by American Depository Receipts or American. Shares, only the outstanding amounts of which were used in determining market values.
The American Depository Receipts and American Shares substantially measured the domestic investment in the foreign issues so represented. The market value of the entire foreign stock issues represented in part by American certificates was about $9.0 billion.

Statistics

Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires that
registrations filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933contain undertakings by the issuers to file the reports required by section 13 of the
Exchange Act, when the class of securities offered and outstanding
exceeds $2 million. The number of issuers required to file these reports, exclusive of issuers also filing under the Investment Company
Act of 1940,1was 971 on June 30, 1956,and 1,086on June 30, 1957. The
1 Registrants
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 are subject to the reporting
and other requirements of that Act. On June 30, 1957, about 188 registrants under the
Investment Company Act also had registrations under the Securities Act of 1933 requiring
reporting pursuant to sec. 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which Is aceompUshed by filing on a single form available under both Acts.

COMMlSS'ION

1,086 issuers had quoted stocks with an aggregate market value on
December 31, 1956, of approximately $20 billion, including $17 billion
domestic and $3 billion foreign, mostly Canadian. About $1.5 billion
of the domestic and $1.8 billion of the foreign stocks were admitted to
unlisted trading on stock exchanges and the remaining $15.5 billion
domestic and $1.2 billion foreign stocks were traded only in over-thecounter markets in the United States.
The number of issuers registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 increased from 399 to 432, and estimated aggregate assets
increased from $14 billion to $15 billion, during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1957, as shown below in the discussion of that Act in this
Annual Report. Of the 432 issuers, 36 had listings on registered stock
exchanges and 3 had stocks with unlisted trading privileges on an exchange, all but 2 of the 39 issuers being of the "closed-end" type. The
assets of these 39 issuers were approximately $2 billion. The remaining 393 registrants, with about $13 billion of estimated aggregate
assets, had exclusively over-the-counter markets for their securities.
The use of investment company totals in computing overall securities
aggregates is duplicative to a very great extent in that the holdings
of investment companies consist of other securities, principally listed
stocks.
The aggregate market value of all domestic stocks, exclusive of investment company issues, with 300 or more reported holders, traded
exclusively in over-the-counter markets, appears to have changed from
about $45 billion to about $46 billion during the calendar year 1956.
Many issues make their appearance in the over-the-counter markets
each year, while many other issues are no longer traded in such markets
because of listings on stock exchanges, mergers, sales of assets, liquidations and other reasons. The number of domestic issuers reporting
300 or more holders of over-the-counter stocks does not appear to have
increased materially from the 3,500 mentioned in previous Annual
Reports.
As stated above, of the $-4:6billion domestic over-the-counter stocks,
$15.5 billion were of issuers reporting pursuant to section 15 (d) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and a further $2.5 billion consist of over-the-counter stocks of issuers complying with provisions
of the Exchange Act by reason of having other issues listed and
registered on stock exchanges. Thus, $18 billion, or about two-fifths
of the $46 billion domestic over-the-counter stocks (excluding investment companies) were of issuers reporting pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act.

DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES

During the fiscal year 1957the Commission granted 26 applications
filed by stock exchanges and 13 applications filed by issuers, pursuant
to rule 12d2-1 (b) under section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, to remove securities from listing and registration.
The applications by stock exchanges covered 4 bond issues and 19
stock issues. Since 3 stock issues were delisted from 2 exchanges and
1 from 3 exchanges, the total number of removals was 24. The applications by issuers covered 13 stock issues, one of which was also included among the 19 stocks delisted upon stock exchange application.'
Thus the net securities delisted were 4 bond issues and 31 stock issues,
accounting for 41 removals in all.
The New York Stock Exchange delisting applications granted during the current fiscal year covered 3 bond issues and 14 stocks. That
exchange has recently revised its policy so that delisting will be
considered in instances among others where the size of a company
has been reduced to below $2 million in net tangible assets or aggregate market value of the common stock and the average net
earnings after taxes for the last three years is below $200,000,and certain instances where the stockholders have authorized liquidation
or where sales of assets have been made without liquidation being
authorized. The first applications under these revised standards were
made by the exchange in January 1956, with respect to the common
stocks of Atlas Tack Corp., Exchange Buffet Corp., and Kalamazoo
Stove & Furnace Co. Pursuant to requests, hearings on the Atlas
Tack and Exchange Buffet applications were held by the Commission.
No hearing was held on the Kalamazoo application, since the single
request for a hearing was subsequently withdrawn and the stock remained listed on another stock exchange. All three applications were
granted in September 1956. The orders with respect to Atlas Tack
and Exchange Buffet were subsequently upheld by United States
Courts of Appeals, as described below under Litigation Under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Additional delisting applications
by the New York Stock Exchange included 4 where liquidation was
authorized and the initial liquidating dividend had been paid," 4

duced to a small amount by conversion into other issues of the same
issuer, 1 where there was a sale of assets and no liquidation, and 1
where the survivor to a merger failed to meet the exchange standards
for listing. In the last two cases, the stocks became listed and
registered on the American Stock Exchange. The 3 delisted bond
issues were residues of offers to exchange into other securities.
With one exception, where the issue remained listed on another
exchange, the delisting applications by other stock exchanges were all
based on virtual disappearance of the issues by reason of exchange
offers and liquidations.
The delisting applications filed by issuers covered 7 stocks which
remained listed on other stock exchanges, 2 stocks which had never
been admitted to trading because of inadequacies in the disclosures
made in connection with listing and registration, 1 closely held preferred stock, 1 stock of a liquidating company, and 2 stocks of companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940.
From July 1, 1936, through June 30, 1957, delistings pursuant to
rule 12d-l (b) have aggregated 464 upon application by stock exchanges and 264 upon application by issuers, counting each removal
from each exchange in the totals. The net numbers of issues delisted
were 440 upon application by stock exchanges and 249upon application
by issuers. Thus the total removals under rule 12d-l (b) during the
period mentioned were 728, including duplication among exchanges,
and resulted in a net delisting of 688 issues.'
Delistlng Proceedings Under Section 19 (a)

Section 19 (a) (2) authorizes the Commission to suspend for a
period not exceeding twelve months, or to withdraw, the registration
of a security on a national securities exchange if, in its opinion, such
action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors, and
after notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that
the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. Section 19 (a) (4)
authorizes the Commission summarily to suspend trading in any
registered security on any national securities exchange for a period
not exceeding ten days if in its opinion such action is necessary or
appropriate for the protection of investors and the public interest so
requires.
At the beginning of the year, there were no cases pending under
section 19 (a) (2). During the year, however, nine proceedings were
instituted by the Commission under subsection 19 (a) (2), of which
• These totals are aggregates of the data presented and analyzed yearly In the Annual

two were concluded and seven were pending at the end of the year.
Traditionally, the Commission has used its power under subsection
19 (a) (4) sparingly. However, during the year it found it necessary
and appropriate, in connection with three proceedings brought by it
under subsection 19 (a) (2), to apply its authority summarily to
suspend trading in three securities registered on the American Stock
Exchange. Two of these proceedings, Great Sweet Grass Oils Limited
and K roy Oils Limited, resulted in the issuance of orders withdrawing
the registration of the securities on that exchange," The other proceeding, which involved Bellanca Corporation, was pending at the end
of the fiscal year.
In the Great Sweet Grass and K roy cases, the Commission found
that reports filed by the companies with the American Stock Exchange and the Commission pursuant to section 13 of the Securities
Exchange Act were false and misleading. These reports were found
to contain overstatements of oil and gas reserves in their properties.
Moreover, the reports misrepresented that certain securities issued
and sold by the companies in exchange for oil and gas properties were
exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of
1933 pursuant to the so-called "no sale" rule (rule 133) under that

Act.
The Commission in its opinion held that where there is a preexisting
plan, as in this case, to use stockholders merely as a conduit for distributing a substantial amount of securities to the public, rule 133
cannot be relied upon by the issuer and that the rule is not applicable
to an "exchange" of assets for stock which is "but a step in the major
activity of selling stock." The theory of rule 133, as described in
the Commission's opinion, is that no sale to stockholders is involved
where the vote of stockholders as a group authorizes a corporate act
such as a transfer of assets for stock of another corporation, a merger
or a consolidation, because there is not present the element of individual consent ordinarily required for a "sale" in the contractual
sense. However, this does not mean that the stock issued under such
a plan is "free" stock which need not be registered insofar as subsequent sales are concerned. Unless the Securities Act provides an
exemption for a subsequent sale of such nonregistered stock, registration would be required.
The Commission found that Sweet Grass and leroy were chargeable
with knowledge of the plan of distribution and such knowledge required each company to register the securities if it wished to avoid
violations of section 5 of the Securities Act. In any event, the opinion stated, where the persons negotiating an exchange, merger or
similar transaction have sufficient control of the voting stock to make
• Securities Exchange Act Release Ko. 5483 (April 8, 1957).

68

SECURITIES AND EXCHAKGE COMMISSION

a vote of stockholders a mere formality, rule 133 does not apply. In
such case the transaction is not corporate action in a real sense, but
rather is action reflecting the consent of the persons in control, and
consequently results in a "sale" as to them.
The Commission found that no bona fide reliance on rule 133 was
or could have been intended in this case and that the distribution of
the unregistered shares created a contingent liability against Sweet
Grass and Kroy to purchasers, pursuant to section 12 (1) of the
Securities Act, which should have been disclosed in the reports filed
with the Commission. The deliberate efforts disclosed by the record
to evade the registration requirements of the Securities Act by creating corporate entities and effecting transactions meeting the requirements of the rule in appearance only were strongly condemned.
The Commission concluded that the use of the facilities of a national securities exchange by an issuer is a privilege involving important responsibilities under the Act, including compliance with the
reporting requirements. It stated that "when those responsibilities
are abused, the integrity of the exchange market is vitiated," and it
decided that under the circumstances of the case, the protection of
investors required that the registrations of the securities of Sweet
Grass and Kroy on the American Stock Exchange should be withdrawn.
UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES
Unlisted Trading Categories

Under the provisions of section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, the Commission may approve applications by national
securities exchanges to admit securities to unlisted trading privileges
thereon without action on the part of the issuers. Such admissions
impose no duties on issuers beyond any they may already have under
the Act. Section 12 (f) provides for three categories of unlisted
trading privileges.
Clause (1) of section 12 (f) provides for the continuation of unlisted trading privileges which existed on the exchanges prior to
March 1, 1934. On December 1, 1935, unlisted trading privileges
under clause (1) in effect consisted of 496 bond and 81'7stock admissions of issues not listed on other exchanges, and 75 bond and 991
stock admissions of issues listed on other exchanges."
By June 30,
1957, the number of admissions to unlisted trading privileges under
clause (1) remaining in effect had fallen from 2,379 to 834, consisting
of 25 bond and 265 stock admissions of issues not listed on other exe The 1!l35 data are

changes and of 2 bond and 542 stock admissions of issues listed on
other exchanges.
Clause (2) of section 12 (f) provides for the granting by the Commission of applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges
in securities which are listed on other exchanges. The first such
applications were granted in 1937, and there were 908 admissions of
stock issues to unlisted trading privileges under clause (2) in effect on
June 30,1957/
There have been 8 admissions of bond issues, and 7 removals, leaving a single bond issue remaining admitted under clause
(2) .
Clause (3) of section 12 (f) provides for the granting by the Commission of applications for unlisted trading privileges conditioned,
among other things, upon the availability of information substantially
equivalent to that filed in case of listed issuers. There have been 45
bond and 11 stock admissions to unlisted trading privileges under
clause (3), of which only 12 bond and 4 stock issues remained on
June 30,1957, and 2 of the stock issues have also become listed on other
exchanges. There have been no applications under clause (3) since
1949.
Volume of Unlisted Trading in Stocks on Exchanges

The reported volume of shares traded on an unlisted basis on the
stock exchanges during the calendar year 1956 included approximately
33.9 million shares in stocks admitted to unlisted trading only and
30.2 million shares in stocks listed and registered on exchanges other
than those where the unlisted trading occurred. These amounts were
respectively about 3.1 and 2.8 percent of the total share volume reported on all exchanges. Appendix table 8 shows the distribution
of share volume among the various categories of unlisted trading
privileges on exchanges.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Pursuant to applications filed by exchanges with respect to stocks
listed on other exchanges, unlisted trading privileges were extended
during the year to June 30, 1957, as follows:

• The reduction from 1,025 unllsterl stock trading privileges nnder clause (2) on Jnne
30, 1956 to 908 on June 30, 1957 was caused primarily by ending of duplications upon the
merger of the Los .Angeles Stock Exchange and the San Francisco Stock Exchange into the
Pacific Coast Stock Exchange on December 31, 1956.

AND

EXCHANGE

COMMISS'ION

The Commission's rule 12f-2 provides that when a security admitted
to unlisted trading privileges is changed in certain minor respects it
shall be deemed to be the security previously admitted to unlisted
trading privileges, and if it is changed in other respects the exchange
may file an application requesting the Commission to determine that
notwithstanding such change the security is substantially equivalent
to the security theretofore admitted to unlisted trading privileges.
During the year to June 30,1957, the Commission granted 3 applications by the American Stock Exchange for determination that one
bond issue and two stock issues were the substantial equivalent of the
securities previously admitted to unlisted trading.
BLOCK DISTRIBUTIONS

BY EXCHANGES

Rule 10b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in substance prohibits any person participating or interested in the distribution of a security from paying any other person for soliciting or
inducing a third person to buy the security on a national securities
exchange. This rule is an anti-manipulative rule adopted under section 10 (b) of the Act which makes it unlawful for any person to
use any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of Commission rules prescribed in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. Paragraph (d) of the rule provides an
exemption from its prohibitions where compensation is paid pursuant
to the terms of a plan, filed by a national securities exchange and declared effective by the Commission, authorizing the payment of such
compensation in connection with the distribution.
At the present time two types of plans are in effect to permit a
block of securities to be distributed through the facilities of a national
securities exchange when it has been determined that the regular
market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb the particular
block within a reasonable time and at a reasonable price or prices.
These plans have been designated the "Special Offering Plan," essentially a fixed price offering based on the market price, and the "Exchange Distribution Plan," which is a distribution "at the market."
Both plans contemplate that orders will be solicited off the floor but
executed on the floor. Each of such plans contains certain antimanipulative controls and requires specified disclosures concerning
the distribution to be made to prospective purchasers.
In addition to these two methods of distributing large blocks of
securities on national securities exchanges, a third method is commonly employed whereby blocks of listed securities may be distributed
to the public over the counter. This method is commonly referred
to as a "Secondary Distribution" and such a distribution usually
takes place after the close of exchange trading. It is generally the

71

practice of exchanges to require members to obtain the approval of

Manipulation

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in securities registered on a national securities exchange.
The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched orders
effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance
of trading activity or with respect to the market for any such security;
a series of transactions in which the price of such security is raised or
depressed, or in which the appearance of active trading is created,
for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales by others; circulation
by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer, or by a person who receives consideration from a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer, of information concerning market operations conducted for a rise or a decline; and the
making of material false and misleading statements by brokers, dealers, sellers, or buyers, or the omission of material information regarding securities for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales. The Act
also empowers the Commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and prohibit the use of these and other forms of manipulative activity in securities whether or not such securities are registered on an
exchange or traded over the counter.

securities, the sales and quotation sheets of the various regional exchanges, and. the bid and asked prices published by the National
Daily Quotation Service for about 6,000 unlisted securities to observe
any unusual or unexplained price variations or market activity. The
financial news ticker, leading newspapers, and various financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed.
,Vhen unusual or unexplained market activity in a security is observed, all known information regarding the security is examined
and a decision made as to the necessity for an investigation. Most
investigations are not made public so that no unfair reflection will
be cast on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not
be upset. These investigations, which are conducted by the Commission's regional offices,take two forms. A preliminary investigation or "quiz" is designed rapidly to discover evidence of unlawful
activity. If no violations are found, the preliminary investigation
is closed. If it appears that more intensive investigation is necessary,
a formal order of investigation, which carries with it the right to
issue subpenas and to take testimony under oath, is issued by the
Commission. If violations are discovered, the Commission may
revoke the registration of a broker-dealer or it may suspend or expel
him from the National Association of Securities Dealers. Similarly,
a member of a national securities exchange may be suspended or expelled from the exchange. The Commission may also seek an injunction against any person violating the Act and it may recommend
to the Department of Justice that any person violating the Act be
criminally prosecuted. In some cases, where State action seems
likely to bring quick results in preventing fraud or where Federal
jurisdiction may be doubtful, the information obtained may be referred to State agencies for State injunction or criminal prosecution.
The following table shows the number of quizzes and formal investigations initiated in 1957, the number closed or completed during
the same period, and the number pending at the end of the fiscal

Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution. It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the
restrictions provided by the Commission's rules 10b-6, 7 and 8. These
rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for
the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to prevent
unlawful manipulation.
During 1957 stabilizing was effected in connection with stock offerings aggregating 28,585,236 shares having an aggregate public offering price of $706,538,755.
Bond issues having a total offering price
of $223,483,150 were also stabilized. To accomplish this, 970,942
shares of stock were purchased in stabilizing transactions at a cost
of $20,870,422 and bonds costing $4,688,610 were also bought. In
connection with these stabilizing transactions 7,341 stabilizing reports which show purchases and sales of securities effected by persons
conducting the distribution were received and examined during the
fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY TRANSACTIONS AND HOLDINGS

Under section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 every
person who becomes a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more
than 10 percent of any class of equity security (other than an exempted security) which is listed and registered on a national securities exchange, or who becomes a director or an officer of the issuer
of any such security, is required to file with the Commission and the
exchange a statement of his ownership of the issuer's equity securities
and to keep such information current by filing a report for each
month in which any subsequent change in his ownership occurs, showing the transactions involved. Officers and directors of public
utility holding companies and officers, directors, principal security
holders, members of advisory boards, investment advisers or affiliated
persons of investment advisers of registered closed-end investment

Recovery or Short Swing Trading Profits hy or on Behalf of Issuer

For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which
may have been obtained by an officer,director or 10-percent stockholder
by reason of his relationship to his company, sections 16 (b) of the
Securities Exchange Act, 17 (b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act provide for
the recovery by or on behalf of the issuer of any profit realized by the
officer, director or 10-percent stockholder from certain purchases and
sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within any
period of less than 6 months. The Commission is not charged with
the enforcement of the civil remedies created by these provisions,
which are matters for determination by the courts in actions brought
by the proper parties.
REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under sections 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12 (e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 the Commission has adopted Regulation X-14 requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent
information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents and
authorizations in respect of securities of companies subject to those
statutes. The regulation also provides means whereby any security
holders so desiring may communicate with other security holders when
management is soliciting proxies, either by arranging for the independent distribution of their own proxy statements or by including
their proposals in the proxy statements sent out by management.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
'Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to avoid such
defects in the preparation of the proxy material in the definitive form
in which it is furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1957 fiscal year 1,991 solicitations were made pursuant
to regulation X-14; 1,968 were conducted by management and 23 by
nonmanagement groups. These 1,991 solicitations related to 1,755
companies, some 160 of which had more than one solicitation during
the year, generally for a special meeting not involving the election
of directors.
Of the 1,991 proxy statements filed during the year, 1,726 involved

special meetings not involving the election of directors, and 26 solicited
assents and authorizations not involving a meeting of security holders

Stockholders' Proposals

During the 1957 fiscal year, 33 stockholders submitted a total of
127 proposals which were included in the 78 proxy statements by the
management of 77 companies under the provisions of rule 14a-8 of
regulation X-H.
Typical of such stockholders' proposals submitted to a vote of security holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters
and bylaws to provide for regional meetings of stockholders, cumulative voting for the election of directors, preemptive rights for stockholders, a requirement that directors own a minimum amount of stock,
limitation of the authority of the directors to issue securities for property without specific approval by stockholders and the annual election
of all directors. Other resolutions of stockholders included in managements' proxy statements related to limitations on executive salaries,
pensions, and options to purchase stock of the company, the sending to
all stockholders of a report of the annual meeting and the approval
by stockholders of the selection by management of the independent
auditors.
The management of 21 companies omitted from their proxy statements, under the conditions specified in rule Ha-8, a total of 39 additional stockholder proposals submitted by 24 individual stockholders.
The reasons why these 39 proposals were omitted from managements'
proxy statements are given below with the number of times each reason

was involved shown in parentheses: (a) The proposal 'wasnot a proper
subject matter under state law (15f; (b) the proposal was not submitted to the company within the prescribed time limit (4); (c) the
proposal involved a personal grievance (7); (d) the same proposal
did not receive sufficient votes at a previous meeting of stockholders
(4) ; (e) the subject matter related to the ordinary conduct of business
of the company (3); and (I) the proposal was withdrawn by the
stockholder (6).
Ratio of Soliciting to Nonsoliciting Companies

Of the 2,256 issuers that had securities listed and registered on
national securities exchanges as of June 30, 1957, 2,004 had voting
securities so listed and registered." Of these 2,004 issuers, 1,532, or
76.4 percent, solicited proxies under the Commission's proxy rules for
the election of directors during the 1957 fiscal year while the remaining 472, or 23.6 percent, did not file proxy statements.
Proxy Contests

During the 1957 fiscal year there were 20 companies involved in
proxy contests for the election of directors, 11 of which were for
control of the company and 9 for representation on the board of
directors. In these contests 265 persons filed detailed statements as
participants under the requirements of rule 14a-11. Of the 11 contests for control, management won 7, the opposition won 2, 1 was
settled by negotiation, and 1 was pending in court as of June 30,
1957. Of the 9 contests for representation on the board of directors,
management won 5, the opposition won places on the board in 3
cases, and in the other case the opposition was given a place on the
board by negotiation.
REGULATION OF BROKER.DEALERS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER
MARKETS
Registration

Section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires
registration of brokers and dealers using the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect transactions in securities on the
over-the-counter market, except those brokers and dealers whose
business is exclusively intrastate or exclusively in exempt securities.

Proceedings

Under section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
Commission may deny broker-dealer registration to an applicant or
revoke such registration if it finds that it is in the public interest and
that the applicant or registrant or any partner, officer, director or
other person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled by such
applicant or broker-dealer is subject to one or more of the disqualifications set forth in the Act. These disqualifications, in general, are
(1) willful false or misleading statements in the application or documents supplemental thereto, (2) conviction within ten years of a
felony or misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of securities or
of any conduct arising out of the business as a broker-dealer, (3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction from engaging in any
practices in connection with the purchase or sale of securities, and
(4) willful violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 or any of the Commission's rules or regulations
thereunder. In addition, brokers and dealers may be suspended or
expelled by the Commission from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and national securities exchanges
for participating in violations of the various federal securities laws
or the regulations thereunder. The Commission may not deny registration to any person who applies therefor absent evidence of misconduct of the specified types enumerated in the Act. Reputation,
character, lack of experience in the securities business or even conviction of the registrant of a :felony not involving the sale of securities
do not constitute statutory bars to registration as a broker-dealer.
The Commission's vigorous enforcement program and a greater
number of broker-dealer inspections during the fiscal year resulted in

Proceedings in which action was taken during the year included.
the following:
Registration as a broker-dealer in securities was denied to John
Raymond LU<Jas,doing business as Lucas and OO'TT/,pany9 upon a finding that while not so registered with the Commission the applicant
had effected securities transactions involving $8,900,000with 116 customers located in 6 states and with 36 other brokers and dealers. A
substantial number of transactions had been effected by Lucas after
he had been advised of the broker-dealer registration requirements of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In addition, it was found that
the sworn financial statement filed with his application for registration was false in failing to disclose a large amount of liabilities and
that Lucas had engaged in transactions with customers while insolvent without disclosing such information to his customers. Subsequently Lucas was tried and convicted in a state court on oharges of
grand larceny and embezzlement and was sentenced to five years in the
state penitentiary.
In The Western Trader, Irw.r the Commission denied an application for registration as a broker-dealer upon a finding that the applicant had been previously registered as a broker-dealer and in an action
instituted by the Commission was permanently enjoined by a decree
entered in a United States District Court in which it was adjudged,
among other things, that the applicant sold unregistered stock in a
uranium company by means of misrepresentations concerning the
company and its properties, and had effected principal and agency
transactions with customers without sending proper confirmations
as required. The Commission also found that Clifford A. Greenman,

president and controlling stockholder of applicant, was a cause of the
order of denial. Greenman was also a registered investment adviser operating under the name The Western Trader and Investor.
Proceedings resulting in revocation of that registration are discussed
in the section of this report relating to Investment Advisers Act of
1940.
The broker-dealer registration of The Lewellen-Bybee Oo'rnpany11
was revoked upon a finding that the firm had offered and sold the
common stock of Venezuelan National Diamond Co. and Powder
River Uranium Co., Inc., and the common and preferred stock of
Hemisphere Productions, Ltd., when no registration under the Securities Act of 1933 was in effect with respect to any of these securities. In connection with the offer of stock of Venezuelan National
Diamond Co., the firm made false and misleading representations
concerning the incorporation of the issuer and the return to be expected from an investment in the security. In the offer and sale of
the securities of Hemisphere Productions Limited the firm made false
representations concerning the issuer's repurchase of its preferred
stock, the soundness of an investment in the securities, and their future
price. In addition, it was found that a predecessor of the firm had
offered and sold unregistered securities of another issuer, and in
doing so had made various false and misleading statements. The
Commission determined that Rollo Lee Lewellen, president of Lew-'
ellen-Bybee, was a cause of the revocation.

O. Herbert Onderdonk, doing business as O. Herbert Onderdonk
00.,12 had been permanently enjoined by a United States District
Court, upon a complaint filed by the Commission, from engaging in
business as a broker-dealer unless his books and records were made
current and made available for inspection by a representative of the
Commission, and a true and correct report of his financial condition
filed. It appeared that his books and records and his financial report
filed with the Commission failed to reflect certain liabilities to customers and that New York State had obtained an injunction based
upon a finding that Onderdonk was insolvent and had misappropriated funds aDJisecurities of customers. The Commission entered
an order revoking Onderdonk's registration.
Onderdonk received
a sentence of from 5 to 10 years' imprisonment upon a plea of guilty
to charges of forgery and grand larceny brought in a state court.
The Commission suspended the membership of Brereton, Rice &:

mining newspaper an advertisement which represented that the firm
offered to sell the unsold balance of an issue of 200,000 shares of
Leadville Lead and Uranium Corporation stock at the original public offering price of $1.25 per share; that a survey of Leadville's mining properties by a certain eminent mining engineer indicated large
bodies of gold, silver, lead, zinc, and copper ore; and that the mining
engineer after completing his survey bought a substantial block of
Leadville stock at $1.25 per share.
The Commission determined that the offer to sell the unsold balances of the Leadville issue was materially misleading in that Brereton, Rice & Co., Inc., intended to fill orders received in response to
the advertisement with outstanding rather than original issue stock,
and consequently none of the proceeds of such sales would be received
by the issuer. With regard to the survey indicating large bodies of
certain minerals, it was found that the conclusions were based upon
certain anomalies which did not necessarily indicate the existence of
any ore bodies. It was also found that the claim that the mining
engineer had purchased a block of stock in Leadville was misleading
since the engineer was given the stock as partial compensation before
beginning his surveys. Prompt action by the Regional Office caused
a discontinuance of the offering before any sales were effected.
An order was entered denying the application for registration as
°abroker-dealer of George W. OMllian, doing business as George W.
OMllian ill Oompany 14 based upon violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act. The
Commission found that the applicant had participated in the distribution of more than a quarter of a million shares of capital stock of
New Metalore Mining Co., Ltd., a Canadian mining company, to
residents of the United States in eight states. The shares were not
registered under the Securities Act and Chillian was not registered
as a broker-dealer under the Exchange Act. It was found that he
also effected transactions in other Canadian securities for residents
of Minnesota.
The Commission revoked the registration of L. D. Friedman d; 00.,
Inc./5 as a broker-dealer when it was found that the firm had made
false statements in its application for registration, and made false
statements that an offering of North Pacific Exploration, Ltd., stock
was almost completed and that only a few shares were left, that the
price of the stock would go up substantially in the near future, that the
firm had made large purchases of the stock, that oil had been discovered on N orth Pacific's properties and that North Pacific compared
favorably with another.well-Imown successful company. In addition,

it was found that the firm had failed to meet the net capital requirements and to keep the books and records required by the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 and had sold securities not registered under the
Securities Act of 1933. The Commission found Louis D. Friedman
and Leo Raymond, president and former vice president, respectively,
of L. D. Friedman & Co., to be causes of the revocation.
Proceedings against Ooburn. and Middlebrook, Imoorporated t" were
based upon violations of section 7 (c) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 and regulation T promulgated by the Federal Reserve Board
thereunder relating to the extension of credit to customers by brokerdealers who transact business through the medium of a member of a
national securities exchange. The registrant maintained 14 branch
officesand employed about 100 salesmen. Its business largely involved
dealings in securities traded in the over-the-counter market. Section
4 (c) (2) of regulation T provides that a broker or dealer shall
promptly cancel or otherwise liquidate the transaction where a customer purchases a security in a special cash account and does not make
full cash payment within 7 business days. Section 4 (c) (8) of the
regulation provides that unless funds sufficient for the purpose are
already in the account, no security shall be purchased for or sold to a
customer in a special cash account if during the preceding 90 days the
customer had purchased another security in that account and sold it
before he paid for it in full. Section 4 (c) (1) (a) of regulation T
permits a broker or dealer to effect bona fide cash transactions involving the purchase of a security by a customer in a special cash account
which does not have sufficient funds for the purpose only if he does so
in reliance upon an agreement accepted by him in good faith that the
customer will promptly make full cash payment for the security and
that he does not contemplate selling the security prior to making such
payment. The Commission found that registrant had violated section
7 (c) of the Act and each of the foregoing provisions of regulation T
and suspended registrant from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., for a period of 30 days.
Another case involving charges of violation of section 7 (c) of the
Securities Exchange Act and regulation T was In the Matter of Denton & Oompany,Ineorporate<iP
In this case the Commission found
that the registrant did not promptly cancel or otherwise liquidate
transactions of customers in special cash accounts when the customer
did not make full cash payment within 7 business days in violation of
section 4 (c) (2) of regulation T. At least one of these transactions
also violated section 4 (c) (8) of the regulation in that a customer was
permitted to purchase a security in a special cash account without hav11 Securities

ing sufficient funds in the account for that purpose when within the
previous 90 days the customer had purchased another security in that
account and sold it before he paid for it. In addition to the regulation
T violations, the Commission found that the registrant had failed to
keep current certain books and records as required. The Commission
suspended the firm from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., for 30 days and found three officers of the firm to be causes
of the suspension order.
The broker-dealer registration of Gill, Pope OO.lS was revoked upon
a finding that the registrant's books and records and its report of financial condition filed with the Commission failed to reflect a liability
for an advance by Paleo Oil & Gas Corp. for expenses in connection
with a "best efforts" underwriting.
Had the liability been shown, it
would have revealed that the firm was doing business with customers
while in violation of the net capital rule and while insolvent. Jesse
S. Gill and Frank I. Pope were found to be causes of the revocation
order.
The Commission revoked the registration of Bartlett and Weikel 19
as a broker-dealer based upon a finding that the firm had engaged in
a distribution of Acteon Gold Mines, Ltd., a Canadian security, in the
United States when no registration statement was in effect for the
securities under the Securities Act of 1933. In connection with such
sales the firm made false and misleading statements by overstating
the value of Acteon's properties, orders held by Bartlett and Weikel
for Acteon stock and the indicated market price of the stock. Further, it was found that the firm had failed to keep certain books and
records, had made fictitious entries in other books and records and had
filed a false annual financial statement with the Commission. The
Commission also found Malcolm H. Biddle Weikel and Paul Henry
Kroger, partners in Bartlett and Weikel, to be causes of the revocation.
The broker-dealer registration of Mitchell Securities, lna.,20 was
revoked by the Commission, based upon an injunction entered in a
United States District Court in which it was adjudged that the firm
had sold its own debentures to the public by means of misrepresentations about its financial condition, its history of unprofitable operations, and commissions paid in connection with the sale of its debentures. The Commission also determined that C. Benjamin Mitchell
and Russell P. Dotterer, who were officers and directors of Mitchell
Securities, were causes of the revocation.

District Court on charges of violating the anti-fraud provisions of
the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act involving conversion by Scarborough of customers' funds and securities. The
Commission earlier had obtained an injunction in the same court
to restrain further violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act and from continuing to effect transactions
in securities as a broker-dealer without making and keeping current
the books and records required under the Act. The injunction was
also a basis for the Commission's order of revocation.
Net Capital

Rule

To provide safeguards for funds and securities of customers dealing
with broker-dealers, the Commission has adopted rule 15c3-1 under
the Securities Exchange Act, commonly known as the net capital
rule. This rule restricts the amount of indebtedness that may be incurred by a registrant in relation to his capital. Under the rule, no
broker-dealer subject thereto may permit his "aggregate indebtedness"
to exceed 20 times his "net capital" as those terms are defined in the
rule.
Prompt action is taken by the Commission whenever it appears that
any broker-dealer fails to meet the capital requirements prescribed
by the rule. Unless the broker-dealer takes necessary steps promptly
to correct any capital deficiency found to exist either by inspection
or by reports filed with the Commission, injunctive action may be
taken or proceedings instituted to determine whether the brokerdealer registration should be revoked. During the fiscal year violations of the net capital rule were alleged in injunctive actions filed
against 34 broker-dealers, and in revocation proceedings instituted
against 20.
Where a broker-dealer participates in "firm commitment" underwritings careful check, based upon latest available information, is
made to determine whether he has adequate net capital to be in compliance with the rule. Acceleration of effectiveness of registration
statements under the Securities Act is not permitted if it appears
that any underwriter would as a result of his commitment be in violation of the net capital rule. In a number of instances during the past
year broker-dealers who were named as underwriters appeared to be
inadequately capitalized to take down their commitments in conformity with the rule. The broker-dealers were informed of the situation and the effect it would have on a pending registration statement,
and they thereupon obtained sufficient capital so that full compliance
with the rule could be had, reduced their commitments to the extent
to which they could be undertaken without violating the rule or withdrew entirely as an underwriter.

Financial Statements

A report of financial condition is required to be filed with the Commission once each calendar year by every registered broker-dealer.
These reports serve to inform the Commission and the public as to the
financial responsibility of broker-dealers, and they are analyzed by
the staff to determine whether the registrant is in compliance with the
Commission's net capital rule. If the analysis discloses that the
registrant is not in compliance with the net capital requirements an
opportunity is usually afforded for compliance, particularly where the
situation appears to be inadvertent or of a temporary nature. However, the Commission, for the protection of customers, insists that
registrants be ill compliance and, where the public interest would be
better served, appropriate action is taken. Revocation proceedings
are brought against registrants who fail to make the necessary filing.
During the year 4,328 reports of financial condition were :filed.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

Inspections of registered broker-dealers as provided for in section
17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act are a vital part of the Commission's activities to provide maximum protection of investors. The
purpose of these regular and periodic inspections is to assure compliance by broker-dealers with the securities acts and the rules and regulations promulgated by the Commission and to detect and prevent
violations.
An inspection ordinarily includes, among other things, (1) a determination of the financial condition of the broker-dealer; (2) review
of pricing practices; (3) review of the treatment of customers' funds
and securities; and (4) a determination whether adequate disclosures
are made to customers. The inspection process also determines whether
the required books and records are adequate and currently maintained,
and whether broker-dealers are conforming with the margin and other
requirements of regulation T, as prescribed by the Federal Reserve
Board. They also check for "churning," "switching," sale of unregistered securities, use of improper sales literature or sales methods,
and other fraudulent practices. These inspections frequently discover
situations which, if not corrected, would result in losses to customers.
The policy inaugurated in the previous year of increasing the number of inspections was carried forward in the fiscal year 1957. The
1,214 inspections completed during the year represent an increase of
more than 25 percent over the previous year. Since the number of
registered broker-dealers continued to increase during the year from
4,591 to 4,771 at the end of the year, it is proposed that the inspection
program will be further expanded to keep pace with the increased
number of persons engaged in the securities business.

While an inspection may disclose violations of the Commission's
statutes or rules, formal action is not taken against every broker-dealer
found to be in violation. In determining whether to institute action
against a broker-dealer found as a result of an inspection to be in
violation, consideration is given to the nature of the violation and to
the effect it has upon members of the public. Inspections usually reveal a number of inadvertent violations which are caught before they
become serious and before they jeopardize the rights of customers. In
such situations, where no harm has come to the public, the matter is
called to the attention of the registrant and arrangements made to correct the improper practices. Where, however, the violation appears to
be willful and the public interest is best served by instituting proceedings against the broker-dealer, such action is promptly taken.
The following table shows the various types of violations disclosed
as a result of the inspection program during the fiscal year 1957.

In addition to the Commission's inspection program, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the principal stock exchanges also conduct inspections of their members and some of the
States also have inspection programs. Each inspecting agency conducts inspections in accordance with its own procedures and with
particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction. Consequently, inspections by other agencies are not an adequate substitute
for Commission inspections since the inspector will not be primarily
concerned with the detection and prevention of violations of the
Federal securities laws and the Commission's regulations thereunder.
The Commission and certain other inspecting agencies, however,
maintain a program of coordinating inspection activities for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplication of inspections and to obtain the widest possible coverage of brokers and dealers. This seems
appropriate in view of the limited number of inspections which it
is possible for the Commission to make. The program does not
prevent the Commission from inspecting any person recently inspected by another agency, and such an inspection by the Commission

88

AND EXCHANGE - COMMISS.'ION

is made whenever reason therefor exists, but it has been necessary
for the Commission to rely to a considerable extent upon the inspection programs of the major exchanges, such as the New York Stock
Exchange.
Agencies now participating in the coordinated program include
the New York Stock Exchange, the American Stock Exchange, the
Midwest Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-Baltimore
Stock Exchange, the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION
OF SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Maloney Act") provides for registration with the Commission of national securities associations and establishes standards for such associations. The rules of such associations must be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and
manipulative acts and practices and to meet other statutory requirements. Such associations serve as a medium for the co-operative self
regulation of over-the-counter brokers and dealers and operate under
the general supervision of this Commission. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only association
registered under the Act.
In adopting legislation to authorize the formation and registration
of such associations, Congress provided an incentive to membership
by permitting such associations to adopt, and the NASD has adopted,
rules which preclude a member from dealing with a non-member,
except on the same terms and conditions as the member affords the
general public. As a consequence, membership is necessary to the
profitable participation in underwritings and over-the-counter trading in general, for price concessions, discounts and similar allowances
may properly be granted only to members.
On June 30, 1957, there were 3,856 NASD members, an increase
of 222 during the year, as a result of 456 admissions to and 234 terminations of membership. There were also registered with the NASD
as registered representatives 57,103 individuals, including, generally,
all partners, officers, salesmen, traders and other persons employed
by or affiliated with member firms in capacities which involved their
doing business directly with the public. The number of registered
representatives increased by 8,537 during the year, as a result of
15,014 initial registrations, 5,861 re-registrations and 12,338 terminations of registration.

TWENTY -THIRD ANNUAL REPORT

Disciplinary Actions

The NASD sends the Commission summaries of decisions on all
final disciplinary actions taken against members and the registered
representatives of members. Each such decision is considered by the
Commission's staff to determine whether the underlying facts indicate conduct violative of the statutes administered by the Commission or the rules adopted thereunder. "This consideration often includes an examination of the NASD's file on a particular case.
Where the available facts appear to indicate violations of the Commission's rules or statutes, independent Commission enforcement action is initiated, unless, of course, such action had already been commenced before receipt of notice from the NASD.
During the year here under review, the NASD reported to the
Commission on 140 final disciplinary actions against 141 members,
one complaint having been directed against two different members,
and 61 registered representatives of members. In 97 cases complaints were directed solely against member firms, and in 44 additional cases complaints were directed against both members and representatives of such members. In all, 135 member firms and 51 registered representatives were found to have violated various NASD
rules as specified in the underlying complaints and were subjected to
penalty. The penalties imposed on members and registered representatives covered a wide range of available sanctions and in several
instances more than a single penalty was imposed on a firm or representative. Thus, 38 member firms were expelled and 1 was suspended
for 2 weeks; 58 firms, including 1 suspended and 2 expelled firms,
were fined amounts ranging from $50 to $5,500 and aggregating over
$37,500; and 38 other firms were either censured or required to file a
statement pledging future observance and compliance with the rules
of fair practice and the bylaws. In addition, the registrations of 27
registered representatives were revoked, the registrations of 6 representatives were suspended for periods ranging from 15 days to three
years, five representatives were fined amounts ranging from $50 to
$2,700 and aggregating $4,850, 7 representatives were censured, and
6 representatives were found to have been the cause of some penalty
imposed on the controlling or controlled member firm. Costs were
also imposed on 38 members and on 1 representative in amounts
ranging from $12.50 to slightly over $1,600 and aggregating approximately $11,500.
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Actions

Section 15A (g) of the Act provides that disciplinary actions of
the NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion

90

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSiON

or on the application of any aggrieved person. The statute also
provides that the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD
is automatically stayed pending determination of any matter brought
before the Commission on review. At the beginning of the fiscal
year, two such review cases were pending before the Commission and
during the year three other such applications were filed. Two cases
were disposed of during the- year and at the year's end three cases
were pending before the Commission."
The Commission sustained in part, and set aside in part, certain
fines and assessments imposed by the NASD upon Managed Investment Programs, of San Francisco, and upon Nathaniel S. Chadwick,
the principal partner, and Richard O. Atkinson, a salesman." All
three parties joined in a petition bringing this matter before the Commission on appeal. The NASD Board of Governors had imposed
fines of $2,000 upon Programs, $1,000 upon Chadwick, and $300, plus
censure, upon Atkinson, and it also assessed Programs for costs in
the amount of $2,000. These disciplinary actions were based upon
violations of the NASD rules of fair practice, involving sales of securities to customers at prices not reasonably related to current market
prices, permitting a salesman who was not at the time Program's
registered representative to transact business for the firm and failing
to maintain and preserve certain records.
Upon review of the NASD decision, the Commission affirmed the
NASD finding that Programs and Chadwick had violated the NASD
rules in the respects indicated and the Commission further held that
such conduct was inconsistent with just and equitable principles of
trade. The Commission sustained the $2,000 fine against Programs
and the $1,000 fine against Chadwick. However, it set aside the
action taken against Atkinson on the ground that this action of the
Board of Governors was beyond the scope of its power to review the
prior ruling of the NASD district business conduct committee, which
had not found a violation by Atkinson on this count. In addition,
the Commission set aside the $2,000 assessment of costs against Programs, without prejudice to the right of the NASD to reassess costs
in an amount not in excess of $2,000 provided such costs are itemized
and without prejudice to the right of Programs to seek further Commission review thereof."
In another decision the Commission set aside disciplinary action
of the NASD against one of its members, Louis C. Lerner, of Boston,
doing business under the name Lerner & CO.25 The case arose out

of a controversy between Lerner and Ball, Burge & Kraus, of Cleveland, over the purchase of stock of Morgan Engineering Co. of Alliance, Ohio. The conduct of both firms was reviewed by the NASD,
which censured Ball Burge and imposed a $500 fine and costs upon
it. The NASD also censured Lerner for its failure to accept delivery
of and pay for a 6,100 share block of Morgan stock acquired by Ball
Burge for Lerner, and ordered that unless Lerner paid for the stock
within 30 days, he be suspended from NASD membership until he
did so. Lerner appealed to the Commission from this action.
The Commission found that in February 1955, Lerner began acquiring Morgan stock from various brokers, including Ball Burge,
who was the most active dealer in Morgan stock. Lerner talked with
Paul Gaither, a Ball Burge partner, about his interest in Morgan
and Gaither indicated that he could supply Lerner with a great deal
of Morgan stock over a period of time. Lerner testified that in view
of the substantial number of shares available through Gaither, he
. decided to seek representation on Morgan's board, that he told
Gaither of this purpose, and that Gaither assured him that he would
obtain proxies on all the shares purchased for use on Lerner's behalf
at Morgan's annual meeting of stockholders scheduled for March 22.
By March 18, 1955,Lerner had agreed to buy from Ball Burge a total
of 27,010 shares of Morgan stock (at an aggregate price of $694,352),
which would have been more than enough to elect one director on a
cumulative voting basis. Gaither did not obtain proxies for all the
shares sold to Lerner, nor did he attend the Morgan meeting to vote
on Lerner's behalf such proxies as he had obtained. Lerner strongly
protested to Gaither that he had breached the contracts relating to
the purchase of Morgan stock by not delivering proxies for stock
so acquired and not using his influence to obtain representation for
Lerner on Morgan's board, and refused to accept the 6,100 shares
tendered in delivery by Ball Burge on March 23, 1955.
The Commission noted that, as the NASD itself had stated, the
NASD is not the proper forum to decide private contract rights
between parties, but should only determine whether a member's conduct
is unethical. It stated that in the absence of justifying or extenuating
circumstances a member's failure to live up to contract obligations
would constitute improper conduct under the NASD's rules. However, the Commission found that even assuming, as the NASD found,
that deliveries of proxies was not an integral part of the contracts,
Lerner's refusal to accept the 6,100 shares did not under all the cireumstances represent unethical or dishonorable conduct. The Commission found that Lerner considered the delivery of proxies to be
a vital part of its agreement to purchase the Morgan shares and that
he honestly and reasonably believed that upon Gaither's failure to

92

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE' OOMMJSS[()N

procure and vote the proxies he was no longer legally or morally obligated to accept the undelivered shares and concluded that Lerner's
conduct was not inconsistent with "just and equitable principles of
trade" within the meaning of the rule, and that accordingly the action
taken by the NASD against Lerner must be set aside.
Commission Review of Action on Membership

Section 15A (b) of the Act and the bylaws of the NASD provide
that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate -in the public
interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker or dealer may
be admitted to or continued in membership if he, or any controlling or
, controlled person, is under any of the several disabilities specified
in the statute or the bylaws. Effective expulsion from the NASD
for violation of a rule prohibiting conduct inconsistent with just and
equitable principles of trade is one such disability. At the beginning
of the fiscal year, four such cases were pending before the Commission,
two petitions were filed during the year and one was withdrawn
prior to a determination of the issues. Two cases were disposed of .
during the year and three were pending at the year end.
The Commission approved applications permitting two firms to be
continued in membership while employing persons who had been expelled by the N ASD for action inconsistent with just and equitable
principles of trade. In one case, the Commission, on application of
the NASD, approved the continuance in membership of a firm while
employing Marvin E. Fowler. In its opinion, the Commission considered, among other things, specified limitations on Fowler's proposed
duties, which were to be in the real estate mortgage loan department
of his employer, and the fact that his activities would be subject to
close supervision of the president of the employing member."
Ih the other case, the Commission approved the continuance in membership of Life Insurance Fund Management Co., Ine., while employing Giles E. MacQueen, Jr. The Commission noted that MacQueen's
activities were to be limited to those of a statistician or bookkeeper
and would not involve handling pf money or dealing with the public
or other dealers, and that he would be subject to close supervision by
officers of the employer. The Commission also observed that MacQueen had made restitution to customers whose securities he had improperly used in the incident which resulted in his expulsion and that
his conduct during the 3 years subsequent to his expulsion had been
good."

Action on NASD Rules

Section 15A (j) of the Act provides that any change in or addition
to the rules of a registered association shall be disapproved by the
Commission unless such change or addition appears to the Commission to be consistent with the requirements of subsection 15A (b) of
the statute.
During the fiscal year the NASD adopted, without Commission disapproval, an integrated series of amendments to the Code of Procedure
for Handling Trade Practice Complaints.
The basic amendment
would permit a District Business Conduct Committee to offer a respondent what is called "minor violation procedure" pursuant to
which a respondent would be permitted, but not required, to admit
the allegations specified in a complaint, waive a hearing and accept
a penalty not to exceed censure and a fine of $100. The program is
designed to reduce the time of staff and committee representatives and
other costs involved in handling disciplinary actions where the
facts are not in question and indicate only minor or technical rule
violations with no significant damage to customers, other parties or
the public interest. Controls included in this program preserve to a
respondent every right accorded by statute, including review by or
appeal to the Board of Governors and this Commission. A respondent
may refuse to admit the allegations in the complaint and require the
ordinary complaint procedure, including a hearing and the right to
representation by counsel.
Other amendments to various rules adopted by the Association during the year appear to concern only internal administration or to be
of a nature not requiring comment or description in this report.

which violates the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Some of the actions brought as a result of such violations also alleged
violations of other acts administered by the Commission.

Payne, a securities salesman for the company. The complaint alleged
that the defendants induced customers, by false representations and
omissions of material facts, to sell securities of one mining company
and buy securities of another, and at the same time induced other customers to effect contra transactions in the same securities, marking up
the prices charged the customers for the securities acquired by them
as much as 100 percent in the process. The defendants were also
alleged to have made fraudulent statements concerning the market
price of the securities, the business properties and operations of the
issuers of the securities, and the dividends to be paid.
In S. E. o. v. Paul Scarborough, Jr.,29 the Commission secured an
injunction against the defendant broker-dealer who, the Commission
charged, induced and effected the sale of securities by means of manipulative, deceptive and fraudulent devices in that he caused customers
to deliver the securities to him upon the representation that he would
sell the securities and remit the proceeds to said customers, when, in
fact, the defendant converted the proceeds to his own use. The court,
in addition, enjoined further violations of the Commission's rules concerning confirmation of transactions and maintenance of books and
records relating to a broker-dealer's business. The defendant consented to the entry of the final judgment. He was convicted in a
criminal action and sentenced to seven years imprisonment and his
registration as a broker-dealer was revoked.
In S. E. O. v, Branch Carden & Oompany, Inc. and Branch J.
Carden; Jr.,30 the fraudulent mishandling of customers' funds was the
dominant aspect of the action. In that case the Commission alleged
that the defendants had converted to their own use and benefit funds
deposited with them by customers for the purchase of securities. Further, defendants commingled and hypothecated customers' securities
in violation of the Commission's rules. The defendants consented to
the entry of a decree by which the court enjoined further illegal conduct of this nature and also restrained defendants from further violations of the net capital requirements and the transaction of business
while insolvent without disclosing this fact to its customers.
Cases Involving the Net Capital Rule

Act, provides an important protection against loss to customers that
may occur by reason of financial difficulties that broker-dealers may
encounter by requiring, with certain exceptions, that no broker or

In several instances, broker-dealers not only violated the net capital rule, but also were insolvent. By continuing to do business without informing their customers of their precarious financial condition,

Delisting

Cases

In Exchange Buffet Corporation v. New York Stock Exchange and
S. E. 0.,53 and Atlas Tack Oorp, v. New York Stock Exchange, et al.,54
the petitioners sought to have set aside the Commission's orders
granting applications by the New York Stock Exchange, pursuant
to the provisions of section 12 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act,
to strike petitioners' capital stock from listing and registration on
the New York Stock Exchange. In both of these cases the Commission found that the rules of the New York Stock Exchange relating
to delisting had been complied with and that..the applications should
be granted without the imposition of any terms or conditions. The
Board of Governors of the New York Stock Exchange, following
a public hearing after notice to issuers of listed securities, including
Exchange Buffet and Atlas Tack, had amended its rule governing the
delisting of securities, spelling out specific standards as guides for
continued listing of the securities on the New York Stock Exchange.
The amended rule provided that delisting would be considered where:

--

•
 * * the size of a company whose common stock is listed has been reduced,
as a result of liquidation or otherwise, to below two million dollars in net
tangible assets or aggregate market value of the common stock, and the average
net earnings after taxes for the last three years is below $200,000.
Exchange Buffet, which was notified of this change in policy, did
not meet the revised standards, and a resolution was adopted by the
Board of Governors directing that an application to delist be :filed
with the Commission. In denying the petition to set aside the Commission's order, the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit agreed
with the Commission that, where the Commission has permitted an
amended rule to become effective without requesting changes or instituting a proceeding under section 19 (b), it is not authorized to deny

with the amended rule of the Exchange.
In the Atias Tack Corp. case the United States Court of Appeals
for the First Circuit under similar facts, also agreed with the Commission in affirming its order, that the Commission's power with respect to section 12 (d) proceedings is limited to the imposition of
terms where the Exchange has complied with its delisting rules, and
that the Exchange's rules cannot be attacked as objectionable in a
section 12 (d) action.
Proxy Litigation

The Commission appeared as plaintiff-intervenor in Ostergren v.
Kirby 55 and obtained a preliminary injunction which enjoined Kirby
and certain other shareholders of Lakey Foundry Corp. from voting
proxies at the annual meeting of shareholders of the corporation, or
any adjournment thereof, unless Kirby filed the material required
by the Commission's proxy rules and unless he furnished to the shareholders whose proxies he had solicited the material required by these
rules. The Commission's complaint alleged that the defendant Kirby,
acting in concert with other defendants, had persuaded a large number of persons to purchase stock of the corporation by lending or
offering to lend funds to purchase such stock, whereby the stock would
be held in the name of Kirby's nominee and thus assure Kirby the
right to vote the stock. In its opinion, the United States District
Court for the Northern District of Ohio upheld the Commission's
contentions that, by virtue of these activities, Kirby was a participant
in the proxy solicitation within the meaning of the term in rule
14a-ll, that Kirby was therefore in violation of regulation X-14 in
that he failed to file a proxy statement as required by rule 14a-3 and
in that he failed to file the information prescribed in Schedule 14B
as 'required of participants in a proxy solicitation. An appeal from
the District Court's decision is pending in the Court of Appeals for
the Sixth Circuit (No. 13310).
Litigation Involving Registration and Reporting Requirements

In8. E. O. v, Rea Bank Oil Oom,pany, et al.," the Commission obtained a decree enjoining Red Bank Oil Co., its officers and directors,
from failing to file the reports required of it under section 13 of the
Securities Exchange Act by virtue of the registration of its capital
stock on the American Stock Exchange, from failing to correct deficiencies in such reports after receiving notice of such deficiencies
from the Commission and from failing to make timely filings with

the Commission and with the American Stock Exchange. The decree also directed that within 60 days from the date of service of the
decree, Red Bank Oil Co., its officers and directors, file all past due
annual reports. The defendants consented to the entry of the decree.
Another case in which the Commission found it necessary to seek
the remedy of injunction in order to enforce the broker-dealer registration requirement of the Securities Exchange Act was S. E. 0; v.
Pacific Investment, Inc. and Norman Hays, individually and doing
business as Pacific Investment 00mpany.57 The Commission's complaint and the affidavits filed in support of its motion for preliminary
injunction recited that the defendants had been for some time selling
substantial amounts of securities without registration as a broker
and dealer under the Act. The defendant Norman Hays had submitted an application for registration as a broker-dealer but it was
returned as not acceptable for filing due to certain deficiencies. Notwithstanding the return of his application he continued doing business
in securities. The defendants consented to the entry of a permanent
injunction.
In John Pierce v. S. E. 0.,58 the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit affirmed the Commission's denial of petitioner's application
for registration as a broker-dealer. The petitioner in this appeal had
previously been named as defendant in an action brought by the Commission to enjoin him from doing business as a broker-dealer without
registering with the Commission pursuant to the provisions of section
15 (a) ofthe Act.59
In addition to the instances previously mentioned, the Commission's
rules relating to the maintenance of books and records were enforced
by court action in other cases. In S. E. O. v. P. J. Gruber &: 00., Inc.60
a preliminary injunction was secured restraining the defendant brokerdealer and two of its officers from making false and fictitious entries
in its books and records. Affidavits filed by the Commission in that
action were to the effect that registrant's records showed confirmations
for purported purchases of securities to prospective customers when
in fact such customers had not ordered any securities and had refused
to buy securities when offered.
S. E. O. v, Ohristopulos &: Nichols Brokerage 00mp(Jffiy,61 and
S. E. O. v. Wendell E. Kindley, doing business as Wendell E. Kindley

Other Litigation

The constitutionality of section 19 (a) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act was challenged in Great Sweet Grass Ous Limited v.
S. E. 0., et
and Kroy Oils Limited v. S. E. O. et al. 67 In these
cases the plaintiff contended that section 19 (a) (4), which provides
that the Commission may summarily suspend trading in any registered security on any national securities exchange for a period not
exceeding 10 days, if in its opinion such action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and the public interest so requires, deprived plaintiffs of property without due process of law and
failed to prescribe adequate standards to guide the exercise of administrative discretion. The plaintiffs further alleged that the Commission's successive summary suspension orders were an unauthorized
exercise by the Commission of the authority conferred upon it by
section 19 (a) (4) of the Act. During the pendency of this action
the Commission on April 8, 1957, issued an order permanently suspending trading in Kroy and Great Sweet Grass stock. Both Kroy
and Great Sweet Grass have filed an appeal from the Commission's
order. These appeals were pending in the District of Columbia Circuit at the close of the fiscal year.68
The Commission's enforcement of certain provisions of the Federal
Reserve Board's regulation T relating to margin requirements in
securities transactions resulted in the entry of injunctions directing
future compliance with that regulation in S. E. O. v, Western States

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY
COMPANY ACT OF 1935

HOLDING

The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 provides for
three separate areas of regulation of holding company systems which
control electric utility companies and companies engaged in the retail
distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The :first embraces
those provisions of the Act, principally those in section 11 (b) (1),
which require the physical integration of public utility and functionally related properties of holding company systems, and those provisions, principally section 11 (b) (2), which require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and :financial structures of holding company systems. The second area of regulation covers :financing
operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries,
acquisitions and dispositions of securities and properties, accounting
practices, servicing arrangements
and intercompany transactions.
The third area includes the provisions of the Act providing for exemptions, and those regulating the right of a person who is affiliated
with a public utility company to acquire securities resulting in a
second such affiliation.
COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMSSUMMARY OF CHANGES

During the :fiscalyear 1957, one registered holding company system,
the trustee of International Hydro-Electric System and its subsidiaries, which had ceased to have any public utility subsidiaries operating in the United States, was granted an exemption by the Commission
pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the Act,' As a result, there remained
on June 30, 1957, 22 public utility holding company systems which
are subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act as registered
systems. Of these 22, four systems comprising 130 companies do not
own as much as 10 percent of the voting securifies of any public utility
company operating within the United States," The aggregate assets

On June 30, 1956 there were 19 registered systems," Included in
these 19 systems were 21 registered holding companies, of which 15
functioned solely as holding companies and 6 functioned also as operating electric utility companies, 105 electric and gas utility subsidiaries and 47 nonutility subsidiaries, a total of 173 companies. In
each of 2 systems there were 2 registered holding companies.
During the fiscal year' 1957,registered systems divested themselves
of 2 nonutility companies with aggregate assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $5 million, Five companies were released
from the jurisdiction of the Act as a result of the exemption granted
during the year to International Hydro-Electric System, 8 companies were absorbed by merger and 1 was dissolved. Registered
systems incorporated 2 new subsidiaries during the year to take over
the properties of certain associated companies and they acquired 3
companies as going concerns with aggregate assets of more than $22
million. These changes brought about a net decrease during the
fiscal year of 11 in the number of companies encompassed within
registered systems.
The maximum number of <!ompaniessubject to the Act as components of registered holding company systems at anyone point of
time was 1,620 in 1938. Since that time additional systems have
registered and certain systems have organized or acquired additional
subsidiaries, with the result that 2,334 companies have been subject
to the Act as registered holding companies and subsidiaries thereof
during the period from June 15, 1938,to June 30,1957. Included in
this total were 216 holding companies (solely holding companies and
operating-holding companies), 1,008 electric and gas utility companies and 1,110 nonutility enterprises. From June 15, 1938, to
June 30, 1957, 2,042 of these companies have been released from the
active regulatory jurisdiction of the Act or have ceased to exist as
separate corporate entities. Of this number 921 companies with assets aggregating approximately $15.3 billion as at their respective
dates of divestment have been divested by their respective parents
and are no longer subject to the Act as components of registered systerns," The balance of 1,121 companies includes 773 which were re3 Excluding
the four registered holding company systems which do not own as much
as 10 percent of the voting securities of nny public utility company operattug within the

ceased to be subject to the Act as components of registered systems as
a result of exemptions granted under sections 2 and 3 of the Act and
deregistrations pursuant to section 5 (d) of the Act."
DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL REGiSTERED

SYSTEMS

Among the significant corporate developments in active registered
systems have been the incorporation of new companies to accomplish
certain realignments of properties, divestments of subsidiaries, dispositions of nonretainable properties by operating subsidiaries, acquisitions by systems of additional subsidiaries, all of the assets of an
electric utility, and segments of 'properties, and, as previously indicated, the exemption of one registered holding company system. Following is a discussion of each active system in which there occurred
during the fiscal year 1957 significant corporate changes other than
recurrent financing transactions. Most active systems undertook substantial bank borrowings and permanent financing during the year to
meet continuously rising construction' expenditures. Those developments are treated in a separate section of this report on page 131
below.
American Gas and Electric Co.

American Gas and Electric Co. ("AG&E") functions solely as a
registered holding company and controls the largest holding company
system subject to the provisions of the Act. It has 24 direct and indirect subsidiaries which render electric service to 1,331,000customers
in 2,328 communities in the States of Virginia, West Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Ohio, Indiana, and Michigan, having an aggregate
population of approximately 4,974,000. At December 31, 1956, the
system had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of $1,159 million and net dependable generating capacity of 3,973,000 kw. In addition, AG&E owns 37.8 percent of the voting securities of Ohio
Valley Electric Corp. ("OVEC") which, with its wholly owned subsidiary, Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corp., furnish electric power to
an installation of the Atomic Energy Commission near Portsmouth,
Ohio. There is pending before the Commission the issue of whether
the acquisition of OVEC's stock by AG&E and other sponsoring companies meets the standards of section 10 of the Act. This issue and
the organization and financing of OVEC and Indiana-Kentucky
Electric Corp. are discussed at page 126 of this report.

105

On September 18, 1956, Public Service Co. of Indiana, Inc. ("pSIll),
an independent public utility company engaged in the distribution
of electricity in the north central, central and southern portions of
the State of Indiana, filed a petition with the Commission requesting
it to institute an investigation to determine whether the proposed construction by Indiana & Michigan Electric Co. ("I&M"), a subsidiary
of AG&E, of a 450,000-kilowatt steam electric generating station on
the Wabash River in western Indiana, violated the integration standards of section 11 (b) (1) of the Act. PSI charged, among other
things, that the site of the new generating station was about 130 miles
from the nearest generating station of I&M and a considerable distance
from its distribution service area, and that it would be interconnected
with other I&M generating stations by means of 330,OOO-volttransmission lines which would cross existing PSI transmission lines. It also
charged that the proposed construction would materially enlarge the
present AG&E system and cause operations beyond the limits permissible by an integrated public utility system under the standards
of the Act.
The Commission held separate administrative conferences with officials of AG&E and PSI and with a member of the Public Service
Commission of Indiana, which has regulatory jurisdiction oyer both
PSI and I&M, and a member of the State Corporation Commission
of Virginia, which has regulatory jurisdiction over another electric
utility subsidiary of AG&E. Both State commissions opposed the request of PSI. A formal resolution adopted by the Indiana Commission stated, among other things, that the request of PSI was not proper
or desirable and requested this Commission not to make the investigation. The president of AG&E, who is also president of I&M, advised
the Commission that the proposed construction on the Wabash River
and the associated transmission facilities for bringing power to I&M's
service area "have as their purpose the supplying of electric power
requirements to take care of the load growth in the area now served by
I&M and neither I&M nor the AG&E system has any intention of
using such facilities to provide electric service in any other territory
than that presently served by our system."
On October 26, 1956, the Commission announced that it would not
conduct an investigation stating, among other things, that it observed
no basis for concluding that the construction of the facilities would
constitute an expansion of AG&E's integrated public utility system
beyond the limits previously found permissible by the Commission,"
On September 13, 1956, the Commission approved a proposal permitting AG&E to acquire the outstanding common capital stock of
Seneca Light and Power Company, a nonaffiliated public-utility comY

pany.' Seneca is an Ohio corporation whose service area is surrounded by the service areas of subsidiaries of AG&E and purchases
all its electric energy from Ohio Power 'o., a subsidiary of AG&E.
I n connection with this acquisition the Commission also approved the
issuance by AG&E of not in excess of 13,000 shares of common stock
having a market d u e of $500,000 which it proposed to offer in exchange for the stock of Seneca. The transaction was consummated
on September 17, 1956, with 12,800 shares of AG&E stock being used
to effectuate the exchange.
During the fiscal year the Commission approved the acquisition by
Ohio Power Co. of all the capital stock of Captina Operating Company, a newly formed subsidiary company: which will supervise and
operate a generating plant near Cresap, W. Va., having three units
of 225,000 kilowatts rated capacity each, on behalf of Ohio Power
Co. and a nonaffiliated company, Olin Revere Generating Corp., a
~vhollyowned subsidiary of Olin Revere Metals Corp.lo One of the
three units is to be owned by Ohio Power Co. and the other two by
Olin Revere Generating Corp. Ohio Power Co. and Olin Revere
Generating Corp. will reimhvlrse Captina for all its expenses in the
operation of the plant in proportion to the power and energy used by
each.
The Commission also approved the transfer by AG&E to Appalachian Electric Power Co.: us a capital contribution, of all of the
authorized and outstanding common stock of Ranawah Valley
Power Co." As a result, Knnawah became a direct subsidiary of
Appalachian.

On June 1, 1955, CENPUC filed an application requesting modification of an outstanding section 11 (b) (2) dissoltition order directed
against its wholly o m e d intermediate holding company, The Islands
Gas & Electric Co., and exemption pursuant to section 3 (a) (6) of
the Act. Shortly thereafter a large block (about 30 percent) of
CENPUC's common stock was acquired by certain new investors,
thereby creating several additional tiers of holding companies i n the
system's structure. With the company's approval, the determination
of CENPUC's application for 'exemption was delayed pending a resolution of these complications. Nun~erouscorlferences relating to the
problem were held by representatives of CENPUC, the Division of
Corporate Regulation, and the new investors.
On May 2, 1957, CENPUC filed an amendment to its application
renewing its request for exemption and stating that the ownership of
the large block of CENPUC3 stock had been transferred from domestic to foreign investors. The Commission, pursuant to rule 6,
issued a notice to the new stock owners terminating the automatic
exemption provided them hy rule 10. The new holders of the .controlling block of CENPUC's common stock thereupon, on May 10,
1957, filed applications pursuant to sections 3 (a) (4) and 3 (a) (5)
of the Act for exemption from the obligations of a holding company.
A t the request of the new holders of the stock, and with the consenf

Public Service Co. of Oklahoma ("Public Service"), an electric
utility subsidiary of Central and South West Corp., utilizes natural gas
as fuel in its electric generating stations. In 1955 Public Service
entered into an arrangement with Transok Pipe Line Co., a newly
created nonaffiliated company, whereby Transok agreed to construct
a natural gas pipeline to supply the natural gas requirements of
Public Service. Transok financed the construction of its pipeline
facilities principally through the issuance of bonds in the aggregate
principal amount of $17,500,000. The gas purchase contract entered
into between Public Service and Transok contained provisions whereby, in the event of default by Transok, Public Service agreed, at the
option and upon the demand of the Trustee under the indenture securing the Transok bonds, to either lease or purchase the pipeline
facilities, and to pay either as rental or purchase price therefor all
sums then due and thereafter becoming due upon the then outstanding
bonds of Transok. Public Service filed a declaration requesting approval of the gas purchase contract between it and Transok to the extent that the provisions of the Act were applicable to the transactions
therein contemplated. The Commission concluded that the obligation
of Public Service to pay, under the conditions stated, the interest on
and the amortization payments of the Transok bonds in the event of
a Transok default constituted a guaranty of payment of Transok's
bonds, and that therefore Public Service had issued a security requiring approval. After analyzing the financial effect of the transaction,
the Commission permitted the declaration to become effective as satisfying the standards of section 7 of the Act.13
Cities Service Co.

Cities Service Co. and 46 of its 47 subsidiaries constitute a fully
integrated oil producing, refining and marketing organization. At
December 31, 1956, the company and its subsidiaries had consolidated
assets, less valuation reserves, of $1,198 million. The company's
only remaining public utility subsidiary, as defined in the Act, is
Dominion Natural Gas Co., Ltd., which had assets at December 31,
1956, of $14 million and serves a population of 548,000 in 94 communities in Ontario, Canada.
Consolidated proceedings involving an exemption application filed
by Cities pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the Act and a section 11

affirming the Commission's action denying the exemption on the
ground that the existence of the public minority interest constitutes
an inequitable distribution of voting power contrary to the standards
of the Act, thereby precluding the granting of the exemption."
With reference to the proceedings described at page 131 of the
22nd Annual Report, involving the acquisition by W. R. Stephens Investment Co., Inc., from Cities of its holdings of 51.5 percent of the
common stock of Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Co. and the exemption
granted the Stephens Co. under section 3 (a) (4) of the Act, the
Stephens Co. has disposed of all of its holdings of such common
stock by means of certain private sales and a public distribution.
Among the private sales was one to Union Securities Corp. (now
Eastman Dillon, Union Securities & Co.) of 807,070 shares, which the
latter subsequently disposed of through a public distribution.
The Columbia Gas System, Inc.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc., functions solely as a registered
holding company and controls 13 operating subsidiaries and a subsidiary service company. The system sells gas at retail to 1,345,000
customers in 1,293 communities and at wholesale to other distributing
companies servicing 1,700,000 customers in the States of Ohio, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, New York, Maryland, and Virginia. The total population of the service area is 12,500,000. The
system operates 37,536 miles of distribution, field gathering and
transmission pipelines, and also sells gasoline, oil, and other hydrocarbons. The system purchases 80 percent of its gas requirements
from southwest suppliers and the balance is produced and purchased
in the Appalachian area. Columbia and its subsidiaries had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of $772 million at December 31,
1956.
In accordance with a systemwide realignment program, during the
fiscal year Columbia requested authorization to effect a series of intrasystem property transfers. The ultimate objective of this program is
to transfer to a single operating company all production and interstate transmission properties subject to the jurisdiction of the Federal
Power Commission, and to consolidate the distribution facilities within each State in a single company subject to the jurisdiction of the
appropriate State commission. Columbia anticipates that consummation of these transactions will, among other things, produce greater
economy by minimizing the problems with respect to rate and other
proceedings before local and Federal regulatory agencies.

The proposals approved by the Commission in the past fiscal year
to effectuate the realignment program included: (1) the transfer by
Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co. of its assets and properties used
in wholesale operations for the transmission and storage of natural
gas together with reserves, liabilities and obligations applicable
thereto to anew ly formed Delaware corporation, Kentucky Gas
Transmission Corp.; 15 (2) the sale and conveyance by Natural Gas
Co. of West Virginia and the acquisition by an associate company,
Manufacturers Light and Heat Co., of certain gas facilities located in
the Ohio-Pennsylvania
border area which were already integrated
with Manufacturers'
eastern Ohio operations; 16 (3) the merger of
Natural Gas Co. of West Virginia into Ohio Fuel Gas Co., the assumption by Ohio Fuel, as the surviving corporation, of all the liabilities of Natural Gas including promissory notes in the principal
amount of $4,02?,000 owing to Columbia, and the making of a capital
contribution by Columbia to Natural Gas equal to its earned surplus
deficit of $1,731,938; 17 and (4) the consolidation of the Keystone Gas
Co., Inc., with Binghamton Gas Works, both New York corporations,
with the name of the surviving corporation changed to Columbia Gas
of New York, Inc.1s After the close of the fiscal year the Commission
also approved the transfer by United Fuel Gas Co., for cash estimated
at $2,916,747, to Central Kentucky Natural Gas Co., both of Charleston, W. Va., of all properties which United uses in connection with the
retail distribution of natural gas in Kentucky, together with accounts
receivable and other assets related to such distribution operations."
In addition to the realignment program, the Commission approved
the acquisition by Home Gas Co. of gas production facilities located
in portions of Schuyler, Yates, and Steuben Counties, N. Y., from
the Wayne Gas Co., a nonaffiliated company, for a cash consideration
of $131,500.20 In taking jurisdiction over the acquisition by Home
Gas Co., the Commission observed that "Since the properties which
Home proposes to acquire will not be used in the distribution at retail
of natural gas and therefore are not utility assets, the exemption
afforded by section 9 (b) (1)21 is not available to Home; and since
such properties constitute an interest in a business within the meaning of section 9 (a) (1) of the Act, Home's proposed acquisitions are

further stated that "It is immaterial that part of the properties was

With respect to another proposal, the Commission determined that
the acquisition by The Manufacturers Light and Heat Co., pursuant
to an exchange agreement with Carnegie Natural Gas Co., a nonaffiliated public utility company, of certain gas utility assets located
in Marshall and Wetzel Counties, W. Va., and in Greene County,
Pa., was exempted from the Commission's jurisdiction pursuant to
section 9 (b) (1), since the acquisition had been expressly authorized
by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission and the Public Service Commission of West Virginia. However, the sale and conveyance
under the exchange agreement by Manufacturers to Carnegie of gas
utility assets, consisting of oil and gas leases, wells and pipelines located in Washington and Greene Counties, Pa., was approved pursuant to section 12 (d) of the Act.22

disposition of the Blackstone gas properties prior to January 1, 1955,
if the earnings from such property were necessary to enable EU A
to continue to pay dividends of $2 per share on its common stock.
The Rhode Island Legislature has adopted a special Act permitting
the creation of a new company to hold the gas properties presently
owned by Blackstone. On February 18, 1957, EUA filed a program
designed to accomplish the disposition of the Blackstone gas properties by July 1, 1960. The proposal involves a series of transactions
including the issuance of collateral trust bonds by EUA. A hearing
on this matter was held in May and July 1957 and post-hearing procedures have been agreed upon.
General Public Utilities Corp.

General Public Utilities Corp. ("GPU") functions solely as a
registered holding company controlling nine public utility subsidiaries, as defined in the Act, and three nonutility subsidiaries. Seven
of the public utility subsidiaries render electric service to 963,289
customers in the States of Pennsylvania and New Jersey. The other
two sell electricity to 283,710 customers in the Philippine Islands.
The effective electric generating capability of the seven domestic
utility subsidiaries amounts to 1,861,000 kilowatts and the effective
capability of the Philippine subsidiaries totals 222,000 kilowatts. The
consolidated assets of the system, less valuation reserves, amounted to
$721 million at December 31, 1956.
On May 14, 1957, the Commission authorized GPU to acquire from
Eastern Gas & Fuel Associates, a non affiliate, all of the outstanding
securities of Colver Electric Co., consisting of 245 shares of Colver's
$100 par value common stock, for approximately $257,400.215 Colver

On Maroh 24, 1957, the Commission issued its findings and opinion
and order approving a proposal by GPU to make cash advances to
its foreign subsidiary, Manila Electric Co., from time to time during
the period ending December 31,1958, in amounts aggregating $3,750,000.26 Manila proposes to use the funds for the installation of an additional 25,000-kilowatt unit to its utility plant, the total cost of which
was estimated at $5 million and the, sums advanced by GPU are to
supply the dollar component needed to purchase certain of the necessary equipment in the United States. Particular consideration was
given by the Commission to the effect of currency control in the Philippines. Since the proposed construction of the additional unit and
method of financing it involved the matter of future repayments in
dollars by Manila Electric to GPU, Manila Electric applied to the
Central Bank of the Philippines for approval of the program. Such
approval was granted, subject to a provision that such future dollar
repayments would be subject to governing Philippine regulations at
the time when the repayments were due. Under present regulations,
the repayments of the loan would be permissible at the rate of 20 percent per annum beginning 5 years from the date the new 25,000kilowatt unit commences operation.
In approving the proposal the Commission had to be satisfied that
the consideration was fairly related to the amounts invested in or the
earning capacity of the utility assets underlying the advances in terms
of the local peso currency. These requirements appeared satisfactory
as to the G PU loan, but as indicated, the ultimate dollar repayment of
the advances would be subject to conditions and circumstances outside
the control of Manila Electric and GPU. The Commission noted that
GPU's board of directors had determined that the proposed transaction was appropriate.
The Commission also observed that Congress, in its enactment in 1956 of a private law which, in effect,
'exempted GPU from compliance with a previous order of the Commission directing that GPU divest itself of its interest in Manila Electric, appeared to have given considerable weight to the financial aid
which GPU, as the parent company, is to render to Manila Electric.
On October 19, 1956, the Commission issued an order authorizing
GPU to dispose of its wholly owned nonutility subsidiary, Employees
Welfare Association, Inc. ("EWADEL"),
a Delaware corporation,
with respect to which the Commission had issued a section 11 (b) (1)
order in 1951 requiring GPU to dispose of that part of the company's

and rural areas in Ohio and 133 communities and rural areas in
Pennsylvania. The total population of the system's service area is
1,855,000. The combined capability of Ohio Edison and Pennsylvania
Power is 1,688,500 kilowatts. The consolidated assets of the system,
less valuation reserves, totalled $486 million at December 31, 1956.
Ohio Edison owns a 16.5 percent interest in Ohio Valley Electric

During the past fiscal year the Commission approved five applications for the acquisition of utility assets from certain municipalities
and an electric cooperative all located in the State of Ohio. These
acquisitions included a generating plant from the village of Plain City
for $410,000; 45 the municipal electric distribution system of the city of
Huron for $335,000; 46 the electric distribution system of the village of
Leroy for $78,500; 47 utility assets from the city of Galion consisting
of a distribution line approximately 1.2 miles long for $2,784; 4S and
a 2.7-mile transmission line from Delaware Rural Cooperative, Inc.,
for $14,700.49 The assets acquired under the foregoing orders are
located within Ohio's service area and will be operated as a part of
the company's integrated system.
The Southern Co.

The Southern Co. functions solely as a registered holding company.
It controls 5 electric utility subsidiaries which furnish electric service
to 1,372,000 customers in 1,406 communities and rural areas with
aggregate population of 6,405,000in Alabama, Florida, Georgia, and
Mississippi. The system also has 2 nonutility subsidiaries and a
mutual service company. Two of the electric utility subsidaries,
Alabama Power Co. and Georgia Power Co., each own 50 percent of
the capital stock of Southern Electric Generating Co., which is building a generating plant to furnish power to its two parent companies.
The Southern system has installed generating capacity of 3,288,380
kilowatts and at December 31, 1956, had consolidated assets, less
valuation reserves, of $932 million.
On February 27, 1957, the Commission issued an order approving
the acquisition by Georgia Power Co. of all the assets, properties and
business of Georgia Power and Light Co., a nonaffiliated electric utility
company and a subsidiary of Florida Power Corp. The Commission
also approved the purchase by Georgia Power Co. of a 1l0-kilowatt
transmission line from Florida Power Corp. and the arrangements
to finance the acquisitions. 50 The aggregate consideration for the
properties amounted to approximately $18,500,000of which $7,705,000
represented the assumption of Georgia Power and Light Co.'s first
mortgage bonds with the balance paid in cash.

Two regulatory commissions, the Georgia Public Service Commission and -the Florida Railroad and Public Utilities Commission,
urged approval of the acquisition.
In finding the transactions consistent with the standards of the
Act, particularly section 2 (a) (29) (A) thereof, the Commission,
in commenting upon the fact that the acquisition would result in
Georgia Power Co. serving virtually the entire State of Georgia,
stated among other things, that: "In some circumstances it might
give us cause for concern in connection with the effectiveness of regulation that a registered holding company system should absorb one
of the only two other electric distribution companies in the State
with which its rates and other practices might be compared. In this
particular case, however, the differences in relative size and type of
system operation between Georgia [Power Co.] and [Georgia Power
and] Light [Co.] are so marked as to lead us to the conclusion that
absorption of [Georgia Power and] Light [Co.] will not have a
discernible effect upon the effectiveness of regulation." The Commission also found that the acquisition would not in any material sense
extend the Southern system to a new area or region and that economically the service area of the company being acquired is part of the
area or region already serviced by the Southern system.
Standard Shares, Ine.
Standard Gas and Electric Co.
Philadelphia Co.

Standard Shares, Inc., formerly known as Standard Power and
Light Corp., is the top holding company of a system which no longer
has any public utility subsidiaries, as defined in the Act. At June 30,
1957, Standard Shares owned 45.59 percent of the voting securities
of Standard Gas, a registered holding company, which in turn owned
all of the voting securities of Philadelphia Co., a registered holding
company. These holdings reflect the consummation of a reorganization plan approved by the Commission under section 11 (e) of the
Act and ordered enforced by the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware. Pursuant to another provision of this plan
Standard Shares is in the process of conversion into a closed-end
nondiversified investment company."
At June 30, 1957, Standard Shares owned 50.89 percent of the voting securities of Pittsburgh Railways Co., a transit system serving
the city of Pittsburgh, which had assets, less valuation reserves, of
$43 million at December 31, 1956. On that date' Standard Shares
owned 4.58 percent and Standard Gas owned 1.20 percent of the

serving the Pittsburgh area which formerly was a subsidiary in the
Standard
system. The corporate assets of Standard
Shares
amounted to $29 million at June 30, 1957.
During the fiscal year, all of Philadelphia's approximately 51 percent interest in the common stock of Pittsburgh Railways Co. was
sold under a rights offering to the Standard Gas common stockholders, including Standard Shares, and substantially all of Philadelphia's interest in the common stock of Duquesne was distributed
to the stockholders of Standard Gas, including Standard Shares."
Later in the fiscal year, Standard Shares sold to the public 265,000
shares of Duquesne common stock." In addition, the Commission
released jurisdiction over the selection and composition of Duquesne's
board of directors."
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year Standard Shares .filed an application under section 5 (d) of the A.ct seeking
an order by the Commission declaring that it has ceased to be a holding company, subject to such terms and conditions as the Commission
finds as necessary for the protection of investors .
.As indicated in the 22nd Annual Report, page 143, and in the 21st
Annual Report, page 71, uncertainties with respect to certain unresolved tax difficulties arising from a dispute between Standard Gas,
Philadelphia and Duquesne on the one hand and the Department of
the Treasury on the other hand as to their Federal income liabilities
for the years 1942 through 1950 have been impediments to compliance
by Standard Gas and Philadelphia with the orders of the Commission
requiring their liquidation and dissolution. Although the income
tax difficulties remain unresolved, during the .fiscal year and with the
approval of the Commission and the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware the then existing tax cutoff agreement between Philadelphia and Duquesne was canceled and another tax cutoff
agreement substituted therefor."
The effect of this action was to
reduce the need by Standard Gas and Philadelphia to retain assets to
cover their potential tax liabilities. This permitted the divestment
by Standard Gas of the Duquesne and Pittsburgh Railways common
stock referred to above.

and in 123 other communities in eastern and central Missouri, 2 communities in Illinois and 1 in Iowa. As at December 31, 1956,the consolidated assets of the system, less valuation reserves, totalled $457
million. The system also owns certain gas utility properties and nonutility assets, and Union Electric Co. owns 40 percent of the common
stock of Electric Energy, Inc., which operates a large generating plant
which furnishes power to an installation of the Atomic Energy Commission near Paducah, Ky. There is still pending before the Commission the issue of whether the acquisitions of the stock of Electric
Energy, Inc., by Union Electric and other sponsoring companies meet
the standards of section 10 of the Act. This issue and the organization
and financing of Electric Energy, Inc., are discussed at page 126 of
this report.
During the fiscal year Union Electric disposed of its interest in
Poplar Ridge Coal Co., a wholly owned nonutility coal company
subsidiary.
In November, 1956, the Commission instituted a private investigation to determine whether Union Electric and certain of its officers
and employees had violated certain provisions of the Act. The inquiry related particularly to the question whether payments aggregating $35,000 made by Union Electric ostensibly to a Chicago lawyer
violated the prohibition of section 12 (h) of the Act against direct or
indirect contributions by a registered holding company in connection
with the candidacy, nomination, election, or appointment of any person for or to any officeor position in the Federal or State government
or in support of any political party or any committee or agency
thereof. In addition, the investigation concerned the question
whether any such payments had been properly recorded on the books
and records of Union Electric and whether financial statements and
reports filed by Union Electric with the Commission correctly accounted for and reported such payments.
The Commission's investigation was prompted by newspaper disclosures that Union Electric had issued $35,000 in checks payable to
the lawyer which had been found in a so-called "envelope account"
maintained at a bank by Orville Hodge, formerly State auditor of the
State of Tllinois, who was convicted of various State and Federal offenses. The possible violation of the Act was also the subject of a
simultaneous inquiry by a Federal grand jury in Springfield, Ill. The
Commission and the United States attorney's officein Springfield cooperated in this matter. During the course of the Commission's investigation some 40 individuals were interviewed and considerable
research involving the inspection of documents and other material was
undertaken.

The Commission referred the evidence which its investigation disclosed to the Department of Justice. The Department concluded that
the facts developed did not come within the reach of the Act. On
May 24,1957, the grand jury before which this inquiry was conducted
was discharged without voting any indictments. In view of the foregoing, the Commission discontinued its investigation.
Union Electric was also involved in a proxy controversy with two
of its common stockholders in regard to its annual meeting held on
April 20, 1957. Union Electric informed the Commission that it was
prepared to spend corporate funds to engage in a proxy contest with
the two stockholders, and the Commission pursuant to section 12 (e)
of the Act issued an order on February 27,1957, prohibiting any person from soliciting the security holders of Union Electric Co. unless
such person had first filed a declaration with the Commission which
had been permitted to become effective.56 Upon the filing of such a
declaration by Union Electric, the Commission ordered a hearing
thereon 51 at which the complaining stockholders were given leave to
participate. At the conclusion of the hearing the Commission issued
its order permitting Union Electric's declaration to become effective."
The two interested stockholders filed a petition to review the order
with the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit and
simultaneously requested the Court to stay the execution of the order.
The stay was denied. The Findings and Opinion of the Commission
was issued subsequently 59 and the petition for review was pending
at the end of the fiscal year. The Commission also sought an order
from the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Missouri enjoining the stockholders from sending out certain solicitation material in violation of the Commission's order of February 27,
1957. This. action was in the process of litigation at the end of the
fiscal year.
On March 6, 1956, Union Electric filed an application requesting
an exemption from the Act pursuant to section 3 (a) (2) thereof80
on the ground that it is predominantly a public-utility company
whose operation as such does not extend beyond the State in which it
is organized and States contiguous thereto. The application also
requested that the Commission release the jurisdiction previously
reserved over the question of the retainability of the gas systems of
Union Electric and its subsidiaries. Due to the relevance and importance of the outcome of the proceeding concerning Electric Energy,
Inc., to this application, the Commission has taken no action on the
application, and it was still pending at the close of the fiscal year .

The West Penn Electric Co.

The West Penn Electric Co. ("West Penn") functions solely as a
registered holding company and controls 13 electric utility subsidiaries, one of which is a registered holding company, and 6 nonutility subsidiaries. The system also owns some small water properties, coal mines, and transportation facilities. The system's consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, totaled $464 million at December
31,1956.
West Penn owns a 12.5 percent interest in Ohio Valley Electric
Corp. which, with its wholly owned subsidiary, Indiana-Kentucky
Electric Corp., furnishes electric power to an installation of the
Atomic Energy Commission. There is still pending before this
Commission the issue of whether the acquisitions of aVEC's stock
by West Penn Electric and the other sponsors meet the standards of
section 10 of the Act. This issue and the organization and financing
of aVEC and !KEC, are discussed at page 126 of this report.
During the past fiscal year the Commission approved a proposal
regarding the dissolution of one inactive nonutility company, the
Braddock Heights Water CO.,61and authorized West Penn Railways
Co., also an inactive nonutility company, to pay its parent, West
Penn, a liquidating dividend of $1,100,000.62 The application by
West Penn Railways Co. to pay a liquidating dividend indicated that
Railways is ultimately to be liquidated and dissolved. Of the
$1,100,000 to be distributed, $766,317 was in the hands of a trustee
which amount represented an accumulation of the proceeds of the
sale of certain property subject to the lien of the mortgage under
which there is outstanding $3,891,000 principal amount of 5 percent
noncallable bonds due June 1, 1960, issued by West Penn Railways

otherwise, as determined by the Trustee and West Penn.
Other Holding Companies

On June 30, 1956, there were five companies in addition to those

One of these companies, Engineers Public Service Co., is a registered holding company in the final stages of liquidation and dissolution. During the past fiscal year the Commission approved an
amendment to Engineers' section 11 (e) plan, providing for, among
other things, the payment of certain fees and expenses to counsel for
Engineers and counsel for the escrow agent under the plan and an
order directing the escrow agent to turn over to Engineers certain
funds held by it in escrow. The amendment also provided that the
Commission request the Court which had previously enforced other
aspects of the plan to fix a bar date for the filing of claims against
Engineers. The amendment further provided that a bar date be
fixed after which the right to exchange securities in accordance with
the plan of Engineers shall terminate. The application was approved
by the Commission on November 13, 1956,64 and enforced by the
United States District Court of Delaware on December 20, 1956.65
The bar date terminating the period for exchange of securities was
set at February 18, 1962.
Pending litigation involving The United Corp., formerly a registered holding company and now a registered investment company,
at the close of fiscal year 1956 is described at pages 147-148 of the
22d Annual Report. An appeal filed by Randolph Phillips, a stockholder of United, to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit, requesting a review of the Commission's order
granting United's application to be declared not to be a holding company pursuant to section 5 (d) of the Act, was dismissed for lack of
prosecution." During the fiscal year appeals were taken by Randolph
Phillips and Joseph B. Hyman from an order of the United States
District Court of Delaware dated October 31, 1956,61 enforcing the
Commission's order approving, among other things, the payment of
$50,000 to Phillips and $7,000 to Hyman, for fees and expenses in
connection with United's 1951 Amended Investment Company Plan.68
The amounts awarded to Phillips and Hyman by the Commission and
the District Court were substantially lower than the amounts requested by these applicants.
On October 22, 1957, subsequent to the end of the fiscal year, the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the District Court
and held that Phillips should receive $50,000 as a fee and $26,925 for
expenses, and that Hyman should receive $12,000 as a fee. A petition

ACQUISITIONS BY PERSONS OTHER THAN REGISTERED HOLDING
COMPANIES

The provisions of the Act do not pertain solely to the organization
and activities of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries.
Certain sections of the statute regulate transactions between other
persons and any electric or gas utility company and the acquisition
by other persons of voting securities of such public utility companies.
One of these provisions is section 9 (a) (2) of the Act, which requires
that the acquisition by any person of 5 percent or more of the voting
securities of two or more public utility or holding companies satisfy
specified statutory standards.
Central Vermont Public Service Corp. is a holding company claiming exemption pursuant to rule 2, and thus is required to obtain
approval of the Commission under section 9 (a) (2) in respect of
acquisitions creating additional affiliate relationships.
The Commission approved the acquisition by Central Vermont Public Service
Corp. of 1,730 shares (86.5 percent) of the initial 2,000 shares of capital stock issued by Vermont Electric Power Co., Inc.69 Central Vermont Public Service Corp., Green Mountain Power Corp., and Citizens Utilities Co., the latter two of which are not subject to the Act,

The first of these companies, Electric Energy, Inc. ("EEl"), was
organized under the laws of Illinois late in 1950 by five sponsor
public-utility or holding companies to erect and operate an electric
generating station at Joppa, Ill., to supply power to the Atomic
Energy Commission in connection with the operation of its new uranium processing plant located near Paducah, Ky. EEl had total assets, less valuation reserves, of $182 million at December 31, 1956', and
net electric generating capability of 1,003,800 kilowatts.
The sponsor companies and their proportionate holdings of the
62,000 outstanding shares of EEl's common stock are: Union Electric Co., an electric-utility company and a registered holding company,
40 percent; Middle South Utilities, Inc., a registered holding company, 10 percent; Kentucky Utilities Co., an electric-utility company
and a holding company heretofore granted exemption pursuant to
section 3 (a) (2) of the Act, 10 percent; Illinois Power Co., an electric-utility company, 20 percent; Central Illinois Public Service Co.,
an electric-utility company, 20 percent.
Ohio Valley Electric Corp. ("OVEC"), an Ohio corporation, and
its wholly owned subsidiary, Indiana-Kentucky
Electric Corp.
("!KEC"), an Indiana corporation, were organized in 1952 by 10
public-utility and public-utility holding companies to construct and
operate two large generating stations, one near Cheshire, Ohio, and
the other near Madison, Ind., together with the requisite transmission
facilities, to supply power to the Atomic Energy Commission in connection with the operation of its new uranium processing plant located near Portsmouth, Ohio. The consolidated assets of OVEC
and !KEC, less valuation reserves, totalled $374 million at December
31, 1956, and the combined proven electric generating capacity of the
two companies amounted to 2,365,000 kilowatts.
The sponsor companies and their proportionate holdings of the
100,000 shares of outstanding common stock of OVEC are: American
Gas and Electric Co., a registered holding company, 37.8 percent; The
Ohio Edison Co., an electric-utility company and a registered holding

As described at page 102 of the 17th Annual Report and at page
129 of the 22nd Annual Report, the acquisitions of the capital stocks
of EEl and OVEC by their respective sponsor companies and the
plans for the financing of these two generating companies and of
OVEC's subsidiary, !KEC, were tentatively approved by the Commission in the interest of national defense, reserving until a later
hearing the determination of whether the acquisitions of the capital
stocks of EEl and OVEC by the sponsor companies is consistent
with the standards of section 10 of the Act and the status of the
sponsor companies under section 2 (a) (7) of the Act.70 On November 19, 1956, the Commission ordered that hearings be held in respect
of these reserved issues." Hearings were held on the EEl matter in
March and April of 1957. Hearings were held on the OVEC and
!KEC reserved issues in March, May, August, October, and December
of 1957. The matters are still pending before the Commission.
In May, 1957, Middle South entered into a contract to sell its 10
percent stock interest in EEl to another sponsor company, Kentucky
Utilities Co., and the latter company agreed to acquire such additional
interest in EEl subject to the condition that the status of Kentucky
Utilities under the Act would not be altered as a result of such acquisition. A hearing on these proposals was held on June 24, 1957, and
this proceeding was consolidated with the section 10 proceeding involving EEl which had been commenced on November 19, 1956.
EEl undertook no new financing in the past fiscal year. The
earlier financing of OVEC and its wholly owned subsidiary, !KEC,
is described at pages 86-87 of the 20th Annual Report and page 84
of the 21st Annual Report. OVEC increased its Subordinated Note
indebtedness to its sponsor companies by $1,502,000 during the past
fiscal year. In that same period, the Commission authorized an increase in the principal amount of Subordinated Notes of OVEC from
$8 million to $9,102,000, the additional $1,102,000 to be taken down by
sponsor companies with funds which they received from OVEC as a
cash dividend on its common stock.72 Of the $8 million principal
amount of Subordinated Notes authorized in prior fiscal years, $400,000
was taken down by sponsor companies during the fiscal year 1957.
In the fiscal year 1955, the Commission approved allowances of fees
and expenses totaling $1,026,532 for services rendered up to December
31, 1953, in connection with the organization and financing of OVEC

One of the first cases which followed the adoption of this amendment related to the creation of Power Reactor Development Co.
("PRDC").
In .August, 1955, a group of public-utility and industrial
companies participated in the formation of this company as a nonprofit
membership corporation organized for the purpose of advancing the
art and technology of producing electric power by the use of fissionable materials.
During the past fiscal year PRDC filed an application
with this Commission pursuant to section 2 (a) (3) of the Holding
Company Act requesting that it be declared not to be an electric utility company. .After a hearing, the Commission found that PRDC will
be engaged, at least until December, 1959, in the construction of an
atomic reactor and in research and development in connection therewith. Thereafter, the reactor will be operated experimentally to
ascertain the technical and economic problems of operation, and to
provide its sponsors with the technical knowledge and experience
needed for the construction of other atomic reactors. In addition, the
company will not sell any electric energy, and will sell only steam to
Detroit Edison Co. and plutonium to the Atomic Energy Commission,
with the sale of plutonium expected to produce the larger portion of
PRDC's revenues. Since it appeared that PRDC will be engaged
primarily in the business of research and development, a business
other than that of an electric-utility company, the Commission concluded that PRDC was entitled to the exemption provided in section
2 (a) (3) of the Act.77

COMMISSION

In its opinion the Commission noted that PRDC would be entitled
to be deemed not an electric utility company, if it elected to claim this
status, under subparagraph (b) of rule 7, as amended on July 13,
1956. It also pointed out that this rule does not prohibit the filing of
an application pursuant to the provisions of section 2 (a) (3) for an
order declaring the company, which meets the standards set forth
therein, not to be an electric utility company. However, in harmony
with this rule, PRDC stipulated in its application and the Commission
conditioned its order granting PRDC's application on the representation that PRDC, on or before May 1 of each year, would make a filing
indicating whether or not there had been any changes in its business
in the following respects: (a) That its only connection with the generation, transmission or distribution of electric energy is the ownership or operation of facilities used for the production of steam from
special nuclear materials, which steam is used by another in the generation of electric energy, (b) that it is not organized for profit, and
( a) that it is engaged primarily in research and development activities.
Additionally PRDC agreed and the Commission ordered that there be
attached to such statements as exhibits statements showing any changes
in its charter, bylaws and licenses issued by the Atomic Energy Commission and any change in its members or in the relative voting
powers of its members, and a statement of its receipts and disbursements for the preceding calendar year and of its financial status at the
end of such year.
Yankee Atomic Electric

Co.

The Commission was called upon during the past year to consider
further developments in respect of another nuclear power project,
Yankee Atomic Electric Co. On November 25, 1955, the Commission approved the initial financing of Yankee and the acquisition of
its voting securities by certain of its 12 sponsoring companies, two of
which were subsidiaries of registered holding companies and two of
which were electric utility companies which were also holding companies exempt from the provisions of the Act. These transactions
are described in detail at pages 162-164 of the 22nd Annual Report.
Yankee was organized to construct and operate a nuclear power
plant which it is proposed will be of the pressurized water type, cooled
and moderated by ordinary water and using slightly enriched uranium
as fuel. At the time of the company's organization, representatives
of Yankee indicated that it was too early to formulate with any degree of certainty the company's ultimate financing program or to
provide more than a rough estimate of the total capital cost of the
proposed plant. It was estimated at that time that the entire plant
would require an investment of approximately $33,400,000. It was
also represented that the investment would be financed by means of

TWENTY -THIRD

conventional public utility financing arrangements with a minimum
of 35 percent of the total cost of the plant to be provided by the common stock equity investments of the sponsoring companies. Recently
the estimate of the ultimate construction cost of the Yankee project
has been increased to about $55 million.
In May, 1956, the Commission granted the company's request to
enter into preliminary discussions with representatives of financial
firms for the purpose of formulating its overall financing program.
Such authorization was subject to the understanding that no discussions as to price or other terms of any securities to be sold would be
undertaken. In the closing weeks of the past fiscal year the company requested authorization of the Commission to commence active
negotiations with prospective purchasers of its securities. In support of its request, Yankee contended that it was an unusual type of
company having no assets, earnings history or credit rating. It was
also urged that the unusual circumstances of Yankee's contemplated
operations made it desirable that its securities be sold to knowledgeable buyers who have the means of acquiring a complete understanding of the company's problems. The Commission authorized Yankee
to initiate negotiations as to price and other terms and conditions of
the securities to be sold with the prospective purchasers. However,
it reserved complete freedom of action to consider Yankee's formal
application for exemption from the competitive bidding requirements
of rule 50 when it is filed and stated that the application would be
granted only upon a sufficient showing that such exemption is
warranted.
FINANCING OF REGISTERED PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING COMPANY
SYSTEMS-TRENDS IN ELECTRIC AND GAS UTILITY INDUSTRIES

During the fiscal year 1957, registered holding companies and their
subsidiaries sold to the public and to institutions 39 issues of their
securities totaling $637 million. As in the preceding fiscal year, all
of this money was used to provide new capital. In 1956 registered
systems sold 45 issues totaling $589 million. 78 The increase in the
volume of external financing of $48 million, or 8.1 percent, in 1957
occurred despite the cumulative effect of divestments of recent years
and the absence from 1957 totals of any large scale financing by the
two large electric generating companies serving Atomic Energy Commission plants. In 1956 one of these companies, Ohio Valley Electric
Corp., sold $107 million of debt securities to institutions pursuant
to construction loan authorizations obtained from the Commission
in earlier years, as described at page 162 of the 22nd Annual Report.
This company sold only $99,000of securities in 1957. The other large

generating company, Electric Energy, Inc., sold no securities in 1956
and 1957. If the sales of securities by Ohio Valley Electric are deducted from the totals for both years, the volume of external financing by all other companies in registered systems would reflect an increase of 32 percent in 1957 over 1956.
Included in the above total were 32 issues with total sales value of
$590 million which were sold by registered systems in 1957 to the
public and to institutions by public distribution or directly to stockholders. The remaining 7 issues totaling $47 million were placed
privately with institutional investors.
In addition to passing upon the 39 issues amounting to $637 million
which were sold outside of their respective systems by registered
holding companies and their subsidiaries in the :fiscal year 1957, the
Commission authorized the issuance and sale of 78 issues of securities
totaling $219 million by subsidiaries to their parents. In 1956 subsidiaries of holding companies in registered systems sold 76 issues with
a volume of $199 million to their parents.

of companies in registered systems which sold the securities, and the

Excluding the companies in registered systems, the electric and gas
utility and natural gas pipeline companies in the electric and gas
utility industries sold $2,923 million of securities to the public and
to financial institutions in the fiscal year 1957. All but about $24
million of this amount was for new money purposes. The total for
1957 represented an increase of $943 million, or 47.6 percent, over
the volume of such financing completed in 1956.
The table on the following page sets forth the amounts of various
types of securities sold in the :fiscalyears 1957 and 1956 by registered
holding companies and their subsidiaries and by all other companies
in the electric and gas utility industries.
As shown by the data in that table, 28.1 percent of the total
dollar volume of external financing completed by registered holding company systems in the fiscal year 1957 was in the form of
common stock. The corresponding ratio for registered systems in the
preceding year was 20.9 percent. All other companies in the electric
and gas utility industries sold common stock issues in 1957 accounting
for 17.0 percent of their total financing as compared with 16.3 percent
in 1956. Bonds, debentures and long term notes accounted for 70.2
percent of the total volume of financing of registered systems in 1957
as compared with 71.2 percent for all other companies in the electric
and gas utility industries. In 1956 these debt securities represented
73.5 percent of the total financing of registered systems and 67.6
percent of the total financing of all other companies in the electric and
gas utility industries. There was a sharp increase in debenture
financing from 6.6 percent of the total by all other companies in the
electric and gas utility industries in 1956to 15.7percent in 1957. There
were virtually no changes in the proportionate amounts of debenture
financing employed by registered systems in those 2 years. It will
also be noted from the table that registered systems in both years
showed much less interest in preferred stock financing than did other
companies in the two industries.
The increase in the volume of new money financing in 1957 over
1956 by registered holding companies and by other companies in the
electric and gas utility industries was caused by the sharp upturn in
expenditures for new plant and equipment which began in the last
quarter of the fiscal year 1955. In that 3-month period expenditures
by electric, gas, and water utilities were equivalent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $4,090 million. The comparable adjusted annual
rate for the last quarter of the fiscal year 1957 amounted to $5,930
million and estimates for the first half of the fiscal year 1958 indicate
that a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $6,480 million may be
reached by the second quarter of that year.79

TWENTY-THIRD ANNUAL REFORT

Actual expenditures for plant and equipment by the electric and
gas utility industries, exclusive of the water and sanitation companies,
totaled $5,360 million in the fiscal year 1951, reflecting an increase of
$933 million, or 21 percent, over the amount expended in 1956. In the
calendar year 1956, the funds required by these industries to finance
their plant and equipment outlays were derived approximately 33.6
percent from depreciation accruals and retained earnings, 45.4 percent
from sales of new securities and 21.0 percent from temporary commercial bank borrowings.
Sales of securities by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries pursuant to sections 6 and 7 of the Act and portfolio sales
by registered holding companies under section 12 (d) are required
to be made at competitive bidding in accordance with the provisions
of rule 50. Certain specified types of security issuances are automatically excepted from the competitive bidding requirement of the
rule by clauses (1) through (4) of paragraph (a) thereof. These
include issues with proceeds of less than $1 million; private borrowings from financial institutions with maturities of 10 years or less;
issues the acquisition of which have been approved by the Commission
under section 10 of the Act; and pro rata issues to existing security
holders, such as non underwritten common stock rights offerings to
stockholders.
Of the 32 issues of securities totaling $590 million sold by registered
systems in 1957 to the public and to outside shareholders, as shown by
the table at page 132 of this report, 29 issues aggregating $554 million
were sold at competitive bidding pursuant to ru1e 50. The following table shows the number of issues and the amounts of each class of
securities sold by this method in the fiscal year 1957 and during the
period from the effective date of the rule to June 30,1957.

set by negotiation with underwriters.
These consisted of (1) a nonunderwritten offering by New England Electric System, a registered
holding company, of $12.7 million of its common stock in exchange
for shares of common stock of Lynn Gas and Electric Co., a nonaffiliated public utility company, which transaction is described at page
118 of this report; (2) a nonunderwritten rights offering to its
shareholders of $21.1 million of common stock by General Public
Utilities Corp., a registered holding company; and (3) a negotiated
underwritten public offering of $2.5 million of preferred stock by
Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Co., a public utility subsidiary of
Eastern Utilities Associates, a registered holding company. The
Commission granted exemption from the competitive bidding requirements of rule 50 pursuant to paragraph (a) (5) thereof with
respect to the Blackstone Valley Gas preferred stock sale and the
New England Electric exchange offering. Blackstone Valley Gas
previously had attempted to sell its shares at competitive bidding and
had received no bids.sO In the New England Electric case, the Commission determined that competitive bidding was not an appropriate
means of effectuating the exchange of New England stock :for the
shares of Lynn Gas and Electric. SI In connection with the proposed
rights offering of common stock by General Public Utilities Corp., it
could not be determined in advance of consummation of the transaction whether the provisions of clauses (1) through (4) of paragraph
(a) of rule 50 would afford automatic exemption from the competitive bidding requirement to all parts of the proposed financing. Accordingly the Commission granted the company an exemption from
the provisions of rule 50, to the extent such rule was applicable to the
transaction. S2
The only other securities sold by registered holding companies and
their subsidiaries in the fiscal year 1957 through channels other than
competitive bidding were the 7 issues o:f debt securities amounting
to $47 million shown in the table at page 132. Included in this total
were 2 issues of subordinated notes in the amount of $449,000 sold
by Ohio Valley Electric Corp. to the 12 participating companies,
which sponsored its organization and which own all of its capital

registered systems. During the fiscal year 1957, these companies
sold $2,923 million of securities, of which $1,060 million, or 36.3 percent, were sold at competitive bidding. Negotiated public offerings
were employed for the sale of $1,250 million, or 42.7 percent, and the

I Includes rights offerings to shareholders and Issuances of seeunties in exchange for properties or seeunttes
of other eompames.

The rights offering to shareholders continued to predominate in
the common equity financing of registered holding company systems
in the fiscal year 1957, accounting for 80 percent of the total in that
year as compared with 91 percent in 1956. The device seemed to be
less popular with other companies in the electric and gas utility
industries. These companies employed the rights offering technique
to effect 43 percent of their common stock financing in 1957 as compared with 77 percent in 1956. The numbers of issues and aggregate
sales value of common stocks sold by means of rights offerings, public offerings and other methods by registered systems and by all other
companies in the electric and gas utility industries are shown in the
table on the following page.
The types of rights offerings employed by registered holding company systems in the fiscal year 1957 differed substantially from those

PROTECTIVE PROVISIONS OF FIRST MORTGAGE BONDS AND
PREFERRED STOCKS OF ~UBLIC UTILITY COMPANIES

During the fiscal year 1956, the Commission adopted Statements
of Policy-regarding first mortgage bonds S6 and preferred stocks S7 of
public utility companies which represent substantially a codification
of certain principles or policies prescribed for the protective provisions of these securities announced on a case-by-case basis over a
period of years, as modified in the light of experience and a reappraisal of those principles and policies and in the further light of
comments received from various interested persons who had been invited to submit their views. From April 1, 1956, when the Statements
of Policy became applicable, to June 30, 1957, applications or declarations were filed by public-utility companies under the Act with respect
to 20 first mortgage bond issues aggregating $339,500,000 principal
amount and 3 preferred stock issues with total par value of $19,500,000.
Of the 20 first mortgage bond issues, 12 issues, with a total principal
amount of $212,500,000, included provisions, as set forth in the Statement of Policy, placing additional restrictions on the distribution of
earned surplus to the common stockholders, thereby assuring the investing bondholders of a greater degree of safety of their investment
through the maintenance of an appropriate common stock equity. In
respect of the other 8 issues with a total principal amount of $127
million, no additional restrictions were required since the indentures
already conformed in this regard to the Statement of Policy. The additional restrictions on earned surplus distributions were proposed by
the companies themselves or were inserted as a result of informal discussions between the staff of the Commission and representatives of
the issuing companies.
One of the more important provisions contained in the Statement of
Policy regarding first mortgage bonds is that relating to the renewal
and replacement fund requirement which is frequently referred to as
a minimum depreciation requirement.
Essentially, it requires that
the issuer construct additions to its property, or else deposit cash or
bonds with the indenture trustee, in an amount which on a cumulative
basis will provide for the replacement in cash or property of the dollar
equivalent of the cost of the depreciable mortgaged property during
its estimated useful life. The Statement of Policy provides that the
requirement be expressed as a percent of the book cost of depreciable
property. This is subject to the qualification that if the existing indenture provision expresses the requirement on a different basis as,
for example, in terms of a percent of operating revenues, no change
will be required if the company can demonstrate that the existing pro.. Holding Company Act Release No. 18105 (February

142

OOMMLSSION

vision provides an amount at least equal to a requirement based on the
book cost of depreciable property. .
In a number of instances the determination of an appropriate rate
of depreciation for indenture purposes occasioned differences of
opinion between the staff of the Commission and representatives of
the issuing companies. In all cases, however, after exchange of views
and data between the staff and the companies, the differences were resolved. In some cases where the issuing company agreed to insert a
provision that the requirement be expressed in terms of a percent of
depreciable property, rather than a percent of operating revenues,
an additional provision was inserted, in the interest of flexibility,
that the percent could be changed with the Commission's approval
upon application by the company. Of the 20 issues of first mortgage
bonds, the indentures of 8, having an aggregate principal amount
of $142,500,000,incorporated for the first time a percent of property
requirement. Of the remaining 12 bond issues, indentures of 8, having
a principal amount of $125,500,000, already contained a percent of
property requirement; the indentures of 3 issues, with a principal
amount of $31,500,000,did not require any modification of their existing percent of revenues provisions since such provisions were deemed
adequate; and the indenture of 1 issue, filed prior to July 1, 1956,
which was also on a percent of revenues basis, was not required to conform in this respect to this provision since the requirement did not become operative under the Statement of Policy until July 1, 1956.
Another of the provisions of both the bond and the preferred stock
Statements of Policy requires that the securities be redeemable at
the option of the issuer at any time upon reasonable notice upon the
payment of a reasonable redemption premium, if any. The purpose
of this provision is to assure that public-utility companies subject
to the Act shall be in a position, if money rates decrease materially,
to refund their bonds or preferred stock. This is deemed to be consistent with the intent of the Act, as expressed in section 1 (b) (5),
to ensure economies in the raising of capital. While the Statements
of Policy do not define what is meant by a reasonable redemption
premium, the working policy of the Commission has been that the
initial redemption price shall not exceed the sum of the initial public
offering price plus the coupon rate on the bonds or the dividend rate
on the preferred stock.
The Commission informally received a number of requests from
issuing companies to relax its requirements so as to permit bonds to
be nonrefundable for a period, after issuance, generally five years,
or to permit the initial redemption price to be higher than that provided by the working formula. No showing was made that higher
premiums on refunding would noticeably reduce the cost of financing

TWENTY-THIRD

so as to warrant the loss of future financing flexibility. In addition,
the Commission has noted that issues subject to its jurisdiction continue to attract a healthy number of bids. Accordingly, to date the
Commission has not acceded to such requests, although it has advised
the issuing companies that it will continue to consider each case as it
comes before it in the light of all the relevant circumstances of the
case at the time and under the then existing market conditions.
Because of the wide importance of this question of redemption
prices for refunding purposes in periods of high interest rates such as
the present, the Commission authorized a member of the staff of its
Division of Corporate Regulation to serve as a member of a committee organized by the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce
of the University of Pennsylvania, which is now making a comprehensive study of redemption provisions. The study is under the
sponsorship of the Life Insurance Association of America.
The three issues of preferred stock having an aggregate par value
of $19,500,000 had charter protective provisions conforming substantially to the provisions of the Statement of Policy, except that
in one case, involving an issue of $8 million par value, the Commission,
with the consent of the issuer, conditioned its order permitting the
issue to provide, among other things, for limitations on unsecured
indebtedness, limitations on the acquisition of its outstanding preferred stock which may become in arrears and limitations on the issuances of any prior preferred stock.
RULES, FORMS AND STATEMENT OF POllCY
Proposal to Amend Rule 9

On March 14, 1957,the Commission issued notice of a proposal made
by its Division of Corporate Regulation to rescind rule 9 providing for the exemption of any holding company system whose net
utility assets did not exceed $1 million at December 31, 1946. Eleven
comments were received, all favoring retention of the present rule
or some modification thereof. The Commission had the matter under
advisement at the end of the fiscal year.
Amendments of Rule 70

Section 17 (C) of the .Act prohibits any registered holding company
or subsidiary thereof from having as an officer or director any "executive officer, partner, appointee or representative of any bank, trust
company, investment banker, or banking association or firm" except
as permitted by rules and regulations of the Commission "as not adversely affecting the public interest or the interest of investors or
consumers." Rule 70 defines those persons to whom the Commission has granted exemptions from the prohibitions of section 17 (C).

COMMlSf3[ON

After receiving comments on a proposed amendment, the Commission
on April 23, 1957, adopted an amendment to rule 70 to permit' a
person whose only financial connection is that of a director of a commercial bank, as defined in the rule, to be a director, but not an officer,
of a registered holding company which has no public-utility subsidiaries within the United States and either is in the process of converting into an investment company in compliance with a final order
under section 11 of the Act, or is subject to an order entered under
section 11 (b) (1) of the Act which has become final requiring it to
divest itself of all its interests, direct or indirect, in any public utility
company."
Proposed Statement on Capitalization Ratios

During the fiscal year 1957, the Division of Corporate Regulation
of the Commission commenced a study of capitalization ratios for
registered holding companies and their subsidiary operating companies subject to the Act. The purpose is to determine the advisability of recommending that the Commission issue for comment a
proposed Statement of Policy regarding capitalization ratios. The
Division considers that such a Statement of Policy may be a desirable
means of informing issuers subject to the Act and investors and consumers of the standards respecting capitalization ratios which the
Commission would generally apply in deciding whether to impose
terms and conditions in granting applications under section 6 (b)
or to make adverse findings in respect of declarations under section
7 (d) of the Act.
To obtain the benefit of the views and comments of as large a number of interested and informed persons as possible, the Division sent
a questionnaire on September 5, 1956, to Federal and State regulatory
agencies, utility companies, insurance companies, investment companies, banks, underwriters, text book writers, educators in finance,
security analysts, and other interested persons. Copies were also
mailed to a large number of persons on the Commission's general
mailing lists inviting them to submit their views and comments,"
Over 200 public replies, plus an additional number of replies which
the writers requested not be made public, have been received and are
being carefully considered by the staff. Upon completion of its
study of the replies, it is expected that the Division will submit a report to the Commission regarding the advisability of promulgating
for comment a proposed Statement of Policy .

PART VII
PARTICIPATION
OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the United States District Courts. The
Commission's duties under Chapter X are, at the request of the judge
of the court, or on the Commission's own motion if approved by the
judge, to act as a participant in the proceedings in order to provide
independent expert assistance to the court and investors on matters
arising in such proceedings, and, where the Commission considers it
appropriate, to file advisory reports on reorganization plans.
Section 172 of Chapter X provides that if the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation does not exceed $3 million, the judge may,
before approving any plan of reorganization, submit such plan to
the Commission for its examination and report. However, if the
indebtedness exceeds $3 million, the judge must submit the plan
to the Commission before he may approve it. The Commission is not
obligated to report on a plan, and it has no authority to veto or reIf the Commission
quire the adoption of a plan of reorganization.
does file an advisory report, copies of it, or a summary thereof, must
be sent to all security holders and creditors when they are asked to
vote on the plan.
Because the Commission's advisory reports on plans of reorganization are usually widely distributed, this aspect of the Commission's
work under Chapter X stands out most prominently in the minds of
the public. However, these reports by no means represent the major
part of the Commission's activities in cases in which it participates.
As a party to a Chapter X proceeding, the Commission is actively
interested in the solution of every major issue arising therein from the
time it becomes a participant to the close of the proceeding.
The
Commission has found that adequate performance of its duties as
a party require that it undertake in most cases intensive legal and
financial studies. Even in cases where the plans are not submitted to
the Commission for advisory report or where the Commission decides
that it will not .file a formal written advisory report, it is necessary
that the Commission consider and discuss various reorganization proposals of interested parties while plans are being formulated, and
447579--58----11

145

146

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE' OO'MMIS&ON

be prepared to comment fully upon all proposed plans at the hearings
on their approval or confirmation.
In the exercise of its functions under Chapter X the Commission
has endeavored to assist the courts in achieving equitable, financially
sound, expeditious, and economical readjustments of the affairs of
corporations in financial distress. To aid in attaining these objectives the Commission has stationed qualified staffs of lawyers,
accountants, and financial analysts in its New York, Chicago, and
San Francisco Regional Offices and has assigned them to the performance of the Commission's duties under Chapter X. The
presence of these staffs in the field helps them to keep in close touch
with all hearings and issues in the proceedings and with the parties,
and makes them more readily available to the courts, thus facilitating
the work of the courts and the Commission. Supervision and review
of the Regional Offices' Chapter X work is the responsibility of the
Division of Corporate Regulation.
The role of the Commission under Chapter X differs from that
under the various statutes which it administers in that the Commission does not initiate the proceedings, hold its own hearings, or adopt
rules and regulations, but acts as an aid and adviser to the court,
paying especial attention to the interests of public security holders,
who may not otherwise be effectively represented. It has no authority to determine any of the issues in a proceeding. The facilities of
its technical staff and its disinterested recommendations are simply
placed at the service of the judge and the parties, affording them
the views of experts in a highly complex area of corporate law and
finance.
SUMMARY

OF ACTIVITIES

During the past fiscal year, the Commission actively participated
in 37 reorganization proceedings involving 57 companies (37 principal debtor corporations and 20 subsidiary debtors}.' The proceedings were scattered among district courts in 15 States, and involved
the rehabilitation of companies engaged in such varied businesses,
among others, as steel manufacture, oil and gas production, railroad
operations, small loans, a luxury hotel and gambling casino, and
telephone and electric utility operations. The stated assets of these
57 companies totaled approximately $485,295,000and their indebtedness totaled approximately $468,522,000. During the year the Commission, either at the court's request or upon its own motion, filed
a notice of appearance in 8 new proceedings and 8 other proceedings
were closed. At the end of the fiscal year the Commission was
actively participating in 29 reorganization proceedings.

a complete list of reorganization proceedings in which the
Commission participated as a party during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1957.

TWENTY -THIRD
THE COMMISSION

A..~AL

REPORT

147

AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

The Commission has not considered it appropriate or necessary that
it move to participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from the fact
that, with approximately 75 cases instituted during the fiscal year
1957, the administrative burden of participating in every case would
be unsurmountable with our present staff, many of the cases involve
only trade or bank creditors and a few stockholders. As a general
matter the Commission has sought to participate principally in those
proceedings in which a substantial public investor interest is involved.
This is not the only criterion, however, and in some cases involving
only limited public investor interest, the Commission has participated
because an unfair plan had been or was about to be proposed, the public security holders were not adequately represented, the reorganization proceedings were being conducted in violation of important provisions of the Act, or where other facts indicated that the Commission
could perform a useful service by participating.
The Commission
also has appeared in some of these cases in response to a request by the
judge.
PROBLEMS

REGARDING

PROTECTIVE

COMMITTEES

On July 19, 1956, an involuntary petition under Chapter X was
filed by certain creditors in the United States District Court for the
District of Nevada against Stardust, Lnc., a Nevada corporation organized for the purpose of erecting and operating a luxury hotel and
gambling casino in Las Vegas, Nev. Due to lack of funds, the proposed establishment had not been completed. Subsequent to the filing
of the petition, the debtor filed an answer denying certain of the allegations of the petition, alleging that the petitioning creditors were in
fact stockholders who are not authorized by Chapter X to file an
involuntary petition and praying that the petition be dismissed. Subsequently, two new groups of creditors moved to intervene and join in
the petition. A stockholders' protective committee was formed, the
chairman of which was formerly the vice president and treasurer, and
also a director of Stardust. From an investigation conducted by the
Commission's staff it appeared that this individual might be liable to
the debtor's estate for misappropriation of funds or for mismanagement. It also appeared that another member of the committee had a
record of numerous criminal convictions.
While Chapter X recognizes the right of the shareholders to be
represented by committees, such committees are subject to control by
the district court. A committee has fiduciary responsibilities and
from the nature of the services to be performed, "the fullest measure
of aid and protection to the investor demands a conscientious representation of his interests by persons who are responsive to his needs,

148

SECURlT1iES

AKD EXCHANGE'

OOMMISSiION

appreciative of his rights, and single in their loyalty to his interests." 2
The Commission has always contended that committees subject to a
conflict of interest are disqualified from acting in Chapter X proceedings. The circumstances of the stockholders' committee in the Stardust case impelled the Commission to move to appear immediately,
without awaiting the court's approval of the involuntary petition.
The Commission filed its appearance with the court's approval, took
part in the hearings on the involuntary petition and advised the court
to approve the petition. The court acted favorably on the Commission's recommendation. Subsequently, the Commission petitioned the
court for a temporary restraining order and a permanent injunction
against the committee to restrain it from utilizing authorizations and
funds it had received from stockholders, further solicitation of stockholder support, and otherwise acting in a representative capacity.
The court granted the relief requested by the Commission.
PROBLEMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION OF ESTATES

It is the view of the Commission that the primary aim of a Chapter X proceeding is promptly and expeditiously to effect a fair and
equitable and feasible plan of reorganization and that, normally, rehabilitation of the debtor's physical properties should either be provided for in the plan of reorganization or be deferred for consideration by the management of the reorganized company. However, in
special circumstances the Commission has taken the position that it
is within the permissible bounds of discretion for the district court to
allow a portion of the debtor's property to be replaced in the course
of a Chapter X proceeding.
Such a situation arose during the fiscal year in .the proceeding for
reorganization of the Hudson &: Manhattan Railroad Oompany. Part
of the business of the debtor is the joint operation of rapid transit
service with the Pennsylvania Railroad Co. between New York City
and Newark, N. J. In that case, the United States District Court for
the Southern District of New York authorized the trustee to purchase
20 new railroad cars to be used in this joint service. Certain senior
bondholders appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit. In its argument on the appeal, the Commission
supported the district court's order which stressed that the authorization for the purchase of new cars was not "to rehabilitate and refurbish and make handsome this estate" but was "on the basis of safety
of the public." 3 The court of appeals was in accord with this posi2 S. E. C. Report

and Functions of Protective and Reorganization Comnrlttees, Part VIII, 163 (1940) .

tion and held that there was no abuse of discretion in view of the
district court's findings that the debtor's cars were in hazardous condition, and the only alternative to the purchase of new cars were
"temporary or total abandonment of the joint run," which "would
be even more detrimental to the estate than the expenditure." 4
PROCEDURAL

MATIERS

Procedural problems are often encountered in Chapter X proceedings, and the Commission,when a party, has been diligent to
urge upon the court the procedural safeguards to which all parties
are entitled. The Commissionalso attempts in its interpretation of
the statutory requirements to encourage uniformity in the construction of Chapter X and the proceduresthereunder.
The proceedingsfor the reorganization of the Third A venue Transit Corporation and its subsidiaries in the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, described at pages
175-176of the 22nd .Annual Report, raised a procedural issue regarding adequacy of notice. On November 6, 1952, the trustee of
the debtor filed. a plan for reorganization and on that date an order
was entered fixing a hearing on the plan, on objections and amendments thereto and on other plan proposals. Copies of the plan and
notice of the hearing were sent by mail to all known creditors and
stockholders. From the date of the commencementof the hearing,
early in 1953, and until ultimate approval of a final plan in July
1956, the hearing proceeded from time to time with intermediate
adjournments. During the sequenceof hearings, evidence was presented, numerous plan proposals were advanced by creditors and
stockholders, and, pursuant to orders of the district court, this
Commission and the New York State Public Service Commission
reported upon the various plans for reorganization. After the court
approved and confirmed a final plan an individual, who was both
a stockholder and a creditor of the debtor, appealed from the district
court's orders to the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit on the ground that adequate notice had not been given to
security holders.
The Commissiontook the position that the district court's action
was proper because,not only was notice given of the initial plan, but
also after the filing by the trustee of an amended plan, notice was
mailed to all known creditors and stockholders of record informing
them of the continuance of the plan hearings and summarizing the
contents of the trustee's amended plan. Further notice of the plan
hearings was given in December,1955. Moreover,after the district

court had approved the amended plan in July 1956,notice of the hearing to consider confirmation of the plan, or such objections thereto
as might be made, was sent to the creditors and stockholders pursuant
to section 179 of the Act. The court of appeals in sustaining the
action of the lower court said:
It is not disputed that there was notice of the commencement of hearings
following submission of the original plan by the trustee, as well as additional
notices preceding approval of the plan. Appellant's position seems to be that
further notice is required by the Act. We find no sucb requirement. On the
contrary, if separate notice were required as a condttk.a precedent to the consideration of every amendment or modification or to resumption of the hearings
following a recess, it is plain that any party so minded could delay the proceeding indefinitely and cause needless and prohibitive expense."

Shortly after the petition :for its reorganization was approved,
an important procedural issue arose in the proceedings for the reorganization of General Stores Oorporation, pending in the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York and
described at pages 178-179 of the 22nd Annual Report. The order
approving the petition for reorganization specifically enjoined any
act or other proceeding against the debtor's property. A trustee under a Collateral Trust Agreement, representing the entire class of the
debtor's secured creditors, moved the district court to vacate the injunction in order to allow him to sell the securities pledged by the
debtor under tbe trust agreement. The securities were the debtor's
sole income-producing asset. The Commission, which is participating in the case, submitted a memorandum and argued in opposition
to the motion pointing out that when a Chapter X petition has been
approved by the court, such approval constitutes a finding that the
filing was in good faith, one element of which is that it is not unreasonable to expect that a plan of reorganization can be effected. In
this connection, the Commission noted that the trustee for the secured creditors did not object to the good faith of the petition. Moreover, the Commission stressed the fact that the trustee had not yet
prepared a report of investigation of the property, liabilities, and
financial condition of the debtor as required by section 167. This
report is submitted to creditors and stockholders in order that they
can reach an informed judgment as to the possibilities of reorganization and submit suggestions to the trustee for a plan of reorganization. The Commission argued that vacating the injunction would
completely frustrate the reorganization proceeding to the detriment of
the other creditors and stockholders. The district court denied the
secured creditors' motion on the grounds that, without the trustee's
section 167 report, the court was in no position to reach an informed

decision as to whether the debtor couId be reorganized, that the
trustee was to file his report shortly, and that no radical change of
circumstances had occurred since the approval of the Chapter X
petition,"
ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowances of compensation to be paid out of the
debtor's estate to the various parties for services rendered and expenses incurred in the proceeding. Since section 242 of the Act provides that the Commission may not receive any allowances from the
estate for the services it renders, the Commission is able to aid the
court with a wholly disinterested view on the question. It has sought
to assist the courts in protecting reorganized companies from excessive charges and at the same time equitably allocating compensation on the basis of the claimants' contribution to the administration
of the estate and the formulation of a plan.
During the fiscal year 1957 an appeal was taken to the United
States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by counsel for a bondholders' committee from an order entered by the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York granting final
allowances in the reorganization of Siieeian-Americaai Corporation.
The appellants challenged fees awarded to them and to the trustee
and his counsel. The Commission supported the appellants and contended that the over-all fees awarded were high in view of the size
of the estate and the results accomplished in the reorganization. The
court of appeals remanded the case to the district court with instruction that it should "incorporate the allowances recommended by the
S. E. C." 1 The court of appeals agreed with the Commission that
the district judge was incorrect in holding that successful opposition
to a plan "could serve as a basis for allowance only if it led to the
realization of substantially increased assets to justify the delay of
some years in the distribution of the estate." s The Commission was
sustained in its contention that denial of reasonable compensation for
services contributing to the defeat of an unfair plan is erroneous and
that section 243 of Chapter X was specifically designed to encourage
voluntary efforts beneficial to the estate in the sense of eliminating
from plans of reorganization unfair and inequitable provisions.

COMMISSION

District of Texas, Galveston Division, an application requesting an
allowance for services and reimbursement of expenses was filed by a
firm which had been the principal underwriter of debentures issued
by Texas City in 1952. The application was based on the contention
that the firm had acted in the proceeding in the nature of a committee
representing debenture holders. The Commission advised the court
that the firm's application should be denied in its entirety because,
while acting in such a representative capacity, some members of the
firm had traded in the securities of the debtor during the course of
the reorganization proceeding and the firm was, therefore, barred
from receiving an allowance by the provisions of section 249 of
Chapter X, which prohibits the payment of compensation under such
circumstances. The court agreed with the Commission and denied
the firm's application."
During the past year an issue was decided involving requested allowances in the Oentral States Electric Oorporation reorganization in
the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia 10 which is described at page 177 of the 22nd Annual Report.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed
an order of the district court which denied an allowance to attorneys
for certain former directors of the debtor who, by reason of the bar
of the New York statute of limitations, had successfully defended
themselves in an action brought against them by the debtor's trustees
in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York. The attorneys took an assignment from the defendants of
their claims for expenses and applied for allowance thereof from the
debtor's estate. The court of appeals refused to apply a New York
statutory provision authorizing the award of expenses to corporate
officials who have successfully defended an action against them in
their official capacity, pointing out that the only reason the action was
brought in New York by the trustees was "due to the accidental fact
that the defendants could be personally served there." U The court
went on to state: "The Bankruptcy Act is intended to be uniform
throughout the States except to the extent that its own provisions
are to the contrary * * *. We think it contrary to the manifest
policy of Chapter X to subject and hamper its provisions by a State
statute." 12 The Commission contended that application of the New
York statute would hamper trustees prosecuting causes of action and
would be contrary to one of the purposes of Chapter X which is to

Commission.
ADVISORY REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

An advisory report of the Commission provides the district court
with an expert independent appraisal of a plan indicating the extent
to which, in the opinion of the Commission, the plan meets or fails
to meet the standards of fairness and feasibility. After the report is
filed the judge considers whether the plan should be approved or disapproved. If the judge approves the plan, it goes to the affected
security holders for acceptance or rejection accompanied by a copy of
the judge's opinion and a copy of the report of the Commission or a
summary thereof.
During the past fiscal year the Commission submitted advisory reports in two proceedings. A brief summary of these cases follows:
Oolumbus Venetian Stevens Buildings, Ino.-The debtor owned
and operated three commercial buildings in Chicago, Ill. The plan
of reorganization proposed by the trustees provided for the sale of the
principal assets of the company at public auction for not less than a
specified up-set price. The Commission's report concluded that the
trustees' plan would not be fair and equitable unless it were amended
to eliminate certain limitations and conditions proposed in connection
with the bidding procedure which the Commission felt might discourage potential bidders for the debtor's properties. In addition,
since the trustees had been paying a commitment fee for a standby
loan previously obtained by one of the debtor's bondholders for the
latter's sole benefit, the Commission recommended that the plan also
be amended to provide that a successful bidder who made use of the
loan commitment should reimburse the estate for the commitment fee
paid by the trustees.
Subsequent to the filing of the advisory report, the trustees filed
amendments to the plan of reorganization substantially in accord with
the Commission's views, and in a supplemental advisory report the
Commission reported to the court that the plan as amended was fair
and equitable.
GreenRiver Steel Oorp.-The debtor manufactured and sold semifinished steel products with its plant located in Owensboro, Ky. It was
organized in 1950 and started operations in 1953 but construction had
not been completed. In early 1954 when the plant was ready to produce at something approaching its rated capacity, a slackening of the
demand for steel took place and the debtor lacked adequate working
capital. With a first mortgage note falling due on January 1, 195-7,
the management of the debtor determined that the earnings and the
financial position of the company would not improve sufficiently by

154

SECURITJ1E8

AND EXCHANGE'

COMMISSION

that date to make possible a refinancing. Accordingly, the debtor
filed a voluntary petition under Chapter X in September 1956.
The plan of reorganization proposed by the trustee of the debtor
was based on an offer by Jessop Steel Co., which manufactures highly
specialized alloy steels, to acquire all the common stock of the debtor
in exchange for shares of its common stock. The plan provided that
(a) the holders of Green River's first and second mortgage notes would
receive a new first mortgage note of the same principal amount, (b)
Jessop would lend Green River $1,500,000 of new money, (c) the
debenture holders would receive new income debentures in the same
principal amount as their existing holders, and (d) the common stockholders would receive 1 share of common stock of Jessop for each
10 Green River shares held.
The Commission found that the plan was not feasible. It expressed
the view that a fair valuation of the interprise based on future earning capacity was approximately $13,100,000. On the basis of this
valuation, as augmented by the new capital to be provided by Jessop,
the Commission advised the court the long-term debt proposed in the
plan amounting to at least $14,056,126,or 96.3 percent, was excessive.
In addition, the Commission reported that the new debentures would
be illusory to subsequent purchasers since the interest thereon was
noncumulative, they were non-interest-bearing for 2 years, and thereafter interest was payable only if earned. The Commission suggested
that the terms of the debentures be strengthened to make the interest
cumulative and to provide for interest from the date of issuance.
As to fairness, the Commission concluded that the debenture holders
under the plan would not receive the equitable equivalent of their
claims. The Commission pointed out that the just expectation of the
debenture holders was to be made whole to the full extent of their
claims before the common stock got anything and that the plan would
violate the absolute priority rule established by the Oonsolidated Rock
Products 00. v. DuBow, 312 U. S. 510 (1941), and other cases. The
Commission advised that fairness required that the debenture holders
receive a substantial portion of the Jessop common stock, all of which,
under the plan, was proposed to be distributed to the common stockholders of Green River.
At a hearing before the court upon the issue of approval of the
trustee's plan and consideration of the Commission's advisory report,
committees and the persons representing debenture holders and common stockholders of Green River urged the court to approve the plan
which the Commission had found to be neither feasible nor fair and
equitable. The court suggested, however, that Jessop modify its
offer to meet certain of the Commission's objections and Jessop
amended its offer and the trustee amended his plan accordingly. In a
supplemental advisory report the Commission concluded that the

TWENTY-TmRD

ANNUAL

REPORT

155

amended plan was a substantial improvement over the trustee's original plan with respeot to the treatment to be accorded the debenture
holders and the terms of the new debentures. However, the Commission again concluded it was unable to advise the court that the
amended plan was fair or feasible since the debenture holders were
still not being compensated fully for their claims and the amended
plan failed to rectify the inordinately high debt ratio proposed
for the reorganized company. The court approved the amended
plan of reorganization and subsequently the security holders voted to
accept it.
In the reorganization proceedings involving Inland Gas Oorporation, KenfJu<JkyFuel Gas Oorporation and American Fuel & Power
Oompany, which are described at page 91 of the 21st .Annual Report
and at pages 1'l4--1'l5 of the 22nd .Annual Report, there was no occasion
for the Commission to file further supplemental advisory reports in
the past fiscal year. However certain of the issues commented on in
advisory reports submitted at earlier stages of the proceedings and
which were pending in the United States Court of Appeals for the
Sixth Circuit were decided in the fiscal year 1957. The court, one
judge dissenting, affirmed the district court's order denying public
holders ~f unsecured debt securities post-reorganization interest."
Several petitions for certiorari were denied by the United States
Supreme Court:'
COMMISSION ACfIVITlES

UNDER CHAPTER XI

Section 328 of Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides that
the Commission may apply to the district court for dismissal of a
Chapter XI proceeding when it believes the case properly belongs
under Chapter X. The question of whether Chapter X, with its
broader powers to deal with all corporate problems and its provisions
for adequate safeguards for security holders' interests, or Chapter
XI, which can only treat with unsecured creditors, is the appropriate statutory proceeding for the financial rehabilitation of a
corporation is one which has arisen with increasing frequency in
recent years. The United States Supreme Court in the recent
General Stores Oorporation case did not lay down absolute criteria,
but stated that "the needs to be served" by the reorganization was
the determinative factor." The area of uncertainty as to the appropriate remedy for a corporation with public security holders was

reduced in the past year by the decision of the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit in S. E. O. v. Liberty BaJcing

oorporationr»

Liberty Baking Corp. filed a petition for an arrangement with
its unsecured creditors under Chapter XI in the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York. Of Liberty's
outstanding debt securities, 65 percent amounting to $1,031,820, was
in the hands of public investors and the entire issue of outstanding
preferred stock and 20 percent of Liberty's common stock were also
publicly held. The proposed arrangement provided that the debtor's
public debenture holders would receive new preferred stock with a
liquidation value of $50 for each $60 of face value of debentures
held. The preferred stock was to be entitled to dividends but was
noncumulative until after the :fifth year following confirmation and
there were certain other conditions which affected the payment of
dividends on the new preferred stock. For the :first 8 years, regardless of the outcome of the reorganization, it would be almost impossible for the old debenture holders as new preferred stockholders
to have any more than a minority of the total votes necessary to
control Liberty.
A motion by the. Commission to dismiss the proceeding was denied
by the district court and the Commission appealed. The Commission
contended in the court of appeals that Chapter XI was not available
because the plan of arrangement did not accord public debenture holders fair and equitable treatment since those security holders were not
fully compensated while stockholders were accorded participation
under the plan. The court of appeals agreed with the position urged
by the Commission and reversed the district court's holding that the
debtor might utilize Chapter XI. The higher court found that the
proposed arrangement involved serious questions as to its fairness and
thus "a grave question existed whether the plan would deprive creditors of their 'absolute priority' right as against stockholders." 17 Moreover, the facts, if explored, "might well lead to a determination by the
publicly held debentures that a change of management is essential." 18
It now appears clear, according to the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, that a debtor with publicly held debt securities cannot
utilize Chapter XI rather than Chapter X to avoid the requirement of fair and equitable treatment for such security holders where
Chapter XI would otherwise fail to meet important needs.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as
specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which
meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with
the Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified
include specified provisions which provide means by which the rights
of holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected
and enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of
eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests.
The Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all
liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after
default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill "in the
exercise of the rights and powers invested in it by the indenture" as
a prudent man would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must
be contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities
issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities
issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority
which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust
Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT

COMPANY ACT OF

1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting, holding and trading in securities. The Act requires, among other things, disclosure of the finances and investment
policies of these companies, prohibits such companies from changing
the nature of their business or their investment policies without the
approval of their stockholders, regulates the means of custody of the
companies' assets, prohibits underwriters, investment bankers and
brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of
such companies, requires management contracts to be submitted to
security holders for their approval, prohibits transactions between
such companies and their officers, directors and affiliates except with
the approval of the Commission and regulates the issuance of senior
securities. The Act requires face-amount certificate companies to
maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their
certificates.
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 1957, there were 432 investment companies registered
under the Act, and it is estimated that on that date the aggregate
estimated market value of their assets was $15 billion. This represents an increase of approximately $1 billion over the corresponding
total at June 30,1956. These companies were classified as follows:

STUDY OF SIZE OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES AND INSPECTION
PROGRAM

Pursuant to the direction contained in section 14 (b) of the Investment Company Act, the Commission has instituted an inquiry into the
problems created by the growth in size of investment companies to ascertain whether additional legislative protection is needed for investors and the general public. Among the particular objectives are
studies of the effects of the size of investment companies on the securities markets, the markets for capital goods, and the management
policies of these companies.
A preliminary report outlining all areas of possible exploration and
the ways and means of carrying out such a program has been presented to the Commission. The Commission is currently giving consideration to the areas to be explored and to the most economical

160

SECU'RITI'ES

AND EXCHANGE

OOMMJSSION

means of undertaking the procurement and compilation of the information necessary to complete the study.
As a result of an investigation of the accounts of one investment
company in 1956, some irregularities were disclosed which, together
with the rapid expansion of the industry, pointed to the necessity for
establishing a regular program of inspections. This work was initiated in the fiscal year 1957. One case was observed where the company did not record the date of receipt of redemption requests, So
that it could not be determined whether the company had complied
with the requirement of section 22 (e) of the Investment Company
Act that investors receive the net asset value of shares within 7 days
after tender of such security to the company for redemption. The
company on a number of occasions held up requests for redemption
for a short time where it appeared that such action would result in a
better price being received by the holder, overlooking the fact that
such action could adversely affect the rights of shareholders remaining in the enterprise. Because of urgent needs for man-power for
other functions under the Investment Company Act, it has not been
possible to make as many inspections as the Commission thinks desirable, and only six inspections were completed during the fiscal year
1957. This program will be continued to the extent that other workload and appropriations permit.
CURRENT INFORMATION

The basic information disclosed in notifications of registration and
in registration statements is required by rules promulgated under the
statute to be kept up-to-date, except in the case of certain inactive
unit trusts and face-amount companies. During the 1957 fiscal year
the following current reports and documents were filed:

APPUCATIONS

AND PROCEEDINGS

Under the Investment Company Act various types of transactions
are prohibited unless specified statutory standards are satisfied. One
of the principal functions of the Commission in its regulation of investment companies is to determine whether applications for exemption filed under various provisions of the Act may be granted pursuant
to these standards. Under section 6 (c) of the Act, the Commission
is empowered by order, either upon its own motion or upon application, to exempt any person, security or transaction from any provision
of the Act if and to the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of in-

TWENTY-THIRD

vestors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions
of the Act. Various other sections, such as 6 (d), 9 (b), 10 (f), 11
(a), 17 (b), and 23 (c) contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which the Commission may grant exemptions from particular
sections of the Act or may approve certain types of transactions.
During the fiscal year 1957 applications regarding 195 matters
were pending before the Commission, of which 140 were disposed of,
leaving 55 pending on June 30, 1957. Forty of the one hundred
thirty-three applications filed during the fiscal year were for general
exemptions, 22 for orders terminating registrations, 32 for orders
under section 17 of the Act permitting transactions between investment companies and affiliates, and 39 for other relief. The various
sections of the Act with which these matters were concerned and the
disposition of such matters during the fiscal year, are shown in the

an order declaring that the company's name, and particular words
used therein, were deceptive and misleading within the meaning of
sections 35 (a) and 35 (d) of the Act. In B. S. F. OompanyS and
Northeast Oapital 00rporation,4 the Commission granted exemptions
from the Act on the ground that each of the companies was primarily
engaged in a business other than that of an investment company.
In Alleghany Oorporation,B the Commission denied an exemption
from section 18 (d) with respect to a proposed issue, in exchange for
outstanding preferred stock on which there were dividend arrearages,
of new convertible preferred stock which was not redeemable until
1970, the Commission finding that the proposed securities were
basically long-term warrants prohibited by section 18, rather than
senior securities.
In Drexel & 00., et al.,6 the Commission granted an exemption from
the prohibition of section 17 (e), pursuant to the authority of section
6 (c), permitting the payment of fees to affiliated persons for services
performed in connection with a sale of assets by a subsidiary of an
investment company. At the end of the fiscal year another matter
in which a hearing had been held, Insured Accounts Fund,r where
an investment company was seeking an exemption from the requirements of sections 16 (a) and 18 (i) of the Act that stockholders be
accorded certain voting rights, was awaiting argument and determination by the Commission.
Matters involving affiliated transactions as to which no hearing was
necessary included three refinancings, five purchases of securities
during the existence of an underwriting syndicate, two sales of portfolio securities, a joint oil venture, a real estate mortgage loan, two
sales of real estate mortgages, one partial liquidation, a partial redemption of debentures, two final liquidations, a loan to an employee,
a purchase of securities of a nuclear engineering company, a purchase of oil and gas leases, a merger of two electronic companies, a
purchase of securities of a uranium company, a bonus plan, a first
refusal agreement relating to a sale of securities, and a transfer of
servicing activities of an investment adviser.
Due perhaps to the increase in recent years in the number of investment companies and the highly competitive nature of the industry,
there appears to be a growing tendency to adopt corporate names containing some special sales appeal by implying that the company's
securities have particular investment characteristics or that the company invests in a particular industry. Such names may be mislead• Investment

ing and deceptive unless the investment policies of the company offer
reasonable assurance that the implications of the name will be realized. In addition to the case of The Private Investment Fund for
Governmental Personnel, Ino., the Commission in numerous instances
during the year settled problems of this nature administratively by
requiring either a modification of the name or the conformance of
the company's investment policy to the representations implicit in
the name.
Some transactions involving investment companies, while important and complicated, do not require a filing under the statute by the
investment company' or any affiliated person. Nevertheless, these
matters are scrutinized by reason of the Commission's responsibilities
under sections 25 and 36 of the Act to bring court proceedings if it
believes that proposed transactions in reorganizations are grossly
unfair or that management has committed a "gross abuse of trust."
Changes in the ownership of stock of a corporation acting as underwriter or investment adviser may present questions under sections 15
and 36 of the Act. Under sections 2 and 15 the assignment of an investment advisory or underwriting contract necessarily results in its
automatic cancellation and the transfer of a controlling block of stock
of a corporation having such a contract is deemed to constitute an assignment. In a 1942 opinion, the Commission's General Counsel
stated that in general the purported transfer of an investment advisory contract for a consideration would constitute a gross abuse of
trust and be the subject of Commission action under section 36 of the
Act. A serious question is raised where there is a proposal to sell a
controlling block of stock in a corporation rendering underwriting or
investment advisory services to an investment company and the sale
is to be made at a figure above book value or at book value with other
collateral promises on the part of the purchaser. Such questions arose
with increasing frequency during the fiscal year. The complaint filed
by the Commission in the Insuramce Securities Incorporated matter,
discussed below, concerned such a question.
In another instance a registered investment company and its subsidiary proposed the disposition of their interests in several companies by the transfer of such interests to a newly organized multiple tier holding company system in exchange for several classes of
securities of the system companies and the sale of certain of the securities of the parent holding company. Some of the proposals involved
transactions between affiliated persons. The complexities in the proposed capital structures of the system companies were such as to raise
substantial questions of feasibility and fairness. After discussions
with the Commission's staff, the plan was revised to provide for the
organization of a company having a single class of stock and the dis-

164

tribution of such stock to the investment company stockholders. The
revised proposals, which had not been consummated at the end of the
fiscal year, did not contemplate any transactions between affiliated
persons.
LITIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

Just before the end of the fiscal year the matter involving so-called
"variable annuity" contracts was brought to trial in the case of
S. E. 0., et al. v, Variable Annuity Life Ineuromoe Oompany of
America, 1'JUJ.,et al.S The trial took place in the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia.
This litigation began in June 1956 when the Commission filed a
complaint in the United States District Court for the District of
Columbia against The Variable .Annuity Life Insurance Co. of
America, Inc. (VALIC). In its complaint the Commission alleged
that the "variable annuity" contracts sold by VALIC are securities
which should be registered pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 and
that VALIC is an investment company which must be registered with
the Commission under the provisions of the Investment Company
Act of 1940.
Some of the additional issues presented to the Court are whether
the VALIC contracts fall within the exemption from registration
contained within section 3 (a) (8) of the Securities Act of 1933;
whether the company's primary and predominant business is that of
writing insurance which would give it an exemption under section
3 (a) (3) of the Investment Company Act of 1940; and whether the
company is exempt from the Commission's regulation by virtue of the
provisions of the McCarran-Ferguson Act,"
In the case of S. E. O. v, Insurance Securities, 1'JUJ.,lo the Commission has appealed from an order of the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California, dismissing the Commission's amended complaint for failure to state a claim for which
relief can be granted under section 36 of the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The appeal is now pending before the United States
Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. lOa

Fund, an open-end company with $215 million of net assets, whose
Participation Certificates are sold to the public.
The Commission's amended complaint alleged that four of the directors, officers and controlling stockholders of I. S. I., and other
stockholders, sold their stock interest to a small group of purchasers
at a price that was over $4 million in excess of the net asset value
of the stock The amended complaint further alleged that the purchase price reflected the value of the perquisites and emoluments
which I. S. I. derives in the form of substantial fees from the Trust
Fund under the investment advisory and principal underwriting contracts, which under the Act are nonassignable; that the value attached
to such contracts, being an asset of the Trust Fund, equitably belongs
to the Trust Fund; and that these directors and I. S. I. are guilty
of gross abuse of trust within the meaning of section 36 of the
Act by reason of their appropriating such pecuniary advantages to
their own account and benefit and for profiting from their fiduciary
relationship to the Trust Fund. The amended complaint also alleged,
as a second cause of action, that the proxy material sent to investors
in the Trust Fund was false and misleading.
The relief sought by the Commission was a court order enjoining
the four directors from serving as officers and directors of I. S. I.
and from serving and acting as directors of the proposed board of
directors of the Trust Fund and enjoining I. S. I. from acting as
investment adviser and principal underwriter of the Trust Fund,
and an accounting for the pecuniary advantages which the four directors wrongfully and inequitably obtained as a consequence of the
sale of their I. S. I. stock.
The Commission also sought relief in the District Court with respect to the use of the proxies which were allegedly obtained through
the use of false and misleading statements. The District Court did
not decide the question of the violation of the proxy rules because
of its dismissal of the cause of action under section 36, upon which
the alleged proxy violation depended.
The proceedings involving the status of Alleghany Corporation
under the Investment Company Act described at pages 188-189 of
the 22nd Annual Report and pages 101-102 of the 21st Annual Report
were terminated by a decision of the Supreme Court of the United
States on April 22, 1957, that the Interstate Commerce Commission
had properly assumed regulatory jurisdiction over Alleghany pursuant to sections 5 (2) and (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act. It
reversed the court below which had held that Alleghany and the

During the pendency of those proceedings, Alleghany registered

reserving its rights on appeal, and thereafter Alleghany and preferred
and common stockholders :filed applications seeking, inter alia, an
exemption with respect to its exchange offer, nunc pro tunc, pursuant
to section 6 (c) of the Act. On November 23, 1956, the Commission

PART X
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF

1940
Persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising
others with respect to securities are required under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 to register as investment advisers. Under the
Act it is unlawful for investment advisers to engage in practices
which constitute fraud or deceit. The Act also requires investment
advisers to disclose the nature of their interest in transactions which
they may effect for their clients, prohibits profit-sharing arrangements and, for all practical purposes, prevents the assignment of any
investment advisory contract without the consent of the interested
client.
The Investment Advisers Act gives the Commission no power to
inspect the books and records of investment advisers, nor may the
Commission deny or revoke the registration of an investment adviser
unless he has been convicted of certain offenses involving securities
or arising out of his conduct as an investment adviser or in certain
other capacities, or has been enjoined by a court of competent jurisdiction on the same grounds, or has falsified his application. Violation of the Investment Advisers Act or the Federal securities laws is
not a ground for revocation unless the investment adviser has been
convicted or enjoined. Although as noted the Act prohibits investment advisers from engaging in practices which amount to a fraud
upon their clients, the lack of effective procedures for the enforcement of the statute has made it difficult for the Commission to control
the activities of tipsters who make extravagant representations
relating to speculative securities. Amendments to the Act which
would permit more effective enforcement and greater protection to
the investing public were introduced in the 85th Congress and are
presently pending.
The number of registered investment advisers continued to increase
to a total of 1,4iA, an increase of nearly 10 percent over the previous
year. The following tabulation reflects certain data with respect
to registration of investment advisers and applications for such registration during fiscal year 1957:

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

The Commission revoked the registration as an investment adviser
of Olifford A. Greenman, doing business as The Western Trader and
Investor,1 following a hearing and determination that the registrant
had been permanently enjoined by a United States district court from
further violations of the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act, as well as the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange
Act. The Commission's complaint for injunction had charged that
Greenman sold and offered to sell unregistered stock of a uranium
company by means of representations that the company had ore reserves in the amount of $70,791,000 without disclosing that this estimate was predicated on only 4 samplings, 3 of which were taken more
than a decade ago. The complaint further charged that Greenman,
who had been a registered broker-dealer, had taken undisclosed profits
in discretionary accounts in connection with the purchase and sale of
securities and converted to his own use funds deposited with him by
persons to whom representations were made that such funds would
be kept in a special trust fund not to be used except for the accounts
of such customers, and in addition, that Greenman had effected principal and agency transactions with customers without disclosing in
writing to such customers before the completion of such transactions
the capacity in which he was acting, and without obtaining their consent to such transactions.
The Commission also denied an application for registration as a broker-dealer of Western Trader, I'lW., a
corporation of which Greenman was president and controlling stockholder.
LITIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

The Investment Advisers Act gives authority to the Commission
to obtain court injunctions to prevent harm to public investors where
violations of the Act have occurred or are foreseen.

Pursuant to that authority the Commission filed a complaint to enjoin (Ionadiam. Resources, lna.2 from acting as an investment adviser
without registration under section 2D3of the Act. The complaint and
affidavits which were filed alleged that the defendant had inserted an
advertisement in a newspaper in which an offer was made to the general public of a 5-month introductory subscription to the defendant's
investment advisory bulletin at a price of $5. According to the advertisement, the bulletin was to provide information relating to
analyses and research on Canadian securities. The complaint further
charged that the defendant had never been registered with the Commission in accordance with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. A
preliminary injunction was entered with the consent of the defendant
and a permanent injunction was later entered by default.
In the case of S. E. O. v. J. Henry Helser and 00. and J. Henry
Helser 3 a final compliance order was entered by consent of the United
States District Court for the Northern District of California at San
Francisco requiring that the defendants' offering brochure be
amended to describe fully and accurately all material facts concerning the nature and status of the litigation, and the findings, conclusions and orders of the Court, the nature of the investment management service, the fact that the Helser plan commits clients' funds to
speculative trading, the relationship between the management fees
collected and dividends and bond interest income received and the
source of funds used to meet monthly and other withdrawals. The
order also prohibits the defendants and their employees from making any statement or representation inconsistent with the statements
to be included in the revised brochure and requires the defendants to
comply in all respects with the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. The
Court had previously found that the Commission had proved its case,
but believed that an injunction "would be a harsh remedy under the
circumstances" and ruled that the defendants should be given an opportunity to bring themselves into compliance with the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, but thereafter the Commission charged that an
interlocutory order, issued on April 29, 1955, had not been complied
with and sought the issuance of an injunction against further unlawful selling practices, and the final order was entered .

PART XI
OTHER

ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION

COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the fiscal year 1957 there were pending in the
courts 21 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices
in the sale or purchase of securities. During the year '71 additional
proceedings were instituted and 49 cases were disposed of, leaving 43
such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 5 proceedings in the
district courts under section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act; and in 10 miscellaneous actions. The Commission also participated in 31 civil appeals in the United States Courts of Appeals.
Of these, 15 came before the courts on petition for review of an administrative order, 6 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which
the Commission had taken an active part, 6 were appeals in actions
brought by or against the Commission, 1 was an appeal from an order
entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 3 were appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as amicue curiae. The Commission also participated in 9 appeals or petitions for certiorari before the United States Supreme
Court resulting from these or similar actions.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are
contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during
the year are discussed in the sections of this report relating to the
statutes under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

Twenty-six new cases were referred to the Department of Justice
for prosecution during the past fiscal year. From 1934 to June 30,
1957, 2,334 defendants have been indicted in United States district
courts in 561 cases developed by the Commission. These figures include 18 indictments returned during the past fiscal year against 51
defendants.
Also during the fiscal year there were 28 convictions in
17 cases, making the total 1,265 convictions in 530 cases. There were
7 appeals in criminal cases. In 2 of these cases the defendants un170

successfully attempted to have their convictions set aside and the remaining cases were pending on appeal at the end of the year. Three
criminal contempt proceedings were instituted during the fiscal year.
The defendant was convicted in 1 case, the other 2 cases were pending
at the end of the year.
Criminal cases developed and prosecuted during the year again covered a variety of fraudulent practices, including broker-dealer frauds
and fraudulent promotions involving inventions, insurance, mining
and oil and gas ventures, and various other types of business. The
defendants in some of the cases were also charged with violation
of the registration provisions of the Securities Act.
A four and one-half year prison term and an $18,000 fine were imposed upon Walter F. Tellier and suspended prison terms were imposed upon two officers of the Alaska Telephone Corp. in United
States v. Walter F. Tellier, et al. (E. D. N. Y.).! The defendants
were convicted on all thirty-six counts of an indictment charging,
among other things, that defendants concealed from investors the fact
that the corporation was unable to meet its debenture interest payments out of earnings and that the proceeds of each series of debentures sold were being used by defendants to pay interest on such
series as well as all earlier series. In addition, the indictment charged
that defendant Tellier advanced funds to the corporation to cover
monthly delinquent debenture interest payments, for which he was
reimbursed out of the initial proceeds of the next series of debentures
offered and did not disclose this fact to investors. Tellier is also
charged in a subsequent indictment with fraud in the sale of uranium
stock. This indictment charges that in his capacity as a broker he
persuaded his customers to buy shares of Consolidated Uranium
Mines, Inc., by making numerous false claims as to their value. It
also charges that he purchased shares for one cent and sold them
through his company for between 75 cents and $1.87, without disclosing his original cost to his customers. A third indictment has been
returned against Tellier and numerous other defendants charging
them with fraud in the sale of stock of Colorado Uranium Mines,
Inc., Mesa Uranium Corp., Three States Uranium Corp., Paradox
Uranium Mining Corp., Consolidated Uranium Mines, Inc., Cherokee
Uranium Mining Corp., and Blackstone Uranium Mines, Inc., in'
violation of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and the
Mail Fraud Statute and with conspiracy to violate these statutory
provisions, as well as the registration provisions of the Securities Act
and conspiracy to defraud the United States by filing false documents
and reports with the Commission.

Other broker-dealers upon whom prison sentences were imposed
were Gordon Keith Proctor (N. D. Georgia), Paui Scarborough, Jr.
(E. D. Virginia) and James J. Snoddy (S. D. Texas). Each of these
defendants had been charged, among other things, with converting
customers' funds to his own use. A complaint alleging similar fraudulent practices has been filed in United States v. Branch J. Oarden; Jr.
(W. D. Virginia).
In United States v. Jesse S. Gill, et al. (N. D. Georgia), the indictment charges that the defendants induced the Paleo Oil & Gas Corp.
to retain their firm as an underwriter for an offering of shares of the
corporation, and that defendants converted to their own use a sum
of money advanced for expenses and maintained fraudulent records
to conceal their actual disbursements in connection with the offering
of the Paleo stock.
Convictions were obtained on an indictment charging violation of
the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Mail
Fraud and Conspiracy Statutes in United States v. Edgar Robert
Errion, et al. (D. Oregon), in connection with the promotion of Mt.
Hood Hardboard and Plywood Cooperative Association. Defendant
Errion pleaded guilty to violating the anti-fraud provisions of the
Securities Act and was sentenced to twelve years imprisonment,"
Five codefendants also were convicted and sentenced to prison terms
ranging from 1 year to '[ years," The indictment charged that the
defendants, as part of a large scale scheme to defraud, misrepresented
to investors that defendants were about to construct a large modern
plywood and hardboard company to be owned and operated by members, that members would obtain continuous employment and job
security and that secret financial sources had agreed to provide from
one and one-half to five million dollars in financing the construction
of the plant. It was further charged that defendants organized
and incorporated Forest Products Cooperative Agency through which
defendants and their salesmen sold Mt. Hood memberships to about
650 people for approximately $650,000 and that a substantial portion
of these funds were diverted to defendants' own use.
Cases involving oil and gas promotions were again numerous.
Horner W. Snowden (E. D. Illinois) was sentenced to 4 years im. prisonment and fined more than $30,000 after conviction on an indictment which charged, among other things, that he falsely represented
that he had never drilled a dry hole, that investors' money would be
refunded on demand or if certain oil wells were deficient and that the
amount invested would be returned in 1 to 3 years. The defendant

similar charges, Melton E. Lightfoot (S. D. Florida) was sentenced
to 3 years imprisonment.
Jess M. Hickey and Loui M. White (N. D.
Texas) pleaded guilty to three counts of an indictment charging them,
among other things, with falsely representing to investors that they
believed they had found the greatest undrilled oil field in the United
States. Both defendants were sentenced to prison terms of six months,
placed on probation for 3 years, and fined $15,000. Ben E. Young
(E. D. Wash.) was sentenced to 18 months imprisonment following
his conviction on an indictment charging him with taking money for
advanced rent and filing fees on oil leases and converting the money
to his own use. Henry O. Gruemmer (S. D. Iowa) was found guilty
on 13 counts of a 15-count indictment which charged, among other
things, that Gruemmer knowingly made false promises of excessive
returns to prospective investors and falsely represented that the carbon
dioxide properties he contributed were free and clear of all liens and
encumbrances.
The indictment further charged that Gruemmer concealed from investors the fact that participating dividends were paid
out of capital.
Defendant was sentenced to a prison term of 5 years.
An indictment was returned in the United States District Court for
the Northern District of Illinois charging Harry G. Ames with misrepresentations concerning the amounts paid by him for the leases

the proposed company had the approval of the 'Washington State Insurance Commissioner, that all funds would be placed in escrow under
the Commissioner's supervision, that the company was financially able
to pay 6 percent interest, that the defendants had personally invested

organized and promoted by defendants to manufacture an instant
powder product which, when mixed with water, was stated to produce
a carbonated beverage. In the Getchell case the indictment charges,
among other things, that the defendants falsely represented to investors that the defendant had developed a secret and commercially
feasible process whereby paper pulp could be manufactured from
cabbage palms. In the Bartz case the indictment charges numerous
misrepresentations with respect to the use to be made of the moneys
obtained from investors, the profitable nature of the operations,
refund guarantees and other matters. In the Saunders case the
defendants pleaded guilty to charges that they defrauded investors
by making misleading and false statements which induced them to
invest in the Collective Trading Fund, an investment' trust controlled by the defendants.
Subsequently each defendant was placed
on probation for 3 years and fined $1,000.
William E. Horton (United States v. Horton, et ol., S. D. Calif.)
was sentenced to 3 years imprisonment and 5 years probation after
his conviction on charges arising out of misrepresentations to investors that the proposed Horton wingless airplane could carry twice
the payload of any other aircraft at half the cost and had 100 percent
greater range and speed; that it could carry 4,000 people 25,000
miles nonstop at over 400 miles per hour; that the corporation had
facilities to manufacture and was in the process of manufacturing the

new plane and that the United States Government was in the process
of contracting to purchase and finance production of the new plane.
The indictment also alleged that Horton failed to disclose that
Horton Aircraft Corp. had no assets and that Horton personally
would receive 70 percent of the authorized capitalization of the
corporation.
Sentences were imposed upon certain former officials of the Thermoid Co. and the company (United States v. Frederic E. Schluter,
et al., S. D. N. Y.), for false reporting in violation of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934:and conspiracy to defraud the United States
by violating that Act and the Internal Revenue Code. The four
counts of the indictment charged that the defendants caused false
and misleading statements, involving understatements of tax liability
and overstatement of net income, to be made in annual reports of
the Thermoid Co. for the years 1951, 1952, and 1953, which annual
reports were filed with the Commission and the New York Stock
Exchange pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934; that
the defendants conspired to evade income and excess profits taxes,
to defraud the United States in the collection of revenue and to
file false reports with the Commission and the exchange by falsifying
and manipulating company records. Defendant Frederic E. Schluter, who pleaded guilty to all four counts, was fined $40,000 and sentenced to a suspended 7-year prison term and 5 years probation;
defendant George S. Fabel, who entered a nolo contendere plea to the
substantive charges and a guilty plea to the conspiracy count, was
fined $25,000. Imposition of sentence was suspended as to him, as
well as to defendants Robert R. Stevenson and Thermoid Co. Each
of the latter two defendants entered pleas of nolo contendere to all
four counts.
In United States v, David L. Shindler, et al. (S. D. N. Y.), the
indictment charges that the defendants conspired to defraud purchasers of stock in Jerry O'Mahoney, Inc., by unlawful manipulative practices which artificially raised the market price of the stock
and that the defendants engaged in a series of transactions in the
stock, creating actual and apparent active trading in the security
for the purpose of raising the price thereof.
Harold L. Nielsen (D. Idaho) was sentenced to prison for 60 days,
having been found guilty of criminal contempt for violation of a
preliminary injunction enjoining him from violating the anti-fraud
provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act.
Nielsen admitted that after entry of the injunction he had misappropriated stock which was to have been delivered to his customers and
had sold the stock for his own benefit.

The criminal appellate cases decided during the year were H ols'llU1/1/,

States, unreported (C. A. 7, September 26, 1956). In the HolBman
case, the court held that there was substantial evidence to sustain the
finding of the appellants' guilt in connection with the fraudulent sale
of cooperative interests in a housing project. In the Vasen case, the
appellate court, without opinion, affirmedthe judgment of the district
court denying the defendant's petition to vacate and correct the judgment and sentence. The Vasen conviction arose out of an oil promotion involving the sale of fractional undivided interests in a well
20,450 feet deep, said to be the second deepest well in the world.
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission empowers it to
conduct investigations to determine whether violations of their provisions have occurred. The Commission continued to place great emphasis on the administration of its Enforcement Program with the
result that the number of investigations initiated during the year
was approximately 36 percent in excess of those started in _the previous year. There was also a substantial increase in the number of actions and proceedings resulting from investigations. Injunctive actions authorized by the Commission more than doubled those of the
previous year. Administrative proceedings involving broker-dealers
nearly doubled. The number of cases referred for criminal prosecution also exceeded the number for the previous year.
The primary responsibility for the conduct of investigations rests
with the Commission's nine regional offices. General supervision over
and coordination of the regional officeinvestigative activities is exercised by the Division of Trading and Exchanges. Effective investigation and protection of innocent persons who might have become the
subject of inquiry are furthered by the Commission's policy of regarding its private investigation files as having a nonpublic
character.
For the most part, the Commission's investigative machinery is set
into motion as a result of the scrutiny of complaints and inquiries received from the investing public, the broker-dealer inspection program, and the constant surveillance of the securities markets. If,
after careful consideration of the information received from those or
other sources, it appears that violations of the Acts may be involved, a
preliminary investigation may be made.
The preliminary investigations are initiated to obtain readily available information sufficient for a determination as to whether any violation of the Acts has occurred. Thus, they generally take the form of
telephone inquiries or correspondence with persons who may have information on the subject, personal interviews with a selected number

TW~-THIRD

177

ANNUAL REPORT

of persons, and a review of the Commission's files. However, where a
violation is disclosed, but it is ascertained that it was due to ignorance
of the law or some misunderstanding and no serious harm to the public is involved, no further action is ordinarily taken except to inform
the offender of the violations and to insure that steps are taken to procure future compliance.
Another purpose of the preliminary investigation is to determine
whether a more full and detailed inquiry is appropriate. When a
more extensive investigation is considered to be in order, the matter is
docketed. If, in the course of a docketed investigation, the Commission .findsthat necessary evidence cannot otherwise be obtained it
may, pursuant to its statutory authority, appoint members of its staff
as officerswith power to issue subpoenas requiring appearance of witnesses to testify under oath and the production of documents. During the :fiscalyear, 73 such orders were issued.
Completed investigations are reviewed by the Regional Administrator concerned, who submits the report together with his recommendation as to the disposition of the matter to the Commission. The
report is in turn analyzed by the staff of the Commission's principal
officeand presented with the recommendations of the regional and the
principal officeto the Commission for .finaldecision as to what, if any,
action the circumstances require.
The Commission may,. if it considers it appropriate, close the investigation. On the other hand, it may decide the public interest requires that some action be taken, in which event several courses are
available to it. It may, in cases that appear to warrant criminal
prosecution, refer the evidence to the Department of Justice. Insuch
matters, members of the staff familiar with the investigation assist
the United States Attorney assigned to the matter in his presentation
of the case to the Grand Jury and, should an indictment be returned,
in the prosecution of the criminal action. In addition, the Commission may institute administrative proceedings against registered
broker-dealers and investment advisers or bring injunctive action in
the Federal courts to stop further violation of the Acts. Evidence of
violations of other Federal and State laws may be referred to appropriate Federal or State authorities.

activities of the Commission during the :fiscalyear: ,

ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO CANADIAN SECURITIES

The offer and sale of securities by Canadian issuers and broker-dealers in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act
continue to present difficult enforcement problems. The principal
difficulty arises from the fact that the Commission has no authority to
conduct investigations outside the United States while the evidence
to establish violations in most of these cases, as well as the violators,
are located in a foreign country. Where personal service can be obtained in the United States effective action is taken to stop such violations.
In the last annual report problems arising under the
Supplementary Extradition Convention between the United States
and Canada and the narrow construction placed thereon by Canadian
courts were discussed. Negotiations to correct the situation have continued through appropriate diplomatic channels.
In order to do effective enforcement work in this area, it is necessary
that there be full cooperation between this Commission and the corresponding enforcement authorities in Canada. There are no securities laws applicable throughout the Dominion of Canada, but each
Province has its own legislation and regulation. Relations between
this Commission and the various provincial authorities are very good,
and excellent cooperation is obtained from them in our enforcement
work. Some of the Provinces have also taken action under their
respective laws after being advised that their residents were engaged
in violating the laws of the United States. The registrations of seven
broker-dealers and three securities issuers were either cancelled or not
renewed by provincial authorities following receipt of information
supplied by this Commission.
New legislation in the Province of Alberta provided a new securities
act in that Province and created a Securities Commission to administer the act. It is believed that violations of United States laws
emanating from Alberta will be substantially reduced through the
adoption and vigorous enforcement of that act.
The migration of persons engaged in illegal sales activities from
one province to another continues to create a problem for Canadian
authorities desirous of cooperating with this Commission. It would
appear that persons who become the subjects of investigation or enforcement action, particularly in the Provinces of Ontario and Quebec, soon carry on their operations from another Province, frequently
operating under a different name. Strengthened enforcement by all
of the Provinces will be necessary completely to eliminate this type
of operation.
With the cooperation of Canadian authorities in developing evidence, this Commission during the fiscal year brought two injunctive
actions based upon illegal sale of Canadian securities in the United
States. In one action, in the Southern District of New York, Robert

TWENTY -THIRD

ANNUAL REPORT

179

Rodman and Sidney Newman, both residents of the United States,
were enjoined from selling stock of Torbrook Iron Ore Mines, Ltd.,
in Violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. In
the other action, filed in United States District Court for the Western
District of Washington, a preliminary injunction based upon violation of the antifraud and registration provisions of the Securities
Act, was entered against Kaiser Development Oorporation; Limited,
and E. David Novelle, a United States resident and former president
of Kaiser Development.
As indicated above, as a result of proceedings initiated under
section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to determine whether securities of (heat Sweet (hass Oils Limited and K roy
Oils Limited should be withdrawn from trading on the American
Stock Exchange, the Commission found that reports filed with the
Commission and the Exchange as required by section 13 of the Act
were false and misleading and issued an order withdrawing the securities from trading on the exchange," Both issuers were Canadian
corporations.
The Commission also denied registration of George W. Ohilian,
doing business as George W. Ohilian & Oompany, based upon violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act in the sale of
New Metalore Mining Co., Ltd., a Canadian mining company," Chilian
was a resident of the United States and effected sales to residents of
this country.
In a further effort to strengthen its enforcement program, the Commission during the year adopted rule 17a-7 under the Securities Exchange Act which requires nonresident broker-dealers registered with
the Commission either to maintain at a place within the United States,
or to furnish to the Commission upon formal demand, true, correct,
complete and current copies of the books and records which the registrant is required to make, keep current, maintain or preserve pursuant
to any provision of any rule or regulation of the Commission adopted
under the Act,"
The Commission maintains its "Canadian Restricted List" containing the names of issuers whose securities the Commission has reason
to believe recently have been, or currently are being, offered and sold
in the United States in violation of the Securities Act of 1933. Names
are added to and deleted from the list as circumstances warrant. During the fiscal year 1957 six supplements were issued bringing current
the list shown in Securities Act Release No. 3632, dated April 24,
1956. These SUPPlements added 64 names to the list and deleted 10.

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

To provide a further means of detecting and preventing fraud in
securities transactions, the Commission maintains a Section of Securities Violations. In brief, the Section maintains records concerning persons who have been charged with violations of various Federal

182

SIECURITI'ES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSIION

and State securities statutes and operates as a clearinghouse for dispensing this information to other enforcement agencies. Considerable information is also maintained concerning violators who are residents in the Provinces of Canada.
Extensive use is made of the information available in these records
by regulatory and law enforcing officials. During the past year the
Commission received 3,262 "securities violations" letters or reports
and dispatched 1,625 communications to cooperating agencies.
The specialized information in these files is kept current through
the cooperation of the United States Post Office Department, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials, State
securities authorities, Federal and State prosecuting attorneys, police
officers, better business bureaus and chambers of commerce. At the
end of the fiscal year these records contained information concerning
62,624 persons aga~t whom Federal or State action had been taken
in connection with securities violations. There were added during the
:fiscal year items of information concerning 6,894 persons, including
2,960 concerning persons not previously identified therein.
The section issues and distributes quarterly a Securities Violations
Bulletin containing information received during the period concerning
violators showing new charges and developments in pending cases.
The Bulletin includes a "Wanted" section in which are listed the
names and references to bulletins containing descriptive information
as to persons wanted on securities violations charges. The Bulletin
is distributed to a limited number of cooperating law enforcement officials in the United States and Canada.
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Dependable, informative financial statements, i. e., statements which
disclose the financial status and earnings history of a corporation or
other commercial entity, whether filed in compliance with the statutes
administered by the Commission or included in other material available to stockholders or prospective investors, are indispensable to the
investor as a basis for investment decisions.
The Congress recognized the importance of these statements and
that they lend themselves readily to misleading inferences or even deception, whether or not intended. It accordingly dealt extensively in
the several statutes administered by the Commission with financial
statement presentation and the disclosure requirements necessary to
set forth fairly the financial condition of the company. Thus, for example, the Securities Act requires the inclusion in the prospectus of
balance sheets and profit and loss statements "in such form as the
Commission shall prescribe" 9 and authorizes the Commission to pre• See. 10 (a) (1) (Schedule A. pars. 25. 26).

TWENTY-mIRD

scribe "the items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of
accounts * * *".10 Similar authority is contained in the Securities
Exchange Act,I1 and more comprehensive power is embodied in the
Investment Company Act 12and the Holding Company Act.13
The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by t'an independent public or certified accountant." 14
The other three statutes permit the Commission to require that such
statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public
accountant, 15and the Commission's rules require, with minor exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by qualified
accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement
as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual accountants, was for the :first time authoritatively and explicitly introduced into law in 1933. Out of this initial provision
in the Securities Act and the rules promulgated by the Commission, 16
and the action taken by the Commission in certain cases,17 have
grown concepts of accountant-client relationships that have strengthened the protection afforded investors.
The Commission's standards of independence are stated in rules
2-01 (b) and (c) of regulation S-X which provide among other
things that an accountant will not be considered independent with
respect to any person, or any affiliate thereof, for any period during
which he has any financial interest, direct or indirect, in such person,
or with whom he is or was connected as a promoter, underwriter,
voting trustee, director, officer, or employee. In determining whether
an accountant is in fact independent with respect to a particular
registrant, the Commission will give appropriate consideration to all
relevant circumstances, including evidence bearing on all relationships
between the accountant and that registrant or any affiliate thereof.
During the last several years many corporations whose securities
were closely held or traded only over-the-counter found it necessary or
desirable to sell securities to the public in interstate commerce or to
list securities on a national securities exchange and thus for the first
time became subject to the filing requirements of the several Acts

administered by the Commission. Experience with the Commission's
certification requirements disclosed that many accountants found that
they were unable to certify the financial statements of clients of long
standing because during the period for which financial data was required to be furnished they had not in fact been independent under
our rules. The most common cause of lack of independence was
ownership by a member of the accounting :firm of stock of the client
company during any of the periods certified. This the Commission
deems an absolute bar to independence, though exceptions where there
would be particular hardship and investor protection can be achieved
by other safeguards have occasionally been permitted.
Another reason for finding a lack of independence, in a number of
current cases but particularly in the situations described above, is the
fact that some accountants intending to certify financial statements
included in such filings have been interested in serving the client's
management, or in some cases large stockholders, in several capacities
and in doing so have not taken care to maintain a clear distinction
between giving advice to management and serving as personal representatives of management or owners and making business decisions
for them.
As shown above, the statutes administered by the Commission give
it broad rule-making power with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. Pursuant to the authority contained
in the statutes the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of
accounts for companies subject to the Holding Company Act; 18 has
adopted rules under the Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers; and has promulgated rules contained in a single, comprehensive regulation, identified
as regulation S-X,19 which govern the form and content of financial
statements filed in compliance with the several acts. This regulation
is implemented by the Commission's Accounting Series releases, of
which 78 have so far been issued. These releases were inaugurated
in 1937, and were designed as a program for making public, from
time to time, opinions on accounting principles, for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in
major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the uniform systems of accounts, prescribe accounting to be followed only in certain basic respects. In the large area
not covered by such rules, the Commission's principal reliance for
the protection of investors is on the determination and application
U Unilorm Sf/stem 01 Accounts lor Mutual Service Oompanies and Subsidiary Service

of accounting principles and standards which are recognized as sound
and which have attained general acceptance.
Changes and new developments in financial and economic conditions
affect the operations and financial status of the several thousand
commercial and industrial companies required to file statements with
the Commission. It is necessary for the Commission to be informed
of the changes and new developments in these fields and to make
certain that the effects thereof are properly reported to investors.
The Commission's accounting staff, therefore, engages in studies designed to establish and maintain appropriate accounting procedures
and practices.
The primary responsibility for this program rests
with the chief accountant of the Commission who has general supervision with respect to accounting and auditing policies and their
application.
Progress in these activities requires constant contact and cooperation between the staff and accountants both individually and through
such representative groups as, among others, the .American Accounting Association, the .American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the .American Petroleum Institute, the Controllers Institute
of .America, the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, the National Federation of Financial Analysts Societies,
as well as other Government agencies. Recognizing the importance
of cooperation in the formulation of accounting principles and practices, adequate disclosure and auditing procedures which will best
serve the interests of investors, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, the Controllers Institute of .America, and the
National Federation of Financial Analysts Societies regularly appoint
committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's staff.
The many daily decisions of the Commission require the almost constant attention of some of the chief accountant's staff. These include
questions raised by each of the operating divisions of the Commission,
the regional offices and the Commission. This day-to-day activity of
the Commission and the need to keep abreast of current accounting
problems causes the chief accountant's staff to spend much time in the
examination and reexamination of sound and generally accepted accounting and auditing principles and practices. From time to time
members of this staff are called upon to assist in field investigations,
to participate in hearings, and to review opinions insofar as they
pertain to accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences, in person or by phone, with officials
of corporations, practicing accountants and others, occupy a considerable amount of the available time of the staff. This procedure, which
has proven to be one of the most important functions of the office of
the chief accountant, and of the chief accountant of the Division of

186

SiECURITJiES AND EXCHANGE'

OOMMLSSlION

Corporation Finance and his staff, saves registrants and their representatives both time and expense.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems arise as a result of
the examination of :financial statements required to be filed with the
Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations of the Commission have not been complied with or that applicable sound accounting principles have not been adhered to, the examining division usually notifies the registrant by an informal letter of
comment. These letters of comment and the correspondence or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and satisfactory
method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff. Where particularly difficult or novel questions arise, which cannot be settled by
the accounting staff of the divisions and by the chief accountant, they
are referred to the Commission for consideration and decision. The
Commission's treatment of accounting questions by these administrative means is extensive. A considerable portion of the time of the accounting staff is spent in the discussion of such cases by letter and
telephone, and in conference with registrants and their accounting
and legal advisers. There is also a large and, in recent years, growing
volume of inquiries as to the propriety of particular accounting
practices from accountants and from companies not presently subject to any of the acts administered by the Commission who wish to
have-the benefit of the Commission's views, and thus utilize and apply
the Commission's experience to the facts of their own case. Teachers
of accounting and their students also use the public files and confer
with the staff in the study of accounting problems.
In the annual report for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1956, mention was made of the fact that many corporate mergers and acquisitions were in process at that date and that during that fiscal year the
Commission's staff had cooperated closely with the accounting profession to bring about the establishment of uniform accounting procedures in that area. Since many corporate combinations of this kind
continue to be made, the staff :finds it necessary to continue its activity
in order to ascertain that the principles set forth in Accounting Research Bulletin No. 48, issued by the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants as a revision of earlier bulletins on this subject,
are applied fairly and uniformly in each instance and accomplish the
fair disclosure required.
The 20th Annual Report 20 contained a brief discussion of some of
the accounting problems which confront the Commission when a registration statement or other filing is made by a corporation domiciled
in a foreign country. It was pointed out that foreign standards of ac:0

counting and financial reporting differ in many respects from .American standards and vary from country to country. Since that report
was issued the Commission has been faced a number of times with
these problems in connection with filings, actual and prospective, by
foreign private issuers. The several acts administered by the Commission make no distinction between domestic private issuers and foreign private issuers and make no distinction between domestic accounting firms and foreign accounting firms. Since the acts contain
substantially the same financial and certification requirements, the
Commission has endeavored, through the adoption of rules and administrative practice, to develop policies with respect to accounting
and auditing principles, practices and procedures which have as their
ultimate objective the inclusion in filings with the Commission of
financial statements of foreign private issuers which have been audited and certified by independent public or certified accountants who
have followed generally accepted auditing standards, practices and
principles, as known to and followed by independent professional
accountants in the United States, when making their audit of such
issuers. Furthermore the financial statements with respect to which
an opinion is expressed after such an audit has been completed should
reflect or be reconciled to the consistent application of generally accepted accounting principles as known to and followed by professional accountants in the United States.
At June 30, 1957, there were approximately 4,700 brokers and
dealers registered with the Commission: Every registered brokerdealer is required to file with the Commission during each calendar
year a report of financial condition on Form X-17A-5 under rule
17a-5. Heretofore a substantial number of these reports were not
required to be certified by independent accountants. On August 8,
1957, the Commission announced the adoption of an amendment of
rule 17a-5. The amended rule provides that every report required
to be filed on Form X-17A-5 must be certified by a certified public
accountant or public accountant who is in fact independent unless
one of the three limited exemptions from the requirements is available. The amendment to rule 17a-5 became effective November 15,
1957, and reports filed after that date, even as of a date within 1957,
were required to comply with the certification requirements set out in
the amended rule.
In several of the Commission's reports for prior years it has been
stated that many of the reports of broker-dealers filed with the Commission were deficient because the certifying accountants appeared
to lack knowledge of stock brokerage techniques with respect to
maintenance of securities accounts because it appeared that they considered the Commission's "minimum audit requirements" to be all

of the requirements necessary when making the audit of a brokerdealer or because it appeared that they had failed to read the applicable rules and to comply with the instructions in the forms. It is
hoped that study and application of procedures set forth in the
booklet "Audits of Brokers or Dealers in Securities," published by
the Committee on Auditing Procedure of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants, at the suggestion of and with the
cooperation of the Commission's staff, will result in improved reports
filed by brokers and dealers. The booklet describes the special
accounting records used by brokers and dealers, and the auditing
procedures and forms of reports to be used in connection with the
examination of their books and records and should fill the need for
an authoritative guide in this specialized field of auditing. Any
revision of the Commission's forms and auditing requirements is
being deferred pending observation of the effectiveness of this guide.
During the fiscal year the Commission issued its Findings,
Opinion, and Order in a proceeding instituted under rule II (e) of
its rules of practice against Touche, Niven, Bailey & Smart, et al.
The Commission found that respondents had failed to comply with
generally accepted auditing standards and rules and regulations of
the Commission and had failed to fulfil their responsibilities as independent accountants in connection with the preparation and certification of financial statements for use in an annual report on Form 10-K
filed by Seaboard Commercial Corp., thus causing the balance sheet
to be materially misleading in that an inadequate reserve was reflected therein for accounts known to be doubtful of collection, resulting in current assets being overstated; advances to subsidiaries were
not so designated and the notes relating to the reserve for losses and
to current assets improperly described the nature of the reserve and
the basis for inclusion of advances in current assets; and the statement of Seaboard's income was materially misleading because insufficient provision was made for losses on uncollectible accounts. The
Commission concluded that it was necessary to deny respondents,
Touche, Niven, Bailey & Smart, a firm of certified public accountants,
and two partners of such firm, the privilege of practicing before the
Commission for a period of 15 days. 21
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Opinions are issued by the Commission in contested and other cases
arising under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities and Exchange
Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940 where the nature of the matter to be decided, whether sub:II AccountIng

stantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance to warrant a formal
expression of views. These opinions include detailed findings of fact
and conclusions of law based on evidentiary records, taken before a
hearing examiner who serves independently of the operating divisions,
or, in an occasional case, before a single Commissioner or the entire
Commission. In some cases formal hearings are waived by the parties
and the findings and conclusions are based on stipulated facts or
admissions.
The Commission is assisted in the preparation of findings, opinions
and orders by its Office of Opinion Writing, an independent staff office
directly responsible to the Commission. It receives all assignments
and instructions from, and makes recommendations and submits its
work to, the Commission directly. While engaged in the preparation
of opinions, members of the Office of Opinion Writing are completely
isolated from members of the operating division actively participating
in the proceedings, and it is an invariable rule that those assigned to
prepare such an opinion must not have had any prior participation
in any phase of the proceedings with respect to which the opinion is
to be prepared.
This complete independence of staff members assisting in the preparation of opinions accords with the principle embodied
in the Administrative Procedure Act requiring a separation between
staff members performing prosecutory functions and those performing
quasi-judicial functions.
Members of the Office of Opinion Writing who are assigned to work
on a particular case attend the oral argument of the case before the
Commission and frequently keep abreast of current hearings. Prior
to the oral argument the office makes a preliminary review of the
record and prepares and submits to the Commission a summary of the
uncontested facts and the factual and legal issues raised in the hearings
as well as in any proposed findings and supporting briefs, the hearing
examiner's recommended decision and exceptions thereto taken by
the parties. Following oral argument or, if no oral argument has been
held, at such time as the case is ready for. decision, the Commission
makes a thorough, independent review of the record assisted by the
Office of Opinion Writing, in which the entire record in the proceedings is carefully read and in some cases a narrative abstract of the
record is prepared. Upon the basis of this review and the conclusions
thus reached, the Office of Opinion Writing is instructed by the
Commission respecting the nature and content of the opinion and
order to be prepared.
Upon completion of a draft opinion and review and revision in the
Office of.Opinion Writing, it is submitted to the Commission. The
draft as submitted may be modified, amended or completely rewritten
in accordance with the Commission's final instructions.

When the opinion accurately expresses the views and conclusions of
the Commission it is adopted and promulgated as the official decision
of the Commission and constitutes a source of information for the bar,
investors, and other interested persons; Opinions are publicly released
and distributed to representatives of the press and persons on the
Commission's mailing list. In addition, the opinions are printed and
published by the Government Printing Office in bound jVolumes entitled "Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
During the fiscal year 1957 the Commission issued findings, opinions,
and orders in 97 cases, exclusive of numerous uncontested matters
disposed of without opinion.

.

APPLICATIONS FOR NONDISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports, or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of Schedule A of the Securities A.ct of 1933, disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value
of the contract and is not necessary for the protection of the investors.
Under section 24 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade
secrets or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with
the Commission, and under section 24 (b) of that Act written objection
to public disclosure of information contained in any such material may
be made to the Commission which is then authorized to make public
disclosure of such information only if in its judgment such disclosure
is in the public interest. Similar provisions are contained in section
22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and in section
45 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These statutory provisions have been implemented by rules outlining the procedure to be
followed by persons applying to the Commission for a determination
whether public disclosure is necessary in a particular case.
The number of applications granted, denied or otherwise acted
upon during the year are set forth in the following table:

STATISTICS

ANNUAL REPORT

191

AND SPECIAL STUDIES

During the past fiscal year the Section of Economic Research of
the staff of the Commission continued its regular work in connection
with the statistical activities of the Commission and the overall Government statistical program under the direction of the Officeof Statistical Standards, Bureau of the Budget. In general, the work conducted by this section is concerned with capital formation in the
United States including the securities markets, saving and investment. Several special reports related to the regular statistical series,
described below, were prepared and released and numerous projects
were completed in response to requests from congressional committees,
the Council of Economic Advisers, other Government agencies, private organizations and individuals.
Special reports prepared during the fiscal year 1957 inchided the
following: (1) A survey of the cost of flotation of securities offered
during the years 1951, 1953 and 1955, covering issues registered under
the Securities Act of 1933, privately placed securities, and certain
other exempt issues, was completed during the year and released in
July 1957. Copies of this survey are available at the Government
Printing Office. A supplemental report to the study providing a
description of the kinds of securities floated in recent years was also
completed, copies of which can be obtained from the Securities and
Exchange Commission Publication Unit. (2) A report on the sales
success of small securities issues (those $300,000 or less in size exempt
from registration under Regulation A of the Securities Act of 1933)
was prepared in January 1957. (3) A new survey on 1957 long-term
financing plans of manufacturing and utility firms, based on sample
data procured in connection with the Commission's annual survey of
business capital expenditures, was released in March 1957 (Statistical
Series Release No. 1443). (4) In October 1956, a report on noninsured
pension funds entitled "Survey of Corporate Pension Funds, 19511954" was published. This study, which was developed in connection
with the annual surveys conducted by the Commission in this field, presented detailed data as to industry and size of corporations having
pension funds and the implications of pension funds on savings and the
capital markets. The report is available at the Government Printing
Office. (5) During the 1957 fiscal year three papers were published in
connection with the joint project of the Commission and the Department of Commerce on business plant and equipment expenditures.
The first of these, "Forecasting Plant and Equipment Expenditures
from Businessmen's Expectations," was delivered at the annual meeting of the American Statistical Association in Detroit in September
1956. The second paper entitled "Ten Years' Experience With Business Investment Anticipations" appeared in the January 1957 Survey

192

COMMISSIION

of Current Business, and the third, "Investment Plans and Realization
{Reasons for Differences in Individual Cases)," was published in the
June 1957 Survey of Current Business.
The regular statistical series which are prepared include data on
securities effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933, offerings of securities by all corporations in the United States (including
issues not registered with the Commission, such as privately placed
issues and railroad securities), retirements of corporate securities,
net change in corporate securities outstanding, stock prices and trading. The research and statistical activity carried out under the direction of the Bureau Of the Budget includes individuals' savings in the
United States, income flow and investments of private pension funds
of United States corporations, current liquid position of the United
States corporations, sources and uses of corporate funds, anticipated
expenditures for plant and equipment by United States businesses,
and a quarterly financial report for all United States manufacturing
concerns.
The statistical series are published in the Commission's Statistical
Bulletin and in addition, except for data on registered issues, current
figures and analyses of the data are published in quarterly press releases. The Commission's stock price index is released weekly, together with the data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the two New
York Stock exchanges.
The various statistical series are as follows:
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly and quarterly statistics are compiled on the number and
volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type
of security, and use of proceeds. Data for the 1957 fiscal year appear
on page 36 and in appendix tables 1 and 2.
New Securities Offerings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues
privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered for
cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuer. Beginning
with the first quarterly release in 1957, data were presented on the
average yield of industrial and public utility issues offered during
the period, and a separate classification of convertible debt offerings
was added to the series. Annual statistics on new offerings since 1952,
as well as monthly figures from January 19506through June 1957,
are given in appendix tables 3 and 4. A summary of the data is shown
annually from 1934 through June 1957 in appendix table 5.

Corporate Securities Outstanding

Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount
of estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale
of securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations
to investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements,
and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Stock Market Data

Statistics are regularly compiled on the market value and volume
of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges, round-lot
stock transactions of the New York exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock transactions on the New York
exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions.
Indexes of
stock market prices are compiled, based upon the weekly closing market prices of 265 common stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The indexes are based on the prices of securities of 7 major
industry groups, 29 subordinated groups, and a composite group.
Saving Study

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represent net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases
in debt. The study shows the aggregate value of saving and the form
in which the saving occurred, such as investment in securities, expansion of bank deposits, increase in insurance and pension reserves,
etc. The Commission is cooperating in a new program of research on
national saving being developed by the Federal Reserve Board, which
will cover Government, business, and individuals' saving, and it is
expected that several changes and improvements will be made in the
saving series in the course of the current fiscal year. A. reconciliation
of the Commission's estimates with the personal saving estimates of
the Department of Commerce, derived in connection with its national
income series, is published annually in July in the National Income
Issue of the Survey of Current Business.
Corporate Pension Funds

An annual survey is made of pension plans of all United States
corporations where funds are administered by corporations themselves or through trustees. The survey shows the flow of money into
these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested, and
the principal items of income and expenditures.
The first survey,
covering the years 1951-54, was released in October 1955, and the
second survey covering the year 1955 was published in December
447579-58-14

1956. A survey for the year 1956 was released shortly after the close
I
ofthe fiscal year.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks and insurance companies, shows the principal components of current assets and liabilities, and also contains
an abbreviated analysis of the sources and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report for all United States manufacturing
concerns. This report gives complete balance sheet data and an
abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and
size of company. During the 1957 fiscal year the industry classification of this report was expanded to give separate figures for several
.important industry groups.
•

Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce,
conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all United States business, exclusive
of agriculture. Shortly after the close of each quarter, data are
released on actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition a survey
is made at the beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion during that year.
PUBLIC DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Administration of the Federal securities laws results in public
dissemination of a vast amount of financial and other information
with respect to securities offered for public sale and those traded on
our national securities exchanges. These data receive extensive circulation through the medium of the prospectuses relating to public
offerings, through the financial press, and by various securities
manuals used extensively by securities firms, investment advisers,
investment companies, trust departments, insurance companies and
others. Virtually all data obtained by the Commission under the
laws it administers constitutes public information and is available
for inspection and distribution, the nonpublic information including
primarily the Commission's private investigation and other internal
files and amounting to something less than 10 percent of the Commission's records.
Most Commission actions take the form of orders, decisions and
rules. So that the investing public may keep currently informed of
these actions, copies thereof are distributed in "release" form to the

TWENTY -THIRD

ANNUAL REPORT

195

Commission's mailing lists, comprising the names of persons who have
specifically requested certain types of releases. During the year, a
total of 940 such releases were issued for distribution to these lists.
Another 92 release~ were issued announcing the results of the Commission's regular statistical studies of New Security Offerings, Expenditures on New Plant and Equipment, Net Working Capital of
Corporations, Financial Reports of Manufacturing Companies, Surveys of Pension Plans, and Savings of Individuals. An additional 136
releases were issued with respect to court injunctions and criminal
prosecutions.
To facilitate widespread press coverage of the financial and other
proposals filed with, and actions by, the Commission, a daily News
Digest is issued to the press presenting a synopsis of all important
corporate developments included in filings with the Commission and
of the orders, decisions and rules issued by the Commission.
Furthermore, the Chairman and other members of the Commission,
as well as top staff officials, frequently deliver addresses before professional and trade bodies to acquaint them with the general policies and
practices of the Commission, or to discuss particular phases of Commission administration.
They also make themselves available for interview by representatives of the press, individually or collectively,
particularly when visiting financial centers throughout the country.
Information

Available for Public Inspection

The Commission maintains public reference rooms at its principal
office in Washington, D. C., and at its regional offices in New York
City and Chicago, Ill.
Copies of all public information on file with the Commission contained in registration statements, applications, declarations and other
public documents are available for inspection in the public reference
loom in Washington. During the fiscal year 3,318 persons made personal visits to the public reference room seeking public information
and an additional 25,284 requests for registered public information
and copies of forms, releases and other material of a public nature
were received. Through the facilities provided for the sale of reproductions of public information, 2,011 orders involving a total of
110,065 page units were filled and 431 certificates attesting to the authenticity of copies of Commission records were prepared. The Commission also mailed or distributed 430,741 copies of publications to
persons requesting them.
There are available in the New York Regional Office copies of recent
filings made by companies which have securities listed on exchanges
other than the New York exchanges and copies of current periodical
reports of many other companies which have filed registration state-

REPORT

The personnel and functions of the New York Regional Officewere
realined effective September 5, 1956. This action was designed to
promote efficiency of operation by establishment of three coordinate
branches, each responsible for the performance of an important
phase of the Commission's task of protecting investors. The New
York Regional Office now consists of a Branch of Investigations,
comprising a Section of Securities Act Investigations, a Section of
Securities Exchange Act Investigations, a Section of Broker-Dealer
Inspections and a Section of Market Surveillance; a Branch of
Enforcement; and a Branch of Operations, comprising a Section of
Small Issues, a Section of Public Information and Interpretations,
and a Section of Reorganization.
Effective February 12, 1957, the personnel and functions of the
Chicago Regional Office were realined to provide for a more effective
organization. The Chicago Regional Officenow consists of a Branch
of Investigations, responsible for broker-dealer inspections and fraud
investigations; a Branch of Enforcement, responsible for all enforcement work in the Chicago Region; and a Branch of Reorganization,
responsible for the Commission's functions under Chapter X of the
Bankruptcy Act. There was also established an Office of Chief
Counsel, with responsibility for all interpretative activities and work
in connection with the administration of regulation A in the region;
and an Office of Assistant Regional Administrator, with headquarters in Detroit, for the tri-state area of Michigan, Ohio, and
Kentucky.
The changes described above cover the Commission's two largest
regional offices, employing approximately half of the total regional
office staff. It is anticipated that this realinement of functions will
be of great assistance to the Commission in its handling of an increasing number of cases requiring investigation and prosecution.
The Commission's 22nd Annual Report summarized the realignment of functions and personnel of the Commission's major divisions
in Washington during the fiscal year 1956.

Personnel Program

During fiscal year 1957 the Commission continued to strengthen its
staff by filling the additional positions authorized under its appropriation and vacancies resulting from turnover. Emphasis was placed
on a college and university recruitment program which included campus interviews by Commission representatives.
This program was
designed to recruit outstanding college and law school graduates
with the required specialized training for careers in the Commission.
Emphasis was also placed on the in-service training of employees
for the advancement of their career development, while at the same
time furthering the administration and enforcement of the Federal
securities laws. These courses were given in the Headquarters Office
in Washington, D. C., and in the New York Regional Office. The
training course in the principal office, sponsored by the Division of
Corporation Finance, consisted of 32 sessions during the period February 23, 1957, through June 7, 1957. The course covered the whole
range of functions of the Division of Corporation Finance and took
cognizance of the importance of an understanding of the related functions of the other divisions and offices of the Commission. Approximately 90 employees attended this course, 32 from the staff of the
Division of Corporation Finance and the balance from other divisions
and offices in the Commission.
The training course in the New
York Regional Office was given from January to June 1957 and was
attended by 24 employees of that office.
Under its Incentive Awards Plan, the Commission recognized the
long service of its career employees by presenting 10- and 20-year
service pins and certificates to a total of 62 employees for service with
the Commission. In the fiscal year 1956, 10- and 20-year pins and
certificates were awarded to 453 employees, or 63 percent of the total
staff. In addition 9 employees were awarded $360 for suggestions
which were adopted and cash awards totaling $4,450 and certificates
of merit were presented to 43 employees.
During the fiscal year, the outstanding achievements of members
of the Commission's staff received further public recognition in the
form of awards made by other organizations.
On December 1, 1956,
a member of the Commission's staff, James F. Duffy, competed for
participation in the Civil Service Commission's Spring 1957 Management Intern Program.
Mr. Duffy was one of the 21 successful candidates, out of a total of 287 applicants throughout the Government
service, admitted to the Program. The National Civil Service League
awarded certificates of merit to 5 Commission employees-Oran
H.
Allred, Byron D. 'Woodside, James E. Newton, Vito Natrella, and

J. Kirk ,'Tindle. In February, 1957, a Rockefeller Public Service
Award, one of 9 such awards made throughout the Federal service
was granted to Lawrence M. Greene, Assistant Director, Division of
Corporate Regulation. J. Arnold Pines, Chief Financial Analyst of
the Division of Corporate Regulation, received an Arthur S. Flemming Award of the Junior Chamber of Commerce of Washington,
D.
as one of the 10 outstanding young men in the Federal service.
In May, 1957, a financial analyst in the Division of Corporate Regulation, Robert E. Johnson, was awarded a Certificate of Merit by the
William A. Jump Memorial Foundation.
The Commission is justifiably proud of these distinctions earned
by its employees whose devoted and conscientious service has contributed so much to carrying out the statutory objectives for which
the Commission was created.
