COMPLAINT
For its complaint against Defendants Nathan Halsey and TexStar Oil Co., Ltd.
(“TexStar”), Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) alleges as
follows:
Summary
1.

From approximately late 2011 through at least March 2014, Halsey carried out a

securities fraud scheme through TexStar, a Dallas-based oil-and-gas company he controlled,
raising at least $1.1 million. In January 2012, Halsey invited a group of investors from China to
Dallas to visit an oil well owned by another company—referred to anonymously in this
complaint as “Company A”—unrelated to TexStar. These and other investors later sent Halsey
$1.1 million to acquire interests in the Company A well. Without disclosure to investors, Halsey
diverted their money to TexStar. When the investors later complained that they were not
receiving returns from their well investment, Halsey entered agreements with them, stating that
their well investment had been “converted” to shares of stock in another Halsey-controlled
company, TexStar Oil Corp. (“TexStar Corp”). The agreement was false: The investors never
owned any interest in the well, and no such stock conversion ever took place.

In March 2012, Halsey opened a TexStar office in Shanghai, China. There, he

employed consultants to solicit investors. Through telephone and face-to-face investor
presentations, the TexStar consultants offered TexStar limited-partnership securities for sale to
prospective investors in China and Southeast Asia. At Halsey’s direction, the consultants
disseminated to investors a prospectus containing statements that, among other things, TexStar
held profitable oil-and-gas assets, that it had history of drilling and production successes, and
that it made high rates of return for investors. In reality, all of these statements were false:
TexStar held no profitable oil-and-gas assets, never drilled or produced any wells, and never
generated investor returns.
3.

In or around June 2013, Halsey formed a marketing company called Insider 21,

which offered members “networking opportunities” and “investment resources.” To attract
members to Insider 21, Halsey offered prospective members shares of TexStar Corp stock that he
owned. He distributed approximately 1.8 million of such shares under this program, but he never
filed a Form 4 with the Commission to report the changes in beneficial ownership of his stock.
4.

By reason of the foregoing, TexStar violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of

1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)], Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78o(a)], and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5 [17
C.F.R. § 240.10b-5]. Halsey violated Securities Act Section 17(a) [15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)],
Exchange Act Sections 10(b) and 16(a) [15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78p(a)], and Exchange Act
Rules 10b-5 and 16a-3 [17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5 and 240.16a-3].
5.

In the interest of protecting the public from violations by the Defendants, the SEC

seeks, among other things, permanent injunctions, disgorgement plus prejudgment interest, and
civil money penalties from each Defendant and an officer-and-director bar and conduct-based

injunction against Halsey.
Jurisdiction and Venue
6.

The SEC brings this action under Securities Act Section 20(b) [15 U.S.C. §

77t(b)] and Exchange Act Section 21(d) [15 U.S.C. § 78u(d)], seeking to restrain and enjoin the
Defendants permanently from engaging in such acts and practices as alleged herein.
7.

This Court has jurisdiction over this action under Section 22(a) of the Securities

Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Sections 21(e) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(e)
and 78aa]. Each of the he fractional undivided interests in oil and gas rights (“oil-and-gas
interests”), limited-partnership interests, and stock offered and sold as described in this
complaint is a “security” as that term is defined under Securities Act Section 2(a)(1) [15 U.S. C.
§ 77b(a)(1)] and Exchange Act Section 3(a)(10) [5 U.S. C. § 78c(a)(10)].
8.

The Defendants, directly and indirectly, made use of the mails or of the means

and instrumentalities of interstate commerce in connection with the transactions, acts, practices,
and courses of business described in this complaint.
9.

Venue is proper because transactions, acts, practices, and courses of business

described in this complaint occurred within the Northern District of Texas.
Parties
10.

Plaintiff SEC is an agency of the United States of America charged with

enforcing the federal securities laws.
11.

Defendant TexStar is a Texas limited liability company with its principal place of

business in Dallas, Texas.
12.

Defendant Halsey is an individual, aged 35, who resides in Dallas, Texas.

STATEMENT OF FACTS
The Beginning of Halsey’s Securities Activities in China and Southeast Asia
13.

In approximately May 2011, Halsey formed an offshore corporation called Falcon

Fund to market investment opportunities in China. Halsey sold memberships in Falcon Fund in
China for prices ranging from $1,000 to $5,000, eventually increasing the company’s
membership roster to approximately 6,000 by October 2011.
14.

Through Falcon Fund, Halsey purported to offer members training on how to

invest in foreign markets and opportunities to purchase regional-distribution rights to various
multi-level-marketing products. From Dallas, Texas, Halsey managed Falcon Fund through
promoters in China, whom he paid to carry out Falcon Fund’s objectives in China and Southeast
Asia.
15.

Halsey founded TexStar in 2011. Halsey served as TexStar’s president and

managing member.
16.

In 2011, Halsey acquired control over a Nevada public shell company called

Millennia, Inc., which eventually changed its name to become TexStar Corp. TexStar Corp was
an SEC-reporting company whose common stock was registered with the SEC under Exchange
Act Section 12 [15 U.S.C. § 78l] and quoted for public sale on www.otcmarkets.com under the
symbol TEXS. Halsey served as TexStar Corp’s president, CEO, CFO, and sole director.
17.

Halsey exercised control over Falcon Fund, TexStar, and TexStar Corp. He held

ultimate authority over the three companies, including the content of all of their public
statements and whether to disseminate such statements.
The Company A Investment
18.

In late 2011, Halsey invited a representative of Company A, a Texas oil-and-gas

SEC v. Nathan Halsey, et al
COMPLAINT

Page 4

Case 3:16-cv-00450-B Document 1 Filed 02/17/16

Page 5 of 13 PageID 5

company unaffiliated with Halsey or TexStar, to present an investment opportunity to a group of
Falcon Fund members in China. Company A was seeking to raise money by selling securities in
the form of oil-and-gas interests in a Company A oil-and-gas well in Texas. The Company A
representative made the presentation to the Falcon Fund members at a meeting in China in or
around December 2011, explaining that Company A was offering for sale interests in the
Company A well.
19.

In January 2012, Halsey invited a group of Falcon Fund members to visit Texas.

Approximately 25 members traveled from China to Texas for a range of activities paid for and
hosted by Halsey, including a chuck wagon BBQ lunch at the Company A well site. At the
BBQ, the Company A representative gave another presentation, introduced Company A’s
management team, and answered questions by the Falcon Fund members for several hours.
20.

After the Falcon Fund members returned home, three Falcon Fund promoters in

China, at Halsey’s direction, used Company A offering materials to raise approximately $1.1
million from at least 16 Chinese investors in the first half of 2012. Some of these investors had
attended Halsey’s BBQ at the Company A well in Texas.
21.

At Halsey’s direction, the promoters transferred the investment proceeds to

Halsey. Although Halsey knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that the money was
raised for investment in the Company A well interests, Halsey directed the money to TexStar
rather than to Company A. At TexStar, Halsey used the money for, among other things, funding
the opening of a TexStar office in Shanghai, China. Halsey did not disclose to the investors that
he directed their money away from Company A or that TexStar received their money. And
TexStar gave the investors nothing in return for the funds it received.
22.

In late 2013, Halsey learned that investors were questioning the status and

SEC v. Nathan Halsey, et al
COMPLAINT

Page 5

Case 3:16-cv-00450-B Document 1 Filed 02/17/16

Page 6 of 13 PageID 6

performance of their purported Company A investments and the lack of returns. Even then,
Halsey did not disclose to the investors that he had directed their money into TexStar.
23.

Halsey subsequently signed agreements with the investors, promising them that

Falcon Fund would convert every “dollar in [Company A] orders” into four shares of TexStar
Corp stock. The agreements provided that the investors had no “rights to request the company to
convert the shares back to [Company A].” In reality, Halsey knew or was severely reckless in
not knowing that the shares could not have been converted “back” to Company A, because
Company A never received the investments in the first place.
24.

The agreements further stated: “All [Company A] dividends will cease to stop

[sic].” Halsey knew or was severely reckless in not knowing that, in reality, no Company A
dividends had ever even begun, because Company A never received the investments.
25.

By these agreements, including the transactions in TexStar Corp stock to effect

the purported conversion of so-called Company A orders, Halsey knowingly or severely
recklessly perpetuated the false appearance that the investors had acquired interests in the
Company A well. And in the same manner, he concealed his misappropriation of their
investment principal, earmarked for the Company A well.
26.

A reasonable investor would have considered it important in making an

investment decision regarding Company A, TexStar, or TexStar Corp: (1) that Halsey would
divert, or had diverted, $1.1 million of investment principal earmarked for Company A to
TexStar; (2) that neither Company A nor TexStar ever issued any interests in exchange for the
$1.1 million; and (3) that no conversion of Company A “orders” into TexStar Corp stock actually
took place. These undisclosed facts were, therefore, material. By failing to disclose these facts,
Halsey and TexStar perpetrated a fraudulent scheme on investors and otherwise made and used

COMPLAINT

untrue statements of material facts in the offer, sale, and purchase of securities.
Halsey and TexStar’s Offering Limited-Partnership Interests
27.

Halsey opened the TexStar office in Shanghai, China, in March 2012. From

January 2012 to November 2013, TexStar employed consultants in China, paying them nearly $1
million to create promotional materials touting TexStar and other Halsey-related companies and
to promote those companies using such materials. Halsey directed these consultants to offer for
sale securities issued by these companies in the form of limited-partnership interests. At
Halsey’s direction, the consultants used telephone and face-to-face investor presentations to offer
the securities for sale. From his office in Dallas, Texas, Halsey approved the promotional
materials and—by telephone and other methods—supervised TexStar’s Shanghai office and its
securities-offering activities in China and Southeast Asia.
28.

During this period, and at Halsey’s direction, the TexStar consultants provided

prospective investors in the Shanghai office a prospectus, offering for sale limited-partnership
interests issued by a company called TexStar Investment Corporation, Ltd. (“TexStar
Investment”). According to the prospectus, TexStar Investment sought to raise $20,000,000 by
selling 40 limited-partnership units for $500,000 apiece. It described TexStar Investment as the
issuer of the limited-partnership units and explained that TexStar would serve as the general
partner of the limited partnership. It represented that each investor would receive a monthly
payment based on oil-and-gas production from wells drilled and completed by the limited
partnership.
29.

Halsey supervised the prospectus’s preparation, contributed to its content,

including two personal letters, and reviewed and approved the final version before ordering its
distribution to prospective investors.

COMPLAINT

30.

Page 8 of 13 PageID 8

The prospectus contained untrue and misleading statements, as follows:
A.

“[T]he company’s assets, which include mineral rights, leased
acreage, proven and estimated reserves, cash and cash equivalents
is in the $160,000,000 U.S.D range.” In reality, neither TexStar
Investment nor TexStar had any assets.

B.

“As a company, we have completed over 50 projects to date.” In
fact, neither TexStar Investment nor TexStar had ever completed
any projects.

C.

Halsey has “more than 10 years of successfully completed oil &
gas investment programs and projects.” In reality, Halsey had
never completed an oil-and-gas investment program or project.

D.

TexStar has “successfully drilled and produced wells in
Throckmorton County, and owns other oil-and-gas wells in the
county.” In reality, TexStar never drilled, produced, or owned any
oil-and-gas wells.

E.

“Returns average over 40% per year, and in many cases have
exceeded 100%+ per year.” In reality, TexStar and TexStar
Investment never had any returns.

F.

“Current TexStar Projects” include seven oil-and-gas projects in
Texas, West Virginia, the North Sea, and Indonesia. In reality,
neither TexStar Investment nor TexStar had any such projects.

G.

“TexStar Oil has made charitable contributions in every market we
conduct business and I am looking forward to being able to
continue this tradition in China.” In reality, neither TexStar
Investment nor TexStar made any charitable contributions.

H.

The Prospectus listed Kara Sands as TexStar’s “Chief Marketing
Officer” and included a photo of Sands posing alongside former
President George Bush and another photo of her posing with
former Texas Governor Rick Perry. In reality, TexStar had no
Chief Marketing Officer, and neither Bush nor Perry was
associated with TexStar in any way.

I.

The Prospectus included a photo of a purported TexStar officer
posing with two men identified as “TexStar partners in the UAE.”
In reality, the two men were never TexStar partners, investors, or
affiliates.

J.

A section titled “TexStar Tours” described with a 9-day trip

COMPLAINT

itinerary, including activities like “Chuck wagon BBQ lunch
served at a TexStar oil well,” and testimonials like “This was an
amazing our, we will be coming back!” In reality, TexStar tours
never took place and neither TexStar nor TexStar Investment ever
owned any oil wells to visit.
K.

31.

“In most cases, from the time the partnership is capitalized to the
time the partners start to receive distribution checks is 120 to 180
days.” In reality, neither TexStar nor TexStar Investments ever
had any capitalized partnerships nor did they ever issue a
distribution check.

Through TexStar’s Shanghai office, Halsey disseminated the prospectus described

in paragraph 30, above, to at least 25 prospective investors in China from approximately March
2012 through January 2013. At the time, Halsey knew or was severely reckless in not knowing
that the statements contained in the prospectus and set forth in paragraph 30, above, were untrue
or otherwise misleading. Each of the prospectus statements described in paragraph 30, above,
was an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary in order to
make the statements made, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
misleading.
32.

In or around June 2013, Halsey formed a marketing company called Insider 21,

which offered members “networking opportunities” and “investment resources.” Halsey
continued to offer TexStar limited-partnership interests through at least March 2014 through the
Insider 21 website.
Halsey Failed to Make Required SEC Filings
33.

To attract members to Insider 21, Halsey offered prospective members shares of

TexStar Corp stock that he owned. He distributed approximately 1.8 million of such shares
under this program. But he never filed a Form 4 with the Commission to report the changes in
beneficial ownership of his TexStar Corp stock as he was required to do under Exchange Act
