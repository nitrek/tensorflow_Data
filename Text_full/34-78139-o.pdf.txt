UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
June 23, 2016

In the Matter of
Rebornne (USA) Inc.,

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1
It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) that there is a
lack of current and accurate information concerning the securities of Rebornne (USA) Inc.
(“RBOR1”) (CIK No. 1268238), a Florida corporation located in Auckland City, Auckland, New
Zealand with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) Section 12(g) because it is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended December 31, 2011. On January 29, 2016, the Commission’s Division of
Corporation Finance (“Corporation Finance”) sent a delinquency letter to RBOR requesting
compliance with its periodic filing requirements but RBOR did not receive the delinquency letter
due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by
Commission rules (Rule 301 of Regulation S-T, 17 C.F.R. Section 232.301 and Section 5.4 of
EDGAR Filer Manual). As of June 16, 2016, the common stock of RBOR was quoted on OTC
Link operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly “Pink Sheets”), had two market makers,
and was eligible for the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).
