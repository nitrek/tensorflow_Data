Securities Exchange Act of 1934

Administrative Proceedings
File No. 3-11818

In the Matter of
ORDER EXTENDING TIME TO ENTER
AN ORDER APPROVING OR
DISAPPROVING DISTRIBUTION PLAN

Banc of America Capital Management,
LLC, BACAP Distributors, LLC, and Banc
of America Securities, LLC
Respondents.

I.
On July 16, 2007, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s
Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1103, the Commission published a
Notice of Proposed Distribution Plan and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) for the
distribution of monies placed into a Fair Fund in the above-captioned matter (Securities
Exchange Act Release No. 56077). The Notice invited public comment on the proposed
distribution plan through August 13, 2007, and the Commission received public comments that
raised various issues.
Rule 1104 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. §
201.1104, provides:
At any time after 30 days following publication of notice of a proposed plan of
disgorgement or of a proposed Fair Fund plan, the Commission shall, by order, approve,
approve with modifications, or disapprove the proposed plan. In the discretion of the
Commission, a proposed plan that is substantially modified prior to adoption may be

republished for an additional comment period pursuant to 17 CFR 201.1103. The order
approving or disapproving the plan should be entered within 30 days after the end of the
final period allowed for comments on the proposed plan unless the Commission or the
hearing officer, by written order, allows a longer period for good cause shown.
On September 11, 2007, the Commission issued an order extending the thirty-day time
period provided in Rule 1104 to November 13, 2007. The Commission believes that additional
time is necessary to adequately consider and address all of the comments raised in this matter,
and therefore good cause has been shown to extend the time period provided in Rule 1104 for
entry of an order approving or disapproving the plan until December 4, 2007.

II.
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that:
Pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. §
201.1104, for good cause shown, the time for entering an Order approving or disapproving the
proposed distribution plan is extended to December 4, 2007.

For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Nancy M. Morris
Secretary
