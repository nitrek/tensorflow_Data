connection with the transactions, acts, practices and courses of business alleged in

2

this Complaint.

3

2.

Venue is proper in this district pursuant to Section 27(a) of the Exchange

4

Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a), because certain of the transactions, acts, practices and

5

courses of conduct constituting violations of the federal securities laws occurred

6

within this district. In addition, venue is proper in this district because Defendant

7

Manuel E. Jesus aka Manny Backus (“Backus”) resides in this district, the primary

8

place of business of Defendant Wealthpire, Inc. (“Wealthpire”) is located in this

9

district, and Defendant Robert C. Joiner (“Joiner”) transacts business in this district.

SUMMARY
3.

From at least January 2012 through at least September 2014, Backus and

12

his company, Wealthpire, defrauded subscribers and potential subscribers to First

13

Hour Trading, an on-line “chat room” run by Joiner under Backus’ supervision, and

14

two stock picking “alert services” offered by Backus and Wealthpire, Portfolio

15

Crafter and Consensus Picks (collectively, the “Alert Services”). Backus and

16

Wealthpire made materially false statements in advertisements for these Alert

17

Services that generally fell into three categories: (1) that Backus, who touts himself

18

as a stock trading “prodigy,” was the source of the stock recommendations for the

19

First Hour Trading and Portfolio Crafter services; (2) that Backus himself was trading

20

in the stocks recommended by those services; and (3) that previous trading

21

recommendations by the Consensus Picks service had yielded huge past returns.

22

Backus’ and Wealthpire’s false statements were intended to induce investors to

23

subscribe to the Alert Services.

24

4.

Additionally, pursuant to instructions from Backus, until approximately

25

late spring 2014, Joiner operated the First Hour Trading online chat room, posed as

26

“MANNY_BACKUS,” during the chat room sessions, and falsely represented that he

27

(as Backus) was buying and selling certain recommended stocks when no such

28

transactions were actually taking place.

5.

By engaging in this conduct, Backus, Wealthpire and Joiner violated the

2

antifraud provisions of Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and

3

Rule 10b-5 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5. As a result of their fraud, Backus and

4

Wealthpire received $1,135,145 in ill-gotten gains from subscription fees for the

5

Alert Services. Joiner received $67,649 for his participation in the First Hour

6

Trading fraudulent scheme.

THE DEFENDANTS

8
9

6.

Manuel E. Jesus aka Manny Backus resides in Pacific Palisades,

California. Backus is the president and sole owner of Wealthpire.

10

7.

Wealthpire, Inc. is a California subchapter S corporation formed in

11

August 2006 and headquartered in Santa Monica, California. Wealthpire’s alert

12

services included First Hour Trading and Portfolio Crafter, both of which Wealthpire

13

stopped offering in 2014, and still include Consensus Picks.

14

8.

Robert C. Joiner resides in Raleigh, North Carolina. Joiner acted as the

15

editor for First Hour Trading, selecting the stocks recommended by that service, and

16

ran that service’s chat room pursuant to instructions from Backus.

THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
A.

Backus and Wealthpire Solicit Subscribers, Touting Backus’ Purported

19

Background as a “Stock Trading Whiz Kid”

20

9.

From January 2012 through at least September 2014, Backus and

21

Wealthpire sought new paying subscribers for the Alert Services through various

22

means, including mailing promotional materials and sending mass emails to non-

23

subscribers on “lead lists” rented by Wealthpire, sending emails to Wealthpire’s then-

24

existing subscriber base, and mailing and/or emailing promotional materials to

25

nonsubscribers and current subscribers. Although each Alert Service had a different

26

investment focus, all three Alert Services told investors which stocks to buy, when to

27

buy them, how much to pay for them, and at what price to sell them.

28

10.
COMPLAINT

From January 2012 through at least September 2014, Wealthpire’s
3

Case 2:16-cv-06850 Document 1 Filed 09/13/16 Page 4 of 10 Page ID #:4

1

advertisements for the Alert Services emphasized Backus’ purported biography.

2

Through Wealthpire advertising materials and websites, Backus promoted himself as

3

a stock picking “prodigy.” He proclaimed himself to be a “math whiz” and boasted

4

of his “skyscraping” IQ and training as a professional chess player. Backus claimed

5

to be known as the “Stock Trading Whiz Kid” and “the untutored prodigy of stock

6

investing” and claimed that by the age of 19 he was actively trading in the market

7

with “real money.” Wealthpire materials claimed that Backus made millions, and

8

that he then decided to help other investors by starting an alert service that let traders

9

copy his every trading move.

10
11

B.

Defendants’ Fraudulent Conduct
11.

From at least January 2012 through at least September 2014, Backus and

12

Wealthpire caused the Wealthpire website, and advertisements and promotional

13

materials for the Alert Services, to contain materially false statements. The false

14

statements were designed to attract new subscribers to the Alert Services, or to induce

15

existing subscribers to subscribe to additional Alert Services.

16

12.

Backus had ultimate control over Wealthpire, the content of its website,

17

and the advertisements concerning the Alert Services. Backus reviewed, revised and

18

approved Wealthpire’s advertisements for each of the Alert Services and instructed

19

Joiner how to conduct the First Hour Trading chat room sessions, during which Joiner

20

made additional materially false representations.

21
22

1.

The First Hour Trading Scheme

13.

First Hour Trading featured a stock trading program in an online chat

23

room. First Hour Trading’s subscribers were given buy and sell recommendations in

24

real time by chat room alerts.

25

14.

Advertisements and promotional materials for First Hour Trading falsely

26

stated the recommended stock picks were made by Backus himself or through

27

methods he developed. Direct mail ads Wealthpire sent in April 2012 and January

28

2013 claimed that Backus, a “math whiz,” noticed unique patterns in a small group of
COMPLAINT

4

Case 2:16-cv-06850 Document 1 Filed 09/13/16 Page 5 of 10 Page ID #:5

1

stocks that took place in the first hour of trading each day. In those ads, a quotation

2

attributed to Backus next to his photo stated, “I’ve created a tool that can predict the

3

exact movements of select stocks at an exact point in time, all with unprecedented

4

precision!” In those same ads, Backus and Wealthpire also claimed that Backus

5

selected stocks using a proprietary stock analyzing tool that told him the exact price

6

at which to buy or sell the stocks and the exact minute to get out. Backus and

7

Wealthpire repeated this representation in email advertisements they sent in

8

November 2013 to potential subscribers, as well as on Wealthpire’s website as late as

9

January 2014.
15.

10

In fact, First Hour Trading’s recommended stock picks were not selected

11

by Backus; nor were methods he developed used to make the stock picks. Rather,

12

Joiner made the stock picks, and Backus never gave Joiner guidance on how to make

13

them.

14

16.

Wealthpire’s advertisements for First Hour Trading also falsely stated

15

that subscribers logging in to the chat room would watch Backus pick and trade

16

stocks in real time and trade alongside him. The First Hour Trading advertisements,

17

mailed in April 2012 and January 2013, are replete with such statements, attributed to

18

Backus: “Watch me pick and trade stocks in real time on your computer . . . Copy

19

and paste my trades into your own account and profit along with me” and “…[E]very

20

day, I’m putting my own money where my mouth is by making the very same trades

21

I’m recommending to you.” Backus and Wealthpire made similar claims in other

22

promotional materials, including a 2012 catalog sent to prospective investors and an

23

October 2013 PowerPoint presentation located on Wealthpire’s website.

24

17.

Until approximately late spring 2014, Wealthpire’s statements in the

25

online chat room falsely represented that Backus was leading the chat room sessions

26

and was actually trading in the recommended stocks. For example, the written

27

introduction to the January 29, 2013 chat room session viewed by subscribers when

28

they logged in to the chat room explained: “‘Doorbell’ and ‘Boing’ are sounds used
COMPLAINT

5

Case 2:16-cv-06850 Document 1 Filed 09/13/16 Page 6 of 10 Page ID #:6

1

to warn you of a stock trade. You’ll hear these sounds every time Manny makes a

2

transaction.” At the beginning of the session, participants were informed that

3

“MANNY_BACKUS is the host.” And, throughout the session, a participant – in

4

fact, Joiner – identified as “MANNY_BACKUS” represented that he had bought and

5

sold certain stocks at specific prices.

6

18.

The statements in the advertisements and chat room sessions were false.

7

Backus did not participate in the chat room. Instead, pursuant to Backus’

8

instructions, Joiner participated in the chat room, signed in using a password supplied

9

by Backus, and posed as “MANNY_BACKUS.” Moreover, neither Backus nor

10

Joiner actually engaged in real-time trading during the chat room sessions. Joiner

11

nevertheless used the terms “bought” and “sold” during the chat room sessions, as

12

instructed by Backus.

13

19.

Because Joiner was not actually engaged in real-time trading, the prices

14

at which he told chat room participants he was executing trades were, in many cases,

15

no longer available. Investors were therefore not able to replicate the purported

16

trades and profit in the manner represented by Backus and Wealthpire in the

17

promotional materials for First Hour Trading.

18

20.

Joiner’s compensation for his work on First Hour Trading was structured

19

to incentivize him to retain subscribers. Specifically, Wealthpire paid Joiner a flat fee

20

for leading the chat room, but also paid him $10-$15 per subscriber. Joiner received

21

$67,649 during the relevant period for his participation in the fraudulent First Hour

22

Trading scheme.

23
24

2.

The Portfolio Crafter Scheme

21.

Until Wealthpire discontinued Portfolio Crafter in 2014, that alert

25

service offered subscribers two model portfolios, one with a short term focus and one

26

with a long term focus.

27
28

22.

Wealthpire sent Portfolio Crafter subscribers buy and sell email alerts

that linked to Wealthpire’s website. The stock recommendations and trades made by

1

Wealthpire were described in the “members only” section on Wealthpire’s website

2

that was only available to paid subscribers.

3

23.

Backus and Wealthpire made materially false statements in both the

4

advertising materials for Portfolio Crafter and in the daily email alerts sent to

5

subscribers. Wealthpire’s website in November 2013, a catalog Wealthpire mailed to

6

potential investors in 2012, and other materials sent to trial and new subscribers claim

7

in multiple places that all investors needed to do was copy Backus’ trades and they

8

would get the same results he did. For example, Backus stated on Wealthpire’s

9

website: “All you have to do is copy my trades and you will get the same results I

10

get.” Backus further emphasized that investors should “copy all – not just some – of

11

my trades because my results don’t lie.” (Emphasis in original). In November

12

2013, Backus claimed on Wealthpire’s website that he had created several

13

“proprietary indicators” that he used to identify stocks that would generate high

14

returns in short periods. In their email alerts to subscribers, including in January

15

2014, Backus and Wealthpire represented that certain stocks had been sold or

16

purchased.

17

24.

These statements were all false. As was the case with other alert

18

services, Backus did not actually make the recommended trades. Moreover, Backus

19

hired an independent contractor to make the stock recommendations, and the

20

contractor was not given any “proprietary indicators” to use in making those

21

recommendations.

22
23

3.

The Consensus Picks Scheme

25.

Consensus Picks is a stock picking alert service that provided weekly

24

buy and sell alerts to subscribers by email beginning in at least March 2012. During

25

the period March 2012 through sometime in 2014, Backus selected the stocks for

26

Consensus Picks and an editor he had hired then prepared an analysis and selected the

27

prices at which to buy or sell the stocks.

28

26.
COMPLAINT

Backus and Wealthpire made materially false statements that claimed
7

Case 2:16-cv-06850 Document 1 Filed 09/13/16 Page 8 of 10 Page ID #:8

1

fantastic returns and incredibly high stock pick success rates by Consensus Picks.

2

For example, in a direct mail ad sent to potential Consensus Picks subscribers in

3

March 2012, Wealthpire claimed that Consensus Picks had earned 73% returns for

4

ten years in a row. In a separate direct mail ad, sent to potential Consensus Picks

5

subscribers from March 2013 through September 2013, Wealthpire claimed that

6

Consensus Picks returned 1,430.51% in 2012, and chose 48 “winners” out of 51 stock

7

picks for a 96% “winning ratio.” This ad, a 30 page mailer, also claimed that from

8

May to August 2012 Consensus Picks had 18 trades and 18 “Winners,” a “100%

9

Winning Ratio … 774.68% Returns,” and from September to December 2012: “16

10
11

Trades … 15 Winners … 94% Winning Ratio … 265.22% Returns.”
27.

In the same direct mail ad sent to potential subscribers from March

12

through September 2013, Backus and Wealthpire lied to potential subscribers about

13

the performance of specific, historic Consensus Picks stock picks. The ad contained

14

three charts listing stocks, including the purported entry price and exit price for each,

15

which they represented were based on the “CP method.” The charts also included the

16

purported corresponding gain or loss for each stock.

17
18
19

28.

In all of these materials, Backus’ and Wealthpire’s claims of fantastic

returns and incredibly high stock pick success rates were false.
29.

Similarly, the purported performance figures for the historic stock picks

20

included in the 2013 Wealthpire advertisement were false. Backus and Wealthpire in

21

fact failed to follow their own purported buy and sell methodology when computing

22

the returns. Specifically, Backus and Wealthpire disregarded instances where a

23

stock’s price fell to the recommended “stop price” – which would have caused a

24

subscriber to sell stock at a loss. Backus and Wealthpire also disregarded instances

25

where a stock’s price never reached its “target price,” and, therefore, would not have

26

caused an investor to sell stock and lock in a gain. As a result, approximately 29% of

27

the stocks for which Backus and Wealthpire provided purported performance figures

28

reported inflated gains or minimized losses, and approximately 53% reported gains

instead of the losses that actually would have occurred if Backus’ methodology had

been followed.
