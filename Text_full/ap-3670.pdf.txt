In the Matter of
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
HUDSON CAPITAL PARTNERS CORPORATION

On January 13, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 203(e) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. On February 17, 2016, I found that Respondent was served with the OIP
on February 8, 2016, and its answer was therefore due February 29, 2016. Hudson Capital
Partners Corp., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3616, 2016 SEC LEXIS 581. To date,
Respondent has not filed an answer.
I therefore ORDER Respondent to SHOW CAUSE by March 14, 2016, why this
proceeding should not be determined against it due to its failure to file an answer or otherwise
defend this proceeding. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
The Division is granted leave to file an appropriate dispositive motion by April 18, 2016.
The Division’s motion shall address the statutory basis for this action and that sanctions are in
the public interest, including a discussion of the public interest factors under Steadman v. SEC,
603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981), with citations
to supporting evidence. Allegations from the district court complaint will not be sufficient to
support a public interest analysis. See Don Warner Reinhard, Exchange Act Release No. 61506,
2010 SEC LEXIS 1010, at *12-14 (Feb. 4, 2010). Supporting evidence should include a
declaration identifying each exhibit with a short description. In addition to the required filing
with the Office of the Secretary, an electronic courtesy copy should be emailed to alj@sec.gov in
PDF text-searchable format. Exhibits should be sent as separate attachments, not a combined
PDF.
