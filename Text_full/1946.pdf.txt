ROBERT -E. HEALY
1883-1946

Robert E. Healy was appointed by the ..President as one of the original
members of the Securities and Exchange Commission, and assumed the
duties of that office on July 2, 1934. _By virtue of three successive
reappointments he held that office until his death on November 16,
1946.
To his duties he brought a wealth" of knowledge and wisdom, a staunch
Integrity, an impeccable sense of fairness, and a boundless, untiring
devotion. These qualities made him, inevitably, a powerful influence
in the shaping and administration of the laws administered by the
Cohimission,
His forceful expression of the principles that guided his decisions
established a tradition deeply respected by all who knew him. He
leaves more than one man's burden to be borne by those who remain.
It would have been his will that we carryon, in spite of his loss, the
tasks which still lie before us.
.
His was a spirit that recognized no limit to friendship. To the young
people, whom he especially loved, he was particularly anxious to give
help and encouragement. Inall who knew him he inspired a deep and
lasting affection.
-.
.We have resolved to memorialize herein our sorrow at his passing and
. to record our deep sympathy for the members of his family.

FOREWORD
This review of the Commission's activities for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1~4~, was prepared, pursuant to law, for the information of
the Congress. It. is a factual report, and is in general limited to the
activities for the fiscal year covered. The Commission's Tenth Annual :Report contained a broader historical statement, and reference
to the Tenth Annual Report should be made for a more adequate survey of the first.decade of the Commission's operations.
~-1iherecent Congressional election has brought to the Congress many
-
new members. We hope tllat this annual report will help to acquaint
them with the work of the Commission. The report indicates the
broad scope of the Commission's concerns under the various laws
administered by it and the significance of the policies embodied in
those laws. The fields regulated by the ComIDlSSIOnare complex and
they are at the heart of the financial life of the American economy.
The key to the most effective regulation in this field is to carry out the
policies of the law with a minimum of interference with the normal
operations of the facilities of securities distribution and trading.
A reading of the report will indicate the extent to which the Commission has adjusted its methods to achieve that aim. While the
number of forms provided under the various acts may seem, at first
glance, to result in complexity, the forms are, in reality, the result of
constant adjustment to achieve simplicity and to minimize the burdens
of those called upon to comply with the laws. The endeavor is 'always
to find that-method of administration which is most suitable and least
burdensome to the particular individual or company affected.
The report describes instance after instance showing the effort of
the Commission to bring the policy of the Congress into play with as
much cooperation as possible with those concerned. The Commission's method of procuring corrections in registration statement'S by
conference and negotiation rather than by formal proceedings is an
example of this. The particular care exercised in conducting trading
_investigations so as to cause, the minimum of disruption and embarrassment is another example. While, to the layman, many of theCommission's rules providing for exemptions and exceptions may appear to be complex and difficUlt to follow, they are the careful product
'of adjustment to the practical needs of the financial community.
The Commission has broad powers to bring about the geographical
inf.egration and corporate simplification of holding company systems.
There are many ways in which such a far-reaching program may be
effected. The dietation of plans by the Commission and their involuntary enforcement by the courts (which is one of the methods
provided' for under the Public Utility Holding Company Act) is one
way. ' Another way is to indicate the Commission's findings as to the
end results required by the Act and to leave wide latitude for the proposal of voluntary plans of compliance by the, companies affected.
The Commission has chosen the latter route. While many of the inXlII

XIV

FOBEWORD

tricate problems dealt with by the Commission under the Public
Ut.ility Holding qompany A~t might have been disposed of more
-
quickly by adoptmg harsh measures for enforcmg involuntary
. changes, the Commission has consistently considered that fairer and
more feasible results can be achieved by encouraging and assisting
voluntary compliance. •

'
Evident throughout the report is the constant concern of the Commission to keep open the channels of communication between itself
and those with whom it deals. In terms of time and manpower spent
the ;ren~tiQn of informati;on, advice, and help to other.gov:ernmental
bodies, interested compames and members of the public. bulks large.
As indicated in this report and in prior reports of the Commission the
formulation of important administrative policies is, wherever possible,
achieved through cooperation and consultation with those 31fected.
The Commission regards itself as having been charged with a
public trust in the.adininistration
of the_ policies of the law, Its
facilities are always available to those who seek information about
its work. It applies to itself the principle of full disclosure embodied
in all the statutes it administers.

, PART I
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURI'hES

ACf OF 1933

The main, objectives of the Securities Act of 1933,.as amended, are
to provide for full disclosure by means of registration statements and
prospectuses of pertinent information regarding securities publicly
offered for sale through Interstate commerce or through the mails and
to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, and other fraudulent practices
in the sale of securities. The Act does not confer upon the Commission the power to approve or pass upon the merits of any security.
Even though the act does not insulate investors against risk, it does
make available to them informati0Il:. with which to gage the risk.
~GISTRATION OF'SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES ACf OF 1933

,

To achieve the end of full and fair disclosure of the material facts
regardiiig. securities offered for sale to the public in interstate commerce or by the use of the mails, the Act provides that, with certain
. exceptions, before securities may be so offered or sold, a registration
statement must be filed with the Commission and must become effective. Each registration statement must be filed on the particular
form prescribed by the Commission as appropriate to the type of
security'proposed to be offered.
.
The registration statement, which becomes a public document once
it is filed, is designed to set forth all the material facts with regard
to the company and its securities which are to be sold. This required
information includes, for" example, statements with regard, to the
character, size, and profitableness of the business; its capitalization;
the purpose of the financing; options outstanding against securities
of the issuer ; the remuneration of officers and directors; bonus and
profit-sharing arrangements; underwriters' commissions; and pendmg or threatened legal proceedings. Certified financial statements
must also be included in the registration statement proper. In addition, the Act provides as an integral part of the registration procedure
that the issuer must furnish to investors a prospectus setting forth
in convenient form the basic or more important material contained
, in the registration statement.
.
The. fact that a registration statement has been filed" or that it has
.been examined by the Oommission's staff,. or that it is in effect, does
not-imply any appraisal by the Commission of the merits of the securityas an investment. The Securities Act does not authorize the Commission to pass judgment upon the soundness of any security covered
by a.registration statement, Actually, the statute makes any representation to the contrary a-criminal offense. Thus, in administering
the Act, the Commission does not direct the :flow or capital or try to
do so, although, of course, the requirement that registrants disclose
the truth concerning security :flotations may very well affect their

public reception. In short, as pointed out in the heacfuote to this
chapter, the basic policy of the Act is not to attempt to protect the
investor by insulating him from risk but to make available to him the
information with which to gage the risk. It follows that, under the
, Act, even speculative or apparently unsound issues may be registered
and sold to the public provided the whole truth is told.
-

One of the Commission's most important functions is to examine
these registration statements for compliance with the statutory standards of full disclosure and to obtain amendments necessary to correct
deficiencies discovered thereby before permitting the registration
statement to become effective. The work of examining registration
statements has to be accomplished with maximum dispatch, since the
Act provides that the registration statement shall, ordinarily, become
effective on the twentieth day after it is filed. The filing of an amendment to the registration statement starts the period of delay running
anew, unless the amendment is filed with the consent of or by the order
of the Commission. In that event the running of the original 20 days
is not interrupted. The Commission may, in its discretion, accelerate
the effective date of the registration statement, having due regard to
the adequacy of relevant information available to the public and with'
due regard to the interests of investors. The purpose of the 20-day
waiting period is to give the public an opportunity to absorb the
information in the prospectus or registration statement before making
a commitment that would otherwise need to be made in hasta.or
ignorance.
The Commission has endeavored-Iri many' ways to adapt its procedures to the accustomed practice of businessmen and distributors of
securities insofar as this adaptation'is consistent with the intent of
the Congress and the protection of investors. A notable example is
the "letter of deficiency" which the Commission sends to registrants
as promptly as possible after the statements are filed to advise them
of any material misstatements or omissions. Registrants are thus
afforded an opportunity to file correcting. amendments -before the
statements become effective. Another informal procedure which has
proved exceptionally useful is the prefiling conference in which representatives of registrants and underwriters discuss problems in connection with proposed filings with the Commission's staff so as to de. termine in advance what types or methods of disclosure would be
necessary under the circumstances of the particular case. As a result
of such informal advisory assistance rendered in an effort to simplify
the registration procedure in every practicable way consistent with
the public interest and the protection of investors, 1946 was the fifth
consecutive fiscal year in which it has not been necessary for the Commission to issue a single order under the Act to prevent or.suspend the
~~ectiveness of any registration statement. ,

Securities Act of 1933-during the 12 months ended June 30,1946, was

ANNUAL REPORT

$1,013,280,000,1 the greatest amount in any fiscal year since the passage
. of the Act and very substantially greater than the previous high of
$4,851,465,000 in the 1931 fiscal year. Of this total registered, securities to be sold for cash amounted to $5,895,840,000, of which about -

. nine-tenths, 'or $5,423,593,000, was registered for the accounts of the
issuers of the securities (primary distributions).
The amount to be
sold' for cash which was registered for the accounts of others than
issuers, $472,248,000, was the greatest amount ever registered for secondary cash distribution in any fiscal year and more than twice the
previous high of $189,722,000 in the 1941 fiscal year.
Volume of Stoeks"and Bonds

Of all securities registered to be sold for cash for the accounts of
issuers, the volume of stocks was $2,321,324,000 and the volume of
bonds and other credit instruments was $3,102,269,000.
The volume
of bonds and other credit instruments was only slightly less than
toe previous high of $3,153,226,000 registered in the 1~~6 fiscal ye.ltr.
Although stocks accounted for the smaller part of seeurities registered
for cash sale; E!Ie increase in stock registrations over previous years
was substantially greater than the increase in bonds and other credit
instruments over recent years. The volume of stock registrations was
more than two and one half times greater than the $863,363,000 registered in the 1945 fiscal year and almost double the previous high of
$1,208,520,000 in the 1937 fiscal year. The volume of' equity securities
. other than preferred stock registered for cash sale, $1,330,625,000t was
'in itself greater than the previous high for all stocks to be sold for
cash; and the volume of preferred stocks to be sold for cash, $990,699,000, was in' itself greater than the total of all stocks registered by
issuers tor cash sale in the 1945 fiscal year.

Types of Issuers

companies. The $1,750,amount was registered by manufacturing
152,000 so registered by this group was substantially greater than the
previous high of $1,195,349,000 in the 1936 fiscal year. Transportation
and communication companies registered $964,795,000 of new issues
to be sold for cash, more than 80 percent greater than the $529,516,000
of such registrations in the 1937 fiscal year. Finance and investment
companies registered $902,344,000 of new issueS to be sold for cash;
almost 40 percent greater than the previous high of $649,475,000 of
such registrations ill the 1937 fiscal year. Only the volume of new
issues registered to be sold. for cash by electric, gas~ and water companies, $1,496,860,000, failed to exceed the previous high of such. registrations by these companies, $1,499,419,000 in the 1936 fiscal year, but
only by ~ess than $3,000,000.

Eighty-two percent, $4,445,915,000, involved commitments by bankers to purchase for resale and 14 percent, $749,952,000,
Commitments to use their best efforts. Registrants planned to sell 4
_ percent, $227,726,000, directly to Investors."
_Cost of Flotation

The cost of flotation of securities registered for primary cash distributiont as reported in the registration statements for such securities,
amounted to 5.3 percent of the aggre~te dollar volume of such securities. .A further break-down of. this 5.3 percent indicates that 4.8
percent was to be paid as commissions and discounts and 0.5 percent
for all other expenses incidental to the flotation of the securities, including all costs relative to registration .. .A study of the portion of
aggregate gross proceeds paid as commissions and discounts to investment bankers on securities registered for sale to the general public
through such bankers reveals a downward trend in recent. years, as

securities offered for cash sale in iss~u~ of ~ore than $100,000 ~uring
_the'12 months ended Jnne 30, 1946, including both those registered
and unregistered, was $7,124,000,009.
NewCapi~

The amount of proceeds from securities flotations applicable to
expan~onof
fixed and working capital aggregated $1,557,000,000.
Thi.s is' the highest volume of new capital financing from securities
in fifteen years and compares with the recent peaks of $1,196,000,000
in the 1937 fiscal year and $862,499,000 in the 1942 fiscal year. Industrial and miscellaneous companies accounted for more than 80 percent
of the new money financing. Flotations by utilities and railroad companies _were m'ainly for the purpose of refunding outstanding
obligations,
Re1inancing

The volume of .refinancing through new issues of. securities reached
a record high of $5,160,000,000, due m great part to the fact that many
corporatiosis took advantage of certain features of the tax laws-and of
the low level of interest rates to reduce their interest and fixed dividend costs," In addition, many corporations retired outstanding securities with cash from sources other than proceeds from the sale of
new issues, such as treasury cash and bank loans, so that the aggregate
volume of fixed income securities is estimated to have declined.
Volume of All New Issues

-
 The addition of noncorporate to corporate issues brings the volume
of.all new issues of securities offered for cash sale in the United States
-during the 1946fiscal year to $35,948,000,000. The bulk of this volume
consisted of long-term United States Government securities. The
volume of such securities, $27,258,000,000, was, however, the lowest
volume of offerings by the Federal Government in 4 years. The
amounts of securities offered for sale by other noncorporate issuers
were: $928,000,000 by states and municipalities; $608,000,000 by Federal Land Banks ; $30,000,000 by foreign governments; and approxi-mately $500,000 by miscellaneous nonprofit organizations,"

amounts of 85 percent, 141 percent, and 77 percent, respectively. As
-
indicated above, the number of these statements filed during the 1946
fiscal year was the greatest since 1937, while the dollar amount of securities involved reached by far the greatest total for anyone of the
13 years that the Securities Act of 1933 has been in effect, exceeding
by 38 percent the previ?u~ high in 1931.
EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES
ACT OF 1933

Section 3 (b) of the Act empowers the Commission, by Rule and
Regulation, subject to such terms and conditions as it might prescribe,
to exempt from registration issues of securities where the aggregate offering price to the public of such securities does not exceed $300,000.9
The law permits the Ooramission to provide exemptions onlY' when it
deems that enforcement of the Act is not necessary in the public interest
and for the protection of investors by reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the public offering. -

Under this Section, the Commission has adopted Regulation A, a
general exemption for small issues; Regulation A-R, a special exemption for notes and bonds secured by first liens on family dwellings ;10
Regulation A-M, a special exemption for assessable shares of stock for
mining companiesi Regulation B, an exemption for fractional undivided mterests in oil or gas rights; and Regulation B-T, an exemption
for interests in oil royalty trusts or similar types of trusts or unincorporated associations.
.
The availability of an exemption under any' of these Regulations
does not include any exemption from civil liabilities under Section 12
or from criminal liabilities for fraud under Section 11. In order to
ensure the proper enforcement of these Sections, the conditions for the
availability of the exemptions provided by these Regulations, with the
exception of Regulation A-;R, include the requirements that certain
minimum information be filed with the Commission and that disclosure
of certain information be made in sales literature.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

Last year a marked increase occurred in the number and dollar
amount involved in public offerings under the general exemption provided by Begulation A. For example, the number of letters of notification received and examined pursuant to Regulation A more than
doubled from the 578 of the preceding year and reached a total for
the 1946 fiscal year of 1,348. At the same time a much more striking
increase occurred in the aggregate offering price of the securities
involved which jumped from $38,848,893 in 1945 to $181,600,155
during the past year. It seems reasonable to attribute a very large
part of this increase to the raising of the maximum limitation for a
permissible exempt offering to $300,000. Included in these offerings
were 69 letters of notification, with an aggregate offering price of
• The maximum amount was originally $100,000. Six weeks before the beginning of the
1946 fIscal'Ye&r Congress amended this Section to raise the maximum amount of $300000
The Commissioon promptly amended Its Reguistlon A, elfeetlve May 22, 1045, to provide
certain exemptions for issues up to $300,000 •
•'" Inasmuch as no reports or 1Illngs are required under this regulation, no statistical data
as to ita application and use are avallable.

SECURITIES AND EXCHAN.~E _~OMMISSION .

$8,158,833, relating to oil and. gas leases and securities of companies
engaged in various phases of the oil and gas business.
. -

This number of filings has placed an unprecedented load on th~
staff of experts maintained by the Commission to examine such filings.
Under Regulation A, letters of notification must be filed at least 54ays '.
prior to the first day when the securities are to. be offered f~r sale, .
in order to permit the CommISSIOn'sstaff to examine the material and
to check its files for other pertinent information about the company.
and persons involved. In addition, sales literature must similarly be
filed before its use. Such filings must be made in the appropriate
regional office, which examines the material, primarily to determine
whether any violations of the antifraud provisions of the Act are
indicated and to ascertain that proper compliance has. been made
with the Rules applicable to the exemption claimed. If any de-ficiencies are discovered in the filing, the offeror of the securities is
informed, by letter or telephone, in order to prevent any violation of
the Act or the provisions of the Regulation.
.

In addition to the initial examination by the regional office, the
material filed is reviewed -by a staff of experts at the Commission's
central office. Such review involves a search for pertinent information in the Commission's extensive files and an .examinasion to determine whether the exemption 'of the Regulation is applicable in the
particular case and whether the information filed discloses any violations of any of the Acts administered by the Commission. The results
of this review are made available promptly to the regional office
involved. During the 1946 fiscal year .1603 such reviews were sent to
regional offices.

As a further step in the administration of Regulation A, the staff
at the central office of the Commission informs the proper authorities'
in the States in which' the securities are to be offered of the fact that
the offering is to be made, and gives such authorities certain pertinent
data. A weekly report of letters of notification filed under this Regulation is compiled and mailed to interested persons, including the'
proper authorities in all the States and the regional offices -0£ the
Commission. This report includes information as to the name of the
issuer of the securities; the offeror; the principal underwriter; the

Confidential Writll;ln Reports of Sales Under Regnlation B

The Commission also received and examined during the year 2,698
confidential written reports required 'pursuant to Rules 320 (e) and
322 (c) and (d) of Regulation B concerning sales made by- brokerdealers or offerors to investors and by dealers to other dealers. This
total consisted of 2,409 reports on Form 1-G and 289 on Form 2-G,
representing sales in the aggregate of $1,001,981 and $582,634, respectively. If.examination of these reports indicates that a violation of the
law may have occurred, the Commission makes appropriate investigations and, in instances where the facts are deemed to warrant it, appropriate action is taKen.

Oil and Gas Investigations

-Among the investigations conducted by the Commission during the
fiscal year to determine whether certain transactions had been effected
in violation of Sections 5 (requiring registration) or 17 (prohibiting
fraudulent sales) of the Securities Act of 1933 or Section 15 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (regulating the conduct of brokers
and dealers), a total of 147 involved oil and gas investments. Apart
from the 1,500 letters written and 600 personal and telephone conferencesheld during the year by the staff of the Commission's central office
engaged in work involving oil and gas securities, the engineers and
geologists- assigned to that specialized staff prepared 91 technical
memoranda or valuation estimates, and also conducted scores of conferences illthe oil and gas producing regions and other locations in the
field, as a part of the Commission's oil and gas investigation activity.
Eight of these investigations were closed during the year so that 139
were pending at the end of the year. A summary of these investigations is tabulated below:

New Rule Adopted Under the Securities Act of 1933

. The only additional Rule promulgated under the Securities Act of
1933 during the 1946 fiscal year was the one adopting the 4O-hour
workweek recommended for Federal agencies by the President.
DISCLOSURES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION 'OF REGISTRATION
STATEMENTS

The staff of the Commission makes prompt and intensive study of
registration s,tatements in order,.by conference, to procure neces~ar:Y
amendments ill advance of effectiveness of such statements. Because
of the extent of this work the Commission has not needed to resort,
in recent years, to the stop-order proceeding. Several typical examples
of inadequacies found in registration statements and of corrective
steps taken will be found in the following brief case histories.
Inside Dealings With Afiiliated Con1panies

A registrant disclosed that it had entered into an arrangement.
whereby all of its goods were sold through two affiliated companiesa general sales company which was owned and controlled by officers
of the registrant and a specialty sales company which was owned and
controlled by the wives of such officers. The terms of the contracts
were such as to assure the sellinz companies a profit. Upon the
Commission's insistence that, in audition, proper disclosure be made
of the advantages secured by the officers and their wives at the expense
of the registrant through these contracts, all such contracts were
canceled and all profits which had accrued to the selling companies
were restored to the- registrant.

Effect of Issuance of Warrants

In order to apprise any prospective investor of the unfavorable effect upon any investment he might make, as a-result of the distribution
of warrants issued to the underwriters and promoters evidencing the
right to subscribe to 60,000 shares of stock, the Commission requested
and obtained the following disclosure in a registration statement:
For the life of the Warrants the Underwriters, and the Promoters, so long as
any of them own any of the Warrants issued to them, will have at no cost, except
as part payment of underwriting

commissions and personal service contracts,

the opportunity to profit at the expense of other stockholders from any rise. in
the market for th~ Common StoclCof the Company above the prices at wblch such
Warrants may be exercised; the Company.presently has no need for additional
working capital in excess of the amount to. be realized from the sale of the Stock
oJrered hereby; such Warrants were issued at the request of the Underwriters

-

'TWELFTH

AI'fNUAL REPORT

11

in -connection with the underwriting and at the request of the Promoters in
consideration of their entering into employment contracts with the Company
described herein; at any time when a substantial amount of the Warrants may
be outstanding, the Company may be deprived of favorable opportunities to procure additional equity capital through the sale of Common Stock if it should
be neededfor the purposes of the business; at any time when the holders of Warrants mtght,be expected to exercise them, the Companymight be able to obtain
equity capital if it needed capital then, by pUblicsale /}fa new offering of Common Stock on terms more favorable than those provided for by the Warrants.
Any price paid to an Underwriter for a Warrant or any price paid to an UnderWJ:iterfor a share of Common Stock in excess of the Warrant exercise price
may be ~eem~ to be an underwriting discount or commission.
Previous Violations of the Securities Act

Pursuant to an investigation by the Commission, it was ascertained
that a company currently filing a registration statement had previously
sold $430,000 of stock in violation of the Securities ~t of 1933. Disclosure of this violation, together with the rights of purchasers to
rescind such purchases or to sue for damages, was required in the
registration statement the company filed under the Securities Act. As
a consequence of this required disclosure, stockholders forced the company to repurchase securities representing
an aggregate price. of
$102,000 plus interest.
.
Investment Position of Pub~c Contrasted With That of Promoters

In order to disclose in summary fashion certain essential features
of a particular offering, the staff of the Commission requested the
placing of an introductory paragraph at the beginning of the prospectus disclosing that, upon completion. of the financing, the public
would have paid $1,852,500, or $19.50 per share, for a 23.2 percent
interest in the company whereas three promoters would have paid
$25,000, or 8 cents per share, for a 76.8 percent interest in the company.
It was further disclosed in this introductory paragraph that in the
last 3 years the company had earned the following per share: 6 cents
(loss), 21. cents and 35 cents and that the book value of the shares
to, be offered at $19.50 would, after the receipts of the proceeds by the
company, amofmt to $1.09 per share.
Position of Investor in Foreign Corporation

The Commission required a Mexican corporation to disclose in a
prominent place in the prospectus that (1) the articles of incorporation of the company provided, as required by Mexican law, that every
person other than a Mexican who acquires an Interest or share in a
company shall be deemed to be a Mexican with respect to such interest
or participation and agrees not to invoke the protection of his govern-ment under penalty of forfeiting such interest or share to the Mexican
government in case of breach of such. agreement; and (21 the company knows of no provision of law in the United States which by its
terms sub~ects the company, a Mexican corporation, and its nonresident directors and officers and' the nonresident experts named in
the prospectus, to the jurisdiction of the courts in the United States;
and (3) the enforcement in the United States by investors of claims
under the Securities Act of 1933 against the company and such directors, officers, and experts as are not residents of the United States
may therefore be difficult or perhaps impossible.

SECURITIES AND EXC~NGE

COMJ4:ISSION

Significance of Contingent Liability

A company which was manufacturing its principal product: With,:
out.having first obtained a license from the owner of the patent covering a basic device embodied therein disclosed the fact that it had not.
secured such license but failed to disclose the possible disastrous results
which would follow from institution of suit by the patent holder. By
amendment required to the registration statement, the company, whose
total capital, reserves, and surplus aggregated less than $2,000,000,
disclosed that while it was unable to state exactly the amount of its
liability for such damages, it estimated that its liability for infringement to date would amount to approximately $232,000; and that.!
moreover, any judgment upholding the validity of the patent WOuld
unquestionably result in an injunction against the continued use of
the device' by th~ company, thus requiring modification and possibly _
abandonment of further manufacture .of the. product in question.
Losses During Reconversion

Period

A company whose peacetime business COnsists of the manufacture of
personal type airplanes reported earnings of $52,000 for the. year 1945.
Upon inquiry by the Commission as to the costs of reconverting and
entering into peacetime business, the statement of earning for 1945 was revised to show that although the company earned approximately
$600,000 in the first 8 months of 1945 from war business, it had lost
approximately $550,000 in the last 4 months of 1945 while it was converting to peacetime operations.
It was further disclosed that losses were continuing in 1946.

•

MisleadiDg Title of Security Revised

A registrant

proposed to describe the securities to be offered as
4 percent noncumulative income bonds." . This
title was considered by the Commission to be misleading, for the reason that the obligor actually promised to pay only 2_percent per
annum, and would pay an additional 2 percent only ln the sole .disere.
tion of its Board of Directors. In addition, all "income,." as that term
is generally understood; was not available for 1?ayment of the original
2 percent of interest, for the reason that the indenture 'provided IQr
the deduction of a fund for capital improvements in arriving at the .
amount available for. interest. The title of the securities was accordingly changed, as disclosed in an amendment to the registration state- .ment, to read "second mortgage noncumulative contingent interest
bonds," and this title was-furtner qualified at the same time by placing
a summary of the interest provisions on the. facing page of the
prospectus.

"second" mortgage

Stock Watering

The ''watering of stock" in its original sense is almost a forgotten
term. However, the issuance of stock at prices which bear little or
no relationship to the issuer's book values .and earning power accomplishes the same purpose. A case. in point is a N ew York corporation
which filed a registration statement covering 450,000 shares of _common stock and 120,000 stock purchase warrants.
This company had
100,000.shares of common stock, 10 cent par value, outstanding, w~ch

TwELFTH

13-

were recapitalized immediately prior to the filing of the registration
statement into.9oo,000 shares of common stock, 10 cent par value, the
new authorized capitalization being 1,500,000 shares. The offering
to the public of 450,000 shares of common stock was made at a price
of $6 per share, or an aggregate offering price of $2,700,000. In this
connection it is interesting to note that although tOe shares 'were to
be sold to the public at $6 per share, a few months prior to the offering
one of the organizers and principal stockholders sold the equivalent
of 207,000 of the recapitalized shares at an average price of approximately 30 cents per share to a company identified with the registrant
itt the time of the offering, The aggregate book value of the company's outstanding stock prior to the public offering was approximately $283,00(}. Based on the price at which the public was asked
'to purchase, i.e., at $6 per share, the 900,000 outstanding snares owned
by the insiders would have an aggregate value of $5,400,000, an
amount exceeding the aggregate boek value by approximately
$5,117,000. Thus it will be seen that on a liquidating basis some
$1,700,000 (>fthe $2,700,000 contributed by the public as a result of the
offering at $6 per share would go toward swelling the book value of
the outstanding stock held by insiders from about 31 cents to $2.21
-

per share.
It should also be noted that the offering at $6 per share was accomplished without even the support of past earning power. For each
of the 3 years prior to the public offering the company's earnings,
based on its capitalization of '900,000 shares, were from a very small
fraction of 1 cent per share to 2* cents per share. The company
recognized that to realize a normal return on its capitalization after
the J>ublic offering; its sales would have to increase from the maximum
-of $2,600,000 achieved in 1945 to in excess of $16,000,000, and that
such sales were not a reasonable expectancy in the near future.
In the registration statement as originally filed, the above facts
were either obscured or omitted.
Information regarding other circumstances, such as the company's dependence on substantial borrowed
capital, the issuance of warrants to underwriters and insiders, the
existence of competition with larger organizations having much
greater resources, the company's reliance upon rented rather than.
owned.facilities, and its performance 'of only limited functions (since
the products were to be obtained from outside sources and distributed
through independent distributors), was also omitted or not adequately
presented. Only after several amendments did the prospectus achieve
clear and adequate disclosure.

of 1933 is concerned generally with the prevention of fraud in the
sale of securities and obtaining compliance with the full disclosure
requirements of the registration process, Data with respect to civil
cases and appellate proceedings instituted under that Act, including
a brief discussion of all civil proceedings commenced or pending during the past fiscal year and their status at the close of the year, are

OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934.

•
 The Securities.Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to eliminate fraud,
manipulation, and other abuses in the trading of securities both on
the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, which
together constitute the nation's facilities fbr trading in securities;
to make available to the public information regar~
the condition
of corporations whose securities are listed on any national securities
exchange; and to regulate the use of the Nation's credit in securities
trading, The authority to issue rules on the use of credit in securities
transactions is lodged in the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, but the administration of these rules and of the other
provisions of the Act is vested in the Commission.
REGULATION OF EXCHANGES AND EXCHANGE TRADING
Registration

of Exchanges

The number of exchanges registered with the Commission as national securities exchanges and the number of exchanges exempted
from such registration remained the same during the fiscal year; the
numbers were 19 and 5 respectively.
Each exchange is required to keep its registration or exemption
statement .uP to date by filing appropriate amendments or supplements reflecting all changes occurring in its constitution, rules, trading practices, and organization. A total of J13 such amendments or
supplements were filed by the exchanges during the year, each of
which was studied and analyzed for its effects upon the public interest
and its compliance with the relevant regulatory provisions. While
the nature of the changes reported in this manner varied considerably,
the more important included adoption by New York Stock Exchange
and New York Curb Exchange of rules designed to regulate floor
trading; adoption. of a delisting rule by Salt Lake Stock Exchange;
adoption by St. Louis Stock Exchange of rules to permit and regulate
odd-lot trading in unlisted securities and of a rule to permit member
firms to make or participate in secondary offerings of listed securities
off the exchange; adoption of amendments to rules of Cincinnati
Stock Exchange to permit issuance of limited memberships; and
adoption by Los Angeles Stock Exchange and San Francisco Stock
Exchange of rules requiring members and member firms to reportwith respect to substantial options relating tQ securities dealt in on
. their respective exchanges.
Value and Volume of Trading

Tra~
on registered. securities exchanges during the fiscal year
1946 had an aggregate value of $20,377,690,000as shown in Appendix
Table 7. This lWire compares with $15,160,875,000 it). the preceding
12 months. Stock trading had a value of $18,934,952,000in the 1946
15

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

period, as against $13,141,773,000 in the 1945 period; The volume of
stock trading in the 1946 fiscal year was 826,777,000 shares as compared with 595,133,000 a year earlier.
Exchange :&Iembership

As of the close of the fiscal year, according to Commission records,
2,880 individuals and 1,045 firms (sole proprietorships, partnerships,
and corporations) were full or associate members of one or more of
~ the registered exchanges, excluding the Board of Trade of the City of
Chicago, which is primarily a commodities exchange. These figures
represent an increase of 40 individuals and 70 firms over the previous
year.
Disciplinary Actions

In connection with the Commission's investigatory activities, the
exchanges have been requested to report to the Commission all cases
of disciplinary action which they take against their members for
violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, any Rule or Regulation thereunder, or of any exchange rule. During the fiscal year, five
exchanges reported taking such action against a total of 39 members,
member firms, partners-or employees of member firms, These disciplinary aetions included fines ranging from $100 to $5,000 in 17
cases with total fines imposed aggregating $24,750; a 6-month_suspension from membership in 2 instances; the cancelation or suspension of registration of 11 registered representatives of member firms j
the suspension of 2 specialists; and the warning and reprimanding of
8 individuals and firms. One of. the specialists who ras suspended
was also fined in cOllnection with the violation involved.
The disciplinary actions were occasioned by violations of various
exchange rules, principally those regarding minimum rates of commission, margin trading, floor trading, handling of orders, partnership agreements, registered representatives, and specialists,
The
two members who were suspended from membership were alleged to
-have accepted and executed a customer's order to buy a sufficient
amount of a "designated stock to cause the last transaction therein
on a given day to be above a stated price. It was the consensus of the
exchange authorities that the execution of this order resulted in an
improper increase in the price of the stock involved.

Special Offering Plans

Rule X--=10B-2 permits special offerings of blocks of securities on
national securities exchanges where sucli -o1ferings are effected pursuant to a plan filed with and declared effective by the Commission.'

Regulation or the Distribution of Publicly Offered Securities

On April 16, 1946, the Trading and Exchange Division recommended
the adoption of a rule pursuant to Section 15 (c) (2) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 which would curb certain practices of some
underwriters and selling group members with respect to securities
being publicly offered, These persons wi~hh~ld ?r d.ivet:t substantial
portions of their allotted shares from public distribution in the underwriting and thereafter sell them to the public at prices substantially
above the offering price. specified in the prospectus. A study conducted by the Division in conaection with the proposed rule had shown
such practices to be wide~read and had indicated, moreover, that the
withholding of shares from distribution frequently contributed to an
artificial rise in the market price. The proposed rule was circulated
among the trade for comment and suggestions and was under consideration. a.t the end of the year.
REGI$TRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Purpose and Nature of Registration of Seeurities on Exchanges

In order to make available currently to investors reliable and comprehensive information regarding the affairs of the issuers of securities
listed and registered on a national securities exchange, Sections 12 and
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provide for the filing with
the Commission and the exchange of an application for registration
and annual, quarterly, and other periodic reports, containing certain
specified information.
Such applications and reports must be filed

. Commission determines that it may become effective within a shorter
period of time. It is unlawful under the statute for any member,
broker, or dealer to effect any transaction in any security (other than
an exempted security) on any national securities exchange unless
registration is effective as to the security on such exchange.
Examination

of Applications and Reports

All applications and reports filed pursuant to Sections 1.2 and 13
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 are examined by the Commission to determine whether accurate and adequate disclosure has been
made of. the information required by the Act and the Rules and Regula.tions thereunder, This examination does not involve an appraisal and
is not concerned with the merits of the registrant's securities. When
the examination discloses that material information has not been
furnished in accordance with the requirements, or that sound principles and procedures have not been followed in the preparation and
presentation of financial statements, the registrant,is so advised by
letter, or in conference with its representatives, and any necessary
correcting amendments are obtained and examined in the same manner
as the originally filed documents. Where the examination discloses
omissions which are clearly of an immaterial nature, particularly in
connection with periodic reports under Section 13 of the Act, the registrant may merely be notified thereof by means of a letter containing
suggestions which should be followed in the preparation and filing of
future reports, without insistence upon the filing of an amendnient
to the particular report in question .•
The examination of an application for registration is made as
promptly as possible after it is filed in order that any material deficieneies may be brought to the attention of the registrant and the
exchange before registration becomes effective in accordance with the
provision of the statute. While the basic period available for this
purpose is 30 days, it was necessary to complete the examination last
year of an increasing proportion of all applications filed within considerably less time, inasmuch as the Commission issued requested
orders accelerating the effective date of registration in a considerable
number of cases. For example, except for the applications filed with
respect to securities issued in connection with stock split-ups and
stock dividends and the like-of which there was a phenomenal increase last year accounting for approximately half of all applications
filed and in connection with which a temporary exemption from registration is generally available-acceleration
was requested last year
with respect to approximately 90 percent of the applications for
regis~abon.
.
Since a registrant's annual report is required to be filed within 120
days after the close of the fiscal year of the registrant, and because of
the fact that approximately 80 percent of all registrants have fiscal
years corresponding to the calendar year, there is filed with the Commission a peak load of more than 2,000 annual reports at or about the
end of April each :year. Consequently, it is always necessary to spread
the work of examining these anual reports over the ensuing months:
While current reports should be examined during the month. in which
they are filed, and such was done prior to the war, there has been such
a phenomenal growth in the volume of work flowing into the Com-

TWELFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

.19

mission, which has not .been coupled with a corresponding increase in
personnel, that-there has necessarily arisen in recent years a growing
backlog of current reports, as well as annual reports, that must be
held in suspense for appropriate examination.
This acute manpower
situation has been aggravated during the past year particularly by the
fact that more than 5,000 current reports were received during the
past fiscal year, nearly double the number of such reports (2,752)
received in the 1945 fiscal year. Further, it is estimated that the number of such current reports to be received in the current 1947 fiscal
year will increase still further to It total of something like 7,500. The
chief reason for this pronounced increase arises from the adoption on
July 23, 1945, of the Commission's Rule designated X-13A-6A requiring the filing of quarterly reports by certain companies engaged
in war groduction (see discussion appearing at pp. 11-12 of the Com.mission s Eleventh Annual Report), and the adoption in substitution
therefor of a new Rule on March 28,1946, designated Rule'X-13A-6B,
providing for the filing of quarterly reports by .certain listed companies. An explanation of this substitute Rule appears below.
New Rules Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
I

1

by

Rule X-13A-6B-Quarterly
reports
certain companies: The
Commission announced on March 28, 1946, the adoption of a reporting
program providing for the disclosure to investors and the public of
current information as to the volume of business being done by most
issuers having securities registered on a national securities exchange.
At the same time the Commission announced the recission of Rule
X-13A-6A and paragraph (f) of Rule X-13A-6.
.
Under the provisions of the new rule, designated X-13A-6B, and
the revised Item 11 of Form 8-K, most issuers filing annual reports
pursuant to the requirements of Rule X-13A-1 will be required to file
quarterly reports on Form 8-K, setting forth the dollar amount of
sales or other gross revenues during the fiscal quarter. A report must
be filed not later than 45 days after the close of each fiscal quarter
beginning after December 31, 1945, or not more than 45 days after
the effectIve date of the new Rule~whichever date is the later. Issuers
previously filing reports under Bule X-13A-6A begin immediately
to report under the new Rule so as to provide a continuous series of
reports as to such companies. Insurance companies, investment companies, common carriers, and public-utility companies are exempted
from the requirements of the new Rule due to the nature of' their
business and because, in the case of most listed public-utility companies, many' Federal and State regulatory agencies to which such
companies are generally subject presently require the filing of more
extensive information on at least as frequent a basis.
Prior to adoption, comments upon drafts of the proposed new rule
and of the amended Item 11 of Form 8-K were obtained from technical and professional associations, governmental agencies, national
securities exchanges, individual companies, attorneys, and many other
interested persons. Effect was given in the new Rules to a number
of the suggestions received. A minority of those commenting on the
proposed Rule, however, expressed varying degrees of doubt as to the
desIrability and feasibility of the proposed reporting program. For
this reason it was decided to make, .public the following statement

20

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

by the Commission outlining briefly the more important objections
raised by those opposed to the program and the reasons for adopting
the new, Rule:
,

..

Section 13 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 requires every
issuer of a security registered on a national securities exchange .to file ,"such
annual reports, • . . and such quarterly reports, as the Commission may prescribe." Pursuant to this subsection Rules. calling for the filing of annual reports
were adopted-shortlr after the efl'ective date of the Act. Rules were later adopted
calling for current reports on Form 8-K whenever any of c-ertain special events
occurred during the year. Since that time the problems involved in the requiring
of regular quarterly operating reports bave been under study from the point
of view of both the usefulness of such reports to investors and their feasiliil,ity
in the light of contemporary business and accounting practices.
We have now concluded to initiate a regular quarterly reporting program
applicable to most issuers having- securities listed on a national securities exchange. Under the new rule, a company is required to furnish quarterly information as to the sales or other gross revenues derived from its operations.
However, companies which regularly publish or distribute to stockholders quarterly financial statements or reports containing at least the above information
may comply with the Rule merely by filing copies of such published reports as
an exhibit to Form 8-K The information called for is not required to be certified by independent public accountanig,
As a result of extended study of The problem and of tqe ebmments received
from those to whom preliminary drafts of the program. were sent, we are of
the opinion that companies should furnish investors and the public with regular
interim information as to their operations. We are inclined to believe, more- .
over, that it would be desirable to obtain at quarterly intervals a condensed income statement showing not only gross revenues but also net income before and
after Federal income taxes together with any nonrecurring items of income or
costs and losses. Of an unusual size even though certain of the items could only
be arrived at by the use of reasonable estimates or on .the basis of certain
assumptions. It appears, however, that a substantial number of listed companies-do not now have their accounting and reporting practices so organized
as to be in a position to make the determinations necessary to furnish reason-:
ably reliable data of this character on'a quarterly basis. Accordingly, we have
determined for the present merely to require information as to sales or other
gross revenues. On the other hand, companies customarily preparing more
detailed information will be able to satisfy the requirements of the rule by filing
copies of their regular quarterly statements or reports.
.
Objection to the program has been made on the ground that the required
information as to sales or. other gross revenues may be uninformative or misleading due to the seasonal nature of a business or to unusual events of the
quarter.
Somewhat s.imilarly it is claimed that tbe information called for is
useless since changes in sales volume may not be accompanied by a comparable
change in gross or net profits, partleularly for short periods or during periods
when business conditions are unsettled. Although such difficulties clearly ,exist
in varying degrees depending upon the type of company, we feel, to the contrary,
that reports of sales volume when taken in conjunction with other known information as to the business and as to business' generally will be of substantial
usefulness. ,Among other things, for example, the information being required
should at the present time provide an index of the extent to which a company has been able to reenter clvilian markets or to maintain in the postwar P.6riod
its wartime volume of civilian business. It is also our view that such information will aid in the formation and exercise of an informed investment
judgment based on other available information as to the general nature' of the
operations of the company, its plans and prospects for the future, its position
with respect to other companies in the same industry, and many other factors
which afl'ect the financial success of a business.
Where in a partlcular case ali Issuer feels that its report as to S1lIesor other
gross revenues may not be representative because or- the seasonal nature of
the bnsiness or for other reasons, there are, of .eourse; a number of possible
procedures that may be utilized. In the ease of a seasonal business, an appro~
priate statement of th~ nature of..tJl,e business could be glven.. ,In addition; it
would be appropriate and desirable to furnish -along with the ..report for tl)e
particular quarter comparable ~.
for the same quarter 01: the llrevloUs

year

or for the 12 months period ending with the current quarter.
Likewise. if in
a particular case it is felt that sales or other gross revenues standing alone
are Inadequate because not indicative of the trend in gross or net profits. the
report coul(l include an appropriate explanation of the special circumstances, or
there could be substituted a more complete though stilI condensed form of
income statement such as is now regularly being published or sent to stockholders by many issuers.
The other principal objection was that the program imposed an unreasonable
burden on reporting companies. As to the very large numbers of issuers now
regularly issuing quarterly statements, we do not believe that the furnishing
of the required information, either directly or by means of copies of the regular
reports. involves any substantial burden. As to other companies. we feel that
any added burden involved in compiling the n,ecessary information as to sales
or other gross revenues is more than outweighed by the benefit to investors and
the. public of interim data as to a listed company's operations. Finally. if under
the circumstances of an unusual case it is impracticable to furnish the necessary
information within the prescribed time, or if the required information is neither
known nor available to the issuer. attention is directed to paragraphs 6 and 7
of the general instructions to Form 8-K which provide for special procedures
in such cases.
'

It may be noted that shortly after the close of the fiscal year, on
July 12, 1946, Rule X-13A-6B was amended so as to exempt from the
Rule in addition companies primarily engaged in the production of
raw cane sugar or other seasonal single-erop agricultural commodity
since such producers will ordinarily have no sales in two or more of
their fiscal quarters. The staff has, however, been directed to study
the 'possibility of requiring such companies to furnish at appropriate
intervals-other significant mformation as to the progress of the operations of such companies.
Rule X-12A-1, Temporary EXemption From Section 12 (a) of Certain Securities of Banks

~
. The Commission announced on December 5, 1945, an amendment to
Rrile X-12A4.
The previous Rule temporarily exempted from registration under the Act securities of banks as to which temporary registration expired on June 30, 1935, securities issued in exchange for or
resulting from a modification of' any securities of banks exempted
from registration by the Rule, and common stock issued as a stock
dividend on stock of the same class exempted from registration by
the Rule. The amendment enlarges the third category of exempt se7'
curities by providing that any additional shares of common stock
(whether issued as a stock dividend or otherwise) shall be exempt
under the Rule if the issuer has common stock of the same class so
exempted from registration.
The amendment also removes from the
Rule any reference to securities of bank holding companies since the
exemption -of such securities under the Rule has expired.
Amendment 1,0 Fol'Jlllllo-K and, I-MD

The Commission on May 22, 1946, amended annual report Forms
1o-K'and I-MD so as to secure a current restatement of the general
character of the business in which registrants and their subsidiaries
are engaged. This restatement was rendered desirable because of the
major changes in many businesses as a consequence of war activities
or occurring In the process of reconversion to peacetime activities.
M9reover, in many cases changes not individually significant have
occurred over a period of years the cumulative.effect of which had

22

SECURITIES AND ExCHANGE

COMMISSION

been a substantial change in the general character of the business of a
registrant and its subsidiaries or in one or more of the major lines of
the business. The amendment requires the restatement only for the
fiscal year ending on or after December 31, 1945. Where registrants
had already filed their reports or are about to do so, extensions of time
for furnishing the additional information may be applied for.
Amendment to Forms 12-K and 12A-K '

The Commission announced on February 19, 1946 (Securities Exchange Act Release No. 3787), the adoption of minor amendments to.
its annual report Forms 12-K and 12A-K (prescribed for companies
required to file annual reports with the Interstate Commerce Commission or the Federal COmmunications Commission).
The purpose
of these changes was to revise the selected schedules so as to conform
to certain changes made in Form A of the Interstate Commerce Commission for tlle year ended December 31, 1945:
I

Proceedings Under Section 19 (a) (2)

Section 19 (a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorizes
the Commission, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing,
to deny, suspend the effective date of, suspend for a period not exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw the registration of a security if
the Commission finds that the issuer of such security has failed to
comply with any provision of the Act or the rules and regulations
thereunder.
Two proceedings under this Section were pending at the beginning
of thel.ear.
During the year two additional proceedings were institute , one for alleged inaccuracies in annual reports of the issuer,
and the other for failure to file the required annual reports. The
registration of the securities of one issuer was ordered withdrawn
during the year for failure to file the required annual reports. At
the end of the fiscal year, two proceedings were still pending.
Temporary Suspensions of Securities From Trading Pursuant
(a) (4) and R~e X-15C2-2

to Section 19
'-

Section 19 (a) (4) authorizes the Commission summarily to suspend trading in any registered security on any national securities
exchange fora_period not exceeding 10 days where the public interest
so reqUIres. Where the reason for a suspension under Section 19 (a)
(4) is to prevent fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices, Rule X-15C2-2'concurrently
prohibits over-the-counter trading
by brokers and dealers. During the year two securities were suspended from trading on exchanges pursuant to these provisions.
In the first case, the common stock, $1 par value of. Red Bank
Oil Co. was suspended fr0!9- trading on the New York (fu;b Exchange.
That security was then the subj8Qt of stop-order proceedings under
the Securities Act of 1933 and delisting proceediiigs under Section
, 19 (a) (2) of the Securities' Exchange Act of 1934. The Suspension
was occasioned by the uncovering of iriformation which raised a serious,
question relating to the independence of the accountants who had prepared financial statements previously :filed with the Commission by
the issuer. After the secunty had been suspended for several10-day
periods, the Conuriission found that the financial statements had

TWELFTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

23

not' in fact, been ]?roperly prepared and pursuant to its' powers
under Section 19 (a) (~) of the Securities Exchange Act, suspended
the security from trading on the New York Curb Exchange for a
period not to exceed 12 months pending final disposition of other
matters at issue in the proceedings.2
. The second suspension under Section 19 (a) (4) involved the
common stock, $1 par value, of Interstate Home Equipment Co., a
company which was in an advanced stage of liquidation.
A suspension of trading on the N ew York Curb Exchange and the Chicago
Board of Trade was ordered when it appeared that a sudden spurt ill
the market price of the security had carried the price far above the
maximum amount which the stockholders could expect to receive upon
completion of the liquidation. The suspension was continued in
effect by further orders until current financial statements, which had
been in preparation, were released to the public, and was then lifted.
Thereafter the exchanges upon which the security had been traded
elected to suspend trading on their own floors and they subsequently
removed the security from listing altogether.
With the lifting of
the Commission's suspension, however, trading became permissible
over the counter,"

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS OF CORPORATE INSIDERS

The security ownership reports prescribed in three of the Acts
administered by the Commission have as their main objective to furnish public security holders with information as to the trading of
insiders in the equity securities of their companies ~ The statutory requirement for the filing of these reports recogniZes the fiduciary capacity of corporate insiders.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Under that
Section every person who is an officer, or director or principal stockholder (i.e., a person who is, directly or indirectly, beneficial owner nf
more than 10 percent of any class of registered equity security) of an
issuer which has any class of equity security listed and registered on
a national securities exchange must file with the Commission and the
exchange an initial report disclosing the amount of every class of
equity security of the issuer of which he is directly or indirectly the
beneficial owner, and a report for each month thereafter in which any
purchase, sale, or other change in such ownership occurs. Under the
corresponding provisions of Section 17 (a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, every officeror-director of a registered holding company is under the duty to file with the Commission reports
disclosing his direct and indirect beneficial ownership of every class
of security of the registered holding company and its subsidiary
companies, as well as all subsequent changes occurring therein, Later,'
when the Investment Company Act of 1940 was passed, it contained in
Section 30 (I) the requirement that every officer, director, principal
security holder, member of an advisory board, investment adviser and
affiliated person of an investment adviser of a registered closed-end
investment company shall in respect of his transactions in any securities of such company (other than short-term paper) be subject to 'the
same duties and liabilities as those imposed by Section 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission has adopted appropriate Rules in order to avoid any unnecessary duplication in the
filing of ownership reports which are required by more than one of
these Acts.
I
Each of these statutes provides that, for the purpose of preventing
the unfair use of inside information, any profit realized by these
corporate insiders from certain short-term transactions shall 'be recoverable by the issuer or by a security holder in its behalf if it
fails or refuses to bring suit to recover within 60 days after request
or fails diligently to prosecute the same thereafter. It is incorrect to
suppose that these latter provisions have the capacity to prevent
insider tradin~. They merely provide that, for the purpose stated,
any profit the Insider realizes from a so-called "short-swing" transaction (specifically, any purchase and sale or any sale and purchase
within any period of less than 6 months) in securities of his company,
shall be recoverable by the company. At the same time, it is undoubtedly correct to say that the successful operation of these ownership reporting requirements has appreciably reduced the amount of
such short-term trading by corporate insiders. It might be noted that
since the constitutionality of the profit-recoverability feature of Section 16 was determined by the court in Smoloue v. Delendo Oorp.".136
F. (2d) 231 (C. C. A. 2, 1943), oert, den., 320 U. S. 751 (1943), certain
other civil actions for the recovery of such insider profits have been
instituted; II and it may also be pointed out that in several instances
corporate insiders have informed the Commission' fhat they have
voluntarily paid over to their companies profits realized by them from
such trancactions.

The total of 19,550 reports filed during the 1946 fiscal year represents an increase of 18 percent over the number filed during the
preceding year, and is greater than the total filed in any of the-. preceding 7 years. During the past 12 years 252,261 reports have
been filed by more than 39,000persons subject to the ownership reporting requirements.
Most of these reports were filed without the
necessity of' any action by the Commission, and in relatively few
instances' has more than a simple reminder to the reporting person
been necessary to secure the filing of the required reports.
The Commission's staff engaged in the work of examining these
reports for compliance with the statutory requirements has need, as.
a practical administrative matter, to examine currently a wide variety
of collateral sources of information available to the Commission.
Amo~ the more important 'of these sources are applications for
registration of securities, annual' reports, and quarterly and other
current reports filed by issuers pursuant to the Securities Exchange
A.ct of 1934; registration statements and prospectuses filed by issuers
under the Securities Act of 1933; notifications of registration; registration statements, and annual supplements filed by registered holding companies' under the Public Utility Holding Company A.ct of
1935; notifications of registration, registration statements, annual
reports and quarterly reports filed by registered closed-end investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940; preliminary and definitive proxy soliciting material filed by issuers,
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Hold!JIg Company Act of 1935 and the Investment Company Act of 1940;
letters received from issuers; and the current publications of certain
daily,week1y, quarterly and other periodic financial news services.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

-
It is inevitable, in view of the volume of security ownership reports
which are received by the Commission-a volume which presently!
averages about 100 reports each work day-that many questions involving the interpretation or application of the reporting requirements to particular situations are presented daily to the Commission's
staff. Many such questions relate to indirect beneficial ownership of
securities held by the reporter's spouse or other member of his intimate
family group, his so-called holding company, or a personaLtrust in
which he has some interest. But the problems extend also to a great
variety of other phases of the requirements. Consequently, a considerable portion of the time of the examining section assigned to this
work is spent in rendering informal administrative interpretations of
the applicable statute or rules as they may relate to the particular facts
and circumstances presented; in answering personal, telephone, and
correspondence requests for advisory assistance as to the simplest
method of preparing necessary forms; and in explaining the scope
of the items of information contained in the forms. Of the 4,223
outgoing letters which originated last year in the examining section
in charge of these ownership reports, it is estimated that one-half
contained such informal advisory assistance afforded in particular
cases, while during the same period hundreds of telephone and
personal inquiries seeking such help were also given appropriate
attention.
The security ownership and transaction reports on all Forms are
available for publio inspection as soon as they are filed at the headquarters office of the Commission, and reports on Forms 4, 5 and 6
may likewise be inspected also at the particular exchange with whichan additional copy of each report relatmg to the issuer concerned must
be filed. For the purpose of making the information contained in all
reports more readily accessible to interested investors, the Commission
compiles and publishes such information in a monthly Official Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings which is widely distributed among mdividual investors, newspaper correspondents and
press services, and other interested persons. Copies of these summaries are also available to the public at each regional office of the
Commission and each national securities exchange.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS

Under three of the'Acts it administers-Sections
14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) 12 (a) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 and 20 t a) of the Investment Company Act of
1940-the Commission is authorized to prescribe rules and regulations
concerning the solicitation of proxies, consents, and authorizations in
connection with securities of the companies subject to those Acts.
Pursuant to this authority the Commission has 'adopted Regulation'
X-14, which is desigued to protect investors by requiring the disclosure of certain information to them and by affording them an opportunity for active participation in the affairs of their company.
Essentially, this Regulation makes unlawful any solicitation of any
ProXY2 consent or authorization which-is false or misleading as to any'
material fact or which omits to state any material fact necessary to
make the statements already made not false or misleading. Under

the Regu!ation it is necessary, in general, that each person solicited be
furnislied such information as will enable him to act intelligently
upon each separate matter in respect of which his vote or consent is
sought. The proxy rules set forth in this Regulation also contain provisions whiCh enable security holders who are' not allied with the
management to communicate with other security holders when the
management is soliciting proxies. In the Comnussion's view the develbpment of these Rules has already contributed distinctly to a revitalization of the democratic process in the conduct of corporate
affairs.'
Stat.istically, it may be noted that last year the Commission received
and examined under Regulation X-14 both the preliminary and definitive material required with respect to 1,670 such solicitations as well
as "fo~ow up" material employed in 390 instances.
UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES s
On Registered Exchanges

.As of June 30, 1946, 965 stock issues were admitted to unlisted trading on the registered exchanges. Of these, 569 issues were fully listed
ana registered on exchanges other than those on which unlisted trading
privileges existed and 396 issues had only an unlisted trading status
so far as the registered exchanges are concerned,"
The 396 issues having only an unlisted status aggregated 374,597,021
shares, or about 13.2 percent of the entire 2,832,452,776 shares admitted
to trading on the registered exchanges. 316 of the issues were on
New York Curb Exchange only, 13 were on that exchange and one or
another of the exchanges outside of New York, and 67 were on the
latter exchanges only. 296 of the issues were of domestic corporations, 70 were of Canadian corporations, and 30 were .American depositary receipts for shares of foreign issues. Reported trading
volume in the 396 issues for the calendar year 1945 was 54,271,815
shares, consisting of 43,191,756 shares traded in domestic issues,
8,083,380 in Canadian issues and 2,996,679 in the .American depositary
receipts, and amounting to about 7.1 percent of the total share volume
traded on these exchanges .
..As of June 30,1946,132 bond issues were admitted to unlisted trading on the registered exchanges. Of these, 16 issues were fully listed
and registered on exchanges other than those on which unlisted trading
privileges existed and 116 issues had only an unlisted trading status.
The 116 issues aggregated $1,155,904,721 principal amount and were
practically all on New York Curb Exchange.
_
The decline in the aggregate of stock and bond issues admitted only
to unlisted trading has continued in accordance with the expectation
of Congress, as mentioned annually in these reports. Most of the net
reduction of 37 stock issues during the past fiscal year was occasioned
by retirement of preferred stocks and by the listing and registration
,of previously unregistered issues or their successors. The net reducf!%8.JDpleof one type of regulatory problllP1 presented under the pro~ rules Is found

During the fiscal year applications filed pursuant to Clause (2) of
Section fs (f) of the Act were granted permitting unlisted trading on
the Boston Stock Exchange with respect to 22 issues;-Chicago Stock
Exchange, 18 issues; Cleveland Stock Exchange, 8 issues; Philadelphia Stock Exchange, 15 issues; Pittsburgh Stock Exchange, 11 issues;
and St. Louis Stock Exchange, 4 issues. - _All of the applications
granted were for stocks. All application of the Pittsburgh Stock
Exchange with respect to one stock issue was denied.
Applications filed pursuant to Clause (3) of Section 12 (f) of the
Act were granted during the year to Chicago Stock Exchange and New
York Curb Exchange with- respect to common stock of the United
Light and Railways Co., subject to certain terms and conditions."
Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

Whenever a security admitted to unlisted trading privileges is
changed only with respect to its title, maturity, interest rate, par value,
dividend rate, or amount authorized or outstanding, its privileges are
retained on condition merely that the exchange notify the Commission, pursuant to Rule X-12F-2 (a), of the change occurring in the
security promptly after learning of it. During the year numerous
such notifications were received from the exchanges,
:
In the event, however, that changes more comprehensive than those
enumerated above are effected. in an unlisted security, unlisted trading
privileges in the altered security may be continued only if the Commission finds, upon application by the exchange pursuant to Bule
X-12F-2 (b), that such altered security is substantially equivalent to
the security previously admitted to such privileges. During the year
applications filed pursuant to this Rule were granted. with respect to 1
bond issue on New Orleans Stock Exchange, 1 stock issue, on Los
Angeles Stock Exchange, 10 st-ockissues 8JId 1 bond issue on New York

DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES
Securities Delisted by Application

Section 12 (d) ot the Act defines the Commission's powers with respect to applications by an issuer or an exchange to remove securities
fr-om listing and registration on an exchange. It provides that a
security may be withdrawn or stricken from listing and registration
in accordance with the rules of the exchange and upon such terms as
the Commission may deem necessary to impose for the protection of
investors.
Pursuant to this Section and in accordance with the procedure prescribed by Rule X-12D2-1 (b), 3 issues were delisted upon application
of their issuers and 12 issues were delisted upon application of exchanges during the fiscal year. In three instances the same issue was
delisted from two exchanges upon their respective applications so
that the total delistings, including this duplication, numbered 18. In
each of these cases the application was granted without the imposition of any terms upon the delisting. Of the three issues delisted
upon application of issuers, one remained listed and. registered on
another exchange, one had become very closely held WIth only a few
shares in public hands and with no exchange activity in recent years,
and the issuer of one was in course of dissolution.
During the year the Commission considered the application of
Suburban Electric Securities Company' to withdraw its preferred
and-common shares from listing and registration on the Boston Stock
Exchange. The application was granted subject (1) to the condition that the withdrawal should not become effective until after the
applicant had submitted the delisting proposal to its shareholders
and obtained their consent, and (2) to certain other conditions relating to adequacy of disclosure in the event the securities in question
were withdrawn: from listing and registration."
This was the third occasion on which the Commission had imposed
material terms upon the granting of a delisting application; the first
two such cases were those of Shawmut Association and The Torrington Company, each of. which had applied to withdraw its common
stock from listing and registration on the Boston Stock Exchange."
The terms imposed in these three cases were similar to the extent that
the assent of shareholders to the proposed deli sting was riuired,
although the precise terms of each in this respect differed.
n the
SUbu:rban case the terms required that solicitation of shareholders'
assents be made by the applicant within 30 days from the date of
issuance of 'the Commission. order granting the application.
Moreover,-the order required consent by two-thirds of the company's comU Sflburban
Electric Securitlll8 Oompanv, Securities Exchange Act Releases Nos. 3822
and 3829 •
.. For a'discusslon ot the two previous cases see Eleventh Annual Report, p. 19. Doring
the fiscal year the Commission dismissed the applications of Shawmut Association, The
TOlrrlBgtonCompany and Suburban upon being advised that each had determined not to
30 Iclt Its shareholders' consent to the proposed dellst~.

'.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

mon and preferred shareholders and by the holders of two-thirds of
the shares of each class. Furthermore the terms in the S'libwrban
case provided, in the event delisting of the securities became effective,
(1) that prior to purchasing any of its shares the applicant should
furnish the seller with a statement st-ating that the applicant was the
purchaser and setting forth specified information relevant to its securities, as well as a consolidated balance sheet, itemized surplus statement, and profit and loss statement of the applicant and its subsidiaries
as of ~
 specified date, and (2) that the applicant should mail to the
Commission a copy of the financial statements intended to be furnished to security holders lis mentioned above prior to the use of
such statements and also mail to the 'Commission a monthly statement
.setting forth certain specified information relative to the number of
its own shares that it had purchased. These latter ternis were imposed in view of the fact that the Commission found financial statements issued by Suburban to its shareholders in the past had not set
forth the status of the trust clearly or in accordance with sound accounting principles and that Suburban had been engaged in a consistent program of buying in its own shares from public holders while
members of the management, familiar with the company's affairs
and prospects, retained their shares, in effect using the company to
increa.se their relative percentages of its outstanding securities.
Securities Delisted by Certification

Under Rule X-12D2-2 (a) an exchange may remove from listing
and registration, upon certification to the Commission, securities
which have been paid at maturity, redeemed or retired in full, or which
have become exchangeable for other securities. During the year 444:
issues of 310 issuers were delisted upon certification by exchanges
under this Rule. Some of these issues were delisted from more than
one exchange; total delistings, includin~ these duplications, numbering 510. In many instances successor ISSUesof those delisted under
this Rule were subsequently listed and registered on the exchanges.
Rule X-12D2-1 (d) provides that an exchange may remove any
security from listing and registration if trading therein has been
terminated pursuant to a rule of the exchange requiring such termination whenever the security becomes listed and admitted to trading on
another exchange. Pursuant to this Rule, six issues of -six issuers
were delisted from New York Curb Exchange when they became listed
and registered on New York Stock Exchange.
Securities Removed From Listing on Exempted Exchanges

The listing of a security upon an exempted exchange may be terminated upon the filing by an exempted exchange of an appropriate
amendment to its application for exemption. Four exempted. exchanges filed such amendments during the year, terminating the listing
of six issues of flve'issuers,
SECURITIES EXEMPTED FROM REGISTRATION
Exempted Securities Removed From Exchange Trading

During the ;year 13 issues of 8 issuers which had' been previously
admitted to exchange trading under a temporary exemption Hom Sec-

TWELFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

31

tion 12 (a) of the Act pursuant to Rules X-12A-l, X-12A-2 or
X-12A-3 were removed from such trading by action of the exchanges
involved. The reasons for these removals were that one issue had
been paid at maturity; two had been called for redemption; two
had had no exchange activity for many years; the three issuers of the
remaining eight issues were involved in reorganizations as a result
of which these issues had either been eliminated or become exchangeable for other securities which were not admitted to exchange trading.
Temporary Exemption of Substituted or Additional Securities

In order to provide continuity of exchange trading in cases where
securities previously listed or admitted to unlisted trading privileges
have come to evidence other securities, Rule X-12A-5 affords to such
securities a temporary exemption from the registration requirements
of Section 12 (a) of the Act to the extent necessary to render lawful
the effecting of transactions therein on the exchange.
Notification of the admission to trading under this Rule with respect
to 144 issues of 127 issuers were received from the various exchanges
during the year. In some instances the same issue was admitted to
trading on more than one exchange, so that the total admissions to
such trading, including these duplications, numbered 181. These
figures include many instances in which the Rule was utilized to permit
exchange trading in additional shares of stock resulting from the
numerous stock split-ups and stock dividends which occurred during
the year.
STABILIZATION AND MANIPULATION
Manipulation

In its administration of the provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 relating to the manipulation of securities markets, the
Commission's policy is to attempt to detect manipulative practices at
their inception, before the public has been harmed. At the same time,
it seeks to avoid interfering with the legitimate functioning of the
securities markets. In brief, the Commission's investigations in this
area take two forms. The "flying quiz," or preliminary investigation,
is designed to detect and discourage incipient manipulation by a
prompt determination of the reason for unusual market behavior. If
a legitimate reason for the activity is uncovered, the case is closed. If
more extended investigation seems required, a formal order is sought of
the Commission under which members of the staff are empowered to
subpena pertinent material and take testimony under oath. These
formal investigations often cover substantial periods of time, and
trading operations involving large quantities of shares are carefully
scrutinized.
, The Commission keeps confidential the fact that any security is under
Investigation so that the market in the security may not be unduly
affected or reflections be unfairly cast upon individuals or firms whose
activities are being investigated.
As a result, the Commission occasionally receives criticism for failing to investigate situations when, in
fact, it is actually engaged in an intensive investigation of those very

matters.

Stabilization

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1946,the Commission continued
the admmistration of Rules X-17A-2 and X-9A6-1. Bule X-17A-2
requires the filing of detailed reports of all transactions incident to
offerings in respect of which a registration statement has been filed
under the Securities Act of 1933 where any stabilizing operation is
undertaken to facilitate the offering. Rule X-9A6-1 governs stabilizing transactions in securities registered on national securities .exchanges, effected to facilitate offerings of securities so registered, in
which the offering prices are represented to be "at the market" or at
prices related to market prices.
Of the total registration statements filed during the 1946 fiscal year,
about two-thirds, or 504, contained a statement of intention to stabilize
to facilitate the offerings covered by such registration statements. Because of the fact that a registration statement sometimes covers.more
than one class of security, there were 660 offerings of securities in
respect of which a statement was made, as required by Rule 827 under
the Securities Act, to the effect that a stabilizing operation was eon"
templated. Stabilizing operations were actually conducted to facilitate 96 of these offerings. In the case of bonds, public offerings of
$188,195,000 principal amount were stabilized. Offerings of stock
issues aggregating 18,797,323 shares and having an aggregate estimated public offering price of $515,548,900 were also stabilized, In
connection with these stabilizing operations, 9,154 stabilizing reports
were filed with the Commission during the fiscal year. Each of these
reports has been analyzed, thereby enabling the staff. to determine
whether the stabilizing activities were lawful.
To facilitate compliance with the Commission's Rules on stabilizing
and to assist issuers and underwriters to avoid violation of the statutory provisions dealing with manipulation and fraud, many confer:'
ences were held with the representatives of such issuers and underwriters and many written and telephone requests were answered. .A. '
total of 2,118 letters and memoranda of such conferences and telephone
requests and memoranda to the regional offices of the Oommission
were written in connection with the administration and enforcement
of the stabilization and manipulation statutory provisions and regulations..

Broker-Dealer

Inspections

Broker-dealer inspections, undertaken pursuant to Section 17 of the
Securities Exchange Act for the purpose of determining ,whether
registrants are in compliance with the requirements of law, totaled
,603 during the 1946 fiscal year. Infractions, which were discovered
in about one-third of these inspections, were of varying degrees of
seriousness.
Seventeen inspections revealed unsatisfactory financial conditions
requiring immediate corrective action or continued surveillance. In
134 inspections, the reports revealed transactions at prices at such
variance with prevailing market prices as to raise some question as
. to fair treatment of customers. .In 108 inspections, the reports con. tained information indicating noncompliance with the provisions of
Regulation T relating to ilie extension of credit. In 36 inspections,
questions were raised concerning improper hypothecation and commingling of customers' securities and use of customers' free funds.
In 25 inspections, it was discovered that, firms took secret profits in
~ency: transa~tions by misrepresenting the prices at which orders had

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Whenever infractions are discovered, efforts are made to determine
whether they are the result of carelessness or represent a policy of indifference or wilfulness on the part of the responsible management.
The Commission has continued its 'established policy in calling
minor infractions to the attention of the firm at the time of the inspection so that corrective measures may be taken immediately. Sub'sequent check-ups are then made in order to determine whether the
promised corrections have been effected. In some instances, however,
the infractions are of serious nature, requiring further inquiry or
investigation.
During the 1946 fiscal year, 39 inspections resulted in
inquiry or investigation beyond the scope of the inspection.

Among those proceedi~s resulting in revocation of registration
was the action against Omtora Oompany, Ino., of WashingtOn, D. C.
The transactions upon which the Commission made its findings were
between the firm and two of its customers, elderly women to whom
the firm owed :fiduciary duties, and involved considerable crosstrading between their accounts. Intransactions with these customers,
the firm habitually confirmed as principal.and at a profit to itself. The
Commission concluded that the firm, under the duty to act as a broker
for these two customers, had obtained secret profits in effec~
cross
transactions between customer accounts as principal, and haa. willfully violated the antifraud provisions of Section 11(~) of the Securities Act and Sections 10 (b) and 15 (c) t1) of the Securities ~change
',"

'

TWELFl'H

ANNUAL REPORT

Act. The' Commission emphasized that, under all the circumstances
of the case, the riskless character of tlJ.e transactions was itself evidence of an agency relationship. The firm had the complete trust and
confidence of the customers; it solicited them to buy specific securities
which it recommended; it knew that these securities were not in inventory and that it would have to go into the market to obtain them
to fill orders; it knew also that it could obtain the securities without
any risk of its own funds. The Commission held that under all of
the circumstances the firm was under the duty to act as agent for the
customer in the absence of explicit and informed consent to the firm's
acting as principal.
In a case of considerable interest to underwriters and securities
dealers generally, the Commission suspended from membership in the
NASD for a period of 10 days, beginning March 16, 1946, the New
York firm of Van Alstyne, Noel &1 00. upon a finding that the firm
had willfully violated Section 5 (a) (1) of the Securities Act of 1933.
On December 14, 1945, approximately a month and' a half prior to
the filing of a r~gistration statement, this firm entered into arrangements WIth Andrew J. Higgins, President of Higgins, Inc., for the
underwriting of 900,000 shares of common stock of Hi~gins, Inc.
Having completed the formation of a so-called "underwritmg group"
consisting of itself and 74 dealers throughout the country, the firm
on or about January 10, 1946, completed the formation of a selling
group consisting of about 160 dealers throughout the country and
allotted specific amounts of shares to these latter dealers, who in
turn allotted shares to their customers .. A registration statement
covering this issue of securities was finally filed on J anuary 30, 1946,
some 20 days after the formation of the selling group. The Commission found, on these admitted facts, that there had been a sale
of Higgins common stock prior to its effective registration.
In reaching this conclusion, the Commission considered that clause of Section
. 2 (3) of the Securities Act which excepts "preliminary negotiations
or agreements between an issuer and any underwriter" from the definition of "sale." The' firm's activities, however, were found to have
exceeded mere negotiations with underwriters and to have involved
sales to members of the selling group and to members of the public.
Commenting on the Congressional :uitent to outlaw offers or sales
to selling group members prior to the effective date of the registration
, statement, the Commission also pointed out that a prohibition against
making "offers to buy" had been expressly included in the l?rohibition
of Section 5' (a) (1) for the specific purpose of preventmg underwriters from discnminating against dealers who did not make offers .
to buy between the period of the filing of the registration statement
and its effective date.
After prolonged proceedings, the Commission on January 22, 1946,
issued its findings and opinion and ordered revocation of the registration of Norris &1 Hirshberg, Ino., of Atlanta, Ga. The Commission found that in fixing prices which were unaffected by the operation of a free, open and competitive market without disclosing the
nature of its market, in dealing as a principal with uninformed customers and customers who had given it powers of attorney, and in
trading excessIvely for accounts as to which it had discretionary
. powers, this firm bad engaged in activities which were fraudulent

and illegal under Section 17 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 and
Sections 10 (b) and. 15 (c) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. On April 29, 1946, .NOrris &1 llil'shberg, Inc; filed a petition
for review of the Commission's order in the United states Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia, and on May 2, 1946, the Court
entered an order by. stipulation staying the Commission's order
pending further order of the Court. The Court conditioned its stay
order upon conformance by the firm with its stipulation. and agreement with the Commission not to engage during the pendency of the
review in acts or practices violating the. above-mentioned provisions
of the statutes.
. SUPERVISION OF NASD ACI'lVITY

The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., continued
to be the only national securities association registered as such with
this Commission. During the year ended June 30, 1946, membership
increased from 2,290 to 2,514, a gain of 224 members.
Disciplinary Proceedings

Final action on 19 disciplinary cases against members was reported
to the Commission by the Association in the year ending June 30, 1946.
Of these 19 cases, complaints were dismissed or withdrawn in 6 instances; in 4 cases violations were .found and the members censured;
and in the remaining 9 cases violations were found and the firms involved were fined an aggregate of $3,950 in amounts ranging in
particular cases from $1,000 to $200. In this last group of cases, collateral penalties such as censure or an agreement pledging future
observance and compliance with the rules' were sometimes also
included and, in addition, in 3 such cases costs, in varying amounts
up to $250, were also imposed on the members found to have violated
Association rules.
'
During the year the Commission found it appropriate to refer, for
whatever action the asso?iation Inig~t find advisable, facts concernmg the busmess practices of 11' different member firms. Three
such cases had been pending at the beginning of the year. During
the year, final action by the association was reported to the Commission on seven such cases and seven cases were 'still in- process at
the year end.
Commission Review of Disciplinary Action or Denial of Membership

_ Section 15A (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides
for. review by the Commission, on application by an aggrieved party,
of .disciplinary action by' the AsSOCIationagainst any member or of
denial of membership by the Association to any broker or dealer. Four
such cases came before the Commission in the 1946 fiscal year, two of
which were decided during the year and the remaining two were
pending at the year .end. _
.
.
. On August 7, 1945; the Commission by order, after hearing and
oral argument, dismissed a review proceeding brought by Tliomas
Arthur Stewart,u a member who had been found by the Association to
have violated its rules of fair practice and had been suspended from

membership for 1 year. The Commission's opinion included findings
that Stewart had violated the Association's rules of fair practice, and
that his conduct had been inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade ill that he had recommended to and executed for certain
customers purchases and redemptions of shares of open-end investment companies, timed in relation to dividend dates so as to obtain
~ultiple dividends, without h~ving reasonable grounds for believing
his recommendations to be suitable for such customers and without
making adequate disclosure as to (a ) the manner of determining the
prices of such shares, (b) the_effect of dividends on such prices, and
(c) the amount of selling charges included in the prices of shares
purchased by the customer. III effect, the dismissal of the review
procet;dJ!Ig affirmed the -
decision and the penalty imposed by the
ASSOCIation.
At the end of the fiscal year another such appeal from Association
disciplinary action was also pending before the Commission," There
was also then before the Commission a petition by Foelber-Patterson,
Inc. seeking review by the Commission of action of the Association in
denying membership to the applicant."

COMMISSION

Board of Governors of the Association had considered his application
and recommended that the Commission admit him to membership.
At the year end, a somewhat similar petition filed by the Association
on behalf of Greene. & Company was before the 'Commission for
decision. The petition on behalf of Greene & Company asked that the
firm be continued in membership with W. F. Thompson acting as a
partner or an employee. Thompson had been expelled by the association in 1942 for violations of the rules of fair practice which prohibit
conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade. This
expulsion created a barrier to membership by any firm employing
Thompson, and made Thompson ineligible for direct membership,
absent Commission approval or direction. As in the Godley case, the
petition for Commission approval of the continuance of Greene &
Company in membership was filed by the Association after the District
Committee and the Board of Governors had considered and conditionally approved the application."
.
The other pending case arose from a petition filed by Lawrence R.
Leeby for admission to membership in the Association notwithstanding
the fact that the Association had expelled him from membership ill!
1942 and that the Commission had in 1943 revoked his broker-dealer
registration.
Leeby's petition requested that the Commission exercise
its administrative discretion in his favor, as far as Association membership was concerned, and it was coupled with an application for registration with the Commission as a broker.
Registered Representative Rule

The Association on July 31, 1945, filed with the Commission as
amendments to its registration statement, after requisite approval by
the Board of Governors and the membership, a series of amendments
to the bylaws and rules requiring that no member should permit any
person to manage, supervise, solicit or handle securities business, trade
in or sell securities or solicit investment advisory or investment management business, unless that person was registered with the Association as a "registered representative."
Registered representatives must
agree to be bound by: the articles of incorporation, bylaws and rules of
the As!1ociation, and duly authorized rulings, orders, directions, decisions and penalties. The rules also provide that a person may. not
become registered if he is subject to an order of the Association suspending or revoking his registration or if he is subject to -any of the
disqualIfications for which brokers and dealers may be refused or
discontinued in membership.
However, under Section 15A (b) (4)
of the Act, the Commission may approve or direct admission into or
continuance of membership notwithstanding the member's control of
a person with a diqualification.
.
- .
The statute does not require affirmative Commission approval before
amendments to the Association's rules may become effectlve, although
it does require the Commission to disaJ.lpFove any amendment unless it
is found to be consistent with the applicable statutory standards. In
order to give all interested parties an opportunity to be heard on the
proposed amendments, the Commission held a public hearing at which
sa On July 31, 1946, the Commission by order approved the continnation ot Greene & Company in membership with W. F. Thompson acting as either a partner or employee. See

arguments were made both for and against the proposal. In an opinion dated September 19, 1945, the Commission, after a detailed exposition of the reasons for the proposed amendments and their implications, found that they were consistent with the statutory standards
and announced that it would not disapprove them."
On December 31, 1945, various members of the Association and a few
nonmembers filed a petition in the District Court for the Southern
District of New York to require the Commission to enter a formal order in connection with its determination not to disapprove the amendments, so that the petitioners might take an appeal to the Circuit
Court of .AJ>peals. After argument on a motion by the Commission to •

dismiss this petition for lack of jurisdiction in the District Court,
the petition was withdrawn.
Thereupon the same petitioners filed a
similar petition in the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
which was denied without opinion on March 9, 1946. The Commission
took the position that the statute did.not contemplate a formal order
when the Commission failed to exercise its veto power over amendments to the Association's rules.
As a result of these amendments and because of the Commission's
residual supervisory duties, a substantial number of cases may come
before the Commission on review of action by the association in denying membership to broker-dealers employing persons who are not qualified to be registered representatives.
UTIGATION UNDER THE ACf

During the past fiscal year the Commission instituted its first actions
for injunction based solely on violation of Regulation T, the margin
regulation promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. for certain categories of broker-dealers pursuant to Section 7 (c) of the Act. Effective February 5; 1945, the Board had increased the general margin requirement from 40 percent to 50 :percent;
. effective July 5, 1945, it was increased to 75 percent; and effective January 21, 1946, it was made 100 percent. On October 16, 194~ the Commission instituted three companion actions in the United l:'tates District Court at Cleveland. OJJ.eaction was against Butler, Wick &'00., a
New York Stock Exchange member house with offices in Youngstown,
Ohio; another against Hirsch & Oo., a member firm with offices in New
York and Cleveland; and the third against two firms jointly, the S. T.
Jackson & Co., Inc., an over-the-counter firm in Youngstown, and A. E.
Masten & Co., a member house in Pittsburgh which acted as correspondent of the Jackson firm in effecting transactions on the New
York Stock Exchange. Richard C. Brown, of Youngstown, and First
Mahoning Co., an Investment company controlled by Brown, were
named as defendants in all three of the actions." The charges in
these cases are that the first three broker-dealer firms repeatedly
violated Regulation T by overextensions of credit to Brown and his investment company; that the Masten firm overextended credit directly
to the.Jackson firm, its over-the-counter correspondent, and indirectly

1945, the court entered a final injunction against the Jackson firm by
default. On the same day the court entered preliminary injunctions
by consent in all three cases restraining Brown and First Mahordng
00. from inducing the four defendant firms or -any other brokerdealer to effect unlawful transactions of the types alleged in the complaints. At the close of the fiscal year Brown and First Mahoning .
Co. were in default of an answer, and the actions against the other
three broker-dealer firms were awaiting trial.
• In Securitiee and Ewaluunge Oommission v. Patriak A. TrajyptJ.
the Commission brought suit to enjoin a broker-dealer from selling
oil royalties at prices unrelated' either to his own contemporan~us
cost or to reasonable estimates of recoverable oil. Although this doctrine is to be newly tried in the courts~ the basis thereof has been laid
in quasi-judicial proceedings before the Commission. The Commission sought at the same time to enjoin Trapp, whose broker-dealer
registration had been previously revoked for fraud in connection
with the sale of such securities, from continuing to engage in the business of an over-the-counter broker-dealer without registration, and
from selling oil royalties by means of various misrepresentations.
The case was pending at the close of the fiscal year..
There were two cases in which the Commission sought mandatoryinjunctions to require registered broker-dealers to permit an examination to be made of their books and records pursuant to Section 17 (a)
of the Act and the Commission's bookkeeping rules. In the first case,
Seourities and Ewahange Oommission. v. Maurice A. Sharkey, the District Court for the Western District of Washington entered a sum_mary judgment of mandatory injunction on December 10, 1945. In

whether WIthdrawal from registration should be conditioned upon the

It was alleged that they had manipulated the market for the common
stock of Red Bank Oil Co. on the New York Curb Exchange while a
registration statement was pending under the Securities Act of 1933
with respect to a proposed offering of a large block of that stock "at
the market." On August 20,1945, the court denied the Commission's
motion for preliminary injunction."
The Commission's evidence that
the defendants' raising of the price on the Curb from 1%, to 2 would
increase the proceeds to them of the proposed offering by approximately $100,000 was not held to be sufficient evidence of a manipulative
purpose."
Instead of appealing from the denial of its motion for
preliminary injunction, the Commission decided to go to trial on the
merits, and the case was awaiting trial at the end of the fiscal year.
There were two civil actions during the year in which the C0111.mission obtained injunctions against various fraudulent practices by
broker-dealers. In Securities and Ewahange Oommission v. FiJrutMial
" Service, Inc., the District Court for the Southern District of Indiana,
on August 28, 1945, enjoined the defendant, a registered broker-dealer,
as well as Oscar F. Koenig, his wife, and Mrs. Mildr~d Martin, officers
and directors of the company, from soliciting and accepting funds and
orders from customers without disclosing to them that the firm was
insolvent. The defendants were enjoined at the same time from falsely
representing to customers the prices at which the firm effected purchases and sales, such misrepresentations having enabled the firm to
realize secret profits while acting as agent for Its customers,"
The
Commission also sought the appointment of a receiver, but the company succeeded in paying off its obligations to its customers and the
, request- was denied. In the second case, Securities and Exchange
(lommiesiotiv, Gilbert M. Bates, the defendant consented to the entry
of an injunction by the District Court for the Northern District of
Iowa restraining him from engaging in various fraudulent practices
(the effecting of purchases and sales at prices not reasonably related
to the market without disclosing that fact, taking secret profits by
effecting transactions with customers at prices fixed by the defendant
while he purported to act as their agent, and violating the confirmation requirements) as well as doing business as an over-the-counter
broker-dealer without registration.
Judicial review of Commission action under the Securities Exchange Act was sought ill two' cases, both discussed elsewhere in this
report. Norris & HirslWerg, Ino., v. S. E. 0., which is pending in the
United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, involves
a petition to review a Commission order revoking the petitioner's

Act of 1934.26 The second case involved the Commission's opinion

Civil Actions Instituted Under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934

The 1946fiscal year has witnessed a continuation of the ever-growing need to resort to the courts for injunctions under Rule X-10B-5
to protect investors. Rule X-10B-5, adopted pursuant to Section
10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, contains a general
prohibition against fraud ill the purchase or sale of securities through
certain channels. The violations which were enjoined during the
year generally involved combinations of situations where controlling
stockholders took advantage of investors in their companies by suppressing information relating to recent and sharp improvement ill
the volume of business, relating to increases in market value of port-s
folio securities, or other vital information.
These situations are
further examples of the need for preventative legislation asked for
- by the Commission in its report to the Congress of June 191 1946,
entitled "A Proposal to Safeguard Investors in Unregistered
Securities." 28
,
Violations of Rule X-10B-5 were sometimes coupled with infractions of other Sections of the Act as well as violations of the Securities
Act of 1933. For example, in S. E. O. v. Financial Seroiee, Ino., et
o1.~2JIand S. E. O. v. Gilbert M. Bates,so the Commission obtained final
judgments enjoining the defendants from violating the antifraud
provisions of the Securities Act as well as the antifraud sections of
the Securities Exchange Act.
In S. E. O. v. Boyd Transfer and Storage 00., et 01.81 the Commission obtained a judgment enjoining violations of the fraud provisions
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934in the purchase of the securities
of the company. The case involved false and misleading statements
in the acquisition of preferred stock regarding book value, net asset
value, and net earnings of the company as well as the benefits to be
received by the management (majority common stockholders) by the
retirement of the preferred stock issues.
In S. E. O. v. Albert M. Greenfield et o1.S2 the Commission instituted
an action charging that the defendants had violated the antifraud
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act in purchasing the deben- tures of Albert M. Greenfield & Co. It was charged that the defendants had made misleading statements regarding the market price,
and suppressed certain information, including the fact that the net
profits during 1944 and the sharply increased profits for the first 6
months ofi 1945 of Albert M. Greerifield & Co. were sufficient to pay

the defendants failed to disclose the identitY' of the purchaser and
the. market value of Albert M. Greenfield & Co.'s portfolio and that
the assets attributable to each outstanding debenture were substantially in excess of the price offered. The action was dismissed on the
Commission's motion upon the filing of a stipulation between the
parties in which defendants agreed to furnish audits of books for the
years 1944 and 1945 to the indenture trustee, to furnish copies of its

ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBUC UTILITY HOLDING
. COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was enacted for
the purpose of eliminating certain evils and abuses which the Congress
found to exist in connection with the activities of holding companies
having subsidiaries which are electric utility companies, or which are
engaged in the retail distribution of natural or manufactured gas. It
'was particularly designed to remove control of widely scattered utility
'properties from the hands of holding companies in large financial
centers and thus to afford to the operating companies the advantages of
localized management and to strengthen local regulation,
This objective finds its most direct expression in Section 11 of the Act. Section
11 (b) (1) 'requires the operations of holding company systems to be
limited to one or more integrated systems and to such additional businesses as are reasonably incidental-or economically necessary or appropriate to the operation of the integrated systems. Section 11 (b) (2)
requires elimination of undue complexities in corporate structures of
holding company systems and the redistribution of voting power
among their security holders on a fair and equitable basis. The Act
provides also for the registration of holding companies (Sec. 5) ;
regulation of security transaetions of holding companies and their
subsidiaries (Secs. 6 ana. 7) ; regulation of acquisitions of securities
and utility assets by holding companies and their subsidiaries (Secs.
9 and 10); regulation of sales of public utility securities or assets,
payment of dividends, solicitation. of proxies, intercompany loans and
other intra-system transactions' (Sec. 12); control of services, sales
and construction contracts (See, 13) ; and the control of accounting
practices (Sec. 15).
SUMMARY OF ACl'lVITIES

The volume of financing involved in applications and declarations
filed under Sections 6 and 7 considered by the Commission during the
1946 fiscal year surpassed that of any previous year. The aggregate
thereof, relating principally to subsidiaries of registered holding companies; involved security issues totaling $2,375,000,000 as compared
, with $1,305,000,000 during the 1945 year. There was also a substantial
increase in the number of cases filed involving matters looking toward
compliance with Section 11 and to give effect to the Oommission's
orders thereunder.
:'Further noteworthy progress was made during the past year rin
effectuating the requirements of the Act relating to integration and
corporate simplification.
During this period, registered holding CO)IlpinlBs 'disposed of nonretainable interests in 57 electric, gas, and
other subsidiary companies having total assets of appro~imately

$1,726,000,000.1 These inciuded 29 electric utility companies with
assets of $1,545,000,000; 8 gas utility companies with assets of
$22,000,000 and 20 other companies having assets of $159,000,000.
Section 11 orders were outstanding on June 30, 1946, requiring the
divestment of holding companies nonretainable interests in 122 subsidiary companies having aggregate assets of $3,352,000,000.
During the year the Commission instituted seven new proceedings -
 .
directing compliance with Section 11. A summary of proceedings
instituted by the Commission under Section 11 (0) which were still
pending at the close of the fiscal year follows:

Section 11 (e) of the Act authorizes the Commission to 'approve
voluntary plans of reorganization submitted by registered holding
companies and their subsidiaries. Prior to June 30, 1946, 167 such
plans had been filed. The Commission has approved 68 of these
plans, 28 were withdrawn or dismissed, 3 were denied; and 68 were
pending before the Commission in various stages of completion.
INTEGRATION AND CORPORATE SIMPUFICATION UNDER SECTION 11
Summary of Progress

As indicated in the. Tenth and Eleventh Annual Reports of the
Commission the integration" and simplification program has undergone
three phases of development.
The first phase, in which the public
utility industry was invited to offer voluntary proposals for complianc~ with Secti~n 11, had a lip1i~d success, due to failure of many compames to submit plans amounting to more than the preservation of
existing systems. In the second phase, the Commission issued orders
with respect to each holding company system directing compliance
and indicating in general terms the changes which the systems must
make to meet the geographical integration requirements of Section
11 (0) (1) and the corporate simplification and redistribution of voting power requirements of Section 11 (0) (2). With the exception
of a few minor problems, this phase is now complete. The third
phase has embraced the processing of voluntary plans for reor~ization or recapitalization filed by nearly all of the systems looking
toward compliance with the orders issued by the Commission under
Sections 11 (0) (1) and 11 (0) (2). This phase of the integration
program has been the center of attention during the recent period.
Divestment

and Simplification

'-

The fiscal year ending June 30, 1946, witnessed a sharp rise in the
market prices for utility securities, particularly common stocks, This
1Included in this figure Is $894,000,000, representing
assets of Pacl1lc Gas " Electric
Co., Which, during the year, ceased to be a subsidiary of a registered holding company.

TWELFl'R ANNUAL

REPORT

provided substantial impetus to the divestment by holding companies
of assets not retainable under the integration standards of Section 11

(b) (1).
During the year ended June 30,1946, the total consideration received
. by holding companies for their interests in subsidiaries divested and
for miscellaneous properties sold was $254,000,000 as compared with
$150,000,000 for 1945. Because of the fact that the interest disposed
of usually consisted of no more than the parent company's holdings
of common stock in the divested company, the total assets of the subsidiary company involved in the divestment are many times the consideration received.
Of particular significance among the divestments of the past year
have been the increased cash sales to underwriters for public distribution by holding companies seeking to dispose of the common stocks
of operating subsidiaries held in their portfolios.
Among these sales
during the past fiscal year were the following, all of which were sold
at competitive bidding:'

Also of interest is the recent distribution and sale of 2,000,000
shares of Cincinnati Gas & Electric Co. common stock through issuance of rights to the common stockholders of the holding company,
Columbia Gas & Electric Corp., combined with an underwriting of
the unsubscribed shares. Proceeds to the parent company resulting
from this transaction approximated $50,000,000. A number of other
important divestments have been effected by means of distribution of
subsidiary securities to security holders of the parent company in the
form of liquidating dividends.
Prior to June 30, 1946, holding companies' nonretainable interests
in 399 subsidiaries having aggregate assets of $6,073,000,000 had been

are no longer subject to the Holding Company Act. Integration orders outstanding at the end of the fiscal year require additional
divestments of interests in 123 subsidiaries with total assets of $3,354,000,000. The following table, which was prepared from the data contained in Appendix Table 20, gives a summary of the total divestment
program from December 1, 1935, to June 30, 1946:

Yoteworthy progress has also been witnessed in the simplification.
of corporate structures and redistribution of voting power of holding
company systems under Section 11 (b) (2). Because of the fact that
in many cases dissolution of unnecessary holding companies cannot
take place until a series of involved transactions has been consummated, it is difficult to provide a precise statistical measure of the
over-all simplification which has been achieved. The following table,
however, covering the period from June 15, 1938 to June 30, 1946,
indicates the sharp reduction which has taken place in the total
number of holding companies, and utility and nonutility subsidiary
companies subject to the Holding Company Act. This reflects the
simplification which has occurred as a result of compliance with both
the geographic integration requirements of Section 11 (0) (1) and
the corporate simplification requirements of.Section 11 (0) (2).

Interpretation

ANNUAL REPORT

-49

of Section 11

Recent inter£retations of the geographic integration requirements
of Section 11 (() (1) in the light of the definitions contained in Section 2 (at (29) have been of particular interest. In TeXlUJ Utilities
00., Holding Company Act Release. No. 6373, the Commission held
that the requirements of Section 10 precluded the acquisition of Dallas
Railway & Terminal Co. by Texas Utilities Co., a registered holding
company, in the absence of a showing of a substantial operating
relationship whicli would qualify the combination of electric and
transportation properties for retention under Section 11 (0) (1).
Two other cases contained important interpretations of the statutory limits of bigness of an integrated public utility system, as applied to electric companies. In American Gas &: Electric 00., Holdmg Company Act Release No. 6333, the Commission found that the
holding company's principal group of properties, which was known as
the Central System, constituted a single integrated public utility system within the meaning of Section 2 (a) (29). These properties, which
included gross electric utility plant of ap'proximately $443,000,000,
had gross operating revenues of approximately $102,000,000 and
served an area of approximately 901000 square miles in the States of
Michigan, Indiana, Ohio, West VIrginia, Virginia, Tennessee and
Kentucky.
The Commission noted, in particular, that practically
all of the power requirements of the central ~ystem were met by
its own electric generating stations, that the Central System had
a long historical record of having been developed and operated as a
highly coordinated system under the central control of the holding
company, that interchanges of energy among the component com.pantes were frequent and substantial, and that it did not blanket
the entire area, inasmuch as other important electric utility companies operated in the territory.
.
The Commission concluded that the Central System constituted
a single integrated system and that it did not appear to be so large
in any of the States in which it operated as to Impair the effectiveness of regulation.
Further, a relatively high degree of coordination
of the system~ utility facilities and its relatively economical operation
were demonstrated.
These characteristics were shown, in, part, to be
due to common control. In reaching this conclusion the important
distinction was made that the Qommission was not asked to approve
the creation of a new holding company over the Central System, but
merely to d~termine whether Section 11 (0 ~ (1) required the status
quo to be affected .. "Tt also observed that 'the Central System approaclies the maximum size which we believe is consistent with the
standards of localized management, efficient operation and effectiveness of regulation contained ill Sections 2 (a) (29) and 11 (0) (1)."
This limitation on the size of the Central System was clarified further in a subsequent case under Sections 9 and 10 of the Act, American
Gas & Electric 00., Holding Company Act Release No. 6639, in which
the Commission denied the application of American Gas & Electric
Co. for permission to acquire the common stock of Columbus & South/ern Ohio Electric Co. In its opinion, the. Commission noted that
~~tion 10, ~hich gove~s extensions of control, permits a new acquisition only If the Oommission can affirmatively find that such aequi122108-;41---3

sition will tend toward the creation of an integrated system as defined
in Section 2) (a) (29). Section 10 requires disapproval of such acquisition if the Commission finds that the acquisition will "tend -
towards . . . the concentration of control of public-utility companies,
of a kind or to an extent detrimental to the public interest or the
interest of investors or consumers." The marked difference-between
the standards of Sections 10 and 11, the Commission stated, "inheres
in the difference between Section 11, as a compromise of the policy
of 'elimination' of holding companies otherwise than as permitted by
the Act (Section 1 (c), and the 'new acquisition' standards of Section
10, which were designed as a more restrictive check: on further growth
of holding companies and further extension of their control."
The Commission concluded that .''the acquisition of Columbus and
Southern Ohio would not be merely the addition of a spur or connecting link to the system, but would represent a major extension into new
territory which very materially and very substantially enlarges the ,
system," and that it would extend the system beyond the maximum
limit deemed permissible in the earlier Section 11 (b) (1) determination of whether the statue quo should be affected.

There follows a brief summary of the status of the major holding
company systems at the' end of the fiscal year with respect to Section 11.
A resume of previously reported accomplishments is included together
with a fuller description of the principal steps taken during the current year.
1. ElectI:ic Bond and Share Company

The parent of this system, Electric Bond and Share Co. (Bond and
Share), controls five major subholding companies: Natibnal Power
& Light Co. (National) ; American Power & Light Co. (American);
Electric Power & Light Corp. (Electric) ; American & Foreign Power
Co., Inc. (Foreign Power); and American Gas and Electric Co.
(American Gas).
, Bond and Share has filed Plans I, II, and ill under Section 11 (e)
of the Act, setting forth a program for the retirement of its preferred
stocks and the divestment of an remaining public utility investments
in the United States," After receiving Securities and Exchange Com-mission and court approvals, Bond and, Share paid $30 per share as a
capital distribution on its outstanding preferred stocks and reduced
regular preferred dividends by 30 percent (subject to any adjustment
found by the Commission and approved by an appropriate court as
fair and equitable), thus consummating Plan J.8 Plan II-A was filed
in June 1946 and provided for an additional $70 per share capital distribution and the issuance of a certificate evidencing the further claim,
if any, of the preferred stockholders, the amount of such claim to be
made definite 1D a subsequent amendment to the plan.' In order to
-
raise the necessary cash for the capital distribution to thelreferred
stockholders, Bond and Share included as part of Plan IIthe proposal to sell its holding of the common stocks of American Gas.Penn• Holding Company Act Release Nil. 5970.

Co. (Carolina), an.d Birmingham Electric Co. (Birmingham);
After the commencement of Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings with
respect to Bond and Share and certain of its subsidiaries," the Commission ordered National to dissolve since it served no useful function
and constituted an undue and unnecessary complexity in the ~stem,fl
and indicated to National that.prior to any disposal of its holdings of
subsidiaries their accounts and corporate structures were to conform
to the requirements of the Act with respect to distribution of voting
power and other matters," Plans to this end were filed by National
and approved by this Commission with respect to Carolina," Binningham," and Pennsylvania,"
The State commission in each of these
cases; either alone or in conjunction with the Federal Power Commission, ordered the elimination from the companies' property accounts
of certain write-ups (Account 107) and the elimination or amortization of acquisition adjustment items (Account 100.5).
Under the settlement approved by the Commission in May 1946,
with respect to all suits. and claims against Bond and Share by or on
behalf of National and its subsidiaries and certain former subsidiaries," Bond and Share paid National and such other companies the
amount of $750,000. This settlement was subsequently approved by
the United States District Court; and in August 1946 National distributed the common stocks of Pennsylvania, Carolina, and Birmingham pro rata to its common stockholders.
Thus, Bond and Share,
which held 46 percent of National's common stock, received 46 percent
of the common stock so distributed.
With respect to National's only
remaini~
subsidiaries-Memphis
Generating Co., The Memphis
Street Railway Co., and Lehigh Valley Transit Co.- plans are pending for the reorganization and divestment of the first two companies,
while it is expected that a plan dealing similarly with Lehigh Valley
Transit will be filed shortly.
American and Electric, two of the other subholding companies,
were ordered to dissolve for reasons similar to those set forth for N ationlCl.12 These companies carried appeals to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the First Circuit, which affirmed the order
.of the Commission (141 Fed. (2d) 606). The companies' petition to
the. United 'States Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari was granted
and arguments were concluded on November 16, 1945. After the death
of Chief Justice Stone, the Court directed a reargument of the case
dur~
the-fall of 1946. Certain major steps taken by Electric and
Amencan and their subsidiaries in the ov.erall process of complying
with Section 11 are detailed below:
Under a Section 11 (e) plan approved by the Commission for American in November and December 1945, American retired approximately $36,400,000 principal amount of debentures,"

had originally proposed to. retire such debentures at 100 percent of

ant tv the Commission's findings and opinion, to provide for the
retirement of its debentures at 110 percent of principal amount plus
accrued interest and certain assumed debentures, noncallable until
1947, at 115 percent of principal amount plus accrued interest: The
plan, as amended, was subsequently enforced by an appropriate district court.
The Commission approved the formation by American in October
1945 of a new Texas holding company, which acquired from American
its interest in Texas Electric Service Co. and Texas Power & Light Co.
and from Electric' the latter's interest in Dallas Power & Light Co.
for a cash consideration of $17,350,000.14 The new holding company,'
Texas Utilities Co., was to be disposed of by American within 1year
from October 1945. During the fiscal year American disposed of its
interests in New Mexico Electric Service CO.15and Central .Arizona
Light and Power Co.16 Minnesota Power & Light CoP-and The Montana Power Co. underwent debt refundings, the latter company also
accomplishing an accounting reorganization."
A plan has also been filed by Electric under Section 11 (e) of the Act.
Under it Electric proposed an exchang~ offer of its holdings of the
common stock of Umted Gas Corporation for Its outstanding first
preferred stock," Thereafter, Bond and Share filed an alternative
plan, following which, in July 1946, Electric and Bond and Share
jointly filed a compromise plan." The latter plan provides for the
retirement of Electric's first and second preferred .stocks; for the
creation of a new southern electric holding company; and for the
transfer by Electric to, the new holding company of the common stocks
of Arkansas Power & Light Co., Louisiana Power and Light Co.,
Mississippi Power & Light Co. and New Orleans Public Service Co.
Electric's first and second preferred stockholders under the plan will
be offered a choice of (a) shares of United Gas Corporation, (b) shares
of the common stock of the new southern electric holding company,
or (0) cash. .Any portfolio securities not exchanged will be sold or
distributed by Electric. It is provided that, upon consummation of
all the above steps, Electric will withdraw its appeal from the Commission's dissolution order and dissolve. A compromise plan, on
which hearings were held after the close of the fiscal year, is now
pending before the Commission.
A Section 11 (e) plan-approved for Utah Power & Light-Co. provided that Utah would (a) recapitalize on a one-stock basis, the holders
of the outstanding publicly held stock to receive new common stock for
their holdings, (b) pay Electric $650,000 cash, (0) release Electric
from all claims in favor of Utah or any of its subsidiaries against
Electric and assign to Electric all claims 6f Utah and its subsidiaries
against Bond and Share or its-wholly owned subsidiaries.
In consideration of the foregoing, Electric surrendered to Utah for cancelation 3,000,000 shares of common stock and 2,100 shares of $7 preferred

subsequently enforced by the United States District Court for the
District of Utah. As a result of the reorganization, in addition to
having its capital structure improved, Utah was separated entirely
from the Bond and Share system.
Electric has disposed of Its interests in Dallas Railway & Termiual
Co., its remaining investments now consisting of its holdings of United
Gas Corp.'s common stock and the common stocks of the four companies which are proposed to be transferred to the new Southern
Electric Holding Co.
. Proceedings on an application filed by American Gas, requesting
approval of the continuance of its Central System together with
continuance of the alleged South Jersey and Northeast Pennsylvania
systems, were consolidated with Section 11 (b) (1) proceedings instituted by the Commission in 1939. Hearings were held from time
to time in such consolidated proceedings.
The Commission concluded
that properties comprising the Central System could be retained
under common control under the standards of Section 11 (b) (1) of
the Act but that other properties must be divested if such Central System were to be retained. In .April 1946, .American Gas sold at competitive bidding its holdings of the common stock of Scranton Electric
CO.,22leaving the Atlantic City Electric Co. to be divested in order
for .American Gas to meet fully the above-mentioned order.
On October 26, 1944, Foreign Power filed a plan of reorganization
under Section 11 (e) of the act in which Bond and Share joined.
Proceedings on the plan were consolidated by the Commission with
the proceedings directed to Bond and Share and Foreign Power under
section 11 (b) (2) of the .Act 23 and hearings were thereafter
held from time to time until July 8, 1946, on which date the
record in the proceedings was closed as to the necessity and fairness
of the plan. The staff of the Public Utilities Division is preparing
its Proposed Findings and Opinion for submission to the Commission,
following which the parties and participants will be given the opportunity to file counter-proposed findings and briefs, and to argue
orally before the Commission.
2. The North American Company

In Section 11' (b) (1) proceedings instituted with respect to The
North American Co. (North American}," the Commission directed
the company to confine its operations to a single integrated system
built around the Union Electric Company of Missouri. North .American appealed from the order to the United States Circuit Court of
.Appeals for the Second Circuit~ which court affirmed the order.2G
Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings have also been initiated with respect to

April 1, 1946, afflrming' the decision of the Circuit Court of Appeals
and sustaining the constitut.ionality of Section 11 (b) (1). -Th~reafter, North .American filed a plan pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the
Act providing for (a) disposition of the major portion of its interests
in four principal subsidiaries, (0) the formation' of a new company
to hold the securities of the Union Electric Company of Missouri system and lllinois Power Co., and (c) the formation of a new company'
to hold miscellaneous nonutility investments and residual investments
in certain utility properties.
Hearings have been held on certain
phases of the plan.
-

North American has continued its policy of paying common.stock
dividends in stock of Pacific Gas & Electric Co. In addition, it sold
700,000 shares of Pacific common stock in a public offering and used the
proceeds to retire its 6 percent preferred stock.29 Pacific Gas & Electric Co., as a result of North American's disposition of holdings therein,
has been declared.not to be a statutory subsidiary in the North American system. A Section 11 (e) plan was approved by the Commission
for Union Electric Co. of Missouri."
Two of Union's subsidiaries
were thereby eliminated and the company's corporate structure simplified. '.
.
The Commission entered an order of dissolution against Light and
Power, a subsidiary holding company of North American, but its
determination of a fair and equitable plan of dissolution has been
delayed by consideration of the disposition of claims asserted by
lllinois Power Co., a subsidiary of Light and Power. Extensive hear- ,
ings have been held on these claims and briefs and reply briefs have
been submitted.
The assets of lllinois Traction Co., a former subsidiary of Light
and Power, have been transfered to Light and Power in the course of
dissolution pursuant to the provisions of a Section 11 (e) plan) which
was approved by the Commission 31 and affirmed by the United States
District Court for the District of Maine on December 19, 1945.
3. The United Gas Improvement Company

.

After Section 11 (0) (1) proceedin~ were instituted with respect to
the United Gas Improvement Co. (U. G. I.), its integrated system was
defined 1?ythe Commission as the electric properties in the Pennsylvania-Delaware-Maryland
area, and orders of divestment were issued
on the basis of this interpretation.w
The company appealed these
orders to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit, which court sustained the orders." Voluntary plans under
Section 11 (e) were filed by U. G. I. and its subsidiary, Philadelphia.
Electric Oo., after argument before the court but prior to the Issuance
of its decision. The plan provided for the distribution to It G. '1:

of its interests in three additional companies, namely, Nashville Gas
and Heating Co.," Arizona Power Corp.," and Manchester Gas CO.31
Pursuant to another Section 11 (e) plan filed on December 6, 1945
and designed to effect further compliance with the requirements of Section 11, U. G. I. exchanged, for approximately 750,000 shares of its outstanding capital stock, Its portfolio holdings of securities of four public
utility liol~
companies, namely,.AmerlCan Water Works and Electric Co., Inc., '1'he Commonwealth & Southern COr{).,Niagara Hudson
Power Corp., and Public Service Corporation of New Jersey. These
securities-had a market value at that time of approximately $23,146,- .

M;ay 16,1946, U. G. I. filed a declaration concerning the sale of its hold~
ings of the preferred stocks of Kansas City Gas Co. and The Wyandotte County Gas Co. (subsidiaries of Cities Service Co.) to each of
these companies for a total consideration of $5,150,000. Since the
close of the fiscal year, the Commission permitted the declaration to
become effective 39and, the sale was consummated.
4. The Commonwea~th &' Southern Corpo~tion

In the Section 11 (b) (1) and (2) proceedings which were instituted and consolidated with respect to this system, the Commission
directed the Commonwealth & Southern Corp. (Commonwealth) to
reduce its outstandinz preferred and common stocks to a single class
of new common stOCK. The Commission's order was appealed by
the company to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit,
and affirmed by the court:1O
Commonwealth's initial plan of recapitalization provided for the
reclassification- of its stock into a new class of common stock and a
distribution of its holdings' of the common stock of' Consumers Power
Co. to Commonwealth stockholders. An amended plan was later
filed 'which proposed a change in the allocation between Commonwealth preferred and common stockholders as well as the distribution of Its holdings in its other Northern subsidiaries in addition to
Consumers Power Co. After the conclusion of hearings on the
amended plan the Commission issued its findings and opinion stating
that if the plan were amended in certain respects, it would be approved.v The requested amendments were filed' and the Commission
on June 30, 1945, entered its order .approving the amended plan,"
Among the provisions of this amended plan was the requirement that
the plan receive the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
each class of Commonwealth's stock before the Commission applied to
an appropriate Federal district court for an order approving and
enforcmg the plan. Following the passage of several months WIthout

comJ?any delete that portion requiring a stockholders' vote. Modifications of its plan, filed by Commonwealth on November 1}, 1945,
provided for the elimination of a stockholders' vote if the Commission
would approve an extensive amendment of the plan which would
essentially alter it.
On January 24, 1946, the Commlssion issued a memorandum opinion
in which it stated that, in addition to the difficult questions of fairness
posed by the changes suggested, the complicated and confusing nature
of the modifications did not merit the scheduling of hearings. Further
proceedings were withheld for a period of 60 days to March 25, 1946, in
order to afford an opportunity to Commonwealth and to any Person

5. Cities Service Company

On May 5, 1944, the Commission issued its order in the Section 11
(b) (1) proceeding involving Cities Service Co. (Cities), the top
company of a system.44 The order directed Cities to comply with
Section 11 (b) (1) by reducing the operations of its system to certain
gas distribution properties located in the midcontinent section, together with certain gas production and transmission properties. The
order, however, permitted the retention of the system's nonutility
properties if Cities should choose to comply with Section 11 (b) (1) by
disposing of all its direct or indirect interest in utility companies.
Cities elected to retain its nonutility properties, whereupon the Commission, on October 12, 1944, entered a supplemental order' providing
in substance, that Cities might dispose of its interests in utility I>roperties in lieu of complying with the provisions of the earlier order.45
Since the original order, Cities has disposed of its interest in 39 sub.
sidiaries 46 and has been engaged in a program of refinancing certain
subsidiaries preparatory to a divestment of its interest in Cities Service
Power & Light Co.
The order of May 5, 1944, also directed Arkansas Natural Gas Corp.,
a subsidiary holding company of Cities, to confine its operations to
the natural gas business and to dispose of its interests in its 'nonutility
subsidiaries. On appeal by Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., the United
States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, sustained the
order of the Commission.v

order. The trustees have divested themselves of most of the companies
cited in the order, so that as at June 30, 1946, only eight of the companies cited are still in the system. The companies which are still
retained consist of five nonutility companies, one utility holding company, and two operating utilities. Plans have been proposed, for distribution, sale or liquidation of such remaining companies.

Carolina Electric & Gas Corp. Following the close of the fiscal Jear
Gengas distributed its remaining holdings to the common stockholders
of its parent and dissolved.
On April 24, 1944, Gengas, Georgia Power and Light Co., a subsidiary of Gengas, and Florida Power Corp., an associate of, Georgia,
filed a joint plan proposing, among other things, the recapitalization
of Georgia. The proposarl included the donation by Florida to Georgia of $1,400,000 in cash to be used in part for the reduction of the
mortgage debt of Georgia and for a cash payment in the amount of
$150 per share in full satisfaction of the claims of the public holders
of preferred stock of Georgia for par value and arrearages.

trustees of Ageco and Agecorp and a subsidiary company in the Associated system instituted proceedings in both a State and Federal court
asserting claims against N egea arising from various transactions in
the years 1930 and 1932. It appeared to the Commission that before
a determination could be made with respect to the recapitalization of
Negea, the validity and rank of the asserted claims would have to be
resolved, The Commission, therefore, instituted. further proceedings
with respect to these claims," On March 29,1945, Negea filed a plan
of recapitalization pursuant to the provisions of Section 11 (e) .68
During the course of the hearings on this plan, extended discussions
were held among the interested parties, including committees representing holders of New England debentures and first preferred shares.
These discussions resulted in the filing by New England of an amended
plan dated March ~1, 1946, which was supported by all interested
parties and the committees. The stated purpose of the amended plan
~ was to effectuate the provisions of Section 11 (b) (2) and the settlement of the various controversies referred to above, After hearings,
the Commission, on June 24, 1946, issued its order approving the
amended plan." By order dated July 17, 1946, the District Court
for the District of Massachusetts approved and ordered enforcement
of the amended plan.

Standard Gas and Electric Co. (Standard Gas) and their subsidiaries,
following which Section 11 (b) (2) proceedings were instituted with
respect to Standard Power. After subsequent hearings, the Commission issued an order requirine; the liquidation and dissolution of
Standard Power."
A dissolution plan for Standard Power was approved by the Commission on February 22,1945.11

to this plan were consolidated with the Section 11 (b) (1) proceedings.
After hearings and oral argument, the Commission issued -its findings
and opinion, stating that it could not make the findings necessary for
approval of the plan." An amended plan subsequently submitted by
Standard Gas was approved by the Commission."
.A~ the request o.f Standard G:as, application was ma?e ~y the ComJlllSSIOnto the United States District Court- for the DISt1'lCt of Delaware for an order of enforcement of the- amended plan. The district
court withheld approval of the plan on the basis that note and debenture holders were not being paid off in cash.
Approval was given, however, to the proposed allocation among
stockholders.
The Commission, Standard Gas, and several other
parties to the proceedings appealed from the district court's decision
to the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit.
The latter court's decision, rendered on September 14, 1945, reversed
the district court and upheld the Commission's finding that the
amended plan was fair and equitable to the note and debenture holders.
Subsequently, Standard Gas filed a motion with the district court
requesting an order of the court disapproving the amended plan for
recapitalization as unfair and inequitable because of changed conditions. The company's motion also Stated that it proposed first to
borrow money with which, together with treasury cash, to call the
notes and debentures and, secondly, to :payoff bank notes then outstanding by the sale of portfolio securities, Such right of Standard
Gas to call the notes and debentures was upheld in a decree of the

On January 2, 1946, the Commission applied to the United States
District Court (Minnesota) for enforcement of the plan. Subsequent to this application for enforcement, but prior to the date set
-for hearing, the Coinmission received numerous objections to enforcement of the plan and received suggested amendments by stockholders
who stated that changed conditions made modification of the plan
necessary. At the Commission's request the court granted a continuance for the purpose of considering the alternative plans. Hearings have been held thereon, briefs filed, oral argument heard and the
matter is now before the Commission for decision.
Proceedings on the plan of recapitalization filed pursuant to Section

The Middle West Corporation

_

In connection with Section 11 (b) (1) proceedings with respect to
The Middle West Corp: (Middle West) and its subsidiaries, the
Commission ordered Middle West to sever Its relations with Its
subsidiary companies, e~cel?t Central Illinoi~ Public ~e~vic~
(Cips) and Kentucky Utilities Co. (KU)!I'~d Its subsidiaries, JU~lSdiction being reserved with respect to the [oint retarnability of Oips,
KU and such interest as Middle West might obtain in Public Service
Co. of Indiana, Inc. in connection with the reorganization of Midland
United Co. and its subsidiaries,"
On May 9, 1944, a further hearing was ordered to permit the introduction of additional evidence with respect to the question of which
properties constituted the integrated system of Central and South
West Utilities Co. (Central) and with respect to the retainability of
certain other businesses. On February 16, 1945 91and July 4, 1945 92
the Commission entered its opinions and orders with respect to the
issues involved in the rehearing, finding that the major electric utility
properties of the subsidiaries of Central form a single integrated
system retainable by Central. The electric utility properties of Oklahoma Power and Water Co., a subsidairy of Middle West, were found
to constitute a part of Central's integrated system. Central was
ordered to dispose of its interest in its retail gas distribution properties as well as its interests in certain small isolated electric properties
and was further ordered to dispose of its interest in certain of its
nonutility properties.
Nearly all of the nonutility properties and
all of. the isolated electric properties have been disposed of in compliance with these orders. Orders were entered by the Commission
approving refinancing of Public Service Co. of Oklahoma and Central
Power and Light CO., both subsidiaries of Central, on October 8,
194593 and December 13 1945,9~ respectively.
_
Middle West acquir;d approximately 20 percent of the common
stock of Public Service Co. of Indiana, Inc., in the reorganization of
Midland United Co. and its subsidiaries and, on August 23,_1945, a
hearing was ordered concerning, among other things, the questions
reserved by the Commission in its previous order regarding the retainability by Middle West of its interests in Cips, KU, and Public
Service Co. of -Indiana, Inc. and raising issues as to the continued
existence of Middle West. Hearings have been held but are not yet
completed. On September 5, 1945, the. Commission approved the
sale of the gas and water properties of Public Service Co. of Indiana,
Inc. to Indiana Gas and Water-Co., a newly formed subsidiary, preparatory to disposal of such interest by Public Service."
Central and American Public Service Co. (American), two subsidiaries of Middle West, filed a joint application proposing a consolidation of the two companies. The Commission instituted proceedings
under Section 11 (b) (2) and ordered that the hearings on the two _
cases be consolidated. The proponents of the plan of consolidation
contended that preferred stock was necessary in the new company in
order to preserve the priorities of the holders of the prior lien and

The Commission ruled that the new corporation could have only common stock.llS The respondents filed a petition for review in the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia, which upheld
the order of the Commission."
Thereafter, Central and American
filed an amended plan of merger to be effectuated through the issuance
of a single class of capital stock. The plan also provided that Middle
West would distribute to its stockholders the new shares of Central
allocated to Middle West. On March 11, 1946 the plan was further
amended, primarily with respect to a proposal to sell common stock
of the merged company at competitive bidding in an amount sufficient
to retire the publicly-held preference stocks of the two companies at
their call prices, subject to the right of the holders of such stocks to
exchange their shares under specified conditions for common stock of
the new company. It was proposed that the remainder of.such stock
be issued in exchange for the publicly-held common stock and 'for
the preference and common stocks held by Middle West. The plan
was approved by the Commission on April 30, 1946,98and enforcement
was ordered on June 19, 1946 by the United States District Court for
the District of Delaware."
The sale of the common stock of the
merged company at competitive bidding had not been consummated
at the end of the fiscal year.
Proceedings pursuant to Section 11 (b) (2) raised issues as to the
equitable distribution of voting power among security holders of the
North West Utilities Co. (North West) system, and also as to the
continued existence of North West, a subsidiary holding company in
the Middle West system. The proceeding was consolidated with a
plan of recapitalization of North West which had been submitted by
North West and Middle West. After hearings, the Commission held
that the proposed plan of recapitalization fell short of effectuatin~ the
provisions of Section 11 (b) and ordered that Nortli West be liquidated,' Sale by North West of its subsidiary Northwestern Public
Service Co., was' approved by the Commission on March 28, 1946.2
, Recapitalization of North West's other subsidiary, Wisconsin Power
and Light Co. (Wisconsin), was approved on October 26, 1945, preparatory to its disposal," A plan was filed by North West on April
22, 1946, proposing to distribute the common stock of Wisconsin held
by North West to the public preference stockholders of North West in
an amount, as determmed by competitive bidding, equal to the liquidating value plus accrued dividends of such preference stock and to
'distribute the balance of such common stock to its parent, Middle
_West. Hearings have been held on the plan, but no decision has been
entered by-the Commission with respect thereto.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHAN:.GE COMMISSJON

_

Commission under the standards of Section 11. 4:n important step
towards liquidation involved the distribution of the common stock of
The United Light and Railways Co. (Railways), to preferred 'and
common stockholders of United Light. The Commission disapproved
the distribution orginally proposed by the company but thereafter
approved the plan as amended to allow the preferred stockholders
approximately 95 percent of Railways common stock," On -June 30,
1943, Judge Leahy, of the United States District Court of Delaware,
entered an order enforcing the plan (51 F. Supp. 217) and on. April
10, 1944, the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit affirmed the order (142 F. (2d) 411). A petition for-certiorari
to the United States Supreme Court was granted on June 12, 1944
(322 U. S. 724). On January 29,1945, the Supreme Court rendered
its decision affirming the .Commission's approval of the I?lan. Following this decision, United Light accomplished its liquidation and
dissolution in compliance with the Commission's initial orders," Railways, which has two subsidiary holding companies, American Light
, & Traction Co. (American Light), and Continental Gas & Electric
Corp. (Continental), thus became the top holding company in the
system.
On June 2, 1945,1 the Commission issued a memorandum opinion,
concluding that the most appropriate means for achieving compliance
with its order requiring Railways to dispose of its interests in certain
subsidiaries was the liquidation and dissolution of America.n Light
and the disposition by Railways of all securities received by it in such
liquidation.
To accomplish this, American Light on July 2, 1945,
filed an amended plan of liquidation and dissolution,
ThIS is to be
accomplished by a retirement of its preferred stock by a cash payment
to the holders thereof and by a pro rata distribution of the remaining
assets to the common stockh.olders. This liquidation was held necessary to e:ffectmite the provisions of Section 11 (b), since the continued
existence of such company served no useful purpose. The principal
point at issue in this plan relates to the amount which should be paid ,
to the holders of the company's noncallable 6 percent preferred stock.
After hearings and oral argument the majority of the Commission
concluded that the plan providing for the retirement of the 6 l?ercent
noncallable cumulative preferred stock by payment of cash equivalent
to the liquidating preference of such stock, i.
$25 a share, could not
be found fair in that it did not provide the equitable equivalent of the
investment value of the liquidated stock," It was held that $33 peJ,"
share would represent such investment value of the stock and -that the
plan ~ust be so amended to be fair and equitable. Before such au'
amendment was filed, changes occurred in the membership of the-Commission and a motion for a reconsideration of this point was granted,"
Reargument was heard August 27, 1946, and the matter has been taken
under advisement.

'
In May 1946 Continental sold its interest in Columbus and Southern
Ohio Electric Co., represented by 744,455 shares of common stock, to
underwriters at competitive bidding. Proceeds to Continental aggregating $38,115,352 were used to retire $20,000,000 principal amount
of 1% percent secured I-year notes and the balance of the proceeds
were applied to the prepayment of its $30,000,000 principal amount of
2% percent unsecured lO-year notes,"
13. American Water Works and Electric Company, Inc.

This was the first registered holding company to file a corporate
simplification plan pursuant to Section 11 (e). The plan contemplated
no divestments of any of the utility properties or utility investments
of the system, but did provide for the elimination of several "second. degree" holding company relationships and for certain other intrasystem readjustments.
Consummation- of the main features of the
plan was contingent upon the-accomplishment of extensive refinancing.
The Commission approved the plan, with various modifications and
reservations, holding that the applicant's interests in certain agricultural properties in California and in an office building in New York
were not retainable, and that the distribution of voting power in the
system was not fair and equitable; it reserved jurisdiction with respect
to the retention of American's interest in a water subholding company
to afford it an opportunity to increase its equity therein and to recapitalize it; and also reserved for future consideration the question of
adjustments of write-ups of- system properties and investments,"
Since the date of'this order, American has sold the agricultural
properties and the office building referred to above; has voluntarily
disposed of a portion of its interests in transportation, bridge, and
water businesses; has eliminated or arranged for the disposition of
certain write-ups in the property accounts of its electric and gas
subsidiaries; and has effected some of the intrasystem adjustments
required. There are- presently pending before the Commission two
plaas to bring a major portion of the American system into conformity
wifh the requirements of Section 11. One of these plans proposes the
divestment by American of substantially all the water properties of
the system through the consolidation of these properties under a single
water works holding company whose securities would be held outside
the .American system; the other plan proposes the Iiquidation of
American itself, leaving The West Penn Electric Co. as the top holding
company for all the subsidiaries of American other than those which
to be divested. These plans are to be followed by other plans relating to the corporate structure of The West Penn Electric Co. and

SECURITIES' AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

14. Engineers Public Service Company

In Section 11 (b) (1) proceeding regarding Engineers Public Service Co. (Engineers) and its subsidiaries, the Commission ordered Engineers to dispose of its interest in Puget Sound Power & Light Co. and
The Key West Electric Co. The Commission initiated Section 11 (b)
(2) proceedings with respect to a subsidiary of Engineers, The Western
Public Service Co. (Western), a Maryland corporation."
Subseqnently, the Commission approved the sale of Western's Nebraska and
South Dakota properties.> Western then redeemed its publicly held
'securities and liquidated."
The Commission ordered the divestment
of the remaining properties in the Engineers system except the electric
utility properties of Virginia Electric and Power Co., allowing Engineers, however, 15 days within which to petition for leave to retain
instead the electric utility properties of Gulf States Utilities Company.16 Engineers appealed to the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia, which on November 22,1943 rendered an
opinion upholding the Commission's order in most respects but setting
it aside upon the ground that the Commission had misinterpreted the
so-called in'pidental business clause of Section 11 (b) (1). The
Court indicated also that Engineers must be given a further right to'
designate the principal integrated utility system which it desired to
retain. Both Engineers and the Commission filed petitions for writs
of certiorari in the Supreme Court of the United States. On June 5,
1944, the petitions were granted.
Oral arguments were made before
the Supreme Court in November, 1945. Because of the death of Chief
Justice Stone, there was lack of a quorum of Justices and the matter
was placed on the Court's calendar for reargument during the fall of
1946.
.
Engineers has divested itself of its interest in Puget Sound Power &
Light Co., The Key West Electric Co., EI -Paso Natural Gas Co., EI .
Paso & Juarez Traction Co., Baton Rouge Bus CQ., The North Kansas
Power Co., Missouri Service Co., Savannah Electric & Power Co., and
the transportation

for the divestment of its interest in two of its public utility subsidiary
companies, namely, Gulf States Utilities Co. and EI Paso Electric Co.
(Texas), the two remaining subsidiaries of Engineers ordered divested
by the Commission. The plan thereafter contemplates the liquidation
and dissolution of Engineers.
Hearings have been concluded on the
plan as amended. Oral argument was heard before the Commission on
September 5, 1946 and disposition of the. matter is being considered,

existing capitalization to one class of stock and cease to be a holding
company."
On' June 27, 1944, United filed another plan pursuant to Section 11
(e) which provided for the exchange of substantially all of its holdings of the common stocks of Philadelphia Electric Co. and Delaware
Power & Light Co. (Delaware), plus cash for approximately one-half
of - its outstanding preferred stock.18 The plan was subsequently
amended to provide for the exchange of only the Philadelphia Electric
Company common stock and an increased amount of cash. The plan,
as amended, was approved by the Commission on November 24, 194419
and has since been consummated.
_On January 17, 1945, United filed a plan pursuant to Section 11 (e)
providing for tbe exchange on a voluntary basis of two shares of the
common stock or Delaware and $5 in cash for outstanding shares of
United's $3 cumulative preferred stock. The plan was subsequently
amended to provide for the payment of $6 in lieu of the $5 in cash
as originally proposed. The J?lan, as amended, was approved by the
Commission on June 9, 1945; and has also been consummated.
. During the fiscal year, United disposed of a portion of its holdings
of Columbia Gas & Electric Corp. common stock ~y sales in the market
and tendered to The United Gas Improvement Co. (UGl) a portion
of its holdings of common stock of that company pursuant to the exchange plan described previously (under the heading, "The United
Gas Improvement Co."). As a result of this plan United's interest
in the common stock of UGl was reduced to approximately 8 percent of
such stock outstanding.
Since the close of the fiscal year, United filed
a declaration, which the Commission permitted to become effective, to
purchase in the open market its preferred stock in an amount not to
exceed $5,000,000.
On June 12, 1946, the Commission instituted proceedings under
Sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) with respect to Public Service
Corp. of New Jersey (Public Service), a subsidiary of United, and
all of its subsidiaries.
Since the close of the fiscal year, Public Service

plan provided, among other things, that Midland Realization and Midland Utilities would merge, and that such merged company would
liquidate its assets expeditiously,
On March 14, 1946, a proposed
modification of the plan was filed pursuant to Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act and Section 11 (f) of the Holding Company Act, wherein
the requirement of the merger of Midland Realization and Midland
Utilities was to be eliminated. In lieu thereof, the liquidation of the
two companies was to be accomplished by a distribution to the public
holders of the two reorganized companies of most of the shares of
the common stock of their principal subsidiary, Northern Indiana
Public Service Co., the sale of the balance of such stock through a
public offering, and the distribution, as a liquidating dividend, of the
remaining assets consisting of treasury cash and the cash proceeds to
be realized from the sale of their interest .in the only remaining subsidiary, Indiana Service Corp. (Indiana Service)."
After the close
of the fiscal year, both the Commission and the reorganization court
approved the proposed modification.
A plan of corporate simplification for Indiana Service was filed
by its parent, Midland Utilities, on October 29, 1945, under Section
11 (e) of the Act. On May 7, 1946, an amendment was filed thereto
providing for the elimination from the security structure of Indiana

It further provided for the elimination of the present preferred and
common stocks; the issuance of new common stock; the sale of such
new common stock to American Gas and Electric. Co., a subsidiary of
Electric Bond and Share Co.; and the distribution of the proceeds
:herefrom to Midland Utilities and the preferred stockholders of
Indiana Service. Hearings were held and the matter was pending at

17. New England Public Service Company

The Commission issued a Section 11 (b) (2) order with respect to
New England Public Service Co. (NEPSCO) directing it to recapitalize on a one-stock basis or to liquidate .. Soon thereafter the company filed a plan for the stated purpose of complying with the applicable provisions of Section 11 of the ACt. One public utility company

18. Federal Water and Gas Corporation

On December 31, 1942 proceedings were instituted by the Commission with respect to Federal Water and Gas Corp. (Federal) and
its subsidiaries under Sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2). The Federal
system at that time consisted of a number of utility and nonutility
companies conducting water, natural gas transmission and distribution, manufactured gas distribution, and electric operations in a
number of widely separated States. Federal's principal subsidiary
was, and is, Southern Natural Gas Co., a registered holding company
controlling four gas utility subsidiaries in Alabama, one in Mississippi
and one in Tennessee, and directly owning and operating a natural
gas 'pipeline extending :from Texas into Georgia. Southern Natural's
utilIty subsidiaries in Mississippi and Tennessee (Mississippi Gas Co.
and Chattanooga Gas Co., respectively) were formerly controlled
directly by Federal, but were sold by Federal to Southern Natural in
June 1946 pursuant to Federal's Section 11 (e) plan." This plan also
provided, among other things, for the distribution of Federal's interest in Southern Natural to Federal's stockholders and for the elimination of Federal as a separate corporation, as to which provisions the
Commission reserved jurisdiction. The plan also provided for the
disposition by Federal of its interests in all its other subsidiary companies, provided~owever, that before disposing of its security hold
ings in Peoples water and Gas Co., Scranton-Spring Brook Water
Service Co., and New York Water Service Corp., these companies be
recapitalized. The Commission approved the latter provisions of
Federal's plan and directed that steps be taken to carry out those
provisions," In addition, Federal, Pennsylvania. Water Service Co.,
and Scranton-Spring Brook were directed to cause the elimination of
Pennsylvania Water Service Co. and the 63 inactive subsidiaries of
Scranton-Spring Brook. Federal has caused the elimination of 62

Water Service Co. After extensive hearings, Federal's plan for the
recapitalization of Scranton-Spring Brook was approved by the Commission in March 1946.29 Federal is under obligation to dispose of
its holdings of Scranton's new common stock received by Federal as
a result of the recapitalization. Hearings have been completed on
Federal's plan for the reorganization of New York Water, and this
matter "isnow pending before the Commission.
. Federal itself was recapitalized in 1941. One aspect of that reorganization, relating to the Commission's decision therein that officers and directors of Federal should not be permitted to profit on
securities of Federal purchased by them during the pendency of the
reorganization, was appealed to the Supreme Court, which set aside
the Commission's order and remanded it to the Commission." In
February 1945 the Commission issued its findings, opinion and order
reaffirming its previous determination. Sl This order was reversed by
the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in
February 1946,82 whereupon the Commission petitioned for a writ of
certiorari which was granted by the United States Supreme Court
in May 1946.
19. Ogden Corporation

Ogden Corporation (Ogden) is a successor corporation to Utilities
Power & Light Corp. which went.into bankruptcy in 1937. A plan
of reorganization approved by this Commission provided, among other
things, that Ogden would divest itself of all its interests in utility
companies." Section 11 proceedings were instituted with respect to
Ogden by the Commission and were consolidated with a Section 11 (e)
plan of Ogden. .The Commission approved certain provisions of
the Ogden plan and ordered Ogden to divest itself of all its interests
in public utility companies and eliminate itself as a public utility
holding company." Ogden has divested itself of its interests in
Derby Gas & Electric Corp., Missouri Natural Gas Co., The Laclede
Gas Light Co. (Laclede), and Missouri Electric Power Co., which
represent all of its interests in utility properties except those of Interstate Power Co. (Interstate) and certain residual assets of Central
States Power and Light Corp. (Central States). Preliminary to
Ogden's divestment of its interest in Laclede, the latter company
underwent a thorough-going reorganization in conformity with the
provisions of Section 11 (b) (2).85 Hearings have been held on a
plan for the reorganization of Interstate and the divestment of
Ogden's interest therein, such plan providing for the company's reorganization while leaving for later determination the question as to
whether Ogden's holdings in Interstate should be subordinated, ill
whole or in part, to Interstate's publicly held debentures and preferred stocks. Hearings are in progress on a plan for the distribution

20. Long Island Lighting Company

On October 25, 1945, Long Island Lighting Co. and three of its
public utility subsidiary companies, Queens Borough Gas and Electric Co., Nassau & Suffolk Lighting Co., and Long Beach Gas Co.,
Inc., jointly filed a comprehensive plan under Section 11 (e) of the
Holding Company Act proposing the consolidation of the four companies, the recapitalization of the resultant consolidated company, and
the distribution of the preferred and common stocks of the recapitalized consolidated corporation to the public security holders of the
constituent companies. On November 9,1945, the Commission instituted proceedings pursuant to Section 11 (b) (2) with respect to each
of the companies and consolidated the proceedings,"
Testimony in
the consolidated proceedings was taken from time to time and the
hearing was closed subsequent to the end of the fiscal year.

The past year witnessed a continuation of the heavy debt refunding
progrlPll which has been in progress for the last decade. Many
utility companies refunded for a second time, as interest rates declined to new low ground. Until J !lnuary 1, 1946, tax considerations
facilitated these refunding operations since many of the companies
were in excess profits tax brackets and could reduce their net income
subject to excess profits tax by the amount of unamortized discount
and expense and call premiums applicable to the refunded issues.
After VJ-day the prospect of termination of the excess profits tax
further stimulated these refundings, with the result that very heavy
offerings were made during the fall of 1945. In October, alone,
approximately $210,000,000 of debt security issues were approved
under Sections 6 (b) and 7.
During the year, utility bond issues were sold on the lowest interest
cost basis since the passage of the Act. For example, in February 1946,
Madison Gas and Electric Co., sold at competitive bidding $4,500,000
principal amount of 30-year, first mortgage, 2% percent bonds at an
interest cost of 2.427 percent. Sixteen bids were received for these
bonds, 15 of which provided an interest cost of less than 2.50 percent.
Other high-grade issues such as those of Gulf States Utilities Co.,
Philadelphia Electric Power Co., and Wisconsin Electric Power Co.,
involving amounts from $27,000,000 to $50,000,000, were sold at interest costs between 2.50 percent and 2.60 J?ercent. Preferred stocks were
likewise sold on a very favorable baSIS during the year, the cost of
money in some instances approaching 3.30 percent.
COMPETITIVE BIDDING

Reflecting the volume of refunding during the 1946 fiscal year as
well as the growth in dispositions of portfolio securities under Section 11, the amount of securities sold. under the competitive bidding
requirements of Rule U-50 was nearly as large as the combined volume
during the four preceding years of the Rule's history. A ,total of
83 issues amounting to $1,642,000,000 was sold during the-1946 fiscal
year, bringing the total since May 7,1941, the effective date of Rule
U-50, to $3,486,440,000, comprising 185 issues.

.Aside from the increased number of issues submitted to competitive
bidding by reason of the influences mentioned above, the process of
competitive bidding has also been extended irr two distinct fields.
In November 1943, for example, the Commission considered it necessary to exempt £rom Rule U-50 the sale of $21,000,000 of Public Service
Co. of Colorado common stock because of the size of the issue and
because there were at that time few precedents for gauging public
acceptance under competitive bidding of such a common stock offering.
Prior to July 1, 1945, as a consequence, only eight issues of common
stock amounting to $47,734,000 had been sold at competitive bidding.
In contrast, the past fiscal year has seen 16 common stock issues, aggreg!lting $215,787,000, sold under Rule U-50.
These issues included
$38,115,000 of Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Co. common stock during May and $51,468,000 of Dayton Power and Light
Co. common stock in the month of June.
'
A second extension in the practice of competitive bidding has
occurred in connection with exchange offers on preferred stock. In
these cases, generally speaking, the holders of the old preferred stock
are given the right to exchange their holdings for new preferred stock
and an underwriting commitment is secured to cover any unexchanged
shares; sometimes, in addition, the underwriters assist in solicitmg
the exchange of the old preferred for the new. The development of
competitive bidding in this field was based upon experience with the
refinancing of preferred stocks by a variety of methods. During the
year the Commission approved a direct exchange offer without underwriting by Cities Service Power & Light CO.,41an exchange offer
coupled with underwriting by Columbia Gas & Electric Corp.," and
a reclassification of outstanding preferred stock pursuant to a vote of
stockholders by Rochester Gas and Electric Corp. <l3 In the case of
Columbus and Southern Ohio Electric Co.,<1<1
it was announced that in
future exchange offers the Commission would require as a minimum
that bids for effecting exchanges under dealer-manal:fer arrangements
should be requested at least £rom a selected group of mvestment banking or other agencies qualified to perform the services involved,"
After considerable study of the general problem of competitive bidding on preferred stock issues, the Commission in Oklahoma Gas and
Electric 00: announced its VIew that, as a matter of future policy,
preferred stock issues under the Holding Company Act. should ordinarily be submitted to competitive bidding whether or not they involve
exchange offers.<l6
certain other important developments have occurred in connection
with the maintenance of competitive conditions required by Section
12 (d) of the Act. In the case of Western Light &'Telephone 00.,
the Commission considered the question of whether an investment
banking firm. retained as a financial adviser by the issuer of securities
might appropriately enter the bidding for such securities."

of a fee would necessarily involve continuing obligations to the issuer
inconsistent with the role of bidder for the securities with respect to
which advice had been given. It was pointed out also that an investment banking house acting in the role of financial adviser may have
an unfair advantage over other bidders because of its early and close
association with the transaction. Accordingly, the Commission announced that investment banking firms acting in such a capacity
would be considered ineligible to bid for the securities involved.
The statutory standards regarding maintenance of competitive
conditions were also considered in the case of Standard Gas and Eleotria 00., which involved the sale of securities of a public utility subsidiary operating in Mexico." This transaction was not subject to
Rule U-50 inasmuch as the anticipated sales price was less than
$1,000,000. The Commission held that, although a transaction may be
exempt from the formal competitive bidding procedure prescribed by
Rule U-50, proper maintenance of competitive conditions within the
meaning of Section 12 (d) requires that a vendor, having solicited
invitations for bids, must follow a selling procedure designed to afford
to all interested persons a fair opportunity to make offers, and to
secure for the vendor the maximum price reasonably obtainable. Upon
a reoffering of the securities, the Commission stated its view that a
bid of "$10,500 plus the next highest bid" was not in legal effect a bid,
and cited court precedents in which bids of a similar character were
rejected as potentially destructive of fair competition. The Commission also indicated in its opinion that in the event more than one
bid were submitted by the same party or by various persons under
common control, it would reject all such bids as improper .
. In the case of Interstate Power 00., the Commission disapproved
a sale of utility assets on the ground that the procedure followed by
the vendor was prejudicial to the competitive position of a prospective
buyer, and thus failed to afford all interested persons the equality of
opportunity to bid for the property required by the "maintenance of
competitive conditions" standard contained in Section 12 (d)!9
Exemptions From Rule V-50

By the terms of Rule U-50, exemptions from the competitive bidding
procedure may be granted by the Commission under certain circumstances. Apart from the exchange of several issues of preferred stock
for outstanding shares of old preferred, as discussed above, exemptions
under Rule U-50 were granted during the past year in six instances
involving securities in the amount of $19,865,000. These exemptions
were granted, in general, because the competitive bidding process was
found to be unsuited to the circumstances of the case or unnecessary
in the light of the public interest. In the case of Unite~ Public Utilities Oorp., for example, an exemption was granted covering the sale
of securities to a neighboring utility company, the Commission finding
that ownership and operation of the properties by the acquiring company were in the public interest. GO

their subsidiaries, the Commission has adhered' to and further developed the policy of securing inclusion in the corporate charters of
certain preferred stock protective provisions. During the past year
these provisions have become generally standardized, providing,
among other things, that the holders of at least two-thirds of the issue
must consent to the authorization of any prior ranking stock, the
alteration of existing preferred stock provisions, and the issuance of
additional shares at a time when earnings are below a stipulated level.
Restrictions have also been placed upon the issuance or assumption of
additional indebtedness and upon the merger or consolidation of the
company with other corporations.
Preferred stockholders are given
the right to elect a majority of the Board of Directors upon default of
four quarterly dividends."
As an additional means of protecting senior security holders, the
Commission has continued to insist- upon suitable restrictions on the
payment of dividends where common stock equity was considered
inadequate.
For example, in the case of Western Light &: Telephone
00.52 the declarant agreed that"
If at any time the aggregate of the common stock and surplus (common equity)
Is or becomes less than 20 percent of the total capitalization, dividends on common
stock in any fiscal year shall be limited to 50 percent of net income available for
said common stock in such fiscal year and whenever such ratios shall be 20 percent
or-more but less than 25 percent, then not more than 75 percent of the earnings
accumulated during such period otherwise available for such purposes shall be
used therefor.
No dividends shall be paid on common stock which will reduce
such ratio to Iess than 25 nercent.
Exemptions From the Provisions of thc Act

The renewed application of Pacific Gas and Electric CO.53 under
Section 2 (a) (8) for an order declaring it not to be a subsidiary of
The North American Co., was granted by the Commission upon finding
that a substantial change in status had occurred since the entry of its ..
order of September 10, 1941, denying, the original application."
During the intervening period the ownership of North American in
Pacific had been reduced from 17.7 percent to 5.24 percent and of two
directors of Pacific elected by North American, one had already resigned while the other was prepared to resign when the disposition
of North American's interest in Pacific had been completed.
•
 During the past year the Commission granted exemptions to 8
holding companies under Section 3 of the Act and upon applications
under Section 5 (d) ordered that the registration of 5 holding companies should cease to be :in effect. Twenty-two small holding
companies claimed exemption from registration under Rule U-9, 24.
claimed exemption under Rule U-2 (a) and 35 subsidiary holding
companies were exempt from registration under Rule U-2 (b).
In the case of Texas Utilities Co.," the Commission had occasion-to
state that any automatic exemption available under Rule U-2 would
be terminated promptly pending adoption of protective provisions
in the preferred stock and completion of the original cost study of a
subsidiary company, thereby assuring that no procedural step could

COOPERATION BETWEEN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE
COMMISSION AND STATE COMMISSIONS .

During the past ye~r the Commission has continued its established
policy of cooperating with other Federal agencies and with State and
municipal regulatory bodies in matters of mutual interest. This is
in keepmg with the spirit and policy of the Act in which the Congress
inserted a number of specific provisions for this purpose. Reference
is made to the Eleventh Annual Report for a detailed discussion of the
principal Sections of the Act dealing with this matter.
The area of the Commission's activities in which State commissions
have the most direct interest embraces the regulation of operating
subsidiaries of holding company systems and usually relates to such
matters as the adequacy of depreciation, accounting practices, and the
removal of questionable items from property accounts. One of the
most interestmg cases in this category which came before the Commission during the past year involved a refinancing operation of the
Jersey Central Power & Light CO.56 Through the cooperative efforts
of the Federal Power Commission, the Board of Public Utility Commissioners of the State of New Jersey, and this Commission, there
resulted a successful plan whereby semor securities _of the company
were reduced, unamortized debt discount and expense on retired issues
was eliminated, and approximately $10,000,000 of excess 'Over original
costs was removed from the property account. An important factor
contributing to the feasibility of these adjustments was a capital donation of $5,000,000 by the company's .l?arent and. as a consequence of
all of the transactions, the total capitalization of the company was
• reduced nearly $7,000,000.
There were eight other financmg cases
during the past year in which there were helpful interchanges of views
and information with interested State commissions. 57 In one of these
cases the record of hearings before this Commission was received in
evidence at concurrent hearings before the two State commissions
having jurisdiction over the companies involved."
The volume of cases of the type described above seems to have tapered off in recent years, apparently for the reason that the major por- •
tion of the problems of this character have been disposed-of through
the combined efforts of State commissions, the Federal Power Commission, and this Commission. Furthermore, in the past few years
'there has been a substantial increase in the number of reorganization
plans filed with the Commission for the purpose of complying with the
geographic integration and corporate simplification standards of
Section 11 (b).. ~ a ~onseque¥ce the focus of cooperative- efforts
appears to be shiftmg to integration.
-Cooperation in this type of case has touched upon a wide variety of
circumsta~ces, most of wh~ch relate to the divestment of operating

The Act does not contain specific provisions for cooperation between
this Commission and State commissions in Section 11 cases, but, in
Section 19 of the Act, the Commission is required to admit a,ny interested State, State- commission, municipality, or other political subdivision of a State as a party in any proceeding before It. Pursuant
to this provision, the Commission has uniformly followed the policy
of inviting interested State commissions to participate in any proceeding which may affect their work. As indicated by the above
cases, a number have taken advantage of this invitation.

PART IV.
PARTICIPATION
OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
>REORGANIZATIO~S UNDER. CHAPTER X OF THE BANK~
nUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, as amended ill 1938, affords appropriate machinery for the reorganization of corporations (other
than railroads) in the Federal courts. The Commission's duties under
Chapter X are, first, at the request or with the approval of the court
to act as a participant in proceedings thereunder in order to provide,
for the court and investors, independent expert assistance on 'matters
arising in such proceedings, and second, to prepare, for the benefit
new proceedings under Chapter X, one of which was filed at the reorganization submitted to it by the courts in suchsproceedings,
The
Commission has no statutory right of appeal in any such' proceeding,
although it may participate in appeals taken by others.
SUMMARY OF ACfIVITIES

The Commission actively participated during the year in 104 reorganization proceedings mvolving the reorganization of 127 companies (104 principal debtor corporations and 23 subsidiary debtors),"
The' aggregate stated assets of these 127 companies amounted to
$1,975,860,000 and their aggregate indebtedness was $1,313,321,000.2
During the year, the Commission filed its notice of appearance in nine
new proceedings under Chapter X, one of -which was filed at the request of the judge and the remaining eight upon approval by the judge'
of the Commission's motion to participate.
These nine new proceedings involved nine companies with aggregate stated assets of
$9,615,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $11,636,000. Proceedings involving 15 principal debtor corporations and 2 subsidiary
debtors were closed during the year.
At the close of the year, the Commission was actively participating
in 89 reorganization proceedings involving 110 companies (8Q.principal debtors and -21 subsidiary debtors), with aggregate stated assets
of $1,918,142,000 and stated 'indebtedness of $1,260,996,000.

COMMISSION'S FUNCTIONS UNDER CHAPTER X

In participating in proceedings under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, the role of the Commission differs .markedly from that
under the other Acts which it administers.
The Commission does not
administer Chapter X. It does not initiate the proceedings, hold its
own hearings, or adopt Rules and Regulations, but acts, as the representative of investors and as an aid to the court, in a purely advisory
capacity. It has no authority either to veto or to require the adoption

of a plan of reorganization or to render a decision on any other issue
in the proceeding. The facilities of its technical staff and its impartial recommendations are placed at the services of the judge and
the security holders, affording them the views of experts in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance.
In order to facilitate this work of the Commission, staifs of lawyers,
accountants, and analysts have been stationed in various regional.
offices where they can keep in close touch with all hearings and rssues
in the proceedirigs and with the parties and be readily available to
the courts. At the central office of the Oommission, the Corporation
Finance Division is charged 'with the immediate supervision of the
Commission's Chapter X functions. As a party to the proceeding the
Commission is represented at all important hearings and its views on
the various problems arising in the proceeding are expressed to the
court orally or through legal or analytical memoranda.
Of equal
importance is the regular participation by the Commission's staff in
informal conferences and discussions with the parties in an endeavor
to work out solutions to questions in advance of formal hearing and
argument. In this.way the Commission has often been 'able to bring
facts, arguments, or alternative suggestions to the attention of the
parties, and frequently the parties have been thereafter prompted-to
modi~ their proposed actions. In general the Commission has found
these informal discussions an effectIve means for cooperation, and of
great value in expediting the proceeding.
While the Commission as a partY in interest has a right to be heard
on all matters arising in the proceeding, it does not have the statutory
right of appeal. The Commission, however, on appropriate occasions
appears before the appellate courts when appeals are taken by others.
The Commission has participated as a party or as amicus ouriae in
many appeals involving significant legal principles of bankruptcy
reorganization law..
_
Through its nation-wide activity in Chapter X cases the Commission
has been in an advantageous position to encourage uniformity in the.
interpretation and "application of the provisions of Chapter X, and is
often called upon by parties, referees and special masters, and judges
for advice and suggestions. 'In this the Commission has been able to
extend substantial assistance derived from its experience accumulated
through participation in many cases.
THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

As a general matter the Commission has deemed it appropriate to
seek to participate only in proceedings in which a public investor
interest IS involved. As a rough, administrative guide, proceedinss are
not considered to have su:ffi.cientpublic interest to warrant Commission
participation if the amount of publicly held securities is less than
$25~OOO." But mere size is not, of course, the sole criterion.
Often
the Commission has deemed it appropriate to enter smaller cases where
an unfair plan has been or is about to be proposed, where the public
security holders are not adequately represented, where the proceedings
are being conducted in violation of important provisions of th.e -A~t,
or where other facts indicate that the Commission may perform a
useful service by participating.
During the past fiscal ye~, the Com-

TWELFl'H

ANNUAL REPORT

83

mission intervened in several such smaller cases because it considered
that unfair plans were being proposed and violations of Chapter X
provisions were occurring.
There is a multitude of diverse questions with which the Commission
is concerned as a. party to a Chapter X proceeding. Some of the more
important matters which have arisen during the past fiscal year are
discussed in the following paragraphs.
Problems in the Administration of.ahe Estate

. The Commission has continued its policy of scrutinizing the qualifications of trustees in the light of the standards of disinterestedness
prescribed oy the statute. Since the independent trustee has the duty
of examining into the history and affairs of the debtor, ascertaining
its financial and managerial problems, and formulating the-plan of
reorganization, it is obvious that the success of the reorganization
depends Iargely upon his thoroughness and skill. In one case, the
Commission objected to the retention of a bank as trustee where its
trust officer, in charge of the reorganizationfroceeding
for the bank,
was closely affiliated with the management 0 the debtor and where it
appeared that no investigation of the property, liabilities, and financial condition of the debtor, as required by Section 167 of the Act,
would be made and reported to security holders. The judge did not
sustain the objection to the retention of the trustee but did order the
trustee to comply fully with the requirements of Section 167.8
In connection with the preparation of the trustee's report, as in
other phases of the case, the Commission has continued its practice of
assisting the trustee through consultation on problems and m furnishing information.
As the result of its experience in many cases, the
Commission has been in a position to render considerable help to
trustees in carrying OUt their duties, in this respect as well as others,
without usurping their functions or controlling their activities.
The importance of a thorough investigation of the debtor's affairs
by the trustee has manifested itself on many occasions during the
Commission's experience in Chapter 4: cases. In one case during the
past year, the Commission's staff discovered evidence of misconduct
on the part of the management of a company which owned an office
building and it assisted the trustee in conductmg an investigation.
It
was found that the manager. and controlling officer of the debtor apparently had charged excessive management fees, used office space to
which he was not entitle-d, and debited the company for expenses which
he should have borne himself. After long negotiation a settlement
was consummated favorably for security holders and approved by the
court. In the same case, prior to the Commission's intervention, a
plan had been proposed, at the instance of the company and its management, under which bondholders. would have received common stock
and cash, equal to.30 percent of the face value of the old bonds, the
cash to be derived from the proceeds of a new mortgage. .With the
thought that the common sto«k would not have a ready market and
might not bring its true value 'if sold, and in view of the current rise
in.realty prices, the Commission urged? as preferable, the adoption of
plan under which the property WOuld be sold at public auction at a

a

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

fair upset price. The trustee submitted this type of plan and it was
approved by the court, accepted by bondholders, and confirmed. At
the sale, the property attracted bids much higher than the upset price.'
(See page 91 on the sale of properties as a method of reorganization under Chapter X.) As a result of this sale and the settlement with the manager, bondholders will receive close to 100 cents on
\he dollar in cash for their bonds.
.
The competence and efficiency of management is likewise an important subject for investigation by the trustee. In a case involving a
large chain of restaurants which had suffered drastically from declining business prior to the war, the Commission endeavored to have the
court order the trustee to retain experts to make a management survey.
While the company's difficulties may have been due to causes other
than incompetence or inefficiency of management, the Commission 00lie-red it essential to ascertain the responsibility of management for
the plight of the company, first, because of-its effect upon a judgment
as to the earnings of the company for valuation purposes, and, second,
because of the necessity for the court to pass upon the future management of the reorganized company. Upon the trustee's assertion that _'
he would present testimony on this subject at the plan hearings, the
court denied the Commission's request."
The responsibility of the trustee for the administration of the estate
is equally as important as his duty with respect to the reorganization
plan. The Commission has taken every opportunity to emphasize this
aspect of the proceeding. In a case involving a large investment company with its major holdings consisting of the common stocks of two
subsidiary investment companies, the Commission, during the early
part of this year, urged that the speculative character of the enterprise
be reduced in the interests of 'creditors and senior security holders of
the debtor company. After conferences with the Commission and
other parties, the trustees presented a program for the 'retirement of
a large portion of the semor capital of the subsidiaries,' thereby reducing to a considerable extent the risks to the debtor's estate inherent
in a high leverage position. The Commission supported this program
before the court. The trustees obtained the approval of the court to
the program despite the opposition of a' preferred stockholders
committee,"
Responsibilities of Fiduciaries

The Commission has consistently been alert to insist upon the absolute honesty of fiduciaries in their relationship to security holders
and has urged that those in positions of trust who have deviated from
the high standards imposed upon them should bear the full consequences of their actions.
Trading in securities of a debtor by trustees, directors or other
insiders is a practice which has generally been condemned by the
cou.rts. During the fiscal.year, in a matter. in which the Commission
actively participated, this rule was applied to the directors of a
corporation in reorganization under Section 77B where they had
purchased bonds of the corporation during their inoumbsney.t The

court held that the directors of the debtor corporation, which had
been continued in possession of its property in the absence of the
appointment of a trustee, should be limited in their claims on their
bonds so purchased to the actual cost to them. Subsequently, a settlement was negotiated and approved by the court,",
In the proceedings to reorganize Jeffrey Terrace Building Corp.
the Commission vigorously supported a petition for limitation to cost
of bonds acquired by an individual in a transaction in which that
individual cooperated in what appeared to the Commission to be a
breach of fiduciary obligations by an indenture trustee who was also
manager of the properties. Instead of attempting to secure the
maximum price for the debtor's property, in which bondholders had
the sole interest, the indenture trustee for the bondholders entered
into an agreement with the aforementioned individual. Under that
agreement the trustee was to receive a commission, the amount ofwhich would increase in proportion as the price paid for the property
by the aforementioned individual went down. Thereafter the fiducrary, acting as agent for the purchaser, induced bondholders to sell
their bonds at 50 cents on the dollar, making no disclosure of the
sale of a large block of bonds to the purchaser at 65 cents on the dollar
and not advising bondholders of his own interest in the transactions.
The court entered an order limiting the purchaser to the cost of his
bonds. Subsequently a settlement was negotiated and was approved
by the court.
The remedy of limitation to cost. is generally invoked in order to
prevent a fiduciary from profiting by his trust. On the other hand,
where the fiduciary's derelictions have caused harm to the security
holders or the estate the remedy of subordination may be pursued to
prevent the fiduciary from sharing in the assets of the estate on a
parity with these security holders. In the previous fiscal year the
Commission filed an advisory report on plans of reorganization in
proceedings involving Warner Sugar Corp. in which the Commission
recommended that the doctrine of subordination be applied. In that
report a detailed account was given of the manner in which various
banks used their domination and control of the company to advance
their own adverse interests to the detriment of public bondholders .
. It was pointed out that the banks, although occupying a fiduciary
position, did not scrupulously observe the bondholders' rights but
violated indenture provisions designed for their protection, obtained
preferential treatment with respect to various assets and engaged in
other practices to place bondholders at a disadvantage, even to the
extent of preventing bondholders from ascertaining the facts and
pursuing their appropriate legal remedies,"
After the filing of the
Commission's report the trustee submitted a memorandum in which
he recommended that the banks be subordinated in their claims against
the debtor.'? After hearings, a plan was filed by the trustee on December 1, 1945, under which public bondholders were to receive the full
principal amount of their bonds with interest at 6 percent from the
date of default in 1931 to the date of payment. The plan embodied

an offer of purchase of West Indies Sugar Corp., a large bondholder
and owner of an adjoining sugar mill and plantation. . As part of
the plan the banks and the manager were to be paid merely the principal of their bonds with no interest. Since the bonds bore a '( percent interest rate th~ plan was in effect a compromise of the issues
of subordination and limitation to cost. Under the circumstances of
the case the Commission concluded that the. compromise was fair to
the public bondholders and recommended that the plan be approved.
Thereafter the plan was approved by the court, accepted by security
holders and it has recently been confirmed by the court.
Another proceeding involving the subordination doctrine in which
the Commissiouactively
participated is that of lnlarut Gas Oorp.,
American Fuel and. Power 00., et al. In that case, during the previous
fiscal_year, the Commission had participated in an appeal to the Circuit Court of Appeals for the Sixth CIrcuit from a decision by the
district court rejecting various claims of Columbia Gas and Electric
Corp. against the debtor based on bonds, debentures and stock. In
brief, the district court found, that Columbia Gas and Electric Corp.
had formulated and carried out a program to prevent Inland Gas
Corp. and its parent company, American Fuel and Power Co., togetlier with other subsidiaries, from expanding its business, primarily
through the building of a pipe line .ffom its field in Kentucky to
Detroit.
The Commission urged that the district court decision rejecting the Columbia Gas claims be affirmed for the reason that
Irrespective of other grounds for rejection such as violation of.
-antitrust laws, the facts showed inequitable conduct by Columbia Gas
and Electric Corp. toward the debtor corporations which warranted
the rejection or subordination of its claims. The Commission argued
that Columbia Gas and Electric Corp. secured control of the American Fuel and Inland Gas system to destroy a threat to its competitiveposition and that Colum.bia accomplished ItS purpose. It was pointed
out that subordination or disallowance was particularly appropriate
because of the difficulties of recasting the history of the enterprise
so as to determine the extent of the loss suffered by the public security
holders. On October 9, 1945 the Circuit Court affirmed the District
Court judgment, modifying the decree, however, so as to 'provide for
subordinatioa of the claims and stock interests of Columbia Gas
and Electric Corp. rather than rejection" thereof."
The court rested
its opinion not merely upon the existence of inequitable or illegal
conduct of Columbia Gas and Electric Corp., but upon the injury
caused the debtors and their security holders by reason of such conduct. Application for a writ of certiorari was filed by Columbia Gas
and Electric Corp. on May 29, 1946. The Commission has filed a
brief in opposition to the application.v

has been able to provide considerable assistance to the courts in this
. matter.
The Commission itself receives no allowances from estates in reorganization and is able to J?resent a wholly disinterested and impartial view. The Commission has consistently tried to secure a
limitation of the total compensation to a!1 amount which the estate
can feasibly pay, In each case the Commission also makes a careful
study of" the a;{>plications of the various parties to the end that unnecessary duplication of services shall not be recompensed and that
compensation shall be allocated on the basis of the work done by
each claimant and of his relative contribution to the administration
" of the estate and the formulation of A plan. With these objectives
in mind the Commission may undertake- to make specific recommendations to the courts in cases in which the Commission has been a
party throughout the proceeding and is thoroughly familiar with
the activities of the various parties and all significant developments
in the .proceedings. In cases in which i~ has entered the proceeding
at an advanced stage the Commission may limit its advice to the court
without specifying 'particular amounts deemed reasonable by it.
Where the activities of an applicant for compensation have constituted inequitable conduct or where an applicant has traded in securities, directly or indirectly, in violation of the provisions of Section 249,
the Commission has urged that fees be denied. In several cases, the
Commission took the position that purchases or sales of securities by
the near relatives of a fiduciary come within the application of the
provisions Of Section 249 of the Bankruptcy Act and the rule of law
which that Section codifies. In one case the Commission's contention
was upheld; 1.3 in two cases-it was not.> In another case the Commission opposed an applicant's contention that Section 249 does not apply
to attorneys who represent individual creditors. The Commission
pointed out that Section 249 applied in terms to attorneys and that its
purpose was to prevent a pernicious reorganization abuse-the buying
and selling of securities by persons within stated groups on the basis of
inside information_about matters such as plans, prospects of reorganization, and the value of securities; information which they were in a
strategic position to acquire and use for-their own gain. Itwas pointed
out that the case of Yowng v, Higbee 00.15 (in which the Commission
had participated) had suggested that even individual security holders
themselves assumed certain representative obligations when their activities were for the benefit of the entire estate." In another case the
Commission urged that compensation be denied to an indenture trustee
and a bondholders' committee where-the indenture trustee was acting
for arid at the instance of the committee. The district court agreed
that a conflict of interest existed between the indenture trustee and the
committee. and denied compensation to' the committee .for services
rendered up to the time of the removal of the indenture trustee. It
denied any compensation to the indentiire trustee."

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

On the other hand the Cornmission has taken the position that the
fee provisions of Chapter X contemplate a broadening of the base for ,
~a'anting allowances as a means of encouraging participation in a
j?eorgamzation proceeding by individual creditors and security holders
w hose personal financial stakes are seldom sufficiently great to pay their
own counsel fees. With this principle in view the Commission is
participating in support of an applicant who was denied compensation
.nythe district court on the ground that his services were performed for
the benefit of particular claimants rather than the estate as a whole.
In an appeal from this denial the Commission urged that compensation
he granted because applicant's services aided the proceeding by bringing before the court considerations applicable to a whole class of
security holders who, in effect, were represented by the applicant."
INSTITUTION OF CHAPTER X PROCEEDNGS AND JURISDICTION OF
THE COURT

The Commission has striven for a liberal interpretation of the provisions of the Bankruptcy Act so that/the benefits of Chapter X may be
made fully available to security holders in accordance with the spirit
and intent of the statute. In accordance with the principle enunciated
in the Supreme Court decision in Securities and Exchange Oommission v. United States Realty and Improvement 00.,19 the Commission
has intervened during the fiscal year in a Chapter XI proceeding where
the company seeking an arrangement appears to have a substantial
class of public security holders. The Commission's views, upheld by
the Supreme Court, is that Chapter XI (relating to creditor arrangements) is not properly available to a debtor where a large public mvestor interest is involved since the provisions of Chapter XI do not
contain the safeguards necessary to protect large classes of public
security holders in the consummation of a fair, equitable, and feasible
plan of reorganization, and that such a reorganization should take
place under Chapter X.20
'
The Commission has also participated in several cases involving
the question of good faith in the filing of a petition. The Commission's
view in these cases 'was that the pendency of a prior State court proceeding was not .a bar to a Chapter X proceeding since,the prior proceedings in those cases did not contain safeguards for investors comparable with those in Chapter X. The contentions of the Commission
were not upheld by the courts, generally on the ground that it had
not been shown that the interests of security holders would not be
best subserved in the prior State court proceedingsP
The disregard of corporate entities in order to achieve a workable
plan was upheld. in the proceeding involving-Pittsburgh
Railwa:ys 00.
The Commission actively supported a petition of the city of Pittsburgh
to have the court assert jurisdiction for purposes of bankruptcy reorganization over various subsidiary companies and associated companies of the debtor, which were not nominally before the court, in 01'11

•
PLANS OF REORGANIZATION UNDER CHAPTER X

The ultimate objective of a reorganization is the formulation and
consummation of a fair and feasible plan of reorganization,
Accordingly, the most important function of the Commission under Chapter
X is to aid the courts in achieving this objective.
Fairness

In appraising the fairness of reorganization plans under Chapter X
the Commission has at all times taken the position that full recognition
must be accorded claims in order of their legal and contractual priority,
either in cash or new securities or both, and that junior clairnants may
participate only to the extent that the debtor's properties have value
after the satisfaction of prior claims or to the extent that they make a
fresh contribution necessary to the reorganization of the debtor.
Hence, a valuation of the debtor is necessary to provide the basis for
judging the fairness as' well as the feasibility of proposed plans 9f
In its advisory reports.rin hearings before the courts,
reorganization.
and in conferences with parties to proceedings, the Commission has
consistently stated that the proper method of valuation for reorganization purposes is primarily an appropriate capitalization of reasonably
prospective earnings.
-

These principles as to the recognition of priorities and as to valuation are now firmly established as a result of the Supreme Court
decisions in Oase v. Los Angeles Lumber Produots 00. Ltd.23 and
Uonsoiidated Rock Products 00. v, DuBois 24 in which the court sustained the positions urged in briefs filed on behalf of the Commission
as amioue curiae. During the past fiscal year these principles were
reiterated in an appeal before the Circuit Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit in which the Commission actively participated.
In
this proceeding, United States Realty and Improvement 00. and Trinity Buildings Oorp. 0/ New York, the district court had excluded the
preferred stockholders of Trinity Buildings Corporation from participation in a plan because the value of the debtor's assets on an earnings
basis was found to be less than the amount of creditors' claims. The
Commission urged that the district court's finding of value was
'substantially supported by the evidence and that it should be affirmed.
The circuit court sustained the position of the Commission and affirmed
the orders approving and confirming the plan of reorganization."

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In connection with the fairness of plans, the Commission, as has
been noted above, has been concerned among other matters with situations where mismanagement or other misconduct on the part of a
parent company or controlling person requires that its claims be subordinated to the claims of the public investors or where a fiduciary's
activities require that he be limited to the cost of his claims. Such
matters must be given full consideration since they form an integral
part of the concept of the "fair and equitable" plan.
,
The relative prosperity during recent years of many companies
undergoing reorganization has enabled a number of debtors to make
payments to creditors in cash either in part or in full. As a result,
novel questions have been raised involving creditors' rights. The
Commission, on behalf of the public investors, has participated in
many of these controversies..
The Commission has urged that partial distribution of 'cash be
made to creditors wherever possible, even though in advance of a
formal plan of reorganization. The power of the court to make'
such distribution has been upheld whenever the question has arisen.
With respect to payment in full to creditors the Commission has
in general taken the view that all the rights of creditors to interest
to the date of. payment should be observed. In one case the CoIIlmission supported the position of debenture holders that they were
entitled to have their claim of principal and accrued interest to the
date of commencement of the Chapter X proceeding treated as an
aggregate claim and to receive interest on such aggregate claim from
the commencement of the proceeding up to. the date of payment.
The Commission urged that the aggregate claim of principal and interest accrued at the inception of the proceeding was in the nature of a
judgment against the estate which carried interest on the full amount
of the judgment to the date of payment. The reason for the rule is
the fact that the BaDkruptcy'Act necessarily restrains creditors from
pursuing their usual remedies by way of judgment and execution in
order to avoid preferential treatment and forced liquidation and to
assure equality of participation in the assets.
The purpose of the stay of suits against the debtor is only to prevent the exercise by creditors of their procedural remedies and the stay
should not be utilized to affect the substantive rights which would
attach upon the acquisition Of a judgment. By' treatin~ creditors'
claims as judgments in computing the amount of the claims, those
substantive rights are preserved and the debtor, and its stockholders
do not gain an advantage over their creditors. The district court
sustained the Commission's position in this ,case.26
,.
,
Feasibility

Although the representatives of security holders frequently regard
the fairness of the plan as their :principal concern, the provisions of
the statute and the protection of investors' interests require also that .
the plan be feasible. To be feasible, a reorganization must be eeonomically 'Sound and workable. 'It must not hamper future operations or lead to another reorganiZation. The extent to which current
reorganizations are attributable to lack of feasibility in previous reor,. In re Realty A88ornatu, Becurltlu

ganizations is indicated by the fact that numerous Chapter X proceedmgs involved compani~ which had already undergone reorganization
in equity receivership pi'Qceedings or under Section 77B of the Bankruptcy Act. In order to avoid a similar record as to Chapter X cases
some years hence, with its attendant expense and injury to investors,the Commission gives a great deal of attention to the factors affecting
feasibility.
In this connection, -the Commission is particularly concerned with the adequacy of working capital, the relationship of
funded debt and capital structure to property values, the adequacy
of corporate earning power in relation to interest and dividend requirements, and the effect of the new capitalization upon the company's
prospective credit.
.
In recent years the Commission has encountered difficulties because
the" parties are disposed to base values and capital structures upon
inflated war earnings, either because they overlook the extent to which
earnings are inflated or hope such earnings will continue long enough
to permit debt to be scaled down to manageable proportions. Another
obstacle to the formulation of feasible plans in the current period of
high tax rates is the reluctance of investors to scale down debt and
thereby lose the deduction for interest payments.
Sale Plans

The increase in value of properties of corporations in reorganization
has been particularly evident in the real estate field. In a number of
these cases the Commission has felt that a sale of the property would
be more beneficial for creditors than a plan involving exchange of
securities. The legal basis for plans involving sales is derived from
Section 216 (10) of Chapter X and has been affirmed in several cases.
In the leading case of In re Lorraine (]{JlftleApartments Buildilng
Oorp., 1M., the Commission was an active participant in supporting
the power of the Chapter X court to approve a plan providing for a
sale of all of the debtor's property,"

"

The Commission also gives its attention to the drafting and preparation of corporate charters, by-laws, trust indentures, and other instruments which are to ~vern the internal structure of the reorganized
debtor. The Commission strives to obtain the inclusion of various
provisions in these instruments which will assure to the investors a
maximum of protection, adequate information with regard to tht
enterprise, and a fair voice in the management.
The Commission has
generally opposed the control device of "a voting trust except when its
use has been justified by the special circumstances of the case and,
when adopted, the Commission has sought to have the voting-trust
agreement contain ~ppropriate provisions in the interests of the
investors,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

means of contact between the Commission and the public in Chapter X
matters. Generally speaking, an advisory ~e'port is prepared only
in connection with a proceeding involving significant problems and a
relatively large company in which the investing public has a
substantial interest.
Even though the Commission does not file a formal advisory report,
it does, in all cases in which it is a participant, advise the court of its
opinion with respect to any plan of reorganization under consideration
by the court.
.
After the trustee has filed a plan, the customary procedure calls
for a-hearing at which this plan and any other plans that may have
been proposed are considered. At this stage of the proceeding, the
attorneys representing the Commission are concerned primarily with
getting into the record sufficient data (1) to enable the judge to decide whether any proposed plan is worthy of consideration and (2) to
supply the factual basis for the report of the Commission. 1£ the
judge finds one or more of the plans worthy of consideration, it 'or
they may be referred to the Commission for report.
An advisory report provides the court with an expert independent
appraisal of the plan indicating in detail the extent to which, in the
opinion of the Commission, it meets, or fails to meet, the standards
of fairness and feasibility. After the report is filed and copies are
made available to the parties who have appeared at the proceedings,
the judge considers the approval, modification, or disapproval of the
plan. If. the judge approves the plan, it goes to the security holders
for acceptance or rejection accompanied by a copy of the judge's opinion and a copy of the report of the Commission, or a summary thereof
prepared by the Commission. The report of the Commission, therefore, while not binding, aids both the judge and the security holders
in determining whether or not to approve a plan.
During the fiscal year the Commission prepared a formal advisory
report and a supplemental advisory report with respect to plans of
reorganization
in proceedings involving Ohicago Railways 00.,
Ohicago Oity Railway 00., Oalwmet and South Ohicago Railwa'l/ 00.,
and Ohicago Rapid Transit 00. In its advisory report the Commission
concluded that the plan proposed by the city of Chicago, pursuant
to which the city was to bid for the Chicago surface lines' traction
properties a minimum price of $75,000,000, was not fair, but could
made fair if the city waived its claim to a $5,21>0,000"City Compensation Fund," if it permitted the constituent companies to retain
net earnings up to the date of actual transfer of the properties, and
if the proceeds of the sale were reallocated among security holders
along lines suggested by the Commission in order to satisfy the
absolute priorities doctrine. The Commission also concluded that the
upset price ?f $12,162,500 for th~ properties of Chicago Rapid T~ansit
Co. was fair. Thereafter the plan was amended by the Chicago
Transit Authority, as assignee of the city of Chicago, so as to adopt
substantially the recomm,endations of the Commission's advisory report. In a supplemental report the Commission concluded that the
amended plan was fair. The plan has been approved by the court,
accepted by security holders and confirmed. _Appeals have been taken
by certain junior security holders from the order of approval and Confirmation and they are presently pending.

The Commission also prepared a formal, advisory report with respect to a plan of reorganization in the proceeding involving The
Rocky Mountain Fuel 00. The Commission took the view that the
plan was feasible and would be fair if it were amended to disclose
to bondholders the-extent of the powers of the new board of directors.
The plan was amended in accordance with the Commission's suggestion and approved by the court.
The plan of reorganization in the latter case provided that certain
bondholders, who had not assented to a prior voluntary plan for
reduction in interest rate and extension of maturity of the bonds,
should be paid an amount in cash equal to the reduced interest payments which had been made to assenting bondholders for a number
of years before the Chapter X proceeding. This provision was intended to accord equal treatment to the holders of both assented and
nonassented bonds because it was felt that such treatment was proper
and equitable. In its advisory report the Commission approved the
proposed treatment, pointing out that under the terms of the indenture, under the applicable State law, and under general equitable principles the assenting bondholders should not be subordinated to nonassenting bondholders but that, on the contrary, the plan was fair
and equitable in providing for parity of treatment of all bondholders.
Certain nonassenting bondholders appealed from the orders approving
and confirming the plan, contending that they were entitled to a priority over assenting bondholders as to principal and interest. The
Commission supported the plan before the circuit court, which affirmed the orders approving and affirming the plan of reorganization."

PART V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT
OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 outlaws the exculpatory clauses
used in the past in trust indentures underlying corporate debt securities. Many of these clauses eliminated liability of the trustee for misconduct to such an 'extent that the word "trustee" was -meaningless as
applied to indenture trustees. The Act is designed to insure that the
trustee will act in the interest of the bond or debenture owners and to
insure his complete independence of the issuer and the underwriters.
To secure 'its objectives, the Act requires that bonds, notes, debentures,
and similar debt securities publicly offered for sale, sold, or delivered
after sale through the mails or in interstate commerce, except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which
meets the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the
Commission. The provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933 of securities to De issued under a trust
indenture is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture
conforms to the requirements expressed in the Trust Indenture Act
-
of 1939, and such an indenture is automatically "qualified" when registration becomes effective as to the securities themselves. An application for qualification of an indenture covering securities not required
to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which is filed with
the Commisson under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, is 'processed
substantially as though such application were a registration statement filed pursuant to the Securities Act of 1933.

OF 1940
The Investment Company .Act of 1940 requires the registration and
provides for the regplation of investment companies, which are, generally, companies engaged primarily in the business of investmg,
reinvesting, owning, holding, or trading in securities. The Act requires, among other things, disclosure of the finances and of the investment policies of these companies, to afford investors full and complete information with respect to their activities; prohibits such companies from changing the nature of their business or their investment
policies without the approval of the stockholders; bars persons guilty
of security frauds from serving as officers and directors of such companies; prevents underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from
constituting more than a minority of the directors of such companies;
requires management contracts in the first instance to be submitted to
security holders for their approval; prohibits transactions- between
such companies and their officers and directors and other insiders
except on the approval of the Commission; forbids the issuance of
senior securities of such companies except in specified instances; and
prohibits pyramiding of such companies and cross ownership of their
securities, The Commission is authorized to prepare advisory reports. upon plans of reorganizations of registered investment companies upon request of such companies or 25 percent of their stockholders and to institute proceedings to enjoin such plans if they are
grossly unfair. The .Act also requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon
their certificates.

New Rules Adopted Under Investment Company Act of 1940

Adoption of Rule N-17D-l: On February 6, 194:6,the Commission
adopted a new rule under the Investment Company Act of 1940 J;.egarding bonus, profit-sharing and pension plans provided by reg-.
istered investment companies and theii controlled companies for directors, officers and other affiliated persons. The rule provides that
prior to the submission of any such plan to security holders for approval, or if not so submitted prior to the adoption thereof, an application regarding the plan shall be filed with the .Oommission and
the Commission be given 10 days to scrutinize the plan and determine
whether or not a hearing should be held thereon. The purpose of
the rule is to protect registered investment companies and. their controlled companies and the security holders of such companies against
contributions to such plans on an unfair and inequitable basis. The
rule provides that the Commission will, in passing upon such applications, be guided by the standards contained in the various pertinent
Sections of the Act.
The type of situatiou-which Rule N-17D-l was designed to meet
is illustrated by the following case: The management of a group of
closely affiliated investment companies proposed that each investment
company in the group adopt an " 'employees' incentive profit-sharing
plan and trust." The proposed profit-sharing plan provided that
each investment company should contribute the lesser of (a) 15 percent of the available profits of the investment company or (b) an
amount which represented three times the contributions made by
officers or employees. This latter amount was to be cumulative, provided that in any 1 year the investment company should not contribute
more than 15 percent of its available p:ofits. The employee eontri.»

ANNUAL REPORT

bution,~
fixed at an amount each employee might elect which would '
'Constitu'U not less than 2 percent nor more than 5 percent of the
salary received by such employee during the year in which the contribution' was made. The proposed profit-sharing plan made no provision for the payment of dividend arrearages prior to contributions
to th.e profit-sharirig ,plan, although at least one of the investment
companies involved had dividend arrearages outstanding on its preferred stock. The plan also permitted officers and employees to include unrealized gains on securities as "profits" for the purpose of
calculating the company's contribution to the plan. After consideration of the provisions of Rule N-17D-l, the management determined
not to submit the proposed profit-sharing plan to the Commission
under the Rule, and the plan accordingly was abandoned.
Adoption of Rule N-28B-l: On June 7, 1946, the Commission
adopted an additional rule under the Investment Company Act of
1940 which authorizes real estate loans partially or wholly guaranteed under the Servicemen's Readjustment Act (the so-called GI bill)
as qualified investments for face-amount certificate companies. Such
companies are authorized to invest only in investments of a kind
which life insurance companies are permitted to invest in under the
provisions of the Code of the District of Columbia, and such other
investments as the Commission may authorize as qualified investments. Insurance companies are not authorized by the Code of the
District of Columbia to invest in Ioans guaranteed under the GI bill
but are so authorized by the GI bill itself. The effect of the new rule
is to extend a similar authorization
to face-amount certificate
companies.

Statistics Relating ~o Registered Investment Companies

At the beginning of the year, 366 companies were registered as investment companies under the Act. During the year 13 additional
companies became registered,' while the registration of 18 companies
was terminated and there remained 361 companies registered at the
close of the year. The assets of these 361 companies aggregated approximately $3,750,000,000. The comparative number of documents

Civil Actions Instituted under the Investment Company Act of 1940

In S. E. O. v. Diversified Fund Oorp., Humberto Moreno, et al.l
the Commission obtained a judgment enjoining Moreno from acting
as trustee of Diversified Fund Shares, a trust fund registered as an
investment company and sponsored by Diversified Fund Corp. Diversified Fund Corp. was also enjoined from serving or acting as investment adviser, principal underwriter or depositor of Diversified
Fund Shares. A, receiver was appointed for the assets of both the
trust fund and the sponsor corporation to hold the property and assets
of the corporation subject to the order of the court for liquidation
and distribution.
1 U. S. D. C., N. M., April 29, 1946.
The complaint charged defendants Moreno and
Diversified Fund Corp. with gross abuse of trnst in that they failed to comply with applicable provisions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 in suspending the right of redemption and in restricting the transferability of securities issued by the corporation, in failing
to have its securities verified by independent public accountants, and in falling to maintain
and preserve records regarding transactions with the trustee of Diversi1led Fund Shares.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS
ACT OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
investment advisers: persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others with respect to securities, The Commission
is empowered to deny registration to or revoke registration of such
advisers if they have been convicted or enjoined because of misconduct in respect of security transactions or have made false statements
in their applications for registration.
The Act also makes it unlawful
for investment advisers to engage in practices which constitute fraud
or deceit; requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of their
interest in transactions executed for their clients; prohibits profitsharing arrangements; and, in effect, prevents assignment of investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

In a proceeding brought by the Commission against Investment
Registry of America, Ina. for the revocation of its registrations as a
broker-dealer and investment adviser, the Commission branded as
"outright and crude" some of the frauds Committed by this firm as a
broker-dealer in transactions with its customers, and revoked its reg-:
istration as a broker-dealer upon a finding that the firm's practices
violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The practices involved taking secret
profits and using customers' free securities. The connection between
such frauds on customers and the devious methods deliberatelv employed by its officers and directors to extricate the firm from and. conceal its financial difficulties was underscored by the Commission.
The firm was also in the business of investment adviser and manv
of its customers had agreed to pay the firm a fee for its "selection" of
securities for their portfolios. This fee was 5 percent of the purchase
price, or less if so reduced by agreement. The firm, however, by
taking secret and unauthorized profits, made charges to these customers
as high as 9 percent, concealing these excessive charges by putting
101

-'

102

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

on its confirmation slips the phrase, "Includes I. R. A. charges," a
device held by the Commission to be plainly misleading and obscure.
The firm's application for registration as an investment adviser stated,
in part, that the firm gave unbiased investment advice to clients and
that its contracts provided for a maximum fee of 5 percent for the
selection of securities, representations patently false. The Commission found that the firm had, by failing to amend its application,
willfully violated Section 207 of the Investment Advisers Act and
revoked its registration as an investment adviser.

ACTIVITIES OF THE CO~SSION
VARIOUS STATUTES

UNDER

THE COMMISSIQN IN THE COURTS
CivilP~g8

A complete list of all instances in which the Commission appeared
before a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae,
during' the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the
year, IS set forth in Appendix Tables 19 and 24 to 34:.
Summarizing' these tables it appears that at the beginning of the
fiscal year 18 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted by the Commission were pending before the courts, in connection
with fraudulent and other illegal practices in the sale of securities,
26 additional proceedings were instituted during the year, and 22
cases were disposed of, ,?O that there remained 22 of such proceedings
pending at the end of the year. In addition.jhe Commission participated in a large number of reorganization cases,' in 24 proceedings
in the district courts under Section 11 (e) of the Holding Company
Act, and in 12 suits as amioue curiae to advise the court of its views
regarding the construction of provisions of statutes administered by
the Commission which were involved in private law suits. The Commission also participated in 50 appeals, exclusive of those involved
in reorganization proceedings. Of these, 28 came before the courts
on petition for review of administrative-orders,
5 were appeals in
actions brought by or against the Commission, 4: were appeals from
orders entered pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, and 13 were miscellaneous appeals.
The issues before the courts related chiefly to apparent or threatened
violations of the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Excha~e
Act of 1934:,to applications to carry out voluntary plans of compliance with the corporate integration and simplification provisions of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, to the fairness and
feasibility of plans of reorganisation, and to constructions of the
,Trust Indenture Act and Investment Company Act. Most of these
cases have been discussed in detail in other portions of this report in
.conneetion with the particular statute under which the action originated. There will be discussed below certain of the significant decisions of general application and interest, which have not been
treated elsewhere-in the report, including the amicus curiae cases.
During the year the Supreme Court decided, in S. E. O. v. H owey,2
that a contract for the sale of land devoted to the cultivation of citrus
f[0ves, when coupled with a contract to service the groves, was an
investment contract," and therefore constituted a security within
the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933. The defendant, wlio sought

to secure public investment in this enterprise without complying with
. the registration provisions of that Act, was enjoined from doing so.
The case, though it dealt. with only 0I!e ~ype of si~u.ationi is nevertheless of vast importance III the Commission's administration of the
Securities Act. It upholds the Commission's power to reach investment schemes involving securities which are masked under a variety
of forms-such as :purported sales of commodities and realty.
S. E. O. v, Penfield 00. of Oalifornia,s now pending before the
Supreme Court on petition for certiorari, illustrates, irrespective of'
the issues presented by that petition, a difficulty which the Commission may encounter as a law enforcement agency owing to the time involved in the necessary steps for judicial enforcement and review of
administrative subpenas. While the Penfield litigation is still pending, the enforcement problem it presents merits full treatment herein.
The extensive litigation there involved related to the Commission's
efforts to examine certain documents in the course of an investigation
into the sale of securities alleged to have been made by means of untrue statements of material facts and without registration.
Under
the Securities Act the Commission is authorized to issue subpenas "for
the :purpose of all investigations which, in the opinion of the Commission, are necessary and proper for the enforcement of this title."
It has similar broad powers of Investigation and subpena under other
statutes administered by it. These statutes thus contemplate inquiries by the Commission into possible criminal violations similar to those
which a grand jury would otherwise have to undertake. This parallel
to the grand jury function has been recognized by the Supreme Court.
Nevertheless, as illustrated in the Penfield case, there is always danger
that litigation delays may prevent the completion of an administrative investigation in time to permit prosecution before the statute
of limitations has become a bar. We do not, of course, wish to suggest that the Federal courts are unaware of the problem.'
The order and supplemental orders directing the investigation were
issued May 14, 1942~February 8, 1943, and April 8, 1943. The first
subpena duces tecum issued by the Commission was ignored and the
Commission was obliged to apply to the district court for an enforcement order. A.s a result of the disclosures revealed under this subpena, the supplemental orders were entered expanding the Commission's investigation and a new subpena duces tecum was served upon
one of Penfield's officials, requiring the production of specified items
contained in Penfield's books and records. Since Penfield also refused to comply with this subpena, the Commission was again obliged
to resort to a Federal district court for its enforcement. The district
court issued its order directing compliance with the subpena on June
1,1943. An appeal followed to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,
which affirmed the action of the district CO~'f
Def~ndaD;t then petitIOned to the Supreme Court for and was denied certiorari. In spite

TWELFTH AN¥UAL REPORT

of the judicially recognized lack of merit in the contentions advanced
by defendant the subpena was not obeyed, even after the mandate
was spread upon the record of the district court. Consequently, on
January 24, 1945, the Commission instituted civil contempt proceedings against the. defendant. While this litigation was in progress,
it was deemed necessary in view of the statute of limitations problem
to submit the case to a grand jury prior to completion of the investigation and the Penfield Company and several of its officials were,
indicted,"
,
.
Due to the pendency of this indictment the court, in the contempt
proceeding, expressed doubt as to whether the Commission was entitled to obtain the evidence requested until after the conclusion of
the criminal trial because that evidence might be used by the Government. Accordingly, the court postponed determination of the issue.
'The matter finally was heard on July 2, 1945, on which date the
defendant was adjudged to be in contempt. The court, however,
refused to grant a remedial decree calculated to coerce production of
Penfield's books and records. Instead it ordered defendant to "pay
a fine of $50, and stand committed until paid." Since such an order
did not enable the Commission to obtain access to the documents, an
appeal was taken. The circuit court reversed, ordering the entry of a
coercive decree, and the petition for certiorari takes exception to
, that decision. Thus, more than 4 years after the original order of
investigation the Commission still seeks access to the documents it
needs for its investigation.
The scope of the injunctive power granted in Section 36 of the
Investment Company Act was subjected to judicial review in Aldred
In'IJestment Trust v. S. E. 0.6 In that case a securities broker and
some associates purchased the equity in a registered investment trust
for a nominal sum-at a time when outstanding debentures were almost
'three times the market value of the securities in the -portfolio and
proceeded to manage -the trust for their personal profit. They invested a large portion of the funds in a speculative enterprise, a race
track, and installed themselves as officers of both the trust and the
race track at excessive salaries. Upon application of the Commission
the broker and his associates were enjoined from continuing in the
management of the trust and a receiver was appointed.
In the first case to involve a construction of provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act, Oontinental Bank ill Trust 00. of N. Y. v. First
National Petroleum Trust.'. the Commission filed a brief omicue
curiae expressing its interpretation of the Sections involved. The
action was brought by an indenture trustee against the issuer to recover certain items of alleged overdue interest and certain charges
and expenses incident to the action alleged to be owed by the issuer.
The issuer set up as an affirmative defense the fact that the holders of
a majority in principal amount of the debentures had directed the
plaintiffs not to bring suit before July 1, 1947, and that Section 316 of
the Trust Indenture Act, which had served as the basis for one of the
provisions of the indenture, permitted the vote of a majority of debenture holders to determine when suit for these items could be brought.
" The indictment ultimately was dismissed all to several of the defendants;
defendants were acquitted.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Commission took the view that a proper construction of Sections
31~~317arid 318of the Trust Indenture ~ct prohibited !J?eimpairment
of the right of a debenture holder to recerve payment of mterest unless
(1) 75 percent of the debenture holders consented to a postponement in
the payment', and (2) a provision of the.indenture stated that such a
postponement might be so obtained. The court entered judgment for
the plaintiff, sustaining the Commission's construction of the statute,
and finding there was neither the requisite 75 percent consent to the
postponement of payment nor a provision in the indenture authorizing
the granting of such consent.
.
Two actions during the year involved a construction of Section 14
-
(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In one, 8. E. O. v, TraruJamerica, 8 the Commission brought suit to restrain the defendants
from using proxy materials obtained. as a result of solicitations which
.did not include proposals which a minority stockholder, 'pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act and the Rules promulgated thereunder,
desired to bring before the annual meeting. The minority stockholder
sought amendments to the corporate bylaws and resolutions (1) to
permit the stockholders to amend the bylaws at any annual meeting
without the requirement that such proposed amendments be contained
in the corI?orati.on's not.ice of m~tin~; ~2) to cause !l~ual meetings
to be held in San FranCISCO,'California, instead of WIlmmgton, Delaware; 9 (3) to cause auditors to be elected by the stockholders and a
representative of the auditors last chosen to attend the annual meeting;
and (4) to require that an account of the proceedings at annual meetings be sent to all stockholders.
The district court permitted the
proxies to be used for the election of directors on condition that the
meeting be adjourned to a subsequent date when such other matters
as it might decide were proper subjects for action by the security
holders -
would be considered. 'In the final judgment subsequently
issued the court sustained the right of the minority stockholder to
have the notice of the annual meeting include his proposal to amend
the bylaws insofar as independent public auditors were concerned and
enjoined the management from violating Section 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act and proxy Rules X-14A-7 and X-14A-2 thereunder
in any respect. After the close of the fiscal year, cross appeals' were
taken from the judgment of the-court to the Third Circuit Court of
A ppeals. In the other action which arose under Section 14 (a) , Wyatt
v. Armstr07l.fl,lO the New York Supreme Court sustained the Commission's contention that a proxy solicitation was defective which did
not disclose that the directors elected had agreed prior to the solicitation to resign in favor of another slate of candidates.
.
Although, for the most part, the Acts administered by the Commission incorporate specific statutes of limitation, the nghts which
these Acts create sometimes give rise to equitable remedies for
which no limitation. is prescribed. ~t had been decided, in
Guaranty Trust 00. v, York,ll that when a State-created equitable
action was instituted in a Federal court, due to the diversity of citizen'ship of the parties, the statute 'of limitations prescribed by the State
was to be applied. In HoltmlJerg v; A'l"TTlbreah:t,ntheQ?~~Qn

appeared be~ore the Supreme Court as amicue curiae to urge that when
the jurisdiction of the Federal court is based upon a federally-crea.ted
equitable right, the broader Federal doctrine should be applicable,
which provides that where a party has been injured by fraudulent
conduct, the bar of the statute of Iimitations does not begin to run
until the fraud is discovered. The Supreme Court, sustaining the
Commission, ruled that federally-created equitable riglits of action
could not be barred, irrespective of State statutes of limitation, where
delay in bringing suit was attributable to the fraud of the defendants.
Four cases which were litigated during the period covered by
this report concerned constructions of Section 16 (b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Under this Section any profit secured by
officers; directors, and principal owners of equity securities in corporations registered on a national securities exchange as a result of purchases and sales of their corporation's securities within a 6-month
period, inures to the benefit of the corporation. The actions, as the
statute contemplates, were instituted by private litigants. However,
the Commission appeared in each case as amicus curiae to urge that
construction of the Section which it deemed best effectuated the intention of Congress in enacting the legislation. In one case, American Di8tilling 00. v. B.rown,1.8 the New York Court of Appeals refused to assume jurisdiction over the action on the ground that Section 27 -of the Securities Exchange Act conferred jurisdiction over
actions arising under that act upon the Federal courts only. This
was in accord with views expressed by the Commission. The two other
cases, Kogan v, Schiulte 14 and Pa:rk &: Tilford v. Schulte 15, involved
the conversion of preferred stock into common stock by a controlling
stockholder within 6 months of a sale of common stock by him. In
both cases the Commission contended that the conversion was a purchase within the 'meaning of Section 16 (b). The district court so
heldt and at the same time reaffirmed the constitutionality of that
Section upon the authority of Smolouie v. Delendo, 136 F. (2d) 231
(C. C. A. 2, 1943), oert. denied, 320 U. S. 751. Kogan, a minority stockholder, was denied intervention in the Park &: Tilford case by the
district court but the-circuit court reversed this action." The Commission filed a memorandum in this case supporting the right to
intervene on the ground that there existed a community of interest
between the corporation and the defendant, an owner of a substantial
number of its shares, which might militate against a completely
adversary action.
-

In the other case, Grata v, OlaJughton,u which is still pending in
the district court. the defendant contested the venue of the actIOn~
which was 'laid ill the place -where the transactions occurred, and.
the Commission filed a memorandum in support of that venue. It
WJl.S the view of the Commission that the statute should be construed
to J?rovide as many alternative choices of venue as could reasonably
be-Implied from the language of the Act in order that the express
P\U'P0se of-Congress, ''to prevent" insider profits, might be realized.
Otherwise' a' stockholder might be faced with the burden and expense

Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of statutory violations to the attorney general
who, in his discretion, may institute appropriate criminal proceedings.
As a matter of practice, the Commission, largely through its ten regional offices, thoroughly investigates suspected violations and, in
cases where the investigation appears to disclose a foundation for
criminal proceedings, prepares detailed reports of investigation which
are forwarded to the Attorney General. When it is decided to institute
criminal proceedings, the Commission assigns such of its employees as
have participated in the investigation to assist in the preparation of
the case for presentation to the grand jury, in the conduct of the trial
and in preparing briefs on appeal. Parole reports on offenders convicted also are prepared by members of the Commission's staff. Where
the investigation discloses violations of statutes other than those administered by the Commission, reference is made to the appropriate
Federal or State agency.
Up to June 30, 1946, in criminal cases developed by. the Commission,
indictments against 2,449 defendants have been obtained in 380 cases.
In the cases disposed of, convictions were obtained against 1,205 defendants. During the past year 15 indictments have been returned
against 45 defendants.
Convictions IS were obtained against 32 defendants in 16 cases during the year."
In the criminal appeals decided during the past year judgments of
conviction were affirmed as to 14 defendants." - One appeal was voluntarily withdrawn. There were no reversals of convictions.
The status of all criminal cases pending during the past fiscal year
is set forth in Appendix Tables 24 and 25.21 Some of the cases prosecuted during the past fiscal year are described below.
The types of fraud cases encountered during the past year are
extremely varied. These include fraud in the promotion of new
businesses and inventions; unlawful practices on the part of corporate officers; various frauds by broker-dealers; fraudulent whiskey
warehouse receipts promotions; failure to keep books and records as
prescribed by the statutes; and the filing of false financial statements
and annual reports with the Commission.
Charges of fraud and unlawful conduct on the part of brokerdealers figured prominently in the cases prosecuted during the year.
Among such cases was U. S. v. W. R. Hempstead and 00., et 01. (D.
R. I.) where it was charged, inter alia, that the company and three of
its officers solicited and accepted customers' orders for the purchase and
sale of securities and deposits of money and securities without disclosing that the company was insolvent. The indictment also charged
that the defendants hypothecated the said securities and converted the
proceeds to their own use and benefit," A somewhat similar case was
developed by the Commission in U. S. v. Ed'lDin PaUl Woodman, et til.
(D. Mass.) resulting in a guilty plea by the two defendants involved

warehouse receipts, The indictment charged that the owners of
whiskey warehouse receipts were induced to exchange them for bottling contracts with a corporation which defendants had organized.
It was charged that defendants had represented that the whiskey
could be bottled, rectified and sold for the investors, for which the
corporation would receive only a small fee, whereas in fact the defendants sold or hypothecated the warehouse receipts and converted
the-proceeds to their own use.S8 U.8. v. Frank L. Ryan. et al, (E. D.

An indictment charging violations of 'Section 10 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule X-10B-5 thereunder, as well as
the mail fraud statute (Section 215 of the Federal Criminal Code) was
returned during the past year in U. S. v. Edgar M. Griswold (N. D.
Ohio) . It was charged that Griswold had defrauded various persons, principally tavern owners, in transactions relating to the stock
of a prominent distilling ~ompan:y. Whiskey purchase rights were
attached to the stock. Griswold, It was alleged, represented to purchasers that the stock would be worthless after the whiskey rights were
exercised and that it could not be retained by the purchasers after
such exercise. According to the indictment, Griswold, by virtue of
these false representations and his failure to disclose that the stock
had a market value of not less than $24 a share after exercise of~the
whiskey rights, was enabled .to obtain the stock for his own use and
in fraud of the original purchasers thereof. The case is now pending.
A "front money" scheme in which persons desirous of obtaining
capital for the financing of new businesses were defrauded was involved in U. S. v. Ooie O. Walker (N. D. Texas). It was charged
that Walker devised a scheme to defraud persons who could be induced
by false representations to. turn money over to him upon his promise
to arrange for the organization of corporations and to assist such
persons in the sale of the stock of such corporations whim organized.

COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission received during the year 7,669 items of mail concerned with alleged securities VIolations. This correspondence is
classified administratively as "complaint enforcement" correspondence.
This material constitutes one of the Commission's important sources
of information concerning possible securities violations, while investigations made by the Cominission's staff and contacts maintained with
other governmental (Federal, State, and local) or private agencies
provide additional sources of such mformation.
Where it appears
on the basis of any such data that any securities violation may have
occurred, the Commission conducts appropriate investigations by
means.of correspondence or the assignment of cases to field investigators 19 ascertain the facts of the particular case. The extent of these
investigatory activities of the Commission during the past lear, under
the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act 0 1934, Sections 12 '(e) and, (h) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

To assist its continuing enforcement and registration activities, and .

to provide a further means of preventing fraud in the purchase and
sale of securities, the Commission has established a securities violations file, consisting of a clearing house of information concerning
persons who have been charged with violations of various Federal
and State securities statutes. This clearing house' has been kept
up-to-date during the past year, as in preVIOUSyears, through the
cooperation of the United States Post OfficeDepartment, the Federal
Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials, State securities commissions, Federal and State prosecuting attorneys, police
officials and other public agencies, members of the National Association of Better Business Bureaus, Inc., and members of the United
States Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the past fiscal year the
Commission had assembled in these files data concerning an aggregate
of 46,924 persons against whom Federal or State action had been
taken in connection with securities violations. During the past year
alone additional items of information relating to 3,706 such persons
were added to these files, including information concerning 1,146
persons not previously identified therein.
The extensive use made of this clearing house of information is
suggested by the fact that during the past year the Commission
received, in connection with its maintenance, 2,394 "securities violations" letters or reports (apart from those mentioned above which are
classified as "complaint enforcement") and dispatched 2,915 communications in turn to cooperating agencies.
-'
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The preparation, filing and, in some cases, other publications of
financial statements for the information of the investing public and of
the Commission is a fundamental requirement under the Securities
Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935, and the Investment Company Act of
1940. To ensure the adequacy and reliability of such statements the
Commission is given, under each of these Acts, broad authority in
matters of accounting-including
important :functions with respect
to the basis, form, and content of financial statements. In those
areas where specific rules arid regulations as to the methods' of
accounting to be followed are neither practicable nor desirable, guides
are found in accounting principles which have been recognized as
sound by professional accountants generally. In this area chief reliance for the protection of investors and the public therefore rests
largely in the administrative determination of the applicable accounting and auditing principles and procedures properly to be followed
in the preparation of financial statements.
This large segment of the Commission's accounting activities presupposes constant contact and cooperation between the Commission
and representative professional bodies and, in those cases where the
accounting issue is of considerable importance and has wide application, may result in the publication of Accounting Series Releases. It
would be difficult to express in quantitative terms the extent of the
Commission's treatment of accounting questions by these administrative means. However, a very large portion of the time of the accounting staff is spent in the discussion of such cases with registrants and

TWELFTH ANNUAL REPORT

113

their accounting and Iegal advisers. In addition, there is an overgrowing volume of inquiries as to propriety of particular accounting
practices being made by accountants, and by companies not presently
subject to any of the Acts administered by the Commission, who wish
to ascertain the Commission's policy in such matters and thus utilize
and apply the Commission's experience to the facts of their own case.
'The organization of the accounting staff of the Commission is
especially designed to facilitate informal consideration of accounting
matters. The Chief Accountant acts as the Commission's chief adviser
and consulting officer on accounting matters and has general supervision over the establishment and execution of Commission policy with
respect to accounting and auditing principles or practices. He is assisted directly by an assistant chief accountant and, in addition, an
assistant chief accountant is assigned to and directly responsible for
the examination of financial data and other accounting work in the
three operating divisions, namely, the Corporation Finance Division,
the Trading and Exchange Division, and the Public Utilities Division.
The majority of accounting problems arises as a result of examination of financial statements received. Where the examination of the
statements reveals that the rules and regulations of the Commission
have not been complied with or that applicable accounting principles
have not been followed, the examining division directs the attention
of the registrant to the deficiencies by letter. These letters of comment
and the correspondence or conferences that follow continue, as in the
past, to be a most convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements.
.
\

Reconversion to Peacetime Activities and New Registrants

The past fiscal year has seen the cessation of hostilities and the lifting of wartime censorship and secrecy restrictions as they affected the
publication of financial information.
The effect on financial reporting
of the termination of war contracts and the reconversion of business
to a peacetime basis was anticipated in the last annual report. That
report discussed the adoption in July 1945 of a program of quarterly
reporting of dollar amounts of sales and unfilled orders showmg separately sales made pursuant to war contracts.
At the same time
immediate reports were required in the event of the termination of a
war contract the uncom~leted portion of which amounted to over 20
percent of the registrant s total sales for the previous fiscal year. This
program was designed to keep investors and the public abreast of
vital changes in the volume of business during the period of transition
from war production to peacetime operations."
The end of the war early in this fiscal year and the termination of
war contracts led to the recission of this reporting program and to
the adoption of a general program of quarterly reports of the volume
of business being done by most issuers having securities registered on
national securities exchanges."
Prior to adoption, preliminary drafts
of the proposed new rule and report form were modified to reflect
comments obtained from technical an"d professional associations, governmental agencies, national securities exchanges, individual companies, public accountants, attorneys, and many other interested persons.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Of particular interest is the adoption of the suggestion that if the
registrant publishes or issues to its stockholders a quarterly report
containing the information required by the new rule, such report may
be substituted for information called for in the form prescribed.
Initially insurance companies, investment companies, common carriers,
and public utilities were exempted by the rule. Following discussions
with representatives of the sugar industry at the close of the fiscal year
the rule was amended 89 to exempt companies primarily engaged in the
production of raw cane sugar or other seasonal single-crop agricultural commodity since such producers ordinarily have no sales in two
or more of their fiscal quarters.
An important problem of the current year which was forecast in
our last annual report involves the proper disposition of war reserves
and the treatment of war costs, losses, and expenses recognized during
the year. Throughout the year extensive consideration was given by
corporation and public accountants as well as the Commission to the
question of the extent to which 'current repairs and maintenance, strike
expenses, inventory losses, loss on war facilities, and plant reconversion
expenses might properly be charged back against war profits, thus
relieving the current income account. In view of the wide diversity in
opinion as to the proper treatment of such items, the problems were
submitted for comment to a large and representative group of registrants, professional and technical associations, financial services,
accountants, attorneys, and others concerned. A substantial majority
concurred in the staff proposal to deal with the problem during this
transition period by requiring a specific form of disclosure in the
financial statements.
The rule adopted
therefore required that where war items are
excluded from the income account and carried directly to. surplus or
reserve accounts, the net aggregate amount so excluded IS to be set
forth following the net income for the period. The nature, amount,
and treatment of such items, including the tax effect of the treatment
employed, is to be explained. In addition, appropriate disclosure is
required of any substantial war Items included in the income statement. Finally, a statement is required of the principle followed in
classifying particular items as attributable to conditions arising out
of the war or its termination.
A second major problem arising from war conditions was precipitated. by the President's termination on September 29, 1945, of the
period for the tax amortization of war facilities. For tax purposes,
emergency war facilities acquired after December 31, 1939, under
certificates of necessity could be amortized over a 60-month period or
less if the President declared the emergency ended prior to the elapse
of 60 months. The result has been that many companies have kept
their books on this tax basis and as of September 30, 1945, wrote
their emergency facilities down to zero. For assets not largely
amortized this resulted in a substantial amortization charge in 1945,
often for facilities having continuing usefulness for peacetime operations. If this procedure is followed in the preparation of general
financial statements, one result is that subsequent balance sheets .may
be viewed as understated because of the omission of substantial and

useful assets. At the same time postwar earnings will fail to include
a~y charges for the use of these assets, and to that extent may be
VIewed as overstated.
This problem is being actively debated in
business and professional accounting circles and is the subject of continuing study and research on the part of the Commission.
Another development has been an almost unprecedented flood of
registration statements for the sale of securities to the public. Elsewhere in this report it is noted that over 750 registration statements
were filed during the fiscal year. Many of these were for companies
~ith previous .r~gistration experience taking advantage of current low
interest and dividend rates to refinance their bond and preferred stock
issues. Many companies, however, were seeking new capital for the
first time since the enactment of the Securities Act of 1933 and in
other cases security holders in closely held enterprises were seeking
to sell part of their holdings to the public. Even in the first group
experienced accounting executives and public accountants with extensive experience with financial statements filed with this Commission encountered unique and controversial accounting problems
largely of a war or reconversion origin. Of the latter group many
had never before been subject to the financial reporting standards of
a stock exchange or of a securities commission; hence, "both the companies and in many cases their independent public accountants had
to face many new problems.
Mention has been made in previous reports of the' extensive use
of informal conferences and correspondence as a means of dealing
with difficult accounting and auditing questions. These administrative procedures have long proved extremely effective as a means- of
arriving at solutions of novel or complex questions since they afford
an opportunity not only to arrive at a mutual understanding of the
facts but also to work out a solution properly protective of investors'
interests and agreeable to all involved. In the case of new registrants
these conferences have been particularly useful in advance of filing as
a means of obtaining compliance with sound accounting and dis.elosure principles, thus avoiding deficiencies and delay when the filing
is made. Because of their importance to the efficient administration
of the Securities Acts, it is appropriate to describe two typical informal
procedures of this kind. '
The' first illustration is a case which involved the propriety of a
company's method of apportioning against income the. loss in useful
value of its fixed assets. The company followed an inventory and
retirement method. While agreeing that the method had long ago
been discredited among industrial companies generally (among public
utility companies in more recent years), this industrial company contended that the method was appropriate under the particular facts of
its case. After the initial correspondence four conferences were held,
at three of which the company's independent public accountants were
present. The Commission, after careful examination of the facts and
of the contentions presented in a written memorandum from the company adopted the staff recommendation that depreciation methods
be required in lieu of the inventory-retirement
method, because the
latter in fact resulted in an improper determination of profits as
between years and in an overstatement of balance sheet assets. In order
to allow the company ample time in which to make the change-over,

r

116

SECURITIES AND JjlXCHANGE COMMISSION

the company was permitted to give effect to the revision in its statements of the following year.
A second illustration involved the treatment of a stock dividend.
Inthe company's application, filed with the New York Stock Exchange
and with the Commission, for the registration of the necessary shares,
the company indicated that this dividend would be charged against
earned surplus at a per-share amount, stated in the application, representing the fair value of the shares to be issued. Later, in an amended
application, the amount per share of the charge against earned surplus
for the dividend was changed to a lesser amount represented by the
par value of the shares. The staff advised the company that applicable
accounting principles required a charge against earned surplus in the
amount of the fair value of the shares. However, in the company's
annual report filed shortly thereafter the accounting treatment to
which the staff had objected was followed. Moreover, the rerort of the
independent public accountants accompanying the company s financial
statements contained an explicit exception to the company's failure to
account for the dividend at fair value rather than the lower par value
figure. The company was again requested to change its accounting
treatment of the transaction, but declined to do so. After reconsidering its position and reviewing the case in detail, the staff again advised
the company that the annual report should be amended in accordance
with its earlier recommendations and those of the independent
accountants. Failing this, the staff indicated it would consider the I
report false and misleading and would accordingly recommend that
appropriate formal action be taken by the Commission to determine
whether the company had failed to comply with the provisions of the
Securities Exchange .Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
Following this interchange of views the statements were amended
without resorting to formal action..
Developments in the Field of Accounting Principles and Procedures

Certain developments in the field of accounting principles and procedures arising out of war conditions and reconversion to peaceful
pursuits have been mentioned in preceding paragraphs.
An associated problem, the proper treatment of corporate income taxes, was
of/articular
importance due to the existence of high wartime rates
an numerous differences in accounting treatment of substantial items
in determining taxable income and income for financial reporting
purposes. Extended discussions of this subject of "tax reductions"
or so-called "tax savings" which were in progress' at. this time last
year between the Commission and representatives of professional
accounting societies and others were concluded and the Commission's
opinion was published as Accounting Series Release No. 53.41 This
opinion "In the Matter of 'Charges in Lieu of Taxes'" contains an
extensive discussion of the Commission's views as to the procedures
to be followed in accounting for reductions in income taxes as a result
of premiums and expenses incurred in refunding bonds, substantial
loss sustained on the abandonment of properties, and the taking of
accelerated amortization on emergency war facilities.
This opinion dealt with a practice which had been growing up
for some time, a practice tolerated by some accountants and sincerely

advocated by others, pursuant to which the current income account
is charged, under the heading of income taxes or charges in lieu of
income taxes, not only with the actual amount of income taxes expected to be paid by the company but also with an additional sum
equivalent t? the reduction in taxes bI:ought. a~out by unusual circumstances ill a particular year. ThIS additional charge against
income is, in most .cases, offset eithe~ by a credit to surplus or. by
utilizing the reduction for some special purpose such as eliminating
a portion of unamortized discount on bonds. The amount of the
estimated reduction has been colloquially termed a "tax saving" and
the general problem. loosely referred to as the "treatment of tax
savings." The principal conclusions announced in the opinion were
that:
1. The amount shown as provision for taxes should reflect only actual taxes
believed to be payable under the applicable tax laws;
2. The use of the caption "charges or provisions in lieu of taxes" is not acceptable;
3. If it is determined, in view of the tax effect now attributable to certain transactions, to accelerate the amortization of deferred charges or to write off
losses by means of charges to the income account, the charge made should
be so captioned as to indicate clearly the expenses or losses being written
off.

During the year, efforts were continued Iookirig to a solution of a
perennial accounting issue-whether there are CIrcumstances under
which certain items of income, expense, or loss may justifiably be excluded from the computation of net income as shown by the profit
and loss statement and carried directly to earned surplus. Accountants have not yet agreed upon any general principles as to the proper
way of identifying such items and disposing of them. Nevertheless,
depending on the treatment of particular items of a nonrecurring or
unusual nature as between income or surplus, it is possible to vary
reported earnings within very wide limits, thus making intelligent
analyses and comparisons difficult and sometime impossible. A staff
study of charges and credits made directly to earned surplus, supplementing and extending earlier studies, reconfirmed the complete lack
of consistency in the treatment of surplus entries as between companies, between accountants, between the same company's reports for
different years, and between reports certified by the same accountants.
In addition, a round table discussion to consider the subject was
sponsored by the Commission and was attended by representatives of
accounting organizations and others interested in the problem. The
results of these studies have been made available to members of professional accounting groups specially interested in the problem and
a free exchange of Ideas between the staff and these groups has been
a feature of the past year. A summary of the results of the current
year's study was published in "The New York Certified Public Accountant." 42 It is believed that definite progress has been made
toward a more uniform treatment of these perplexing items.
Consideration of proposals for a thorough revision of the accounting requirements applicable to' management investment companies
as laid down in Article 6 of Regulation SoX was advanced considerably durin~ the year. A restatement of Article 6 incorporating many
of the recommendations of the National Association of Investment
.. William W. Werntz and Earle C. King, "An Analysis of Charges and Credits to Earned
Surplus," September 1946.\

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Companies and of the American Institute of Accountants was published accompanied by a comprehensive discussion of the proposals
and explanation of remaining points of difference between the Commission's staff and outside commentators. Announcement was made
on May 22, 1946, that a public conference would be held by the Commission on July 9, 1946t to consider the revised proposals." All
interested persons were invited to attend or to file any comments
desired. It may be noted that the procedure followed in the consideration of these important amendments to the Commission's accounting rules conformed substantially to that required by Section
4 of the Administrative Procedures Act which became law June 11,
1946,and, as to rule making, is effective September 11, 1946.
Other examples of the Commission's practice of discussing particular problems with specialists in various fields include a conference
with representatives of the New York Society of Security Analysts on
the subject of financial data secured by the Commission. Further,
attention was given to financial reporting by mining corporations and
a helpful conference was held with the American Institute of Accountants' subcommittee on mine accounting.
On June 20, 1946, the Commission announced that it had submitted
to Congress a report
recommending the extension of certain protective features of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to unregistered
corporations having at least $3,000,000 in assets and at least 300
security holders. The report contains studies of stockholders reports
of unregistered companies, the principal, if not the only" source of
public information as to the financial affairs of such companies. The
study disclosed that in practically every case the statements failed to
disclose information that is of considerable significance to investors.
Frequently, such companies failed to make public a full set of financial statements. In many cases, the available financial statements were
deficient as to the form and content of the balance sheet and income
statement and failed to make adequate disclosures in footnotes. In
some instances, it appeared that improper or unsound accounting
principles had been followed. The study showed that in 90 percent _
of the cases the statements were certified by public accountants.
An important conclusion of the Commission as expressed in the
report was that whatever a certifying: accountant's personal views
may be about the necessity or desirability of disclosure, it was apparent in the cases studied that management policy was the factor which
determined the nature of the annual report and that unless accountants
can point to legal requirements as to the extent of disclosure they are
often unable to insist on a position contrary to that of the management. The Commission further concluded that accountants need and
should have the support of the Commission's accounting regulations,"
It was noted that a similar finding with respect to the position of
accountants in Great Britain was made by a committee of the Board
of Trade investigating the need for amendments to the Companies
Acts,"

Several cases involving the use of inadequate or deliberately false
financial statements with the effect of working a fraud on investors
were considered by the Commission during the year. In the Matter of
Su1nurban Electric Seawrities OO.~7 is a sequel to the case reported in
this section of last year's report. That case reported an action taken
to. force the registrant to correct grossly inadequate financial statements. The current case dealt with a request for withdrawal of the
registrant's securities from listing and registration.
It seemed clear
that the inadequate financial information furnished to stockholders
prior to the intervention of this Commission assisted the management
in a program of repurchase of the company's senior securities while the
management retained its own holdings of all classes of securities. The
terms imposed for withdrawal from listing and registration and for
the continuance of the repurchase program included a vote by stockholders who had first to be furnished with company and consolidated
balance sheets, itemized surplus statements, and profit and loss statements conforming to generally accepted accounting principles, as of a
time within the past 12 months.
In the case of Albert M. GTeenfield & 00.,48 an unregistered company,
public investors had been sold long-term debentures which after business reverses and interests defaults sold in the over-the-counter market
at a considerable discount. In the spring of 1945, after a substantial
improvement in financial conditions due to the war, the company
through an affiliate (a relationship unknown to the investors) purchased some of the debentures at much less than their book value.
Investigation disclosed that the debenture holders were consistently
denied mformation but were referred to the indenture trustee who in
turn was repeatedly denied audited financial reports required under
the trust indenture.
The Commission's court action was withdrawn
after the company agreed to have its books audited by a representative
firm of accountants, to furnish copies of the .auditors' reports to the
trustee, and to furnish debenture holders audited reports in a form
satisfactory to the Commission. The company also was required to
offer to rescind all debenture repurchase transactions since the
initiation of the program in March 1945.
Two cases in which broker-dealer registrations were revoked included elements similar to the cases just presented. In one ~9 of the
cases material misrepresentations with respect to a company's financial condition assisted in inducing stockholders to sell their holdings
to agents of officers of the company. In this case the officers knew
-that the business was in a better condition than represented.
In
the other case, the company publicly offered and sold its preferred
stock without disclosure that statements and figures in the prospectus
used in connection with the sale were based on false, fictitious, and
misleading bookkeeping entries and on assets of doubtful value."
Developments in the Field of Auditing Practices and Professional Conduct

broker-dealer.

ants required by our Rule X-17A-5 has caused us some concern during
the past year. The two cases mentioned in the preceding paragraph
contained evidence of unsatisfactory work by public accountants.
Examination of reports filed during the year and correspondence
conducted in connection with some of the reports also indicate that
many broker-dealer audits are performed by accountants unfamiliar
with the Commission's requirements and apparently not well-versed
in the general requirements of up-to-date auditing procedure as set
forth in publications of the American Institute of Accountants and
.elsewhere, A thorough discussion of the problem was had with
representatives of the American Institute of Accountants following
which plans were made to undertake a program of education in an
effort to improve the work done in this special field. A general
editorial calling attention to the problem in very strong. ter:ms was
published in the Journal of Accountancy in June, 1946.51
In another field of business a case was considered by the Commission
in which it was found that the auditor was not independent and the
. audits made were not in accordance with generally accepted auditing'
standards applicable in the circumstances. 52 The record in the case
revealed that the accounting firm in question had certified the financial
statements of the registrant over a 5-year period. In one of those
years, the accountant engaged the treasurer and bookkeeper of the
registrant to do the detailed auditing work including the preparation
of working papers. In the other years, the detailed auditing work was
done by a member of the accountants' staff who did not make that
critical and objective examination which is the obligation of an independent accountant and in particular he failed to investigate
adequately transactions between the registrant and its parent and
affiliates and to disclose that substantial amounts of the receivables
and payables were due from or to the parent and affiliates. In four
of the years no adequate review of the auditing work was made either
by the head of the certifying firm or by a certified public accountant
who was engaged to review the working papers and to sign the report.
It was also found that the business relations of the head of the accounting firm and the president of the registrant were so intimate as to
preclude any independent approach to the audit.
'
STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES
Capital Markets

The Commission, during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1946, continued to compile and analyze statistics on the volume and characteristics of offerings and retirements of securities; the distribution of and
the changes in ownership of securities among different groups of institutional, corporate, and individual holders; and various other
aspects of capital markets statistics. Figures were released monthly
showing the volume of all new issues of securities known to have been
offered within the United States for cash sales in amounts of more than
$100,000,together with break-downs comparing the amounts of registered and unregistered issues, indicating the type of exemption; public
offerings and private placements; bonds, preferred stocks, and common
stocks; corporate and noncorporate issues; and the net proceeds in"A Warning to Auditors," June 1946, p. 447.

tended for refunding' and for expansion of plant and equipment and
working capital of each principal industrial group. Additional
break-downs of the dollar volume of securities registered under the
Securities Act of"1933 were released regularly showing the amounts
registered for exchange, conversion, etc., as well as for cash sale; the
volume of secondary as well as primary distributions; the amounts
offered through investment bankers and directly by the issuers ; the
volumes expected to be absorbed primarily by the general public, by
security holders, and by other special groups; and the distribution by
investment banking firms of underwriting commitments and syndicate management activities. Some of these statistics have been summarized in Tables 1 through 4 of the Appendix to this report.
In addition to information published on the capital markets, many
special adaptations of the basic data were made to problems met in
the day-to-day operations of the Commission and to questions raised
by other governmental agencies and by members of Congress. During
the year a detailed study was made and a report prepared for internal
purposes on new issues $100,000 to $300,000 in size exempted from
registration under the Securities Act as a result of the amendment to
Regulation A effective May 21, 1945. At the close of the fiscal year,
several r~:eorts were in preparation including an analysis of the extent
and significance of underwriters' speculative compensation (options,
etc.), long-term bank loans as a substitute for public offerings, and
private placements. Other studies planned for the next fiscal year
are a comprehensive analysis of the cost of flotation of securities, an
intensive study of the expenses involved in registration under the
Securities Act, an investigation of the success of flotations of registered
issues, a study of offerings to stockholders and by stockholders, including bail-outs, an analysis of the comparative experience of investors in registered and nonregistered issues, and a study of the
characteristics of investors in new securities.
Saving Study

The Commission continued its series of quarterly releases on the
volume and composition of saving by individuals in the United States.
These releases show the aggregate volume of individuals' saving, that
is, the increase in their assets less the increase in their liabilities,
exclusive of gains or losses from revaluation of assets. The figures
also show the components contributing to this total, such as changes in
securities, cash, insurance, consumers' indebtedness, and consumers'
durable goods.
Financial Position of Corporations

•

The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of all
United States corporations, exclusive of banks and insurance companies, was continued. These releases show the principal components of
current assets and current liabilities and an abbreviated analysis of
the sources and uses of corporate funds. In addition semiannual
supplementary tables were released showing a detailed break-down of
current assets and liabilities for various industry and size groups of
corporations registered with the 'Commission. It is intended in subsequent reports to present more detailed data on the sources and uses
of corporate funds, including a few additional income account and

122

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

balance sheet items, thus giving an up-to-date analysis of the financial
condition of corporations as well as a complete picture of the volume
\ and composition of corporate saving.
In December 1945, the Commission, together with the Department
of Commerce, inaugurated a series of quarterly releases on the plant
and equipment expenditures by United States businesses other than
agriculture. Shortly after the close of each quarter, these releases
present industry totals on the actual capital expenditures of that
quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. It
is intended in future reports to present additional data showing more
detailed classifications of industry groups and a size-of-company
break-down. These data provide a useful index of present and future
activity in the capital goods industries and capital markets and a
valuable barometer of business activity in general.
Survey of American Listed Corporations

During the past fiscal year, the Commission again released for public and Government use statistical data filed with the Commission by
registrants under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and the Securities Act of 1933. These data are summarized in a series of reports
.known as the "Survey of American Listed Corporations" showing individual data for each company as well as industry totals for 1,546
registered companies. One of these series of reports, "Data on Profits
and Operations, 1943-1944," was completed in the fiscal year. Principal items furnished in these reports on profits and operations are annual data on sales, costs and/or operating expenses; operating profits;
net profit before and after income taxes; depreciation, depletion, etc.;
maintenance and repairs; selling, general and administrative expenses; and return on net worth before and after taxes. Each of these
companies' reports also shows data before and after renegotiations
of all contracts, the amounts and effects of "carry-backs" of taxes and
data on termination of contracts whenever reported. A summarization of data on profits and operations for the period 1936-1944, inclusive, was also publicly released. These data for registered corporations, both on an individual company and industry basis, are
. currently being carried through 1945.
Under Rule X-13A-6A, termination of war contracts and quarterly
reports of registrants' total sales, war sales, and unfilled war orders
at the begfuning and at the end of each quarter were reported to the
Commission. These data were made public weekly in a series of releases. Summarization of these data was also released showing complete industry totals for the second, third, and fourth quarters of the
calendar year 1945. Under a new Rule, X-13A-6B, the majority of
registrants with the Commission are required to furnish quarterly
sales figures, and these data will be released each quarter as to both
individual companies and industry groups.
Investment Company Data

Data for- closed-end and open-end management investment companies were compiled and released quarterly showing purchases and
sales of their own stocks and bonds and changes in their portfolios
and in their principal asset items. '

Brokers and Dealers

During the past fiscal year, a study was made of the financial condition of 3,029 registered brokers and dealers reporting under Rule
X-17A-5.
The study showed their cash, aggregate indebtedness and
net capital, customer's free credits, bank loans and firm securities,
exempt and nonexempt, from which the ratios of the firms' cash to
free credit balances, the firms' nonexempt securities to net capital and
aggregate indebtedness to net capital are computed. This analysis
was made for Commission use. A more detailed study of the resources and liabilities of these brokers and dealers is now in preparation for the current fiscal year.
Stock Market Statistics

The Commission continued to publish indexes of weekly closing
prices of common stocks on the New York Stock Exchange; the
monthly market value and volume of sales on registered and exempted
securities exchanges; daily and weekly round-lot stock sales on the
two New York Exchanges, including short sales, weekly round-lot
stock transactions on the New York Stock Exchange for accounts of
members and nonmembers, weekly round-lot and odd-lot transactions.
on the New York Curb Exchange for accounts of members and nonmembers, and daily odd-lot stock transactions on the New York Stock
Exchange for odd-lot accounts of odd-lot dealers and specialists. A
number of these series are presented in appendix tables.
Special Studies

The Commission's staff continued its studies on various aspects of
trading in securities, including floor trading, margin trading, purchases and sales of domestic securities for foreign account, purchases
and sales of security options, and general research on exchange rules
and practices.
War Activities

As a continuation of the Commission's war activities, several members of the staff were loaned to various war agencies and committees
for special economic investigations in Germany and Japan.
OPINION WRITING OFFICE-FORMAL

OPINIONS

The Opinion Writing Office prepares drafts of the Commission's
formal opinions in contested cases arising under the Securities Act
of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of
1940. This Office has also been assigned the additional functions of
joint responsibility with the Solicitor's office in dealing with the problems raised by the Administrative Procedure Act and responsibility
for the preparation of compilations of annotations of the various
statutes administered by the Commission. It is contemplated that
these annotations will include reference to all Commission opinions,
to significant court decisions and to other relevant material and will
be prepared so that they may, when completed, be made available to
the public. The work of this office is done by a group of attorneys

124

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

under the direction of the Executive Assistant to the Commission who
serves as Head of the Office, an Assistant Head, and Supervising
Attorneys.
While engaged in the preparation of opinions, the attorneys are
completely Isolated from persons actively participating in the proceedings. It is an invariable rule that the attorney assigned to prepare an opinion must not have had any connection with any previous
phase of the case with respect to which the opinion is to be prepared.
After hearings have been held, and after consultation with the Commission, an attorney in this Office analyzes the entire record and
prepares a draft of the formal opinion in accordance with the Commission's instructions. In most cases he also prepares a narrative
abstract of the record. Commission experts are from time to time
consulted on technical problems arising in the course of the preparation of the opinion, but these experts are never individuals who have
participated in the preparation of the case or testified at the hearing.
When the draft of the opinion and the abstract of the record have been
completed, they are submitted to a supervising attorney, who reviews
the entire case and, in conjunction with the drafting attorney, 'revises
the draft. The revised draft is then submitted to the Assistant Head
and the Executive Assistant to the Commission and, thereafter, to the
Commission. After further discussion, the opinion may be modified,
amended, or completely rewritten in accordance with the Commission's
instructions.
In addition to the foregoing, the Opinion Writing Officealso assists
the operating divisions in the preparation of opinions in uncontested
cases and assists the officeof the Solicitor in the preparation of appeals
taken from formal decisions prepared by the Opinion Writing Office.
The Commission, during the past year, issued over 200 formal opinions under the Securities Act of 1933,the Securities Exchange Act of
1934,the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Some of the more significant
opinions are commented upon herein under the discussions of the
various statutes administered by the Commission.

CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS, REPORTS, OR
DOCUMENTS

Under the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934,the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935,the Investment
Company Act of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940,
.confidential treatment may be granted, upon application by
registrants, to information contained in reports, applications, or documents which they are required to file. Under the Securities Act of
1933 the Commission has adopted Rule 580, which provides that information as to material contracts, or portions thereof, will be held
confidential by the Commission if it determines that disclosure would
impair the value of the contracts and is not necessary for the protection
of investors. The other four statutes referred to are, in general, without specific restriction in this respect and empower the Commission to
hold confidential under certain conditions any information contained
in any reports required to be filed under those statutes. Disclosure of
information confidentially filed under the latter statutes is made only
when the Commission determines that disclosure is in the public
interest.
Although registrants may seek judicial review of decisions by the
Commission adverse to them, no petitions for such judicial review
were filed in any of these cases durrng the past fiscal year.

COMPLIANCE WITH THE ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEDURE

ACT

On June 11, 1946, Congress passed the Administrative Procedure
Act (Public Law 404, 79th Cong., 2d sess., 60 Stat. 238), the stated
purpose of which is "to improve the administration of justice by
prescribing fair administrative procedure." This Act is applicable
to most Federal administrative agencies, including this Commission.
Among other things, it contains requirements respecting the ;publication of information; prescribes procedures to be followed In the
adoption or revision of rules; specifies various procedural steps in the
adjudication of cases, including the separation of prosecutory and
investigatory functions from decisional functions in certain defined
types of cases and the issuance of intermediate decisions by subordinate
officersand final decisions by the a~ency; defines the status iurd powers
of examiners and other hearing omcers; and deals with the right and
scope of judicial review.
The Commission's existing organization and procedures in certain
respects afford greater procedural safeguards to all interested persons
than is required under the procedures specified in the Act, and the
passage of the Act does not appear, therefore, to require any substantial change in the Commission's organization or any major modifications of the essential features of the Commission's present practice.
The present procedure has been designed to afford a satisfactory
solution of the particular procedural problems arising under those
statutes. Descriptions of the Commission's organization and procedures have been made public, adequate notice of and opportunity
for the presentation of views on proposed rules and for partieipation in other Commission proceedings is provided, due publicity is given
to all official acts of the Commission affecting members of the public,
and advisory and interpretative services are rendered to persons to
assist them in complying with the requirements of the statutes. In
order to insure maximum impartiality in the preparation of the Commission's decisions, the Commission has maintained a separate Opinion
Writing Office,herein described, responsible directly to the Commission and functioning independently of any other divisions of the Commission's staff, to assist the Commission in preparing findings and
opinions in 'contested cases and in other cases where a separation of the
decisional function from the prosecutory function is desirable.

However, the Commission took several steps as a result of passage
of the Act. Although some of these steps post-date the period covered
by this report, we have deemed it important to comment on them
herein. A study of the Act and its legislative history as they relate to
existing Commission practice was undertaken and led to the drafting
of revised Rules of Practice which were adopted by the Commission
III time to become effective September 1, 1946, the date on which most
of the provisions of the Act became effective.53 It is expected that this
study will continue and that later changes in the Commission's procedures may be made in the event further problems arise under the
Act and in the light of any judicial interpretations which may be
issued.
.
Section 3 of the Act requires publication in the Federal Register of
certain information not heretofore published therein. In compliance
with that requirement, the Commission prepared and published a
detailed description of its central and field organization and of the
methods by which persons may secure information and make submittals and requests; 54 a description of informal and other procedures employed by the Commission and its staff,55and a description
of the various forms prescribed by the Commission under the several
statutes it administers."
Also prepared for publication is a compilation of interpretative opinions, issued under the several stat'utes administered by the Commission for the guidance of the public."
While it is not clear that publication in the Federal Register of interpretative opinions of this kind is required by the Act, the Commission considers such publication may be helpful to the public and that
it falls within the spirit of the act. It is also contemplated that any
future interpretative releases of this nature will also be submitted for
publication in the Federal Register.
THE COMMISSION'S STUDY OF UNREGULATED SECURITIES AND ITS
RECOMMENDATIONS TO CONGRESS

On June 19, 1946, the Commission forwarded to Congress a recommendation for amending Section 12 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 so as to close certain gaps in the pattern of investor protection
established by that Act and by other legislation administered by the
Commission. The amendment proposed by the Commission would
extend to investors in the larger unregistered corporations the same
benefits as to financial information, informative proxy-soliciting materials, and protection against trading by corporate insiders as are
now enjoyed by investors in the securities of registered corporations.
Accompanying the proposed amendment was a U8-page report, based
on a study made by the Commission, containing case histories and
other illustrative material in support of the Commission's conclusion
that abuses in unregulated securities are in some respects as great
.. The Commission's revised Rules of Practice. effective Sept. 11. 1946. and applicable to
proceedings instituted after that date, were published in the Federal Register on Sept. 11,

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

as anything the original Securities Exchange Act was designed to
abolish. The Commission's proposed legislation was introduced by
Representative Lea, chairman of the House Committe on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce, as H. R. 7151, and was recommended by the
President for earnest consideration by the Congress (House Doc.
No. 682, 79th Cong.). The text of the Commission's report, "A Proposal to Safeguard Investors in Unregistered Securities," was printed
as a House Document (House Doc. No. 682, 79th Cong.). However,
the bill was not submitted until the closing weeks of the session, and
Congress adjourned without having taken any action on it.
Certain vital protections for investors are available respecting the
publicly-held securities of many of the large corporations of the
country either because they are listed on national securities exchanges
or because the companies involved are subject to the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 or the Investment Company Act of
1940. As to these securities there are available much basic data about
the companies involved and issuers must file periodic reports with the
Commission as to their financial condition and earnings. These reports are public information; they provide the investor with the basis
for a rational appraisal of the value of securities and for an intelligent decision as to whether to buy or sell. Without such information,
securities trading tends to be a gamble, and the investor is at the mercy
of insiders exploiting inside sources of information.
As the House
Interstate Commerce Committee stated in 1934, "There cannot be
honest markets without honest publicity.
Manipulation and dishonest practices of the market place thrive upon mystery and
secrecy." G8 Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and the Investment Company
Act of 1940 the security holder is assured also that when his proxy is
solicited he will be fully informed about the matters to be raised at the
stockholders' meeting, and that he will be able to present his own
proposals through use of the proxy machinery.
In addition, there
are certain protections against trading abuses by corporate insiders.
Officers, directors and principal stockholders may not sell short the
securities of their own company, must file public reports of their
trading in such securities, and are accountable to the company for
profits made in trading in the securities of the company within any 6month period.
These provisions are contained in Sections 12, 13, 14, and 16 of the
Securities Exchange Act, and in cognate provisions of the Holding
Company Act and the Investment Company Act. They are not applicable in any degree to unregistered securities, with the result that,
as revealed in special studies conducted by the Commission and discussed in its report, many of the old evils still persist.
The Commission found, for example, in a sample group of the larger
type of unregistered company, that 50 percent of the balance sheets
released to the public were materially deficient :from the viewpoint of
the information needs of the investor. Some 13 percent of the companies did not even issue income statements. Yet all these companies
had substantial numbers of public stockholders. The proxy-soliciting
practices of unregistered companies were found tYEical of the pre-1934
era. Photocopy reproductions in the Commission s report show solici.. H. Rep. No. 1383, 73rd Cong., 2bd Sess. (1934) 11.

tations unaccompanied by disclosure even of the names of the persons
whom the proxy agents intended to elect as directors, blank check
authorizations to the proxy agents to ratify anything done in the past
and to vote for anything which conceivably could come up at the
meeting. In some cases the entire announcement to the stockholder
was set forth on the back of an ordinary post card.
To illustrate the practical effect upon the investor of such practices,
the Commission presented in summary form sixteen case histories
showing how in instance after instance unscrupulous promoters or
insiders have exploited investor ignorance to rille corporate treasuries
and to buy and sell securities on the basis of information obtained in
the course of their fiduciary duties at rates highly advantageous to
themselves. A pattern typical of the war and postwar periods consists of (1) extraordinary earnings by the company, (2) failure to
disclose such earnings to public security holders, and (3) purchase
of the holdings of the public investor by corporate insiders, sometimes
upon the open market without disclosure of the identity of the purchaser. Most such cases, the Commission observed, have involved
unregistered securities. And while cases of this character are within
the scope of the antifraud provisions of the securities legislation administered by the Commission, comparatively few can be reached in
this manner. As the Commission noted in its report, prevention of
such frauds through appropriate legislative safeguards is needed.
Many of the larger corporations, or their securities, are already,
registered under one or another of the statutes administered by the
Commission. However, a substantial number of large corporations
and important issues of securities are not. Nor does this appear to be
the result of any express design on the part of Congress. The original
Securities Exchange Act was intended to provide safeguards for investors in unregistered securities similar to those enjoyed by investors
in registered securities under Sections 12, 13, 14, and 16 of the Act. For
reasons stated in our report, the achievement of this objective was not
feasible in the early days of the Act, and a modification of the statute
was effected to conform to existing conditions. However, Congress
never abandoned its program of providing safeguards for investors in
unregistered securities, end in a series of enactments since 1934 has
taken concrete steps in that direction. Thus a 1936 amendment to the
Securities Exchange Act extended the reporting requirements of that
act to all new securities issues of substantial size, whether or not the
securities involved were listed on exchanges. The Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935 and the Investment Company Act of
U)40 contained provisions substantially similar to the reporting,
proxy-soliciting, and insider-trading features of Sections 12, 13, 14,
and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act. The Trust Indenture Act
of 1939 marked a further extension of reporting requirements. And
public reports in some measure similar to those filed with the Commission are required under other statutes of companies subject to the
jurisdiction of such agencies as the Interstate Commerce Commission,
the Federal Power Commission and the Federal Communications.
Commission.
The piece-meal development of the protective scheme has left a series
of gaps, and the Commission's report stated that these gaps should
now be filled, at least as to the larger corporations. The amendment

132

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

recommended by the Commission to Congress would make the provisions of Sections 12, 13, 14, and 16 of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 applicable to the securities of all corporations having assets of at
least $3,000,000 and at least 300 security holders. Exemptions would
be available for banks, for mutual insurance companies, for public
and charitable corporations, for corporations substantially all the
securitiea of which are held within a single State, and for certain other
categories. According to the Commission's estimates, some 1,500
companies which are not already registered would be subject to the
proposed amendment, and some 500 of these are already filing reports
with other public 'agencies which are comparable in their basic aspects
to those required by the Commission. The rule-making powers of the
Commission would be ample to prevent needless duplication of effort.
In its report the Commission discussed also the nature of the bur- -

dens that the amendment would place upon the companies affected.
It observed that Tittle or no administrative effort is required for
compliance with the proxy and insider-trading provisions. As to
the reporting provisions, companies which, do not file reports with
the Commission and which do not file comparable reports with other
agencies could in most instances meet the reporting requirements
without assuming any significant accounting burdens. The studies
of sample companies conducted by the Commission and discussed in
its report reveal, for example, that some 85 percent of the companies
. in the class which would be covered by the proposed legislation already
have their financial statements certified by public accountants. The
information that would be required is already on the books of most of
these companies, and the only question is whether it shall be made
available to their security holders and to the investing public.
The Commission noted that one beneficial effect of its proposed
program on the over-the-counter market would be that dealers in the
over-the-counter market, like the investor, would have the tools with
which to select securities on a truly informed basis. Dealers might
also expect to benefit to the extent that uniform reporting requirements would tend to decrease such private placements as may be
motivated by a desire to avoid the disclosure provisions applicable
to public offerings under the Securities Act of 1933.
VOLUME OF INFORMAL INTERPRETATIVE

ASSISTANCE

Attention is called throughout this report to the amount of informal
interpretative and advisory assistance which the Commission furnishes to the public in connection with the various Acts administered
by the Commission. This assistance is generally furnished by the
staff directly concerned with the problem presented or charged with
the responsibility for examining material filed with the Commission.
The Officeof Chief Counsel of the Corporation Finance Division, however, maintains an interpretative unit staffed with lawyers who are
available for aid as to the many problems which arise under the
various acts administered by the Commission.
As further illustrating the very considerable volume of such assistance necessarily rendered by the staff to registrants and other
interested parties concerned with the day-to-day regulatory work performed by the Commission, it may be noted that during the past year

TWELFTH

ANNUAL REPORT

133

the interpretative unit established in the Office of Chief Counsel of
the Corporation Finance Division alone received and gave appropriate
assistance in response to a total of 4,547 letters requesting such aid
with regard to a great variety of the functions assigned to the jurisdiction of that particular division. In addition, assistance was given
in many hundreds of conferences held by the lawyers of this unit with
members of the public, either in person or over the telephone.
INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL AND ECONOMIC MATI'ERS

At the request of other agencies concerned with foreign economic
policy, the Commission has participated in various activities connected
with the field of international finance, both as to the problems directly
involved in such matters and as to domestic affairs which reflect themselves in foreign economic policy. To this end the Commission had,
during the war years, loaned members of its staff to other agencies
and to the Army for specific assignments in foreign countries, the last
of which was the recent survey of the Japanese Zaibatsu.
Further, the Commission has appointed representatives to various
committees engaged in formulating and executing United States international economic policy. Among these are the Foreign Investment Policy Committee and the Committee on Private Monopolies
and Cartels (which are both subcommittees of the Executive Committee on Economic Foreign Policy) and the Staff Committee and
other committees of the National Advisory Council on International
Monetary and Financial Problems. The Commission also appoints
two representatives
to the Federal Committee on International
Statistics.
In the course of its operations, the Commission maintains a survey
of various aspects of these markets and makes this information available to such other agencies, either through its representatives on the
committees mentioned above or through its adviser on foreign investments. Further, the Commission makes or participates in special
studies to aid other agencies concerned with foreign economic and
financial problems. It has done so with respect to the debt status of
foreign countries applying for credit; the appraisal of the credit status
of foreign countries in the private capital market; the external interest rates of foreign borrowers and their effect on private investors;
and a study of foreign laws with respect to securities and investments.
Indicative of the Commission activities is the present participation
of the Commission in connection with the rendition of assistance and
advice to the United States Executive Directors of the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development with respect to the effect
of domestic laws and domestic markets on the flotation of its bonds
and the bonds of foreign countries guaranteed by the bank. With
respect to registration statements filed by foreign corporations and
governments seeking capital in the domestic market, the Commission
maintains, through its adviser on foreign investments, facilities for
liaison with other 'gove~ent
agencies having jurisdiction of the
problems involved, and for rendering of such aid and advice as it
might be called on to give.

1 The purpose of column I is to show the number of issuers having securities admitted to deahng under
the various bases for the admission of securities to dealing under the Act. Each issuer IScounted once under
each basis for admission of Its securities to dealing. For example, an Issuer having securities registered on
one or more exchanges and also admitted to unlisted trading privileges on one or more exchanges Is counted
once under "registered" and once under "admItted to unlisted trading privileges on registered exchanges."
This column is not totaled because of such duplications.

to dealing on all exchanges. Each issuer is counted only once, and the elumnatrons of the duplications in

having' securities admitted to unlisted trading privileges on registered exchanges 552 also have securities
