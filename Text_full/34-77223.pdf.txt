EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time until
May 30, 2016 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).
On June 5, 2015, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Public Administrative
and Cease-And-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8A of the Securities Act of 1933,
Sections 4C and 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Rule 102(e) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions and a
Cease-And-Desist Order (“Order”) against Computer Sciences Corporation, Michael Laphen,
Michael Mancuso, Wayne Banks, Claus Zilmer, and Paul Wakefield (“Respondents”).1 The
Order required Respondents to pay a total of $195,078,490.00 in disgorgement, prejudgment
interest, and civil money penalties to the Commission and created a Fair Fund pursuant to
Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended. Additionally, in two related

district court actions, defendant Robert Sutcliffe 2 was ordered to pay disgorgement in the
amount of $6003.33 and prejudgment interest of $1,060.62 and Edward Parker 3 was ordered
to pay disgorgement in the amount of $2,800.00 and prejudgment interest of $750.00, with all
district court payments to be made to the Commission and transferred into the Computer
Science Fair Fund. With all payments made, the total fair fund is $195,089,083.95.4
In its request for an extension of time, the Division states that it needs additional time
to prepare a distribution plan for the combined Computer Science Fair Fund.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the Division’s
request for an extension of time until May 30, 2016 to submit a Proposed Plan of Distribution
is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
