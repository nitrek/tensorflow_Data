ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 3654/February 29, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-15764
In the Matter of
GARY L. MCDUFF

ORDER REGARDING
CLARIFICATION REQUEST

On April 23, 2015, the Commission remanded this proceeding. See Gary L. McDuff,
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Release No. 74803, 2015 WL 1873119 (Apr. 23, 2015). On
February 18, 2016, after extensive summary disposition briefing, I held a telephonic prehearing
conference regarding the logistics of holding a hearing. During that conference the Division of
Enforcement stated it could likely present its case in chief in about one day, and Respondent
McDuff stated that his case would last multiple weeks. Although I ordered nothing beyond the
filing of status reports, I opined that the hearing should be limited temporally by limiting its
scope to “whether McDuff was acting as a broker or dealer at the time of his misconduct.” Id. at
*3; see Gary L. McDuff, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3632, 2016 SEC LEXIS 649 (Feb.
22, 2016).
On February 26, 2016, McDuff filed a document styled “Re: Ruling Clarification”
(Motion). McDuff argues, among other things, that my remarks at the prehearing conference
should be clarified, “so that if necessary [he] may seek Rule 400(a) review.” Motion at 1.
Construing the Motion as one for clarification, it is granted. To clarify, the Commission
directed me to consider only two issues on remand: whether McDuff was acting as a broker or
dealer at the time of his misconduct, and what sanctions, if any, should be imposed against him
in the public interest. See Gary L. McDuff, 2015 WL 1873119, at *3. The question of sanctions
was thoroughly addressed in the parties’ summary disposition briefing, and may not require
additional evidence. Nonetheless, I have issued no orders and made no final rulings on the scope
of the issues to be litigated at the hearing, and I intend to give both parties an opportunity to be
heard on that subject before the hearing commences. The Motion is denied in all other respects.
In particular, construing it as a request for certification pursuant to Rule 400(c), it is denied
because there is no ruling to certify. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.400.
SO ORDERED.
