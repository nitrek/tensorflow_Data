THOMAS R. DREILING, on behalf of
INFOSPACE, INC.,
Plaintiff-Appellee,
v.

NAVEEN JAIN and
ANURADHA JAIN, husband and wife and their marital community,
Defendants-Appellants.

On Appeal from the United States District Court
for the Western District of Washington

BRIEF OF THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION, AMICUS CURIAE,
IN SUPPORT OF REVERSAL AND OF POSITIONS THAT FAVOR
THE DEFENDANTS - APPELLANTS

INTEREST OF THE
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
The Securities and Exchange Commission, the agenCy responsible for the
administration and enforcement of the federal securities laws, submits this brief as
amicus curiae to address important legal issues relating to the "short-swing" trading

provision in Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, 15 U.S.c. 78p(b).
The objective of Section 16(b) is to deter corporate insiders from trading in their
companies' securities on the basis of inside information to which they have access by
virtue of their positions. Congress viewed shori-swing trading -- purchases and sales
occurring within a period of less than six months -- as a type of trading that posed a
particular risk of misuse of inside information. Therefore, it provided in Section
16(b) that any profits realized by the insider from such trading shall inure to and be
recoverable by the issuer. Although Section 16(b) actions are brought only by issuers
and their shareholders, and not by the Commission, the Commission has an interest
in assuring that Section 16(b) is properly construed.

INTRODUCTION
In this shareholder's actionbroughfunderSection 16(b) of the Exchange Act
on behalf of an issuer against a statutory insider to recover short-swing profits
allegedly realized from purchases and sales of the company's securities, the district
court entered a $247,122,712 judgt.nent in favor of the plaintiff ($202,551,696 in
profits and $44,571,016 in prejudgment interest). The relevant defendants, a
statutory insider and his wife, are alleged to have taken stock of the issuer from three
trusts established for the benefit of their children in violation of the terms of the
trusts and for no consideration. They also are alleged to have sold stock of the issuer
within six months of their acquisitions from the trusts. The district court held that
-2-

the defendants' acquisitions, for no consideration, constituted "purchases" under
Section 16(b). Dreiling v.Kellett,.281 F. Supp. 2d 1215 (W.D. Wash. May 14,2003).
And because the defendants paid nothing for the stock, the court held that the
purchase price was zero. Having so found, the court detennined that the profits
recoverable under Section 16(b) were the total amount of the proceeds from the·
defendants' sales of the stock. Dreiling v. Jain, 281 F. Supp. 2d 1234 (W.D. Wash..
Aug. 22,2003).
In the Commission's view, the district court erred by assigning a purchase
price of zero for the shares of stock. In so doing, the court failed to recognize that
when the defendants acquired the shares from the trusts, they simultaneously
incuriedan offsetting obligation -an obligation to return the shares to the trusts. In
light of this obligation, any gains due to fluctuation in the value or market price of the
shares inured to the trusts and not the defendants. To the extent that an insider
acquires securities subject to an obligation to return them, and in fact performs that
obligation before a shareholder demand for suit is made, he does not "realize" any
"profits"within;the meaning ofSection

16(b)~

Even if the Court does not agree that the obligation to return the shares
eliminated the potential for defendants to realize any profit under Section 16(b),
defendants should be permitted to deduct from.the proceeds of their sales the market
value of the shares at the

time of their acquisition.
-3-

This amount, at a minimum; was~

owed to the trusts and should be imputed as the "purchase price" of defendants'
shares. Further, if the first alleged acquisition of stock here was a "purchase," and the
defendants would otherwise be subject to liability for profits under Section 16(b),
they are entitled to the exemption from Section 16(b) liability provided by
Commission Rule 16a-9, 17 C.F.R. 240.16a-9, for their later acquisition of stock split
shares derived from the stock acquired in the first purchase. 1/
If the Court concurs in the view that defendants did not realize any "profits"

under Section 16(b), it need not address the question whether their acquisitions of
stock from the trusts were purchases, and we urge it not to reach that issue. Should
the Court nevertheless determine to address whether the acquisitions were purchases,
the Court should take into account the potential consequences that its resolution of
the issue might have under provisions other than Section 16(b). The statutory
definition of "purchase" (Section 3(a)(13), 15 U.S.c. 78c(a)(13» is applicable to the __
entire Act, including the antifraud provisions in Section 10(b), 15 U.S.C. 78j(b). The
Commission is concerned that, if the Court in this Section 16(b) case holds that a
purchase requires consideration, it may be difficult to limit such a holding to Section

1/

The Commission does not take any position on other legal issues presented by
the parties, and it takes no position on factual disputes. Nor does the
Commission; in- expressing legal positions that would result in reversal of the
judgment obtained by the plaintiff, endorse-the-alleged-conduct ofthe
defe"ndants in this case or any other matter. The Commission's only interest is
in the proper construction of the federal securities laws.

16(b). See Gustafson v. A/loyd Company, Inc., 513 U.S. 561,570 (1995) (holding that the
term "prospectus" has the same meaning throughout the Securities Act). The
Conurussion has traditionally taken a broad view of the term "purchase" in the
context of Section 1O(b) and does not consider the term limited, in that context, to
situations where consideration is exchanged. Indeed, the Second Circuit has held
that, for purposes of Section 10(b), a taking of securities for no consideration can
constitute a purchase. See International Controls Cop. v. Vesco, 490 F.2d 1334, 1343-44
(2d Cir. 1974).

BACKGROUND

1.

Facts 2./

Thomas R. Dreiling, a shareholder of InfoSpace, Inc. (''InfoSpace''), brought
this shareholders' action in September, 2001, on behalf of InfoSpace against Naveen
Jain, a founder and former CEO of InfoSpace, and AnuradhaJain, NaveenJain's
wife, alleging that they engaged in short-swing trading. J./ Plaintiff seeks recovery of
short-swing profits on behalf of InfoSpace under Section 16(b) of the Exchange Act.

2./

-These facts are taken from the district court opinions and from record
materials supporting the faet~ as set forth in the opinions.

J.!

Named as defendants in addition to Mr.. and Mrs. Jain are three trusts
established by the J ains for the benefit of their children.
-5-

NaveenJain and his wife established three trusts for tax purposes in mid1998. They are the NaveenJain Grantor Retained Annuity Trost No.1
("NJGRAT"), the Anuradha Jain GRAT Trost ("AJGRAT"), and the Jain Family
Irrevocable Trost ("Family Trost"). All three trusts were irrevocable. Declaration of
NaveenJain in Support ofJain Defendants' Motion for Summary Judgment, Dkt.
No. 71, Exhs. A, B, and C (1 ER 51,61, 71).1.1 The two GRATs were each initially
funded with two million shares of InfoSpace stock and the Family Trost was funded
with one million shares. NaveenJain and his wife received an annual annuity from
the two GRAT trusts, and the remainder of the trusts' estates were to be paid out to
their children. Unlike the GRATtrusts, the Family Trost paid no annuity to Mr. and
Mrs. Jain. AtulJain, Naveen Jain's brother, is the trustee of all three of the trusts and
is the owner of the trust estates until they are paid out to the children. Dreiling v.
Kellett, 281 F. Supp. 2d at 1217. See also Dedaration of Naveen Jain, Dkt. No. 71,

Exhs. A, B, & C (1 ER 51,61, 71).

purchases, subject them to liability for short-swing profits under Section 16(b). The
first purchase is alleged to have occurred in December 1998 when Naveen Jain
allegedly took one million shares· of InfoSpace stock from the NJG RAT Trust and
placed it in escrow to satisfy a personal indemnity obligation. Specifically, as
InfoSpace was preparing its initial public offering in late 1998, the board of directors
learned that N aveen Jain might have incurred liability for InfoSpace through options
grants and disputes arising out of commercial contracts. Accordingly, the board
required him to personally indemnify InfoSpace for potential claims against the
company by placing one million shares in escrow, with InfoSpace as the escrow
agent. 281 F. Supp. 2d at 1217.
On December 11, 1998, Naveen Jain executed an agreement with InfoSpace to
establish the escrow. Declaration of Richard Spoonemore ("Spoonemore Decl."),
Dkt. No. 83, Exh. 25 at 2-3 (2 ER 378-79). The law firm of PerkinsCoie, attorneys
for InfoSpace, drafted an amendment to the IPO registration statement stating that
NaveenJain had placed one million shares of common stock, previously held by the
NJGRATTmst~ in

escrow, with Naveen Jain retaining voting control over those

shares. Dreilingv. Kellett;·281F:Supp-:-2dat1217.. See, e.g., Spoonemore Decl., Dkt.
No. 83, Exh. 25 at 2-3 (2 ER 378-79). This amendment was filed with the
Commission.

See,e~g.,

Spoonemore Decl., Dkt. No. 83, Exh. 25 at 1 (2 ER 378)..

-7-

Over the period of a year, NaveenJain signed, or authorized his attorney in
fact to sign, several filings with the Commission stating that he had placed the
NJGRAT shares in escrow. Dreiling, 281 F. Supp. 2d at 1218. See also Spoonemore
Declaration, Dkt. No. 83, Exhs. 25-39 (2 ER 361-89). After one year passed with no
actions being brought against InfoSpace, Naveen Jain asked that. the stock in escrow
be released.- The board complied with his request in early 2000. 281 F. Supp.2d at
1218. Previously, the shares had been inadvertendy returned to the NJGRAT Trust
in connection with the exchange of pre-IPO stock certificates for post-IPO
certificates. Plaintiffs Motion for Summary Judgement and Response to Defendants
Motion for Summary Judgment (''Plaintiffs Response''), Dkt. No. 82 at 11.
The remaining three alleged purchases occurred in May 1999 when Mr. and
Mrs. Jain deposited shares owned by the trUsts into their personal brokerage account.
Specifically, at that time InfoSpace stock underwent a two-for-one stock split.
Pursuant to the split, InfoSpace issued new stock certificates representing the new
shares and sent them to its shareholders. The split shares were sent to th~ Jains,
either at InfoSpace~s-offices-or-attheir-homeAlthough the certificates were marked
as belonging to the trusts, Plaintiffs Response, Dkt 82, Exhs. 58,61, and the

After receiving the shares, H&Q sent N aveen Jain a draft letter of
authorization that purported to make a gift of the NJGRAT shares to him from the
trust. NaveenJain completed the fonn and returned it toH&Q. Similarly, Naveen
Jain's wife provided a letter of authorization purporting to gift the AJGRAT split
shares to her. Plaintiffs Response, Dkt. No. -82 at 14; Spoonemore Decl., Dkt. No.

As a result of these alleged purchases, tlu:ee deposits of InfoSpace stock were
made in an account designated as the J ains' pe:i:sonal trading account at H&Q: two

The Sales

There is no dispute regarding the Jains' sales of InfoSpace stock. On April 6,
1999, the J ains sold 1,000,000 shares of InfoSpace stock, receiving $85,600,000. On
April 12, 1999, they sold 210,000 shares for $17,955,000. And on May 13, 1999, they
sold 1,800,000 shares for $98,966,696. There is no dispute that each sale occurred
within six months of the alleged December 1998 purchase or one of the subsequent
three alleged May 1999 purchases. '281 F. Supp. 2d at 1237.

A paralegal at InfoSpace, who was responsibie for tracking share's, testified that
she first noticed the discrepancy in the Jains; account. Spoonemore Decl., ,

requested that InfoSpace undertake an internal investigation that identified a
transfer error. 281 F. Supp. 2d at 1218; Defendants Consolidated Response,

Decision of the District Court

The defendants moved for swnmary judgment, and the plaintiff responded
with a cross-motion for summary judgment. The district court issued a decision
denying the Jains' motion for summary judgment and granting the plaintiffs crossmotion. Dreiling v. Kellett, 281 F. Supp. 2d 1215 (W.D. Wash. May 14, 2003). The court
held that the defendants' acquisitions of the stock constituted purchases for purposes
of Section 16(b). See 281 F. Supp. 2d at 1222.
. Having received a favorable ruling on his cross motion for summary judgment,
the plaintiff moved for judgment as to the amount of profits to be recovered from
the Jains. In its decision granting plaintiffs motion, Dreiling v. Jain, 281 F. Supp. 2d 1234
(W.D. Wash. Aug. 22, 2003), the court wrote that "[c]alculating the profit in this case is
straightforward" because "[t]he Jains paid nothing for shares that were transferred,
and therefore their purchase price is $0." 281 F. Supp. 2d at 1239. The Jains were
therefore held liable for the full amount of the $202,551,696 in proceeds from their

DISCUSSION
I.

IN CALCULATING PROFITS THE DISTRICT COURT
IMPROPERLY DISREGARDED THE OFFSETTING OBLIGATION
INCURRED BY THE DEFENDANTS TO RETURN THE SHARES
OR, AT A MINIMUM, TO PAY TO THE TRUSTS THE MARKET
VALUE OF THE SHARES AT THE TIME OF ACQUISITION.
When the J ains took the shares from the trusts, they did not take them free and

clear. They incurred offsetting obligations to the trusts - - obligations that affect
whether they made a profit and, if S'O, how much. These offsetting obligations are
important in this case because Section 16(b) isa profits-based provision. It does not
declare conduct unlawful; it is a strict liability provision that allows recovery only if
the insider receives profits. 2/ In the case of a routine purchase, the calculation of
profits simply involves subtracting the agreed-upon purchase price from the agreedupon sales price, and the purchase price in this regard is the amount paid to buy the
shares. The Jains' acquisitions of stock, however, were not routine; there was no
agreed-upon price that they paid. This does not mean, as the district court
. concluded, that the Jains' profits should be calculated based on a "purchase price" of
zero. Rather, the profits determination must reflect that the purchase price was the
amount of the offsetting obligation that the Jains incurred. By disregarding that
obligation and using a zero purchase price, the district court departed from the

2/

See V Louis Loss &JoelSeligman, Securities Regulation 2345 n.28 (3d ed. 2001).
-12-

profits-based nature of Section 16(b). 10/
Thus, in detennining whether the J alnS realized profits, it is necessary to take
into account their offsetting obligation to return the shares to the trusts. Where a .
defendant incurs an obligation to return the securities that he has acquired, he cannot
realize any profits: any profits inure to the person from whom the securities were
acquired and not to the defendant. Because of the Jains' obligation to return the
shares to the trusts, the trusts effectively remained the beneficial owners of the
securities, even after the Jains acquired possession of them, and any benefits resulting
from fluctuations in the value of the securities were realized by the trusts and not by
the Jains.
The sitqation involved here is analogous to a loan of securities. Bona fide
pledges and loans of securities have longbeen regarded as being beyond the scope of
Section 16(b} because, as here, there is no change in beneficial ownership. See
Interpretative Release on Rules Applicable to Insider Reporting and Trading, Exchange Act
Release No. 18114,23 S.E.C. Docket 856, 1981 WI. 31301 at *61 n.64 (September
•. 24,1981). See also Log On America v. Promethean Asset Management LLC, 223 F. Supp.
2d 435, 449-50 (S.D.N.Y. 2001) (sales cannot be matehed·withsha£esb(}rIowedto

As discussed, infra pp.16-17, the insider should not be allowed to assert an··
offsetting obligation in this context unless he both had, and has satisfie<i,the
obligation.

cover short sales).
Because Section 16(b) is a strict liability provision that looks only to
defendants' "profits," failure to consider the lack of ariy change in beneficial
ownership can produce inappropriately harsh results. For example, consider an
insider who has held shares for several years. On January 1, the.insider sells the
shares; one month later, on February 1, he acquires shares from a trust as the J ains
did; and he returns the shares tothe trust one week later. It should be apparent that
the insider has realized no short-swing profit. Yet under the district, court's holding,
he would be liable for the full amount of the proceeds of his sale. 11/
Ignoring the offsetting obligation incurred by the Jains to the trusts, and
making the J ains liable for the full amount of the proceeds of their sales, is contrary
to Section 16(b)'s objective to recover shorl-swingprofits. Under Section 16(b)

~n

issuer is entided to recover profits made by a statutory insider from purchases. and
sales of the issuer's securities, but only within a period of less than six months. The
provision was not intended to recover long-term increments in the value of the
security. -In reviewing the abuses that gave rise to the enactment of Section 16(b), the
Commission stated in 1950:

11/ Under Section 16(b), the insider is liable irrespective of which transaction -the purchase or the sale - - occurs first.

-14-

'

The legislative history makes clear a basic purpose to deter
manipulative activity and abuse of inside information by
insiders. This purpose must of course be related to the
discrimination section 16(b} makes between long term
investment and short-swing speculation. * * * Congress
evidently did not intend to discourage those who manage
and control a company from having an investment stake in
it * * *.
Statement Upon Rule X-16b-6, Exchange Act Release'No. 4509 (Oct. 30, 1950) (quotedin
Kornfeld v. Eaton, 217 F. Supp. 671,676-677 (S.D.N.Y. 1963), aJfd, 327 F.2d 263 (2d

Cir. 1964». The district court's use of a zero purchase price impermissibly results in
recovery of any long-term increment in the value of the shares. Indeed, the district
court's judgment provides recovery of all gains in the value of the InfoSpace
securities occurring since the inception of the company.
Even if the Court does not agree that the obligation to return the shares
eliminated the potential for defendants to realize any profit under Section 16(b),
defendants should be permitted to deduct from the proceeds of their sales the market
value of the shares at the time of their acquisition. This amount, at a minimum) was
owed to the trusts: Imputing the value of the securities at the time of acquisition as
the purchase price is supported by the use of a similar method in another context
under Section 16(b). Rule 16b-6(c) requires looking to the price of the underlying
securities on the purchase and sale dates to calculate sho,rt-swing profits made on
transactions involving certain-derivative-securities: In addressing, that calculation, the

Commission said that "the maximum short-swing profit recovery is the difference in
market value of the underlying security between the date of the purchase and the date
of sale." Ownership Reports and Trading by Officers, Directors and Principal Security Holders,
Exchange Act Release No. 28869, 56 Fed. Reg. 7242, 7254,1991 WL 311110, at

The burden should be upon the insider to establish the existence and amount
of any offsetting obligation arising from his acquisition of the securities. 12/

12/

Sources for such an obligation include common law principles of trusts, torts,
and unjust enrichment. See, e.g., Restatement (Second) ofTrusts §291 (1959);
Restatement (Second) ofTorts §222A (1965); Restatement (Third) ofRestitution and
Unjust Enrichment, § 1 (tentative draft 2002). As applied to this case, for
example, "[a] basic rule of equity is 'that one should not be unjusdy enriched at
the expense of another.'" Bonneville PowerAdministration v. Washington Public
PowerSupp!y System, 956 F.2d 1497, 1505 (9th Cit:. 1992) (quoting l.:Jnch v.
Deaconess Medical CIT., 776 P.2d 681, 683 (Wash. App. 1989)). "A person who is
unjusdy enriched at the expense of another is liable in restitution to the other."
Restatement (Third) ofI,Vstitution and U'!iust Enrichment §1.
Property may not be transferred from a trust in violation of the terms of the
trust. See, e.g., In re Eustace' Estate, 87 P.2d 305, 307 (Wash. 1939). Whether the
defendant acted intentionally or, as the Jains claim here, innocendy, may not
make a difference under principles of unjustenrichrnent. A duty to provide
restitution can arise from even an "innocent conversion" of property, see
Restatement (First) ofRestitution, §154 (1937), and a "constructive trust may arise
even though acquisition of the property was not wrongful." Srymanski v.
Dtifault, 491 P.2d 1050, 1057 (Wash. 1972) (citing Restatement (First) ofRestitution,
§160). See also Omerv. Omer, 523 P.2d 957, 961 (Wash. App. 1974) (affirming
imposition of a constructive trust where there was no finding of fraud, .
misrepresentation, or overreaching). Thus under the law of unjust enrichment
the Jains incurred an obligation to returri the securities or, at a minimum, theit:
fait: mat:k~t value at the time of their acquisition from the trusts.. See Restatement
-16-

Moreover, in the absence of a contract evidencing the acquisition of the securities (as
in a bona fide loan), special care must be taken not to allow the insider to make a
spurious claim that he incurred an offsetting obligation to the person from whom he
acquired the securities. In order to ensure that he in fact incurred the requisite
obligation (here, to return the shares or to pay the market value at the time of
acquisition), and also to ensure that he retains no profits, the Conimission believes
that the insider should not be allowed to assert an offsetting non-contractual
obligation except where he not only had, but also has satisfied, that obligation. In
addition, in order to further ensure that the insider understood and fully appreciated
the obligation, satisfaction of the obligation ordinarily must take place prior to a
Section 16(b) demand for suit being made upon the issuer by a shareholder or, in the
absence of demand, prior to the filing of the complaint. 13/

(First)ofRestitution§154 and §160.

Here the securities allegedly acquired by the Jains were returned to the trusts in
2000. No demand upon the issuer was made prior to the filing of the initial
complaint in September 2001 on the ground that a demand would be futile.

demand upon the issuer in October 2001. First Amended Complaint, Dkt.

II.

IF NAVEEN JAIN'S ACQUISITION OF THE ESCROW SHARES IS
DETERMINED TO BE A "PURCHASE" BY HIM., HE IS
ENTITLED TO THE EXEMPTION IN RULE 16a-9 FOR HIS
SUBSEQUENT ACQUISITION OF STOCK SPLIT SHARES
DERIVED FROM THE ESCROW SHARES.
Should the court detennine that the alleged transfer of InfoSpace stock from

the NJGRAT Trust into escrow constitutes a purchase by NaveenJain for purposes
of Section 16(b), he is then entitled to an exemption from Section 16(b) liability for
his later acquisition of the stock split shares derived from the escrowed stock. Rule
16a-9(a), 17 C.P.R. 240.16a-9(a), provides an exemption from Section 16 for "[t]he
increase or decrease in the number of securities held as a result of a stock split * * *
applying equally to all securities of a class * * * ." In adopting Rule 16a-9, the
Commission reasoned that acquisition of additional securities through stock splits
should be exempt because "these are non-discretionary transactions, and do not
present the opportunity for abuse intended to be addressed by section 16." Ownership
Rpotts, 56 Fed: Reg. 7242, 7259, 1991 WL 311110, at *7259.

In December 1998, InfoSpace stock from the NJGRATTrust was alleged to
have been placed in escrow. On May 5, 1999, InfoSpaceundertooka two-far-one
stock split. Accordingly, if the alleged transfer of stock from the NJGRAT Trust into
escrow is deemed. a purchase. by N aveen Jain, the Jains held those shares at the time
they acquired the split shares derived from them in May 1999. Therefore, the
acquisition of the stock split shares derived from the escrowed NJGRAT shares, and
-18-

deposited in the Jains' H&Q account, would be exempted from Section 16 by Rule
16a-9. 14/ The Jains should not be held liable for any profits attributable to the sale
of shares matched with this acquisition.

14/

This exemption is inapplicable to the AJGRAT split shares or the Family Trost
split shares because the InfoSpace stock from which they were derived was
held by the trusts and.notbytheJains at the time theJains acquired those split
shares..
-19-

CONCLUSION
The judgment of the district court should be reversed because, whether or not
there was a purchase for purposes of Section 16(b), the defendants realized no profits
recoverable under that provision; because recovery should, in any event, be restricted
.to the difference between the market value of the shares at the time of their
acquisition and the proceeds from the defendants' sales of the issuer's stock; and
because the acquisition of stock split shares by the defendants attributable to stock
allegedly transferred into escrow is exempt under Rule 16a-9.
