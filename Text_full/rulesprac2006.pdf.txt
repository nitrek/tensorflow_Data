whether upon completion of review or appeal procedures or because further
review or appeal procedures are no longer available.
(i)

The Commission, with due regard to the public interest

and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, temporarily suspend
from appearing or practicing before it any attorney, accountant,
engineer, or other professional or expert who has been by name:
(A)

permanently enjoined by any court of competent

jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action
brought by the Commission, from violating or aiding and
abetting the violation of any provision of the Federal securities
laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder; or
(B)

found by any court of competent jurisdiction in an

action brought by the Commission to which he or she is a party
or found by the Commission in any administrative proceeding
to which he or she is a party to have violated (unless the
6

violation was found not to have been willful) or aided and
abetted the violation of any provision of the Federal securities
laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.
(ii)

Any person temporarily suspended from appearing and

practicing before the Commission in accordance with paragraph
(e)(3)(i) of this rule may, within 30 days after service upon him or her
of the order of temporary suspension, petition the Commission to lift
the temporary suspension. If no petition has been received by the
Commission within 30 days after service of the order, the suspension
shall become permanent.
(iii)

Within 30 days after the filing of a petition in accordance

with paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this rule, the Commission shall either lift
the temporary suspension, or set the matter down for hearing at a time
and place designated by the Commission, or both, and, after
opportunity for hearing, may censure the petitioner or disqualify the
petitioner from appearing or practicing before the Commission for a
period of time or permanently. In every case in which the temporary
suspension has not been lifted, every hearing held and other action
taken pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) shall be expedited in
accordance with Rule 500. If the hearing is held before a hearing
officer, the time limits set forth in Rule 540 will govern review of the
hearing officer's initial decision.
(iv)

In any hearing held on a petition filed in accordance with

paragraph (e)(3)(ii) of this rule, the staff of the Commission shall
show either that the petitioner has been enjoined as described in
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) of this rule or that the petitioner has been found
to have committed or aided and abetted violations as described in
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(B) of this rule and that showing, without more,
may be the basis for censure or disqualification. Once that showing
has been made, the burden shall be upon the petitioner to show cause
why he or she should not be censured or temporarily or permanently
disqualified from appearing and practicing before the Commission. In
any such hearing, the petitioner may not contest any finding made
7

against him or her or fact admitted by him or her in the judicial or
administrative proceeding upon which the proceeding under this
paragraph (e)(3) is predicated. A person who has consented to the
entry of a permanent injunction as described in paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A)
of this rule without admitting the facts set forth in the complaint shall
be presumed for all purposes under this paragraph (e)(3) to have been
enjoined by reason of the misconduct alleged in the complaint.
(4)

Filing of Prior Orders. Any person appearing or practicing

before the Commission who has been the subject of an order, judgment,
decree, or finding as set forth in paragraph (e)(3) of this rule shall promptly
file with the Secretary a copy thereof (together with any related opinion or
statement of the agency or tribunal involved). Failure to file any such paper,
order, judgment, decree or finding shall not impair the operation of any other
provision of this rule.
(5)

Reinstatement.
(i)

An application for reinstatement of a person permanently

suspended or disqualified under paragraph (e)(1) or (e)(3) of this rule
may be made at any time, and the applicant may, in the Commission's
discretion, be afforded a hearing; however, the suspension or
disqualification shall continue unless and until the applicant has been
reinstated by the Commission for good cause shown.
(ii)

Any person suspended under paragraph (e)(2) of this rule

shall be reinstated by the Commission, upon appropriate application,
if all the grounds for application of the provisions of that paragraph
are subsequently removed by a reversal of the conviction or
termination of the suspension, disbarment, or revocation. An
application for reinstatement on any other grounds by any person
suspended under paragraph (e)(2) of this rule may be filed at any time
and the applicant shall be accorded an opportunity for a hearing in the
matter; however, such suspension shall continue unless and until the
applicant has been reinstated by order of the Commission for good
cause shown.

Rule 151.
(a)

Filing of Papers with the Commission: Procedure.
When to File. All papers required to be served by a party upon any

person shall be filed contemporaneously with the Commission. Papers required to
be filed with the Commission must be received within the time limit, if any, for
16

such filing. Filing with the Commission may be made by facsimile transmission if
the party also contemporaneously transmits to the Commission a non-facsimile
original with a manual signature. However, any person filing with the Commission
by facsimile transmission will be responsible for assuring that the Commission
receives a complete and legible filing within the time limit set for such filing.
(b)

Where to File. Filing of papers with the Commission shall be made

by filing them with the Secretary. When a proceeding is assigned to a hearing
officer, a person making a filing with the Secretary shall promptly provide to the
hearing officer a copy of any such filing, provided, however, that the hearing
officer may direct or permit filings to be made with him or her, in which event the
hearing officer shall note thereon the filing date and promptly provide the
Secretary with either the original or a copy of any such filings.
(c)

To Whom to Direct the Filing. Unless otherwise provided, where the

Commission has assigned a case to a hearing officer, all motions, objections,
applications or other filings made during a proceeding prior to the filing of an
initial decision therein, or, if no initial decision is to be filed, prior to the time fixed
for the filing of briefs with the Commission, shall be directed to and decided by the
hearing officer.
(d)

Certificate of Service. Papers filed with the Commission or a hearing

officer shall be accompanied by a certificate stating the name of the person or
persons served, the date of service, the method of service and the mailing address
or facsimile telephone number to which service was made, if not made in person.
If the method of service to any party is different from the method of service to any

defined in Rule 101(a) shall:

(2)

be typewritten or printed in 12-point or larger typeface or

otherwise reproduced by a process that produces permanent and plainly
legible copies;

the Commission, are not suitable for computer scanning or microfilming may be

facsimile transmission. The non-facsimile original must be accompanied by a
statement of the date on which, and the facsimile number to which, the party made
transmission of the facsimile filing.

18

Rule 153.
(a)

Filing of Papers: Signature Requirement and Effect.

General Requirements. Following the issuance of an order instituting

proceedings, every filing of a party represented by counsel shall be signed by at
least one counsel of record in his or her name and shall state that counsel's business
address and telephone number. A party who acts as his or her own counsel shall
sign his or her individual name and state his or her address and telephone number
on every filing.
(b)

Effect of Signature.
(1)

The signature of a counsel or party shall constitute a

certification that:
(i)

the person signing the filing has read the filing;

(ii)

to the best of his or her knowledge, information, and

belief, formed after reasonable inquiry, the filing is well grounded in
fact and is warranted by existing law or a good faith argument for the
extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and
(iii)

the filing is not made for any improper purpose, such as

to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost
of adjudication.
(2)

If a filing is not signed, the hearing officer or the Commission

shall strike the filing, unless it is signed promptly after the omission is called
to the attention of the person making the filing.
Rule 154.
(a)

Motions.
Generally. Unless made during a hearing or conference, a motion

shall be in writing, shall state with particularity the grounds therefor, shall set forth
the relief or order sought, and shall be accompanied by a written brief of the points
and authorities relied upon. All written motions shall be served in accordance with
Rule 150, be filed in accordance with Rule 151, meet the requirements of Rule
152, and be signed in accordance with Rule 153. The Commission or the hearing
officer may order that an oral motion be submitted in writing. Unless otherwise
ordered by the Commission or the hearing officer, if a motion is properly made to
the Commission concerning a proceeding to which a hearing officer is assigned,
the proceeding before the hearing officer shall continue pending the determination
19

of the motion by the Commission. No oral argument shall be heard on any motion
unless the Commission or the hearing officer otherwise directs.
(b)

Opposing and Reply Briefs. Except as provided in Rule 401, briefs in

opposition to a motion shall be filed within five days after service of the motion.
Reply briefs shall be filed within three days after service of the opposition.
(c)

Length Limitation. No motion (together with the brief in support of

the motion), brief in opposition to the motion, or reply brief shall exceed 7,000
words, exclusive of any table of contents or table of authorities. The word limit
shall not apply to any addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable cases,
pertinent legislative provisions or rules, or relevant exhibits. Requests for leave to
file motions and briefs in excess of 7,000 words are disfavored. A motion or brief,
together with any accompanying brief, that does not exceed 15 pages in length,
exclusive of pages containing the table of contents, table of authorities, and any
addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative
provisions, or rules and exhibits, but inclusive of pleadings incorporated by
reference, is presumptively considered to contain no more than 7,000 words. Any
motion or brief that exceeds these page limits must include a certificate by the
attorney, or an unrepresented party, stating that the document complies with the
length limitation set forth in this paragraph and stating the number of words in the
document. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word count of a
word-processing program to prepare the document.
Rule 155.
(a)

Default; Motion to Set Aside Default.
A party to a proceeding may be deemed to be in default and the

Commission or the hearing officer may determine the proceeding against that party
upon consideration of the record, including the order instituting proceedings, the
allegations of which may be deemed to be true, if that party fails:
(1)

to appear, in person or through a representative, at a hearing or

conference of which that party has been notified;
(2)

to answer, to respond to a dispositive motion within the time

provided, or otherwise to defend the proceeding; or
(3)

to cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the

Commission or the hearing officer pursuant to Rule 180(b).
20

(b)

A motion to set aside a default shall be made within a reasonable time,

state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and specify the nature of the
proposed defense in the proceeding. In order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate, the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing
of the initial decision, or the Commission, at any time, may for good cause shown
set aside a default.
Rule 160.
(a)

Time Computation.
Computation. In computing any period of time prescribed in or

allowed by these Rules of Practice or by order of the Commission, the day of the
act, event, or default from which the designated period of time begins to run shall
not be included. The last day of the period so computed shall be included unless it
is a Saturday, Sunday, or Federal legal holiday (as defined in Rule 104), in which
event the period runs until the end of the next day that is not a Saturday, Sunday, or
Federal legal holiday. Intermediate Saturdays, Sundays, and Federal legal holidays
shall be excluded from the computation when the period of time prescribed or
allowed is seven days or less, not including any additional time allowed for service
by mail in paragraph (b) of this rule. If on the day a filing is to be made, weather
or other conditions have caused the Secretary's office or other designated filing
location to close, the filing deadline shall be extended to the end of the next day
that is neither a Saturday, a Sunday, nor a Federal legal holiday.
(b)

Additional Time for Service by Mail. If service is made by mail, three

days shall be added to the prescribed period for response unless an order of the
Commission or the hearing officer specifies a date certain for filing. In the event
that an order of the Commission or the hearing officer specifies a date certain for
filing, no time shall be added for service by mail.
Rule 161.
(a)

Extensions of Time, Postponements and Adjournments.
Availability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the Commission,

at any time, or the hearing officer, at any time prior to the filing of his or her initial
decision or, if no initial decision is to be filed, at any time prior to the closing of
the record, may, for good cause shown, extend or shorten any time limits

21

prescribed by these Rules of Practice for the filing of any papers and may,
consistent with paragraphs (b) and (c) of this rule, postpone or adjourn any hearing.
(b)

Considerations in Determining Whether to Extend Time Limits or

Grant Postponements, Adjournments and Extensions.
(1)

In considering all motions or requests pursuant to paragraph (a)

or (b) of this rule, the Commission or the hearing officer should adhere to a
policy of strongly disfavoring such requests, except in circumstances where
the requesting party makes a strong showing that the denial of the request or
motion would substantially prejudice their case. In determining whether to
grant any requests, the Commission or hearing officer shall consider, in
addition to any other relevant factors:
(i)

the length of the proceeding to date;

(ii)

the number of postponements, adjournments or

extensions already granted;
(iii)

the stage of the proceedings at the time of the request;

(iv)

the impact of the request on the hearing officer’s ability

to complete the proceeding in the time specified by the Commission;
and
(v)
(2)

any other such matters as justice may require.

To the extent that the Commission has chosen a timeline under

which the hearing would occur beyond the statutory 60-day deadline, this
policy of strongly disfavoring requests for postponement will not apply to a
request by a respondent to postpone commencement of a cease -and-desist
proceeding hearing beyond the statutory 60-day period.
(c)

(1)

Time Limit. Postponements, adjournments or extensions of

time for filing papers shall not exceed 21 days unless the Commission or the
hearing officer states on the record or sets forth in a written order the reasons
why a longer period of time is necessary.
(2)

Stay Pending Commission Consideration of Offers of

Settlement.
(i)

If the Commission staff and one or more respondents in

the proceeding file a joint motion notifying the hearing officer that
hey have agreed in principle to a settlement on all major terms, then
22

the hearing officer shall stay the proceeding as to the settling
respondent(s), or in the discretion of the hearing officer as to all
respondents, pending completion of Commission consideration of the
settlement offer. Any such stay will be contingent upon:
(A)

the settling respondent(s) submitting to the

Commission staff, within 15 business days of the stay, a signed
offer of settlement in conformance with Rule 240; and
(B)

within 20 business days of receipt of the signed

offer, the staff submitting the settlement offer and
accompanying recommendation to the Commission for
consideration.
(ii)

If the parties fail to meet either of these deadlines or if

the Commission rejects the offer of settlement, the hearing officer
must be promptly notified and, upon notification of the hearing
officer, the stay shall lapse and the proceeding will continue. In the
circumstance where:
(A)

a hearing officer has granted a stay because the

parties have “agreed in principle to a settlement;”
(B)

the agreement in principle does not materialize into

a signed settlement offer within 15 business days of the stay;
and
(C)

the stay lapses, the hearing officer will not be

required to grant another stay related to the settlement process
until both parties have notified the hearing officer in writing
that a signed settlement offer has been prepared, received by the
Commission’s staff, and will be submitted to the Commission.
(iii)

The granting of any stay pursuant to this paragraph (c)

shall not affect any deadline set pursuant to Rule 360.
Rule 180.
(a)

Sanctions.
Contemptuous Conduct.
(1)

Subject to Exclusion or Suspension. Contemptuous conduct by

any person before the Commission or a hearing officer during any
23

proceeding, including any conference, shall be grounds for the Commission
or the hearing officer to:
(i)

exclude that person from such hearing or conference, or

any portion thereof; and/or
(ii)

summarily suspend that person from representing others

in the proceeding in which such conduct occurred for the duration, or

Review Procedure. A person excluded from a hearing or

conference, or a counsel summarily suspended from practice for the duration
or any portion of a proceeding, may seek review of the exclusion or
suspension by filing with the Commission, within three days of the
exclusion or suspension order, a motion to vacate the order. The
Commission shall consider such motion on an expedited basis as provided in
Rule 500.
(3)

Adjournment. Upon motion by a party represented by counsel

subject to an order of exclusion or suspension, an adjournment shall be
granted to allow the retention of new counsel. In determining the length of

record. The Commission or the hearing officer may direct a party to cure any
deficiencies and to resubmit the filing within a fixed time period.

Failure to Make Required Filing or to Cure Deficient Filing. The

Commission or the hearing officer may enter a default pursuant to Rule 155,
dismiss the case, decide the particular matter at issue against that person, or
prohibit the introduction of evidence or exclude testimony concerning that matter if
a person fails:

24

(1)

to make a filing required under these Rules of Practice; or

(2)

to cure a deficient filing within the time specified by the

Commission or the hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (b) of this rule.
Rule 190.

shown at or before the expiration of such 14-day period.
(c)

Confidentiality of Materials Pending Final Decision. Pending the

determination of the application for confidential treatment, transcripts, non-final

Rule 191.

Adjudications Not Required to Be Determined on the Record
After Notice and Opportunity for Hearing.

(a)

Scope of the Rule. This rule applies to every case of adjudication, as

defined in 5 U.S.C. 551, pursuant to any statute which the Commission

notice and opportunity for hearing and which the Commission has not chosen to
determine on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing.
(b)

Procedure. In every case of adjudication under paragraph (a) of this

rule, the Commission shall (1) give prompt notice of any adverse action or final
disposition to any person who has requested the Commission to make (or not to

the publication of a Commission order, notice of the action or disposition shall be
deemed to be given by such publication.
(c)

opportunity for the submission of written comments by parties to the adjudication
or, as the case may be, by other interested persons, written comments received on
or before the closing date for comments, unless accorded confidential treatment

adjudication. The Commission, in its discretion, may accept and include in the
record written comments filed with the Commission after the closing date.
Rule 192.

Rulemaking: Issuance, Amendment and Repeal of Rules of
General Application.

(a)

By Petition. Any person desiring the issuance, amendment or repeal

of a rule of general application may file a petition therefor with the Secretary.
Such petition shall include a statement setting forth the text or the substance of any
proposed rule or amendment desired or specifying the rule the repeal of which is
26

desired, and stating the nature of his or her interest and his or her reasons for
seeking the issuance, amendment or repeal of the rule. The Secretary shall
acknowledge, in writing, receipt of the petition and refer it to the appropriate
division or office for consideration and recommendation. Such recommendations
shall be transmitted with the petition to the Commission for such action as the
Commission deems appropriate. The Secretary shall notify the petitioner of the
action taken by the Commission.
(b)

Notice of Proposed Issuance, Amendment or Repeal of Rules. Except

where the Commission finds that notice and public procedure are impracticable,
unnecessary, or contrary to the public interest, whenever the Commission proposes
to issue, amend, or repeal any rule or regulation of general application other than
an interpretive rule; general statement of policy; or rule of agency organization,
procedure, or practice; or any matter relating to agency management or personnel
or to public property, loans, grants, benefits, or contracts, there shall first be
published in the Federal Register a notice of the proposed action. Such notice
shall include:
(1)

a statement of the time, place, and nature of the rulemaking

proceeding, with particular reference to the manner in which interested
persons shall be afforded the opportunity to participate in such proceeding;
(2)

reference to the authority under which the rule is proposed; and

(3)

the terms or substance of the proposed rule or a description of

the subjects and issues involved.
Rule 193.

Applications by Barred Individuals for Consent to Associate.
P RELIMINARY N OTE

This rule governs applications to the Commission by certain persons, barred
by Commission order from association with brokers, dealers, municipal securities
dealers, government securities brokers, government securities dealers, investment
advisers, investment companies or transfer agents, for consent to become so
associated. Applications made pursuant to this rule must show that the proposed
association would be consistent with the public interest. In addition to the
information specifically required by the rule, applications should be supplemented,
where appropriate, by written statements of individuals (other than the applicant)
27

who are competent to attest to the applicant's character, employment performance,
and other relevant information. Intentional misstatements or omissions of fact may
constitute criminal violations of 18 U.S.C. 1001, et seq. and other provisions of
law.
The nature of the supervision that an applicant will receive or exercise as an
associated person with a registered entity is an important matter bearing upon the
public interest. In meeting the burden of showing that the proposed association is
consistent with the public interest, the application and supporting documentation
must demonstrate that the proposed supervision, procedures, or terms and
conditions of employment are reasonably designed to prevent a recurrence of the
conduct that led to imposition of the bar. As an associated person, the applicant
will be limited to association in a specified capacity with a particular registered
entity and may also be subject to specific terms and conditions.
Normally, the applicant's burden of demonstrating that the proposed
association is consistent with the public interest will be difficult to meet where the
applicant is to be supervised by, or is to supervise, another barred individual. In
addition, where an applicant wishes to become the sole proprietor of a registered
entity and thus is seeking Commission consent notwithstanding an absence of
supervision, the applicant's burden will be difficult to meet.
In addition to the factors set forth in paragraph (d) of this rule, the
Commission will consider the nature of the findings that resulted in the bar when
making its determination as to whether the proposed association is consistent with
the public interest. In this regard, attention is directed to Rule 5(e) of the
Commission's Rules on Informal and Other Procedures, 17 CFR 202.5(e). Among
other things, Rule 5(e) sets forth the Commission's policy "not to permit a . . .
respondent [in an administrative proceeding] to consent to . . . [an] order that
imposes a sanction while denying the allegations in the . . . order for proceedings."
Consistent with the rationale underlying that policy, and in order to avoid the
appearance that an application made pursuant to this rule was granted on the basis
of such denial, the Commission will not consider any application that attempts to
reargue or collaterally attack the findings that resulted in the Commission's bar
order.

28

(a)

Scope of Rule. Applications for Commission consent to associate, or

to change the terms and conditions of association, with a registered broker, dealer,
municipal securities dealer, government securities broker, government securities
dealer, investment adviser, investment company or transfer agent may be made
pursuant to this rule where a Commission order bars the individual from
association with a registered entity and:
(1)

such barred individual seeks to become associated with an

entity that is not a member of a self-regulatory organization; or
(2)

the order contains a proviso that application may be made to the

Commission after a specified period of time.
(b)

Form of Application. Each application shall be supported by an

affidavit, manually signed by the applicant, that addresses the factors set forth in
paragraph (d) of this rule. One original and three copies of the application shall be
filed pursuant to Rules 151, 152 and 153. Each application shall include as
exhibits:
(1)

a copy of the Commission order imposing the bar;

(2)

an undertaking by the applicant to notify immediately the

Commission in writing if any information submitted in support of the
application becomes materially false or misleading while the application is
pending;
(3)

the following forms, as appropriate:
(i)

a copy of a completed Form U-4, where the applicant's

proposed association is with a broker-dealer or municipal securities
dealer;
(ii)

a copy of a completed Form MSD-4, where the

applicant's proposed association is with a bank municipal securities
dealer;
(iii)

the information required by Form ADV, 17 CFR 279.1,

with respect to the applicant, where the applicant's proposed
association is with an investment adviser;
(iv)

the information required by Form TA-1, 17 CFR

249b.100, with respect to the applicant, where the applicant's
proposed association is with a transfer agent; and
29

(4)

a written statement by the proposed employer that describes:
(i)

the terms and conditions of employment and supervision

to be exercised over such applicant and, where applicable, by such
applicant;
(ii)

the qualifications, experience, and disciplinary records of

the proposed supervisor(s) of the applicant;
(iii)

the compliance and disciplinary history, during the two

years preceding the filing of the application, of the office in which the
applicant will be employed; and
(iv)

the names of any other associated persons in the same

office who have previously been barred by the Commission, and
whether they are to be supervised by the applicant.
(c)

Required Showing. The applicant shall make a showing satisfactory

to the Commission that the proposed association would be consistent with the
public interest.
(d)

Factors to be Addressed. The affidavit required by paragraph (b) of

this rule shall address each of the following:
(1)

the time period since the imposition of the bar;

(2)

any restitution or similar action taken by the applicant to

recompense any person injured by the misconduct that resulted in the bar;
(3)

the applicant's compliance with the order imposing the bar;

(4)

the applicant's employment during the period subsequent to

imposition of the bar;
(5)

the capacity or position in which the applicant proposes to be

associated;
(6)

the manner and extent of supervision to be exercised over such

applicant and, where applicable, by such applicant;
(7)

any relevant courses, seminars, examinations or other actions

completed by the applicant subsequent to imposition of the bar to prepare for
his or her return to the securities business; and
(8)
(e)

any other information material to the application.

Notification to Applicant and Written Statement. In the event an

adverse recommendation is proposed by the staff with respect to an application
30

made pursuant to this rule, the applicant shall be so advised and provided with a
written statement of the reasons for such recommendation. The applicant shall
then have 30 days to submit a written statement in response.
(f)

Concurrent Applications. The Commission will not consider any

application submitted pursuant to this rule if any other application for consent to
associate concerning the same applicant is pending before any self-regulatory
organization.

subdivision thereof, sent to or served on the underwriter; or, in the case of a
foreign or territorial person, sent to or served on its duly authorized
representative in the United States named in the registration statement,
properly directed in the case of telegraphic notice to the address given in
such statement. In addition, if such proceeding is commenced within 90
days after the registration statement has become effective, notice of the
proceeding shall be given to the agent for service named on the facing sheet
of the registration statement and to each other person designated on the
31

facing sheet of the registration statement as a person to whom copies of
communications to such agent are to be sent.

state the legal authority and jurisdiction under which the

hearing is to be held;
(3)

contain a short and plain statement of the matters of fact and

law to be considered and determined, unless the order directs an answer

officer may, at any time prior to the filing of an initial decision or, if no
initial decision is to be filed, prior to the time fixed for the filing of final
briefs with the Commission, amend an order instituting proceedings to
include new matters of fact or law that are within the scope of the original
order instituting proceedings.
(e)

Publication of Notice of Public Hearings. Unless otherwise ordered

by release to the public, by publication in the SEC News Digest and, where
directed, by publication in the Federal Register.
Rule 201.
(a)

Consolidation and Severance of Proceedings.
Consolidation. By order of the Commission or a hearing officer,

proceedings involving a common question of law or fact may be consolidated for
32

hearing of any or all the matters at issue in such proceedings. The Commission or
the hearing officer may make such orders concerning the conduct of such
proceedings as it deems appropriate to avoid unnecessary cost or delay.
Consolidation shall not prejudice any rights under these Rules of Practice and shall
not affect the right of any party to raise issues that could have been raised if
consolidation had not occurred. For purposes of this rule, no distinction is made
between joinder and consolidation of proceedings.
(b)

Severance. By order of the Commission, any proceeding may be

severed with respect to one or more parties. Any motion to sever must be made
solely to the Commission and must include a representation that a settlement offer

procedures necessary or appropriate for the proceeding with particular reference to:
(1)

whether there should be an initial decision by a hearing officer;

(2)

whether any interested division of the Commission may assist

in the preparation of the Commission’s decision; and
(3)

whether there should be a 30-day waiting period between the

issuance of the Commission’s order and the date it is to become effective.

Parties, Limited Participants and Amici Curiae.
Parties in an Enforcement or Disciplinary Proceeding, a Proceeding

to Review a Self-Regulatory Organization Determination, or a Proceeding to
Review a Board Determination.
(1)

Generally. No person shall be granted leave to become a party

or a non-party participant on a limited basis in an enforcement or
disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a determination by a selfregulatory organization pursuant to Rules 420 and 421, or a proceeding to
review a determination by the Board pursuant to Rules 440 and 441, except

person may state his or her views with respect to a proposed plan of

(b)

Intervention as a Party.
(1)

Generally. In any proceeding, other than an enforcement

proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review a selfregulatory determination, or a proceeding to review a Board determination,
any person may seek leave to intervene as a party by filing a motion setting
forth the person's interest in the proceeding. No person, however, shall be
admitted as a party to a proceeding by intervention unless it is determined
that leave to participate pursuant to paragraph (c) of this rule would be
inadequate for the protection of the person's interests.
(i)

in a proceeding under the Public Utility Holding

Company Act of 1935, any representative of interested consumers or
security holders, or any other person whose participation in the
proceeding may be in the public interest or for the protection of
investors or consumers, may be admitted as a party upon the filing of
a written motion setting forth the person's interest in the proceeding.
34

(ii)

in a proceeding under the Investment Company Act of

1940, any representative of interested security holders, or any other
person whose participation in the proceeding may be in the public

upon the filing of a written motion setting forth the person's interest in
the proceeding.
(2)

Intervention as of Right.
(i)

in proceedings under the Public Utility Holding

Company Act of 1935, any interested representative, agency, authority
or instrumentality of the United States or any interested State, State
commission, municipality or other political subdivision of a state shall
be admitted as a party to any proceeding upon the filing of a written
motion requesting leave to be admitted.
(ii)

in proceedings under the Investment Company Act of

1940, any interested State or State agency shall be admitted as a party
to any proceeding upon the filing of a written motion requesting leave
to be admitted.
(c)

Leave to Participate on a Limited Basis. In any proceeding, other

than an enforcement proceeding, a disciplinary proceeding, a proceeding to review
a self-regulatory determination, or a proceeding to review a Board determination,
any person may seek leave to participate on a limited basis as a non-party
participant as to any matter affecting the person's interests:
(1)

Procedure. Motions for leave to participate shall be in writing,

shall set forth the nature and extent of the movant's interest in the
proceeding, and, except where good cause for late filing is shown, shall be
filed not later than 20 days prior to the date fixed for the commencement of
the hearing. Leave to participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) may include
such rights of a party as the hearing officer may deem appropriate. Persons
granted leave to participate shall be served in accordance with Rule 150;
provided, however, that a party to the proceeding may move that the extent
of notice of filings or other papers to be provided to persons granted leave to
participate be limited, or may move that the persons granted leave to
participate bear the cost of being provided copies of any or all filings or
35

other papers. Persons granted leave to participate shall be bound, except as
may be otherwise determined by the hearing officer, by any stipulation
between the parties to the proceeding with respect to procedure, including
submission of evidence, substitution of exhibits, corrections of the record,
the time within which briefs or exceptions may be filed or proposed findings
and conclusions may be submitted, the filing of initial decisions, the
procedure to be followed in the preparation of decisions and the effective
date of the Commission's order in the case. Where the filing of briefs or
exceptions or the submission of proposed findings and conclusions are
waived by the parties to the proceedings, a person granted leave to
participate pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall not be permitted to file a brief
or exceptions or submit proposed findings and conclusions except by leave
of the Commission or of the hearing officer.
(2)

Certain Persons Entitled to Leave to Participate. The hearing

officer is directed to grant leave to participate under this paragraph (c) to any
person to whom it is proposed to issue any security in exchange for one or
more bona fide outstanding securities, claims or property interests, or partly
in such exchange and partly for cash, where the Commission is authorized to
approve the terms and conditions of such issuance and exchange after a
hearing upon the fairness of such terms and conditions.
(3)

Leave to Participate in Certain Commission Proceedings by a

Representative of the United States Department of Justice, a United States
Attorney's Office, or a Criminal Prosecutorial Authority of any State or any
Other Political Subdivision of a State. The Commission or the hearing
officer may grant leave to participate on a limited basis to an authorized
representative of the United States Department of Justice, an authorized
representative of a United States Attorney, or an authorized representative of
any criminal prosecutorial authority of any State or any other political
subdivision of a State for the purpose of requesting a stay during the
pendency of a criminal investigation or prosecution arising out of the same
or similar facts that are at issue in the pending Commission enforcement or
disciplinary proceeding. Upon a showing that such a stay is in the public
interest or for the protection of investors, the motion for stay shall be
36

favored. A stay granted under this paragraph (c)(3) may be granted for such
a period and upon such conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer
deems appropriate.
(d)

Amicus Participation.
(1)

Availability. An amicus brief may be filed only if:
(i)

a motion for leave to file the brief has been granted;

(ii)

the brief is accompanied by written consent of all parties;

(iii)

the brief is filed at the request of the Commission or the

hearing officer; or
(iv)

the brief is presented by the United States or an officer or

agency thereof, or by a State, Territory or Commonwealth.
(2)

Procedure. An amicus brief may be filed conditionally with the

motion for leave. The motion for leave shall identify the interest of the
movant and shall state the reasons why a brief of an amicus curiae is
desirable. Except as all parties otherwise consent, any amicus curiae shall
file its brief within the time allowed the party whose position the amicus will
support, unless the Commission or hearing officer, for cause shown, grants
leave for a later filing. In the event that a later filing is allowed, the order
granting leave to file shall specify when an opposing party may reply to the
brief. A motion of an amicus curiae to participate in oral argument will be
granted only for extraordinary reasons.
(e)

Permission to State Views. Any person may make a motion seeking

leave to file a memorandum or make an oral statement of his or her views. Any
such communication may be included in the record; provided, however, that unless
offered and admitted as evidence of the truth of the statements therein made, any
assertions of fact submitted pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph (e) will be
considered only to the extent that the statements therein made are otherwise
supported by the record.
(f)

Modification of Participation Provisions. The Commission or the

hearing officer may, by order, modify the provisions of this rule which would
otherwise be applicable, and may impose such terms and conditions on the
participation of any person in any proceeding as it may deem necessary or
appropriate in the public interest.
37

Rule 220.
(a)

Answer to Allegations.
When Required. In its order instituting proceedings, the Commission

may require any party to file an answer to each of the allegations contained therein.
Even if not so ordered, any party in any proceeding may elect to file an answer.
Any other person granted leave by the Commission or the hearing officer to
participate on a limited basis in such proceedings pursuant to Rule 210(c) may be
required to file an answer.
(b)

When to File. Except where a different period is provided by rule or

by order, a party required to file an answer as provided in paragraph (a) of this rule
shall do so within 20 days after service upon the party of the order instituting
proceedings. Persons granted leave to participate on a limited basis in the
proceeding pursuant to Rule 210(c) may file an answer within a reasonable time, as
determined by the Commission or the hearing officer. If the order instituting
proceedings is amended, the Commission or the hearing officer may require that an
amended answer be filed and, if such an answer is required, shall specify a date for
the filing thereof.
(c)

Contents; Effect of Failure to Deny. Unless otherwise directed by the

hearing officer or the Commission, an answer shall specifically admit, deny, or
state that the party does not have, and is unable to obtain, sufficient information to
admit or deny each allegation in the order instituting proceedings. When a party
intends in good faith to deny only a part of an allegation, the party shall specify so
much of it as is true and shall deny only the remainder. A statement of a lack of
information shall have the effect of a denial. A defense of res judicata, statute of
limitations or any other matter constituting an affirmative defense shall be asserted
in the answer. Any allegation not denied shall be deemed admitted.
(d)

Motion for More Definite Statement. A party may file with an answer

a motion for a more definite statement of specified matters of fact or law to be
considered or determined. Such motion shall state the respects in which, and the
reasons why, each such matter of fact or law should be required to be made more
definite. If the motion is granted, the order granting such motion shall set the
periods for filing such a statement and any answer thereto.

38

(e)

Amendments. A party may amend its answer at any time by written

consent of each adverse party or with leave of the Commission or the hearing
officer. Leave shall be freely granted when justice so requires.
(f)

Failure to File Answer: Default. If a party respondent fails to file an

answer required by this rule within the time provided, such person may be deemed
in default pursuant to Rule 155(a). A party may make a motion to set aside a
default pursuant to Rule 155(b).
Rule 221.
(a)

Prehearing Conference.
Purposes of Conference. The purposes of a prehearing conference

include, but are not limited to:
(1)

expediting the disposition of the proceeding;

(2)

establishing early and continuing control of the proceeding by

the hearing officer; and
(3)

improving the quality of the hearing through more thorough

preparation.
(b)

Procedure. On his or her own motion or at the request of a party, the

hearing officer may, in his or her discretion, direct counsel or any party to meet for
an initial, final or other prehearing conference. Such conferences may be held with
or without the hearing officer present as the hearing officer deems appropriate.
Where such a conference is held outside the presence of the hearing officer, the
hearing officer shall be advised promptly by the parties of any agreements reached.
Such conferences also may be held with one or more persons participating by
telephone or other remote means.

(13)

such other matters as may aid in the orderly and expeditious

at least one prehearing conference should be held.
(e)

Prehearing Orders. At or following the conclusion of any conference

held pursuant to this rule, the hearing officer shall enter a ruling or order which
recites the agreements reached and any procedural determinations made by the
hearing officer.

Failure to Appear: Default. Any person who is named in an order

instituting proceedings as a person against whom findings may be made or
sanctions imposed and who fails to appear, in person or through a representative, at
a prehearing conference of which he or she has been duly notified may be deemed
in default pursuant to Rule 155(a). A party may make a motion to set aside a
default pursuant to Rule 155(b).
Rule 222.
(a)

co-authored by the expert.
Rule 230.

Enforcement and Disciplinary Proceedings: Availability of
Documents for Inspection and Copying.

For purposes of this rule, the term documents shall include writings,
drawings, graphs, charts, photographs, recordings and other data compilations,
including data stored by computer, from which information can be obtained.
(a)

Documents to be Available for Inspection and Copying.
(1)

Unless otherwise provided by this rule, or by order of the

Commission or the hearing officer, the Division of Enforcement shall make
available for inspection and copying by any party documents obtained by the
Division prior to the institution of proceedings, in connection with the
investigation leading to the Division's recommendation to institute
proceedings. Such documents shall include:
(i)

each subpoena issued;

(ii)

every other written request to persons not employed by

the Commission to provide documents or to be interviewed;
(iii)

the documents turned over in response to any such

subpoenas or other written requests;
(iv)

all transcripts and transcript exhibits;

(v)

any other documents obtained from persons not

employed by the Commission; and

41

(vi)

any final examination or inspection reports prepared by

the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations, the Division
of Market Regulation, or the Division of Investment Management, if
the Division of Enforcement intends either to introduce any such
report into evidence or to use any such report to refresh the
recollection of any witness.
(2)

Nothing in this paragraph (a) shall limit the right of the

Division to make available any other document, or shall limit the right of a
respondent to seek access to or production pursuant to subpoena of any other
document, or shall limit the authority of the hearing officer to order the
production of any document pursuant to subpoena.
(b)

Documents that May Be Withheld.
(1)

The Division of Enforcement may withhold a document if:
(i)

the document is privileged;

(ii)

the document is an internal memorandum, note or writing

prepared by a Commission employee, other than an examination or
inspection report as specified in paragraph (a)(1)(vi) of this rule, or is
otherwise attorney work product and will not be offered in evidence;
(iii)

the document would disclose the identity of a

confidential source; or
(iv)

the hearing officer grants leave to withhold a document

or category of documents as not relevant to the subject matter of the
proceeding or otherwise, for good cause shown.
(2)

Nothing in this paragraph (b) authorizes the Division of

Enforcement in connection with an enforcement or disciplinary proceeding
to withhold, contrary to the doctrine of Brady v. Maryland, 373 U.S. 83, 87
(1963), documents that contain material exculpatory evidence.
(c)

Withheld Document List. The hearing officer may require the Division

of Enforcement to submit for review a list of documents or categories of
documents withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this rule
or to submit any document withheld, and may determine whether any such
document should be made available for inspection and copying. When similar
documents are withheld pursuant to paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iv) of this
42

rule, those documents may be identified by category instead of by individual
document. The hearing officer retains discretion to determine when an
identification by category is insufficient.
(d)

Timing of Inspection and Copying. Unless otherwise ordered by the

Commission or the hearing officer, the Division of Enforcement shall commence
making documents available to a respondent for inspection and copying pursuant
to this rule no later than seven days after service of the order instituting
proceedings. In a proceeding in which a temporary cease-and-desist order is
sought pursuant to Rule 510 or a temporary suspension of registration is sought
pursuant to Rule 520, documents shall be made available no later than the day after
service of the decision as to whether to issue a temporary cease-and-desist order or
temporary suspension order.
(e)

Place of Inspection and Copying. Documents subject to inspection

and copying pursuant to this rule shall be made available to the respondent for
inspection and copying at the Commission office where they are ordinarily
maintained, or at such other place as the parties, in writing, may agree. A
respondent shall not be given custody of the documents or leave to remove the
documents from the Commission's offices pursuant to the requirements of this rule
other than by written agreement of the Division of Enforcement. Such agreement
shall specify the documents subject to the agreement, the date they shall be
returned and such other terms or conditions as are appropriate to provide for the
safekeeping of the documents.
(f)

Copying Costs and Procedures. The respondent may obtain a

photocopy of any documents made available for inspection. The respondent shall
be responsible for the cost of photocopying. Unless otherwise ordered, charges for
copies made by the Division of Enforcement at the request of the respondent will
be at the rate charged pursuant to the fee schedule at 17 CFR 200.80e for copies.
The respondent shall be given access to the documents at the Commission's offices
or such other place as the parties may agree during normal business hours for
copying of documents at the respondent's expense.
(g)

Issuance of Investigatory Subpoenas After Institution of Proceedings.

The Division of Enforcement shall promptly inform the hearing officer and each
party if investigatory subpoenas are issued under the same investigation file
43

number or pursuant to the same order directing private investigation ("formal
order") under which the investigation leading to the institution of proceedings was
conducted. The hearing officer shall order such steps as necessary and appropriate
to assure that the issuance of investigatory subpoenas after the institution of
proceedings is not for the purpose of obtaining evidence relevant to the
proceedings and that any relevant documents that may be obtained through the use
of investigatory subpoenas in a continuing investigation are made available to each
respondent for inspection and copying on a timely basis.
(h)

Failure to Make Documents Available – Harmless Error. In the event

that a document required to be made available to a respondent pursuant to this rule
is not made available by the Division of Enforcement, no rehearing or redecision of
a proceeding already heard or decided shall be required, unless the respondent shall
establish that the failure to make the document available was not harmless error.
Rule 231.

Enforcement and Disciplinary Proceedings: Production of
Witness Statements.

(a)

Availability. Any respondent in an enforcement or disciplinary

proceeding may move that the Division of Enforcement produce for inspection and
copying any statement of any person called or to be called as a witness by the
Division of Enforcement that pertains, or is expected to pertain, to his or her direct
testimony and that would be required to be produced pursuant to the Jencks Act, 18
U.S.C. 3500. For purposes of this rule, statement shall have the meaning set forth
in 18 U.S.C. 3500(e). Such production shall be made at a time and place fixed by
the hearing officer and shall be made available to any party, provided, however,
that the production shall be made under conditions intended to preserve the items
to be inspected or copied.
(b)

Failure to Produce - Harmless Error. In the event that a statement

required to be made available for inspection and copying by a respondent is not
turned over by the Division of Enforcement, no rehearing or redecision of a
proceeding already heard or decided shall be required unless the respondent
establishes that the failure to turn over the statement was not harmless error.

44

Rule 232.
(a)

Subpoenas.
Availability; Procedure. In connection with any hearing ordered by

the Commission, a party may request the issuance of subpoenas requiring the
attendance and testimony of witnesses at the designated time and place of hearing,
and subpoenas requiring the production of documentary or other tangible evidence
returnable at any designated time or place. Unless made on the record at a hearing,
requests for issuance of a subpoena shall be made in writing and served on each
party pursuant to Rule 150. A person whose request for a subpoena has been
denied or modified may not request that any other person issue the subpoena.
(1)

Unavailability of Hearing Officer. In the event that the hearing

officer assigned to a proceeding is unavailable, the party seeking issuance of
the subpoena may seek its issuance from the first available of the following
persons: the Chief Administrative Law Judge, the law judge most senior in
service as a law judge, the duty officer, any other member of the
Commission, or any other person designated by the Commission to issue
subpoenas. Requests for issuance of a subpoena made to the Commission,
or any member thereof, must be submitted to the Secretary, not to an
individual Commissioner.
(2)

Signing May be Delegated. A hearing officer may authorize

issuance of a subpoena, and may delegate the manual signing of the
subpoena to any other person authorized to issue subpoenas.
(b)

Standards for Issuance. Where it appears to the person asked to issue

the subpoena that the subpoena sought may be unreasonable, oppressive, excessive
in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she may, in his or her discretion, as a
condition precedent to the issuance of the subpoena, require the person seeking the
subpoena to show the general relevance and reasonable scope of the testimony or
other evidence sought. If after consideration of all the circumstances, the person
requested to issue the subpoena determines that the subpoena or any of its terms is
unreasonable, oppressive, excessive in scope, or unduly burdensome, he or she
may refuse to issue the subpoena, or issue it only upon such conditions as fairness
requires. In making the foregoing determination, the person issuing the subpoena
may inquire of the other participants whether they will stipulate to the facts sought
to be proved.
45

(c)

Service. Service shall be made pursuant to the provisions of Rule

150(b) - (d). The provisions of this paragraph (c) shall apply to the issuance of
subpoenas for purposes of investigations, as required by 17 CFR 203.8, as well as
hearings.
(d)

Tender of Fees Required. When a subpoena compelling the

attendance of a person at a hearing or deposition is issued at the instance of anyone
other than an officer or agency of the United States, service is valid only if the
subpoena is accompanied by a tender to the subpoenaed person of the fees for one
day's attendance and mileage specified by paragraph (f) of this rule.
(e)

Application to Quash or Modify.
(1)

Procedure. Any person to whom a subpoena is directed, or

who is an owner, creator or the subject of the documents that are to be
produced pursuant to a subpoena, or any party may, prior to the time
specified therein for compliance, but in no event more than 15 days after the
date of service of such subpoena, request that the subpoena be quashed or
modified. Such request shall be made by application filed with the Secretary
and served on all parties pursuant to Rule 150. The party on whose behalf
the subpoena was issued may, within five days of service of the application,
file an opposition to the application. If a hearing officer has been assigned
to the proceeding, the application to quash shall be directed to that hearing
officer for consideration, even if the subpoena was issued by another person.
(2)

Standards Governing Application to Quash or Modify. If

compliance with the subpoena would be unreasonable, oppressive or unduly
burdensome, the hearing officer or the Commission shall quash or modify
the subpoena, or may order return of the subpoena only upon specified
conditions. These conditions may include but are not limited to a
requirement that the party on whose behalf the subpoena was issued shall
make reasonable compensation to the person to whom the subpoena was
addressed for the cost of copying or transporting evidence to the place for
return of the subpoena.
(f)

Witness Fees and Mileage. Witnesses summoned before the

Commission shall be paid the same fees and mileage that are paid to witnesses in
the courts of the United States, and witnesses whose depositions are taken and the
46

persons taking the same shall severally be entitled to the same fees as are paid for
like services in the courts of the United States. Witness fees and mileage shall be
paid by the party at whose instance the witnesses appear.
Rule 233.
(a)

Depositions Upon Oral Examination.
Procedure. Any party desiring to take the testimony of a witness by

deposition shall make a written motion setting forth the reasons why such
deposition should be taken including the specific reasons why the party believes
the witness will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing; the name and address
of the prospective witness; the matters concerning which the prospective witness is
expected to be questioned; and the proposed time and place for the taking of the
deposition.
(b)

Required Finding When Ordering a Deposition. In the discretion of

the Commission or the hearing officer, an order for a deposition may be issued
upon a finding that the prospective witness will likely give testimony material to
the proceeding; that it is likely the prospective witness, who is then within the
United States, will be unable to attend or testify at the hearing because of age,
sickness, infirmity, imprisonment, other disability, or absence from the United
States, unless it appears that the absence of the witness was procured by the party
requesting the deposition; and that the taking of a deposition will serve the interests
of justice.
(c)

Contents of Order. An order for deposition shall designate by name a

deposition officer. The designated officer may be the hearing officer or any other
person authorized to administer oaths by the laws of the United States or of the
place where the deposition is to be held. An order for deposition also shall state:
(1)

the name of the witness whose deposition is to be taken;

(2)

the scope of the testimony to be taken;

(3)

the time and place of the deposition;

(4)

the manner of recording, preserving and filing the deposition;

(5)

the number of copies, if any, of the deposition and exhibits to

and
be filed upon completion of the deposition.

47

(d)

Procedure at Depositions. A witness whose testimony is taken by

deposition shall be sworn or shall affirm before any questions are put to him or her.
Examination and cross-examination of deponents may proceed as permitted at a
hearing. The witness being deposed may have counsel present during the
deposition.
(e)

Objections to Questions or Evidence. Objections to questions or

evidence shall be in short form, stating the grounds of objection relied upon.
Objections to questions or evidence shall be noted by the deposition officer upon
the deposition, but a deposition officer other than the hearing officer shall not have
the power to decide on the competency, materiality or relevance of evidence.
Failure to object to questions or evidence before the deposition officer shall not be
deemed a waiver unless the ground of the objection is one that might have been
obviated or removed if presented at that time.
(f)

Filing of Depositions. The questions propounded and all answers or

objections shall be recorded or transcribed verbatim, and a transcript prepared by
the deposition officer, or under his or her direction. The transcript shall be
subscribed by the witness and certified by the deposition officer. The original
deposition and exhibits shall be filed with the Secretary. A copy of the deposition
shall be available to the deponent and each party for purchase at prescribed rates.
(g)

Payment. The cost of the transcript shall be paid by the party

requesting the deposition.
Rule 234.
(a)

Depositions Upon Written Questions.
Availability. Depositions may be taken and submitted on written

questions upon motion of any party. The motion shall include the information
specified in Rule 233(a). A decision on the motion shall be governed by the
provisions of Rule 233(b).
(b)

Procedure. Written questions shall be filed with the motion. Within

10 days after service of the motion and written questions, any party may file
objections to such written questions and any party may file cross-questions. When
a deposition is taken pursuant to this rule no persons other than the witness,
counsel to the witness, the deposition officer, and, if the deposition officer does not
act as reporter, a reporter, shall be present at the examination of the witness. No
48

party shall be present or represented unless otherwise permitted by order. The
deposition officer shall propound the questions and cross-questions to the witness
in the order submitted.
(c)

Additional Requirements. The order for deposition, filing of the

deposition, form of the deposition and use of the deposition in the record shall be
governed by paragraphs (c) through (g) of Rule 233, except that no crossexamination shall be made.
Rule 235.

Introducing Prior Sworn Statements of Witnesses into the
Record.

(a)

At a hearing, any person wishing to introduce a prior, sworn statement

of a witness, not a party, otherwise admissible in the proceeding, may make a
motion setting forth the reasons therefor. If only part of a statement is offered in
evidence, the hearing officer may require that all relevant portions of the statement
be introduced. If all of a statement is offered in evidence, the hearing officer may
require that portions not relevant to the proceeding be excluded. A motion to
introduce a prior sworn statement may be granted if:
(1)

the witness is dead;

(2)

the witness is out of the United States, unless it appears that the

absence of the witness was procured by the party offering the prior sworn
statement;
(3)

the witness is unable to attend or testify because of age,

sickness, infirmity, imprisonment or other disability;
(4)

the party offering the prior sworn statement has been unable to

procure the attendance of the witness by subpoena; or,
(5)

in the discretion of the Commission or the hearing officer, it

would be desirable, in the interests of justice, to allow the prior sworn
statement to be used. In making this determination, due regard shall be
given to the presumption that witnesses will testify orally in an open hearing.
If the parties have stipulated to accept a prior sworn statement in lieu of live
testimony, consideration shall also be given to the convenience of the parties
in avoiding unnecessary expense.
(b)

[Reserved]
49

Rule 240.
(a)

Settlement.
Availability. Any person who is notified that a proceeding may or

will be instituted against him or her, or any party to a proceeding already instituted,
may, at any time, propose in writing an offer of settlement.
(b)

Procedure. An offer of settlement shall state that it is made pursuant

to this rule; shall recite or incorporate as a part of the offer the provisions of
paragraphs (c)(4) and (5) of this rule; shall be signed by the person making the
offer, not by counsel; and shall be submitted to the interested division.
(c)

Consideration of Offers of Settlement.
(1)

Offers of settlement shall be considered by the interested

division when time, the nature of the proceedings, and the public interest
permit.
(2)

Where a hearing officer is assigned to a proceeding, the

interested division and the party submitting the offer may request that the
hearing officer express his or her views regarding the appropriateness of the
offer of settlement. A request for the hearing officer to express his or her
views on an offer of settlement or otherwise to participate in a settlement
conference constitutes a waiver by the persons making the request of any
right to claim bias or prejudgment by the hearing officer based on the views
expressed.
(3)

The interested division shall present the offer of settlement to

the Commission with its recommendation, except that, if the division's
recommendation is unfavorable, the offer shall not be presented to the
Commission unless the person making the offer so requests.
(4)

By submitting an offer of settlement, the person making the

offer waives, subject to acceptance of the offer:
(i)

all hearings pursuant to the statutory provisions under

which the proceeding is to be or has been instituted;
(ii)

the filing of proposed findings of fact and conclusions of

(iii)

proceedings before, and an initial decision by, a hearing

law;
officer;
(iv)

all post-hearing procedures; and
50

(v)
(5)

judicial review by any court.

By submitting an offer of settlement the person further waives:
(i)

such provisions of the Rules of Practice or other

requirements of law as may be construed to prevent any member of
the Commission's staff from participating in the preparation of, or
advising the Commission as to, any order, opinion, finding of fact, or
conclusion of law to be entered pursuant to the offer; and
(ii)

any right to claim bias or prejudgment by the

Commission based on the consideration of or discussions concerning
settlement of all or any part of the proceeding.
(6)

If the Commission rejects the offer of settlement, the person

making the offer shall be notified of the Commission's action and the offer
of settlement shall be deemed withdrawn. The rejected offer shall not
constitute a part of the record in any proceeding against the person making
the offer, provided, however, that rejection of an offer of settlement does not
affect the continued validity of waivers pursuant to paragraph (c)(5) of this
rule with respect to any discussions concerning the rejected offer of
settlement.
(7)

Final acceptance of any offer of settlement will occur only upon

the issuance of findings and an order by the Commission.
Rule 250.
(a)

Motion for Summary Disposition.
After a respondent's answer has been filed and, in an enforcement or a

disciplinary proceeding, documents have been made available to that respondent
for inspection and copying pursuant to Rule 230, the respondent, or the interested
division may make a motion for summary disposition of any or all allegations of
the order instituting proceedings with respect to that respondent. If the interested
division has not completed presentation of its case in chief, a motion for summary
disposition shall be made only with leave of the hearing officer. The facts of the
pleadings of the party against whom the motion is made shall be taken as true,
except as modified by stipulations or admissions made by that party, by
uncontested affidavits, or by facts officially noted pursuant to Rule 323.

51

(b)

The hearing officer shall promptly grant or deny the motion for

summary disposition or shall defer decision on the motion. The hearing officer
may grant the motion for summary disposition if there is no genuine issue with
regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to a
summary disposition as a matter of law. If it appears that a party, for good cause
shown, cannot present by affidavit prior to hearing facts essential to justify
opposition to the motion, the hearing officer shall deny or defer the motion. A
hearing officer's decision to deny leave to file a motion for summary disposition is
not subject to interlocutory appeal.
(c)

The motion for summary disposition, together with any supporting

memorandum of points and authorities (exclusive of any declarations, affidavits, or
attachments), shall not exceed 9,800 words. Requests for leave to file motions and
accompanying documents in excess of 9,800 words are disfavored. A motion that
does not, together with any accompanying memorandum of points and authorities,
exceed 35 pages in length, inclusive of pleadings incorporated by reference (but
excluding any declarations, affidavits, or attachments) is presumptively considered
to contain no more than 9,800 words. Any motion that exceeds these page limits
must include a certificate by the attorney, or an unrepresented party, stating that the
brief complies with the length limitation set forth in this paragraph and stating the
number of words in the motion. The person preparing the certificate may rely on
the word count of a word-processing program to prepare the document.
RULES REGARDING HEARINGS
Rule 300.

Hearings.

Hearings for the purpose of taking evidence shall be held only upon order of
the Commission. All hearings shall be conducted in a fair, impartial, expeditious
and orderly manner.
Rule 301.

Hearings to Be Public.

All hearings, except hearings on applications for confidential treatment filed
pursuant to Rule 190, hearings held to consider a motion for a protective order
pursuant to Rule 322, and hearings on ex parte application for a temporary cease52

and-desist order, shall be public unless otherwise ordered by the Commission on its
own motion or the motion of a party. No hearing shall be nonpublic where all
respondents request that the hearing be made public.
Rule 302.
(a)

Record of Hearings.
Recordation. Unless ordered otherwise by the hearing officer or the

Commission, all hearings shall be recorded and a written transcript thereof shall be
prepared.
(b)

Availability of a Transcript. Transcripts of public hearings shall be

available for purchase at prescribed rates. Transcripts of nonpublic proceedings,
and transcripts subject to a protective order pursuant to Rule 322, shall be available
for purchase only by parties, provided, however, that any person compelled to
submit data or evidence in a hearing may purchase a copy of his or her own
testimony.
(c)

Transcript Correction. Prior to the filing of post-hearing briefs or

proposed findings and conclusions, or within such earlier time as directed by the
Commission or the hearing officer, a party or witness may make a motion to
correct the transcript. Proposed corrections of the transcript may be submitted to
the hearing officer by stipulation pursuant to Rule 324, or by motion. Upon notice
to all parties to the proceeding, the hearing officer may, by order, specify
corrections to the transcript.
Rule 310.

Failure to Appear at Hearings: Default.

Any person named in an order instituting proceedings as a person against
whom findings may be made or sanctions imposed who fails to appear at a hearing
of which he or she has been duly notified may be deemed to be in default pursuant
to Rule 155(a). A party may make a motion to set aside a default pursuant to Rule
155(b).
Rule 320.

Evidence: Admissibility.

The Commission or the hearing officer may receive relevant evidence and
shall exclude all evidence that is irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious.

53

Rule 321.
(a)

Evidence: Objections and Offers of Proof.
Objections. Objections to the admission or exclusion of evidence

must be made on the record and shall be in short form, stating the grounds relied
upon. Exceptions to any ruling thereon by the hearing officer need not be noted at
the time of the ruling. Such exceptions will be deemed waived on appeal to the
Commission, however, unless raised:
(1)

pursuant to interlocutory review in accordance with Rule 400;

(2)

in a proposed finding or conclusion filed pursuant to Rule 340;

(3)

in a petition for Commission review of an initial decision filed

or
in accordance with Rule 410.
(b)

Offers of Proof. Whenever evidence is excluded from the record, the

party offering such evidence may make an offer of proof, which shall be included
in the record. Excluded material shall be retained pursuant to Rule 350(b).
Rule 322.
(a)

Evidence: Confidential Information, Protective Orders.
Procedure. In any proceeding as defined in Rule 101(a), a party; any

person who is the owner, subject or creator of a document subject to subpoena or
which may be introduced as evidence; or any witness who testifies at a hearing
may file a motion requesting a protective order to limit from disclosure to other
parties or to the public documents or testimony that contain confidential
information. The motion should include a general summary or extract of the
documents without revealing confidential details. If the movant seeks a protective
order against disclosure to other parties as well as the public, copies of the
documents shall not be served on other parties. Unless the documents are
unavailable, the movant shall file for in camera inspection a sealed copy of the
documents as to which the order is sought.
(b)

Basis for Issuance. Documents and testimony introduced in a public

hearing are presumed to be public. A motion for a protective order shall be granted
only upon a finding that the harm resulting from disclosure would outweigh the
benefits of disclosure.
(c)

Requests for Additional Information Supporting Confidentiality. A

movant under paragraph (a) of this rule may be required to furnish in writing
54

additional information with respect to the grounds for confidentiality. Failure to
supply the information so requested within five days from the date of receipt by the
movant of a notice of the information required shall be deemed a waiver of the
objection to public disclosure of that portion of the documents to which the
additional information relates, unless the Commission or the hearing officer shall
otherwise order for good cause shown at or before the expiration of such five-day
period.
(d)

Confidentiality of Documents Pending Decision. Pending a

determination of a motion under this rule, the documents as to which confidential
treatment is sought and any other documents that would reveal the confidential
information in those documents shall be maintained under seal and shall be
disclosed only in accordance with orders of the Commission or the hearing officer.
Any order issued in connection with a motion under this rule shall be public unless
the order would disclose information as to which a protective order has been
granted, in which case that portion of the order that would reveal the protected
information shall be nonpublic.
Rule 323.

Evidence: Official Notice.

Official notice may be taken of any material fact which might be judicially
noticed by a district court of the United States, any matter in the public official
records of the Commission, or any matter which is peculiarly within the knowledge
of the Commission as an expert body. If official notice is requested or taken of a
material fact not appearing in the evidence in the record, the parties, upon timely
request, shall be afforded an opportunity to establish the contrary.
Rule 324.

any pertinent facts in the proceeding. A stipulation may be received in evidence
and, when received, shall be binding on the parties to the stipulation.
Rule 325.

A witness at a hearing for the purpose of taking evidence shall testify under
oath or affirmation.
55

Rule 326.

Evidence: Presentation, Rebuttal and Cross-examination.

In any proceeding in which a hearing is required to be conducted on the
record after opportunity for hearing in accord with 5 U.S.C. 556(a), a party is
entitled to present its case or defense by oral or documentary evidence, to submit
rebuttal evidence, and to conduct such cross-examination as, in the discretion of
the Commission or the hearing officer, may be required for a full and true
disclosure of the facts. The scope and form of evidence, rebuttal evidence, if any,
and cross-examination, if any, in any other proceeding shall be determined by the
Commission or the hearing officer in each proceeding.
Rule 340.

shall have an opportunity, reasonable in light of all the circumstances, to file in
writing proposed findings and conclusions together with, or as a part of, its brief.
(b)

Procedure. Proposed findings of fact must be supported by citations

to specific portions of the record. If successive filings are directed, the proposed
findings and conclusions of the party assigned to file first shall be set forth in
serially numbered paragraphs, and any counter statement of proposed findings and
conclusions must, in addition to any other matter, indicate those paragraphs of the
proposals already filed as to which there is no dispute. A reply brief may be filed
by the party assigned to file first, or, where simultaneous filings are directed, reply
briefs may be filed by each party, within the period prescribed therefor by the
hearing officer. No further briefs may be filed except with leave of the hearing
officer.
(c)

Time for Filing. In any proceeding in which an initial decision is to

be issued:
(1)

At the end of each hearing, the hearing officer shall, by order,

after consultation with the parties, prescribe the period within which
proposed findings and conclusions and supporting briefs are to be filed. The
party or parties directed to file first shall make its or their initial filing within
30 days of the end of the hearing unless the hearing officer, for good cause
shown, permits a different period and sets forth in the order the reasons why
the different period is necessary.
56

(2)

The total period within which all such proposed findings and

conclusions and supporting briefs and any counter statements of proposed
findings and conclusions and reply briefs are to be filed shall be no longer
than 90 days after the close of the hearing unless the hearing officer, for
good cause shown, permits a different period and sets forth in an order the
reasons why the different period is necessary.
Rule 350.

order ending the proceeding becomes final, or the conclusion of any judicial
review of the Commission's order.
(c)

Substitution of Copies. A true copy of a document may be substituted

for any document in the record or any document retained pursuant to paragraph (b)
of this rule.
Rule 351.

Transmittal of Documents to Secretary; Record Index;
Certification.

(a)

Transmittal from Hearing Officer to Secretary of Partial Record

Index. The hearing officer may, at any time, transmit to the Secretary motions,
exhibits or any other original documents filed with or accepted into evidence by
the hearing officer, together with a list of such documents.
(b)

Preparation, Certification of Record Index. Promptly after the close

of the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit to the Secretary an index of the
originals of any motions, exhibits or any other documents filed with or accepted
into evidence by the hearing officer that have not been previously transmitted to
the Secretary, and the Secretary shall prepare a record index. Prior to issuance of
an initial decision, or if no initial decision is to be prepared, within 30 days of the
close of the hearing, the Secretary shall transmit the record index to the hearing
officer and serve a copy of the record index on each party. Any person may file
proposed corrections to the record index with the hearing officer within 15 days of
service of the record index. The hearing officer shall, by order, direct whether any
corrections to the record index shall be made. The Secretary shall make such
corrections, if any, and issue a revised record index. If an initial decision is to be
issued, the initial decision shall include a certification that the record consists of
the items set forth in the record index or revised record index issued by the
Secretary.
(c)

Final Transmittal of Record Items to the Secretary. After the close of

the hearing, the hearing officer shall transmit to the Secretary originals of any
motions, exhibits or any other documents filed with, or accepted into evidence by,
the hearing officer, or any other portions of the record that have not already been
transmitted to the Secretary. Prior to service of the initial decision by the
Secretary, or if no initial decision is to be issued, within 60 days of the close of the
58

hearing, the Secretary shall inform the hearing officer if any portions of the record
are not in the Secretary's custody.
Rule 360.

Initial Decision of Hearing Officer.

(a)(1) When Required. Unless the Commission directs otherwise, the
hearing officer shall prepare an initial decision in any proceeding in which the
Commission directs a hearing officer to preside at a hearing, provided, however,
that an initial decision may be waived by the parties with the consent of the hearing
officer pursuant to Rule 202.
(2)

Time Period for Filing Initial Decision. In the order instituting

proceedings, the Commission will specify a time period in which the hearing
officer's initial decision must be filed with the Secretary. In the Commission's
discretion, after consideration of the nature, complexity, and urgency of the subject
matter, and with due regard for the public interest and the protection of investors,
this time period will be either 120, 210 or 300 days from the date of service of the
order. Under the 300-day timeline, the hearing officer shall issue an order
providing that there shall be approximately 4 months from the order instituting the
proceeding to the hearing, approximately 2 months for the parties to obtain the
transcript and submit briefs, and approximately 4 months after briefing for the
hearing officer to issue an initial decision. Under the 210-day timeline, the
hearing officer shall issue an order providing that there shall be approximately
2-1/2 months from the order instituting the proceeding to the hearing,
approximately 2 months for the parties to review the transcript and submit briefs,
and approximately 2-1/2 months after briefing for the hearing officer to issue an
initial decision. Under the 120-day timeline, the hearing officer shall issue an
order providing that there shall be approximately 1 month from the order
instituting the proceeding to the hearing, approximately 2 months for the parties to
review the transcript and submit briefs, and approximately 1 month after briefing
for the hearing officer to issue an initial decision. These deadlines confer no
substantive rights on respondents. If a stay is granted pursuant to Rule 210(c)(3),
the time period specified in the order instituting proceedings in which the hearing
officer's initial decision must be filed with the Secretary, as well as any other time

59

limits established in orders issued by the hearing officer in the proceeding, shall be
automatically tolled during the period while the stay is in effect.
(3)

Motion for Extension. In the event that the hearing officer presiding

over the proceeding determines that it will not be possible to issue the initial
decision within the specified period of time, the hearing officer should consult with
the Chief Administrative Law Judge. Following such consultation, the Chief
Administrative Law Judge may determine, in his or her discretion, to submit a
motion to the Commission requesting an extension of the time period for filing the
initial decision. This motion must be filed no later than 30 days prior to the
expiration of the time specified in the order for issuance of an initial decision. The
motion will be served upon all parties in the proceeding, who may file with the
Commission statements in support of or in opposition to the motion. If the
Commission determines that additional time is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, the Commission shall issue an order extending the time period for
filing the initial decision.
(b)

Content. An initial decision shall include: findings and conclusions,

and the reasons or basis therefor, as to all the material issues of fact, law or
discretion presented on the record and the appropriate order, sanction, relief, or
denial thereof. The initial decision shall also state the time period, not to exceed
21 days after service of the decision, except for good cause shown, within which a
petition for review of the initial decision may be filed. The reasons for any
extension of time shall be stated in the initial decision. The initial decision shall
also include a statement that, as provided in paragraph (d) of this rule:
(1)

The Commission will enter an order of finality as to each party

unless a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a
petition for review of the initial decision or a motion to correct a manifest
error of fact in the initial decision with the hearing officer, or the
Commission determines on its own initiative to review the initial decision;
and
(2)

If a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a

petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the initial
decision with the hearing officer, or if the Commission takes action to

60

review as to a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review, the initial
decision shall not become final as to that party or person.
(c)

Filing, Service and Publication. The hearing officer shall file the

initial decision with the Secretary. The Secretary shall promptly serve the initial
decision upon the parties and shall promptly publish notice of the filing thereof in
the SEC News Digest. Thereafter, the Secretary shall publish the initial decision in
the SEC Docket; provided, however, that in nonpublic proceedings no notice shall
be published unless the Commission otherwise directs.
(d)

Finality.
(1)

If a party or an aggrieved person entitled to review timely files a

petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact in the
initial decision, or if the Commission on its own initiative orders review of a
decision with respect to a party or a person aggrieved who would be entitled
to review, the initial decision shall not become final as to that party or
person.
(2)

If a party or aggrieved person entitled to review fails to file

timely a petition for review or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact in
the initial decision, and if the Commission does not order review of a
decision on its own initiative, the Commission will issue an order that the
decision has become final as to that party. The decision becomes final upon
issuance of the order. The order of finality shall state the date on which
sanctions, if any, take effect. Notice of the order shall be published in the
SEC Docket and on the SEC Web site.
APPEAL TO THE COMMISSION AND COMMISSION REVIEW
Rule 400.
(a)

Interlocutory Review.
Availability. The Commission may, at any time, on its own motion,

direct that any matter be submitted to it for review. Petitions by parties for
interlocutory review are disfavored, and the Commission ordinarily will grant a
petition to review a hearing officer ruling prior to its consideration of an initial
decision only in extraordinary circumstances. The Commission may decline to
consider a ruling certified by a hearing officer pursuant to paragraph (c) of this rule
61

or the petition of a party who has been denied certification if it determines that
interlocutory review is not warranted or appropriate under the circumstances. This
section is the exclusive remedy for review of a hearing officer's ruling prior to
Commission consideration of the entire proceeding and is the sole mechanism for
appeal of actions delegated pursuant to 17 CFR 200.30-9 and 200.30-10.
(b)

Expedited Consideration. Interlocutory review of a hearing officer's

ruling shall be expedited in every way, consistent with the Commission's other
responsibilities.
(c)

Certification Process. A ruling submitted to the Commission for

interlocutory review must be certified in writing by the hearing officer and shall
specify the material relevant to the ruling involved. The hearing officer shall not
certify a ruling unless:
(1)

his or her ruling would compel testimony of Commission

members, officers or employees or the production of documentary evidence
in their custody; or
(2)

upon application by a party, within five days of the hearing

officer's ruling, the hearing officer is of the opinion that:
(i)

the ruling involves a controlling question of law as to

which there is substantial ground for difference of opinion; and
(ii)

an immediate review of the order may materially advance

the completion of the proceeding.
(d)

Proceedings Not Stayed. The filing of an application for review or the

grant of review shall not stay proceedings before the hearing officer unless he or
she, or the Commission, shall so order. The Commission will not consider the
motion for a stay unless the motion shall have first been made to the hearing
officer.
Rule 401.
(a)

Consideration of Stays.
Procedure. A request for a stay shall be made by written motion, filed

pursuant to Rule 154, and served on all parties pursuant to Rule 150. The motion
shall state the reasons for the relief requested and the facts relied upon, and, if the
facts are subject to dispute, the motion shall be supported by affidavits or other
sworn statements or copies thereof. Portions of the record relevant to the relief
62

sought, if available to the movant, shall be filed with the motion. The Commission
may issue a stay based on such motion or on its own motion.
(b)

Scope of Relief. The Commission may grant a stay in whole or in

part, and may condition relief under this rule upon such terms, or upon the
implementation of such procedures, as it deems appropriate.
(c)

Stay of a Commission Order. A motion for a stay of a Commission

order may be made by any person aggrieved thereby who would be entitled to
review in a federal court of appeals. A motion seeking to stay the effectiveness of
a Commission order pending judicial review may be made to the Commission at
any time during which the Commission retains jurisdiction over the proceeding.
(d)

Stay of an Action by a Self-Regulatory Organization.
(1)

Availability. A motion for a stay of an action by a self-

regulatory organization for which the Commission is the appropriate
regulatory agency, for which action review may be sought pursuant to Rule
420, may be made by any person aggrieved thereby at the time an
application for review is filed in accordance with Rule 420 or thereafter.
(2)

Summary Entry. A stay may be entered summarily, without

notice and opportunity for hearing.
(3)

Expedited Consideration. Where the action complained of has

already taken effect and the motion for stay is filed within 10 days of the
effectiveness of the action, or where the action complained of, will, by its
terms, take effect within five days of the filing of the motion for stay, the
consideration of and decision on the motion for a stay shall be expedited in
every way, consistent with the Commission's other responsibilities. Where
consideration will be expedited, persons opposing the motion for a stay may
file a statement in opposition within two days of service of the motion unless
the Commission, by written order, shall specify a different period.
(e)
Lifting of Stay of Action by the Public Company Accounting Oversight
Board.
(1)
Availability. Any person aggrieved by a stay of action by the
Board entered in accordance with 15 U.S.C. 7215(e) for which review has
been sought pursuant to Rule 440 or which the Commission has taken up on
its motion pursuant to Rule 441 may make a motion to lift the stay. The
63

Commission may, at any time, on its own motion determine whether to lift
the automatic stay.
(2)
Summary Action. The Commission may lift a stay summarily,
without notice and opportunity for hearing.
(3)
Expedited Consideration. The Commission may expedite
consideration of a motion to lift a stay of Board action, consistent with the
Commission's other responsibilities. Where consideration is expedited,
persons opposing the lifting of the stay may file a statement in opposition
within two days of service of the motion requesting lifting of the stay unless
the Commission, by written order, shall specify a different period.
Rule 410.
(a)

Appeal of Initial Decisions by Hearing Officers.
Petition for Review; When Available. In any proceeding in which an

initial decision is made by a hearing officer, any party, and any other person who
would have been entitled to judicial review of the decision entered therein if the
Commission itself had made the decision, may file a petition for review of the
decision with the Commission.
(b)

Procedure. The petition for review of an initial decision shall be filed

with the Commission within such time after service of the initial decision as
prescribed by the hearing officer pursuant to Rule 360(b) unless a party has filed a
motion to correct an initial decision with the hearing officer. If such correction has
been sought, a party shall have 21 days from the date of the hearing officer's order
resolving the motion to correct to file a petition for review. The petition shall set
forth the specific findings and conclusions of the initial decision as to which
exception is taken, together with supporting reasons for each exception.
Supporting reasons may be stated in summary form. Any exception to an initial
decision not stated in the petition for review, or in a previously filed proposed
finding made pursuant to Rule 340 may, at the discretion of the Commission, be
deemed to have been waived by the petitioner. In the event a petition for review is
filed, any other party to the proceeding may file a cross-petition for review within
the original time allowed for seeking review or within ten days from the date that
the petition for review was filed, whichever is later.
(c)

Financial Disclosure Statement Requirement. Any person who files a

petition for review of an initial decision that asserts that person's inability to pay
64

either disgorgement, interest or a penalty shall file with the opening brief a sworn
financial disclosure statement containing the information specified in Rule 630(b).
(d)

[Reserved]

(e)

Prerequisite to Judicial Review. Pursuant to Section 704 of the

Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission for
review of an initial decision is a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review of a
final order entered pursuant to such decision.
Rule 411.

Commission Consideration of Initial Decisions by Hearing
Officers.

(a)

Scope of Review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set

aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, an initial decision by a
hearing officer and may make any findings or conclusions that in its judgment are
proper and on the basis of the record.
(b)

Standards for Granting Review Pursuant to a Petition for Review.
(1)

Mandatory Review. After a petition for review has been filed,

the Commission shall review any initial decision that:
(i)

denies any request for action pursuant to Section 8(a) or

Section 8(c) of the Securities Act of 1933, 15 U.S.C. 77h(a), (c), or
the first sentence of Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. 78l(d);
(ii)

suspends trading in a security pursuant to Section 12(k)

of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78l(k); or
(iii)

is in a case of adjudication (as defined in 5 U.S.C. 551)

not required to be determined on the record after notice and
opportunity for hearing (except to the extent there is involved a matter
described in 5 U.S.C. 554(a)(1) through (6)).
(2)

Discretionary Review. The Commission may decline to review

any other decision. In determining whether to grant review, the Commission
shall consider whether the petition for review makes a reasonable showing
that:
(i)

a prejudicial error was committed in the conduct of the

proceeding; or
65

(ii)

the decision embodies:
(A)

a finding or conclusion of material fact that is

clearly erroneous; or
(B)

a conclusion of law that is erroneous; or

(C)

an exercise of discretion or decision of law or

policy that is important and that the Commission should review.
(c)

Commission Review Other Than Pursuant to a Petition for Review.

The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any initial decision, or
any portion of any initial decision, within 21 days after the end of the period
established for filing a petition for review pursuant to Rule 410(b). A party who
does not intend to file a petition for review, and who desires the Commission's
determination whether to order review on its own initiative to be made in a shorter
time, may make a motion for an expedited decision, accompanied by a written
statement that the party waives its right to file a petition for review. The vote of
one member of the Commission, conveyed to the Secretary, shall be sufficient to
bring a matter before the Commission for review.
(d)

Limitations on Matters Reviewed. Review by the Commission of an

initial decision shall be limited to the issues specified in the petition for review or
the issues, if any, specified in the briefing schedule order issued pursuant to Rule
450(a). On notice to all parties, however, the Commission may, at any time prior
to issuance of its decision, raise and determine any other matters that it deems
material, with opportunity for oral or written argument thereon by the parties.
(e)

Summary Affirmance.
(1)

At any time within 21 days after the filing of a petition for

review pursuant to Rule 410(b), any party may file a motion in accordance
with Rule 154 asking that the Commission summarily affirm an initial
decision. Any party may file an opposition and reply to such motion in
accordance with Rule 154. Pending determination of the motion for
summary affirmance, the Commission, in its discretion, may delay issuance
of a briefing schedule order pursuant to Rule 450.
(2)

Upon consideration of the motion and any opposition or upon

its own initiative, the Commission may summarily affirm an initial decision.
The Commission may grant summary affirmance if it finds that no issue
66

raised in the initial decision warrants consideration by the Commission of
further oral or written argument. The Commission will decline to grant
summary affirmance upon a reasonable showing that a prejudicial error was
committed in the conduct of the proceeding or that the decision embodies an
exercise of discretion or decision of law or policy that is important and that
the Commission should review.
(f)

Failure to Obtain a Majority. In the event a majority of participating

Commissioners do not agree to a disposition on the merits, the initial decision shall
be of no effect, and an order will be issued in accordance with this result.
Rule 420.
(a)

Appeal of Determinations by Self-Regulatory Organizations.
Application for Review; When Available. An application for review

by the Commission may be filed by any person who is aggrieved by a
determination of a self-regulatory organization with respect to any
(i)

final disciplinary sanction;

(ii)

denial or conditioning of membership or participation;

(iii)

prohibition or limitation in respect to access to services offered

by that self-regulatory organization or a member thereof; or
(iv)

bar from association as to which a notice is required to be filed

with the Commission pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. 78s(d)(1).
(b)

Procedure. As required by section 19(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange

Act of 1934, 15 U.S.C. 78s(d)(1), an applicant must file an application for review
with the Commission within 30 days after the notice of the determination is filed
with the Commission and received by the aggrieved person applying for review.
The Commission will not extend this 30-day period, absent a showing of
extraordinary circumstances. This rule is the exclusive remedy for seeking an
extension of the 30-day period.
(c)

Application. The application shall be filed with the Commission

pursuant to Rule 151. The applicant shall serve the application on the
self-regulatory organization. The application shall identify the determination
complained of and set forth in summary form a brief statement of the alleged errors
in the determination and supporting reasons therefor. The application shall state an
67

address where the applicant can be served. The application should not exceed two
pages in length. If the applicant will be represented by a representative, the
application shall be accompanied by the notice of appearance required by Rule
102(d).
(d)

Determination Not Stayed. Filing an application for review with the

Commission pursuant to paragraph (b) of this rule shall not operate as a stay of the
complained of determination made by the self-regulatory organization unless the
Commission otherwise orders either pursuant to a motion filed in accordance with
Rule 401 or on its own motion.
(e)

Certification of the Record; Service of the Index. Fourteen days after

receipt of an application for review or a Commission order for review, the selfregulatory organization shall certify and file with the Commission one copy of the
record upon which the action complained of was taken, and shall file with the
Commission three copies of an index to such record, and shall serve upon each
party one copy of the index.
Rule 421.

Commission Consideration of Determinations by Self-Regulatory
Organizations.

(a)

Commission Review Other than Pursuant to a Petition for Review.

The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any determination by a
self-regulatory organization that could be subject to an application for review
pursuant to Rule 420(a) within 40 days after notice thereof was filed with the
Commission pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78s(d)(1).
(b)

Supplemental Briefing. The Commission may at any time prior to

issuance of its decision raise or consider any matter that it deems material, whether
or not raised by the parties. Notice to the parties and an opportunity for
supplemental briefing with respect to issues not briefed by the parties shall be
given where the Commission believes that such briefing would significantly aid the
decisional process.

68

Rule 430.
(a)

Appeal of Actions Made Pursuant to Delegated Authority.
Scope of Rule. Any person aggrieved by an action made by authority

delegated in 17 CFR 200.30-1 through 200.30-8 or 17 CFR 200.30-11 through
200.30-18 may seek review of the action pursuant to paragraph (b) of this rule.
(b)

Procedure.
(1)

Notice of Intention to Petition for Review. A party to an action

made pursuant to delegated authority, or a person aggrieved by such action,
may seek Commission review of the action by filing a written notice of
intention to petition for review within five days after actual notice of the
action to that party or aggrieved person, or 15 days after publication of the
notice of action in the Federal Register, or five days after service of notice of
the action on that party or aggrieved person pursuant to Rule 141(b),
whichever is the earliest.
(2)

Petition for Review. Within five days after the filing of a notice

of intention to petition for review pursuant to paragraph (b)(1) of this rule,
the person seeking review shall file a petition for review containing a clear
and concise statement of the issues to be reviewed and the reasons why
review is appropriate. The petition shall include exceptions to any findings
of fact or conclusions of law made, together with supporting reasons for
such exceptions based on appropriate citations to such record as may exist.
These reasons may be stated in summary form.
(c)

Prerequisite to Judicial Review. Pursuant to Section 704 of the

Administrative Procedure Act, 5 U.S.C. 704, a petition to the Commission for
review of an action made by authority delegated in 17 CFR 200.30-1 through
200.30-18 is a prerequisite to the seeking of judicial review of a final order entered
pursuant to such an action.
Rule 431.

Commission Consideration of Actions Made Pursuant to
Delegated Authority.

(a)

Scope of Review. The Commission may affirm, reverse, modify, set

aside or remand for further proceedings, in whole or in part, any action made
pursuant to authority delegated in 17 CFR 200.30-1 through 200.30-18.

69

(b)

Standards for Granting Review Pursuant to a Petition for Review.
(1)

Mandatory Review. After a petition for review has been filed,

the Commission shall review any action that it would be required to review
pursuant to Rule 411(b)(1) if the action was made as the initial decision of a
hearing officer.
(2)

Discretionary Review. The Commission may decline to review

any other action. In determining whether to grant review, the Commission
shall consider the factors set forth in Rule 411(b)(2).
(c)

Commission Review Other Than Pursuant to a Petition for Review.

The Commission may, on its own initiative, order review of any action made
pursuant to delegated authority at any time, provided, however, that where there
are one or more parties to the matter, such review shall not be ordered more than
ten days after the action. The vote of one member of the Commission, conveyed to
the Secretary, shall be sufficient to bring a matter before the Commission for
review.
(d)

Required Items in an Order for Review. In an order granting a

petition for review or directing review on the Commission's own initiative, the
Commission shall set forth the time within which any party or other person may
file a statement in support of or in opposition to the action made by delegated
authority and shall state whether a stay shall be granted, if none is in effect, or shall
be continued, if in effect pursuant to paragraph (e) of this rule.
(e)

Automatic Stay of Delegated Action. An action made pursuant to

delegated authority shall have immediate effect and be deemed the action of the
Commission. Upon filing with the Commission of a notice of intention to petition
for review, or upon notice to the Secretary of the vote of a Commissioner that a
matter be reviewed, an action made pursuant to delegated authority shall be stayed
until the Commission orders otherwise, provided, however, there shall be no
automatic stay of an action:
(1)

to grant a stay of action by the Commission or a self-regulatory

organization as authorized by 17 CFR 200.30-14(g)(5) - (6); or
(2)

to commence a subpoena enforcement proceeding as authorized

by 17 CFR 200.30-4(a)(10).

with the Commission pursuant to Rule 151 within 30 days after the notice filed by
the Board of its determination with the Commission pursuant to 17 CFR 240.19d-4
is received by the aggrieved person applying for review. The applicant shall serve
the application on the Board at the same time. The application shall identify the

the Board filed notice thereof pursuant to 17 CFR 240.19d-4.
(b)

Supplemental Briefing. The Commission may at any time prior to the

issuance of its decision raise or consider any matter that it deems material, whether
or not raised by the parties. The Commission will give notice to the parties and an
opportunity for supplemental briefing with respect to issues not briefed by the
parties where the Commission believes that such briefing could significantly aid
the decisional process.
Rule 450.
(a)

Briefs Filed with the Commission.
Briefing Schedule Order. Other than review ordered pursuant to Rule

431, if review of a determination is mandated by statute, rule, or judicial order or
the Commission determines to grant review as a matter of discretion, the
Commission shall issue a briefing schedule order directing the party or parties to
file opening briefs and specifying particular issues, if any, as to which briefing
should be limited or directed. Unless otherwise provided, opening briefs shall be
filed within 30 days of the date of the briefing schedule order. Opposition briefs
shall be filed within 30 days after the date opening briefs are due. Reply briefs
shall be filed within 14 days after the date opposition briefs are due. No briefs in
addition to those specified in the briefing schedule order may be filed except with
leave of the Commission. The briefing schedule order shall be issued:
(1)

at the time the Commission orders review on its own initiative

pursuant to Rules 411 or 421, or orders interlocutory review on its own
motion pursuant to Rule 400(a); or
(2)

within 21 days, or such longer time as provided by the

Commission, after:

72

(i)

the last day permitted for filing a petition for review

pursuant to Rule 410(b) or a brief in opposition to a petition for
review pursuant to Rule 410(d);
(ii)

receipt by the Commission of an index to the record of a

determination of a self-regulatory organization filed pursuant to Rule

(iii)

receipt by the Commission of an index to the record of a

determination by the Board filed pursuant to Rule 440(d);
(iv)

receipt by the Commission of the mandate of a court of

appeals with respect to a judicial remand; or
(v)

certification of a ruling for interlocutory review pursuant

to Rule 400(c).
(b)

Contents of Briefs. Briefs shall be confined to the particular matters at

issue. Each exception to the findings or conclusions being reviewed shall be stated
succinctly. Exceptions shall be supported by citation to the relevant portions of the
record, including references to the specific pages relied upon, and by concise
argument including citation of such statutes, decisions and other authorities as may
be relevant. If the exception relates to the admission or exclusion of evidence, the
substance of the evidence admitted or excluded shall be set forth in the brief, in an
appendix thereto, or by citation to the record. Reply briefs shall be confined to
matters in opposition briefs of other parties.
(c)

Length Limitation. Except with leave of the Commission, opening

and opposition briefs shall not exceed 14,000 words and reply briefs shall not
exceed 7,000 words, exclusive of pages containing the table of contents, table of
authorities, and any addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable cases,
pertinent legislative provisions or rules, and exhibits. The number of words shall
include pleadings incorporated by reference. Motions to file briefs in excess of
these limitations are disfavored.
(d)

Certificate of Compliance. An opening or opposition brief that does

not exceed 30 pages in length, exclusive of pages containing the table of contents,
table of authorities, and any addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable
cases, pertinent legislative provisions, or rules and exhibits, but inclusive of
pleadings incorporated by reference, is presumptively considered to contain no
73

more than 14,000 words. A reply brief that does not exceed 15 pages in length,
exclusive of pages containing the table of contents, table of authorities, and any
addendum that consists solely of copies of applicable cases, pertinent legislative
provisions, or rules and exhibits, but inclusive of pleadings incorporated by
reference, is presumptively considered to contain no more than 7,000 words. Any
brief that exceeds these page limits must include a certificate by the party's
representative, or an unrepresented party, stating that the brief complies with the
length limitation set forth in Rule 450(c) and stating the number of words in the
brief. The person preparing the certificate may rely on the word count of the
word-processing system used to prepare the brief.
Rule 451.
(a)

Oral Argument Before the Commission.
Availability. The Commission, on its own motion or the motion of a

party or any other aggrieved person entitled to Commission review, may order oral
argument with respect to any matter. Motions for oral argument with respect to
whether to affirm all or part of an initial decision by a hearing officer shall be
granted unless exceptional circumstances make oral argument impractical or
inadvisable. The Commission will consider appeals, motions and other matters
properly before it on the basis of the papers filed by the parties without oral
argument unless the Commission determines that the presentation of facts and legal
arguments in the briefs and record and the decisional process would be
significantly aided by oral argument.
(b)

Procedure. Requests for oral argument shall be made by separate

motion accompanying the initial brief on the merits. The Commission shall issue
an order as to whether oral argument is to be heard, and if so, the time and place
therefor. If oral argument is granted, the time fixed for oral argument shall be
changed only by written order of the Commission, for good cause shown. The
order shall state at whose request the change is made and the reasons for any such
changes. No visual aids may be used at oral argument unless copies have been
provided to the Commission and all parties at least five business days before the
argument is to be held.
(c)

Time Allowed. Unless the Commission orders otherwise, not more

than one half-hour per side will be allowed for oral argument. The Commission
74

may, in its discretion, determine that several persons have a common interest, and
that the interests represented will be considered a single side for purposes of
allotting time for oral argument. Time will be divided equally among persons on a
single side, provided, however, that by mutual agreement they may reallocate their
time among themselves. A request for additional time must be made by motion
filed reasonably in advance of the date fixed for argument.
(d)

Participation of Commissioners. A member of the Commission who

was not present at the oral argument may participate in the decision of the
proceeding, provided that the member has reviewed the transcript of such argument
prior to such participation. The decision shall state whether the required review
was made.
Rule 452.

Additional Evidence.

Upon its own motion or the motion of a party, the Commission may allow
the submission of additional evidence. A party may file a motion for leave to
adduce additional evidence at any time prior to issuance of a decision by the
Commission. Such motion shall show with particularity that such additional
evidence is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to adduce
such evidence previously. The Commission may accept or hear additional
evidence, may remand the proceeding to a self-regulatory organization, or may
remand or refer the proceeding to a hearing officer for the taking of additional
evidence, as appropriate.
Rule 460.

(c)

Review of Documents Not Admitted. Any document offered in

evidence but excluded by the hearing officer or the Commission and any document
marked for identification but not offered as an exhibit shall not be considered a
part of the record before the Commission on appeal but shall be transmitted to the

pursuant to Rule 141(b) is not practicable, by any other means reasonably
78

calculated to give actual notice that a hearing will be held, including telephonic

delay the hearing, whether the alternative means is reliable, and whether the
party proposing its use has made arrangements to pay for its cost.
(4)

After a hearing has begun, the Commission may, on its own

motion, or the motion of a party, assign a hearing officer to preside at the

Rule 512.

Temporary Cease-and-Desist Orders: Issuance After Notice and
Opportunity for Hearing.

(a)

Basis for Issuance. A temporary cease-and-desist order shall be

issued only if the Commission determines that the alleged violation or threatened
violation specified in an order instituting proceedings whether to enter a permanent
cease-and-desist order pursuant to Securities Act Section 8A(a), 15 U.S.C. 77h1(a), Exchange Act Section 21C(a), 15 U.S.C. 78u-3(a), Investment Company Act
Section 9(f)(1), 15 U.S.C. 80a-9(f)(1), or Investment Advisers Act Section
203(k)(1), 15 U.S.C. 80b-3(k)(1), or the continuation thereof, is likely to result in
significant dissipation or conversion of assets, significant harm to investors, or
substantial harm to the public interest, including, but not limited to, losses to the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation, prior to the completion of proceedings
on the permanent cease-and-desist order.
(b)

order granted shall:
(1)

describe the basis for its issuance, including the alleged or

threatened violations and the harm that is likely to result without the

served with a temporary cease-and-desist order, the respondent may apply to the
Commission to have the order set aside, limited or suspended. The application

cease-and-desist order is to be entered without prior notice and opportunity for
hearing:
(a)

Basis for Issuance Without Prior Notice and Opportunity for Hearing.

A temporary cease-and-desist order may be issued without notice and opportunity
for hearing only if the Commission determines, from specific facts in the record of
the proceeding, that notice and hearing prior to entry of an order would be
impracticable or contrary to the public interest.
(b)

Content of the Order. An ex parte temporary cease-and-desist order

shall state specifically why notice and hearing would have been impracticable or
contrary to the public interest.
(c)

Hearing Before the Commission. If a respondent has been served with

a temporary cease-and-desist order entered without a prior Commission hearing,
the respondent may apply to the Commission to have the order set aside, limited, or
suspended, and if the application is made within 10 days after the date on which
the order was served, may request a hearing on such application. The Commission
shall hold a hearing and render a decision on such an application at the earliest
possible time. The hearing shall begin within two days of the filing of the
application unless the applicant consents to a longer period or the Commission, by
order, for good cause shown, sets a later date. The Commission shall render a
decision on the application within five calendar days of its filing, provided,
however, that the Commission, by order, for good cause shown, may extend the
time within which a decision may be rendered for a single period of five calendar
81

days, or such longer time as consented to by the applicant. If the Commission does
not render its decision within 10 days of the respondent's application or such
longer time as consented to by the applicant, the temporary order shall be
suspended until a decision is rendered.

(1)

the completion of proceedings to determine whether a

permanent order shall be entered; or

if any, shall be made a permanent revocation of registration.
(b)

Modification of Temporary Order. If any temporary sanction shall

not become permanent under the terms of the initial decision, the hearing officer
shall issue a separate order setting aside, limiting or suspending the temporary
sanction then in effect in accordance with the terms of the initial decision. The
hearing officer shall decline to suspend a term or condition of a temporary ceaseand-desist order if it is found that the continued effectiveness of such term or
condition is necessary to effectuate any term of the relief ordered in the initial
decision, including the payment of disgorgement, interest or penalties. An order
86

modifying temporary sanctions shall be effective 14 days after service. Within one
week of service of the order modifying temporary sanctions any party may seek a
stay or modification of the order from the Commission pursuant to Rule 401.
Rule 540.

Appeal and Commission Review of Initial Decision Making a
Temporary Order Permanent.

(a)

Petition for Review. Any person who seeks Commission review of an

initial decision as to whether a temporary sanction shall be made permanent shall
file a petition for review pursuant to Rule 410, provided, however, that the petition
must be filed within 10 days after service of the initial decision.
(b)

Review Procedure. If the Commission determines to grant or order

review, it shall issue a briefing schedule order pursuant to Rule 450. Unless
otherwise ordered by the Commission, opening briefs shall be filed within 21 days
of the order granting or ordering review, and opposition briefs shall be filed within
14 days after opening briefs are filed. Reply briefs shall be filed within seven days
after opposition briefs are filed. Oral argument, if granted by the Commission,
shall be held within 90 days of the issuance of the briefing schedule order.
Rule 550.

Summary Suspensions Pursuant to Exchange Act Section
12(k)(1)(A).

(a)

Petition for Termination of Suspension. Any person adversely

affected by a suspension pursuant to Section 12(k)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. 78l(k)(1)(A), who desires to show that such suspension is not necessary in
the public interest or for the protection of investors may file a sworn petition with
the Secretary, requesting that the suspension be terminated. The petition shall set
forth the reasons why the petitioner believes that the suspension of trading should
not continue and state with particularity the facts upon which the petitioner relies.
(b)

Commission Consideration of a Petition. The Commission, in its

discretion, may schedule a hearing on the matter, request additional written
submissions, or decide the matter on the facts presented in the petition and any
other relevant facts known to the Commission. If the petitioner fails to cooperate
with, obstructs, or refuses to permit the making of an examination by the
Commission, such conduct shall be grounds to deny the petition.
87

RULES REGARDING DISGORGEMENT AND PENALTY PAYMENTS
Rule 600.
(a)

Interest on Sums Disgorged.
Interest Required. Prejudgment interest shall be due on any sum

required to be paid pursuant to an order of disgorgement. The disgorgement order
shall specify each violation that forms the basis for the disgorgement ordered; the
date which, for purposes of calculating disgorgement, each such violation was
deemed to have occurred; the amount to be disgorged for each such violation; and
the total sum to be disgorged. Prejudgment interest shall be due from the first day
of the month following each such violation through the last day of the month
preceding the month in which payment of disgorgement is made. The order shall
state the amount of prejudgment interest owed as of the date of the disgorgement
order and that interest shall continue to accrue on all funds owed until they are
paid.
(b)

Rate of Interest. Interest on the sum to be disgorged shall be

computed at the underpayment rate of interest established under Section 6621(a)(2)
of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. 6621(a)(2), and shall be compounded
quarterly. The Commission or the hearing officer may, by order, specify a lower
rate of prejudgment interest as to any funds which the respondent has placed in an
escrow or otherwise guaranteed for payment of disgorgement upon a final
determination of the respondent's liability. Escrow and other guarantee
arrangements must be approved by the Commission or the hearing officer prior to
entry of the disgorgement order.
Rule 601.
(a)

Prompt Payment of Disgorgement, Interest and Penalties.
Timing of Payments. Unless otherwise provided, funds due pursuant

to an order by the Commission requiring the payment of disgorgement, interest, or
penalties shall be paid no later than 21 days after service of the order, and funds
due pursuant to an order by a hearing officer shall be paid in accordance with the
order of finality issued pursuant to Rule 360(d)(2).
(b)

Stays. A stay of any order requiring the payment of disgorgement,

interest or penalties may be sought at any time pursuant to Rule 401.
(c)

Method of Making Payment. Payment shall be made by United States
88

postal money order, wire transfer, certified check, bank cashier's check, or bank
money order made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
payment shall be mailed or delivered to the office designated by this Commission.
Payment shall be accompanied by a letter that identifies the name and number of
the case and the name of the respondent making payment. A copy of the letter and
the instrument of payment shall be sent to counsel for the Division of Enforcement.
Rule 630.
(a)

Inability to Pay Disgorgement, Interest or Penalties.
Generally. In any proceeding in which an order requiring payment of

disgorgement, interest or penalties may be entered, a respondent may present
evidence of an inability to pay disgorgement, interest or a penalty. The
Commission may, in its discretion, or the hearing officer may, in his or her
discretion, consider evidence concerning ability to pay in determining whether
disgorgement, interest or a penalty is in the public interest.
(b)

Financial Disclosure Statement. Any respondent who asserts an

inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties may be required to file a sworn
financial disclosure statement and to keep the statement current. The financial
statement shall show the respondent's assets, liabilities, income or other funds
received and expenses or other payments, from the date of the first violation
alleged against that respondent in the order instituting proceedings, or such later
date as specified by the Commission or a hearing officer, to the date of the order
requiring the disclosure statement to be filed. By order, the Commission or the
hearing officer may prescribe the use of the Disclosure of Assets and Financial
Information Form (see Form D-A at § 209.1 of this chapter) or any other form,
may specify other time periods for which disclosure is required, and may require
such other information as deemed necessary to evaluate a claim of inability to pay.
(c)

Confidentiality. Any respondent submitting financial information

pursuant to this rule or Rule 410(c) may make a motion, pursuant to Rule 322, for
the issuance of a protective order against disclosure of the information submitted to
the public or to any parties other than the Division of Enforcement. Prior to a
ruling on the motion, no party receiving information as to which a motion for a
protective order has been made may transfer or convey the information to any
other person without the prior permission of the Commission or the hearing officer.
89

(d)

Service Required. Notwithstanding any provision of Rule 322, a copy

of the financial disclosure statement shall be served on the Division of
Enforcement.
(e)

Failure to File Required Financial Information: Sanction. Any

respondent who, after making a claim of inability to pay either disgorgement,
interest or a penalty, fails to file a financial disclosure statement when such a filing
has been ordered or is required by rule may, in the discretion of the Commission or
the hearing officer, be deemed to have waived the claim of inability to pay. No
sanction pursuant to Rules 155 or 180 shall be imposed for a failure to file such a
statement.

90

FORM D-A
17 CFR 209.1
(a)

Form D-A: Disclosure of assets and financial information.

Rules 410 and 630 of the Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.410 and

201.630) provide that under certain circumstances a respondent who asserts or
intends to assert an inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties may be
required to disclose certain financial information. Unless otherwise ordered, this
form may be used by individuals required to supply such information.
(b)

The respondent filing Form D-A is required promptly to notify the

Commission of any material change in the answer to any question on this form.
(c)

Form D-A may not be withheld from the interested division. A

respondent making financial information disclosures on this form after the
institution of proceedings may make a motion, pursuant to Rule 322 of the
Commission's Rules of Practice (17 CFR 201.322), for the issuance of a protective
order to limit disclosure to the public or parties other than the interested division of
the information submitted on Form D-A. A request for a protective order allows
the requester an opportunity to justify the need for confidentiality. The making of
a motion for a protective order, however, does not guarantee that disclosure will be
limited.
(d)

No party receiving information for which a motion for a protective

order has been made may transfer or convey the information to any other person
prior to a ruling on the motion without the prior permission of the Commission or a
hearing officer.
(e)

A person making financial information disclosures on Form D-A prior

to the institution of proceedings, in connection with an offer of settlement or
otherwise, may request confidential treatment of the information pursuant to the
Freedom of Information Act. See the Commission's Freedom of Information Act
("FOIA") regulations, 17 CFR 200.83. A request for confidential treatment allows
the requester an opportunity to substantiate the need for confidentiality. No
determination as to the validity of any request for confidential treatment will be
made until a request for disclosure of the information under FOIA is received.

91

Form D-A
Model Disclosure of Assets and Financial Information Form
Instructions: The Commission's Rules of Practice provide that under certain circumstances a
respondent who asserts or intends to assert an inability to pay disgorgement, interest or penalties
may be required to disclose certain financial information. See Rules 410 and 630. Unless
otherwise ordered, this form may be used by individuals required to supply such information.
Partnerships, corporations or other entities should submit a financial statement, including an
income statement, balance sheet and federal tax returns for each year from the year of the earliest
violation alleged against the entity in the order instituting proceedings to the present.
The respondent filing this form is required promptly to notify the Commission of any material
change in the answer to any question on this form.
A respondent making financial information disclosures on this form or in another manner
pursuant to the requirements of Rule 410 or Rule 630 may submit the form with a motion for a
protective order pursuant to Rule 322 of the Commission's Rules of Practice. Any other person
submitting this form may request that the Commission afford the information submitted
confidential treatment under the Freedom of Information Act under the Commission's Freedom
of Information Act ("FOIA") regulations, see 17 CFR 200.83. A request for confidential
treatment allows the requester an opportunity to justify the need for confidentiality. A request
for confidential treatment does not, however, guarantee confidentiality.
Notwithstanding any request for a protective order or for confidential treatment, copies of the
financial disclosure statement shall be served on the interested division and will be included in
the record of the proceeding. See Rule 630(d). If confidential treatment is sought, notice that a
financial disclosure statement and request for confidential treatment have been filed shall be
served on all other parties.
No party receiving information for which confidential treatment has been requested may transfer
or convey the information to any person or entity not a party to the proceeding without the prior
permission of the Commission or a hearing officer.

Informal Procedures and Supplementary Information Concerning
Adjudicatory Proceedings.

(a)

Guidelines for the Timely Completion of Proceedings.
(1)

Timely resolution of adjudicatory proceedings is one factor in

assessing the effectiveness of the adjudicatory program in protecting investors,
promoting public confidence in the securities markets and assuring respondents
a fair hearing. Establishment of guidelines for the timely completion of key
phases of contested administrative proceedings provides a standard for both the
Commission and the public to gauge the Commission's adjudicatory program on
this criterion. The Commission has directed that, to the extent possible:
(i)

A decision by the Commission on review of an interlocutory

matter should be completed within 45 days of the date set for filing the
final brief on the matter submitted for review.
(ii)

A decision by the Commission on a motion to stay a

decision that has already taken effect or that will take effect within five
days of the filing of the motion, should be issued within five days of the
date set for filing of the opposition to the motion for a stay. If the
decision complained of has not taken effect, the Commission's decision
should be issued within 45 days of the date set for filing of the opposition
to the motion for a stay.
(iii)

Ordinarily, a decision by the Commission with respect to an

appeal from the initial decision of a hearing officer, a review of a
determination by a self-regulatory organization, or a remand of a prior
Commission decision by a court of appeals should be issued within seven
months from the date the petition for review, application for review, or
mandate of the court is filed, unless the Commission determines that the
matter presents unusual complicating circumstances, in which case a
decision by the Commission on the matter may be issued within 11
months from the date the petition for review, application for review, or
mandate of the court is filed. The Commission retains discretion to take
additional time to dispose of an appeal from the initial decision of a
hearing officer, a review of a determination by a self-regulatory
101

organization, or a remand of a prior Commission decision by a court of
appeals when the Commission determines that extraordinary facts and
circumstances of the matter so require. The deadlines in Rule 900 confer
no substantive rights on the parties.
(2)

The guidelines in this paragraph (a) do not create a requirement

that each portion of a proceeding or the entire proceeding be completed within
the periods described. Among other reasons, a proceeding at either the hearing
stage or on review by the Commission may require additional time because it is
unusually complex or because the record is exceptionally long. In addition,
fairness is enhanced if the Commission's deliberative process is not constrained
by an inflexible schedule. In some proceedings, deliberation may be delayed by
the need to consider more urgent matters, to permit the preparation of dissenting
opinions, or for other good cause. The guidelines will be used by the
Commission as one of several criteria in monitoring and evaluating its
adjudicatory program. The guidelines will be examined periodically, and, if
necessary, readjusted in light of changes in the pending caseload and the
available level of staff resources.
(b)

Reports to the Commission on Pending Cases. The administrative law

judges, the Secretary and the General Counsel have each been delegated authority to
issue certain orders or adjudicate certain proceedings. See 17 CFR 200.30-1, et seq.
Proceedings are also assigned to the General Counsel for the preparation of a
proposed order or opinion which will then be recommended to the Commission for
consideration. In order to improve accountability by and to the Commission for
management of the docket, the Commission has directed that confidential status
reports with respect to all filed adjudicatory proceedings shall be made periodically to
the Commission. These reports will be made through the Secretary, with a minimum
frequency established by the Commission. In connection with these periodic reports,
if a proceeding pending before the Commission has not been concluded within 30
days of the guidelines established in paragraph (a) of this rule, the General Counsel
shall specifically apprise the Commission of that fact, and shall describe the
procedural posture of the case, project an estimated date for conclusion of the
proceeding, and provide such other information as is necessary to enable the

102

Commission to determine whether additional steps are necessary to reach a fair and
timely resolution of the matter.
(c)

Publication of Information Concerning the Pending Case Docket.

Ongoing disclosure of information about the adjudication program caseload increases
awareness of the importance of the program, facilitates oversight of the program and
promotes confidence in the efficiency and fairness of the program by investors,
securities industry participants, self-regulatory organizations and other members of
the public. The Commission has directed the Secretary to publish in the SEC Docket
in the first and seventh months of each fiscal year summary statistical information
about the status of pending adjudicatory proceedings and changes in the Commission's
caseload over the prior six months. The report will include the number of cases
pending before the administrative law judges and the Commission at the beginning
and end of the six-month period. The report will also show increases in the caseload
arising from new cases being instituted, appealed or remanded to the Commission and
decreases in the caseload arising from the disposition of proceedings by issuance of
initial decisions, issuance of final decisions issued on appeal of initial decisions, other
dispositions of appeals of initial decisions, final decisions on review of self-regulatory
organization determinations, other dispositions on review of self-regulatory
organization determinations, and decisions with respect to stays or interlocutory
motions. For each category of decision, the report shall also show the median age of
the cases at the time of the decision and the number of cases decided within the
guidelines for the timely completion of adjudicatory proceedings.
FAIR FUND AND DISGORGEMENT PLANS
Rule 1100. Creation of Fair Fund.
In any agency process initiated by an order instituting proceedings in which the
Commission or the hearing officer issues an order requiring the payment of
disgorgement by a respondent and also assessing a civil money penalty against that
respondent, the Commission or the hearing officer may order that the amount of the
disgorgement and of the civil money penalty, together with any funds received by the
Commission pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7246(b), be used to create a fund for the benefit of
investors who were harmed by the violation.
103

Rule 1101. Submission of Plan of Distribution; Contents of Plan.
(a)

Submission. The Commission or the hearing officer may, at any time,

order any party to submit a plan for the administration and distribution of funds in a
Fair Fund or disgorgement fund. Unless ordered otherwise, the Division of
Enforcement shall submit a proposed plan no later than 60 days after the respondent
has turned over the funds or other assets pursuant to the Commission's order imposing
disgorgement and, if applicable, a civil money penalty and any appeals of the
Commission's order have been waived or completed, or appeal is no longer available.
(b)

Contents of Plan. Unless otherwise ordered, a plan for the administration

of a Fair Fund or a disgorgement fund shall include the following elements:
(1)

Procedures for the receipt of additional funds, including the

specification of any account where funds will be held, the instruments in which
the funds may be invested; and, in the case of a Fair Fund, the receipt of any
funds pursuant to 15 U.S.C. 7246(b), if applicable;
(2)

Specification of categories of persons potentially eligible to

receive proceeds from the fund;
(3)

Procedures for providing notice to such persons of the existence

of the fund and their potential eligibility to receive proceeds of the fund;
(4)

Procedures for making and approving claims, procedures for

handling disputed claims, and a cut-off date for the making of claims;
(5)

A proposed date for the termination of the fund, including

provision for the disposition of any funds not otherwise distributed;
(6)

Procedures for the administration of the fund, including selection,

compensation, and, as necessary, indemnification of a fund administrator to
oversee the fund, process claims, prepare accountings, file tax returns, and,
subject to the approval of the Commission, make distributions from the fund to
investors who were harmed by the violation; and
(7)

Such other provisions as the Commission or the hearing officer

may require.
Rule 1102. Provisions for Payment.
(a)

Payment to Registry of the Court or Court-appointed Receiver. Subject

to such conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer shall deem appropriate, a
104

plan for the administration of a Fair Fund or a disgorgement fund may provide for
payment of funds into a court registry or to a court-appointed receiver in any case
pending in federal or state court against a respondent or any other person based upon a
complaint alleging violations arising from the same or substantially similar facts as
those alleged in the Commission's order instituting proceedings.
(b)

Payment to the United States Treasury Under Certain Circumstances.

When, in the opinion of the Commission or the hearing officer, the cost of
administering a plan of disgorgement relative to the value of the available
disgorgement funds and the number of potential claimants would not justify
distribution of the disgorgement funds to injured investors, the plan may provide that
the disgorgement funds and any civil penalty shall be paid directly to the general fund
of the United States Treasury.
Rule 1103. Notice of Proposed Plan and Opportunity for Comment by
Non-parties.
Notice of a proposed plan of disgorgement or a proposed Fair Fund plan shall
be published in the SEC Docket, on the SEC website, and in such other publications
as the Commission or the hearing officer may require. The notice shall specify how
copies of the proposed plan may be obtained and shall state that persons desiring to
comment on the proposed plan may submit their views, in writing, to the Commission.
Rule 1104. Order Approving, Modifying, or Disapproving Proposed Plan.
At any time after 30 days following publication of notice of a proposed plan of
disgorgement or of a proposed Fair Fund plan, the Commission shall, by order,
approve, approve with modifications, or disapprove the proposed plan. In the
discretion of the Commission, a proposed plan that is substantially modified prior to
adoption may be republished for an additional comment period pursuant to Rule 1103.
The order approving or disapproving the plan should be entered within 30 days after
the end of the final period allowed for comments on the proposed plan unless the
Commission or the hearing officer, by written order, allows a longer period for good
cause shown.

105

Rule 1105. Administration of Plan.
(a)

Appointment and Removal of Administrator. The Commission or the

hearing officer shall have discretion to appoint any person, including a Commission
employee, as administrator of a plan of disgorgement or a Fair Fund plan and to
delegate to that person responsibility for administering the plan. An administrator
may be removed at any time by order of the Commission or hearing officer.
(b)

Assistance by Respondent. A respondent may be required or

permitted to administer or assist in administering a plan of disgorgement subject to
such terms and conditions as the Commission or the hearing officer deems appropriate
to ensure the proper distribution of the funds.
(c)

Administrator to Post Bond. If the administrator is not a Commission

employee, the administrator shall be required to obtain a bond in the manner
prescribed in 11 U.S.C. 322, in an amount to be approved by the Commission. The
cost of the bond may be paid for as a cost of administration. The Commission may
waive posting of a bond for good cause shown.
(d)

Administrator's Fees. If the administrator is a Commission employee, no

fee shall be paid to the administrator for his or her services. If the administrator is not
a Commission employee, the administrator may file an application for fees for
completed services, and upon approval by the Commission or a hearing officer, may
be paid a reasonable fee for those services. Any objections thereto shall be filed
within 21 days of service of the application on the parties.
(e)

Source of Funds. Unless otherwise ordered, fees and other expenses of

administering the plan shall be paid first from the interest earned on the funds, and if
the interest is not sufficient, then from the corpus.
(f)

Accountings. During the first 10 days of each calendar quarter, or as

otherwise directed by the Commission or the hearing officer, the administrator shall
file an accounting of all monies earned or received and all monies spent in connection
with the administration of the plan of disgorgement. A final accounting shall be
submitted for approval of the Commission or hearing officer prior to discharge of the
administrator and cancellation of the administrator's bond, if any.
(g)

Amendment. A plan may be amended upon motion by any party or by

the plan administrator or upon the Commission's or the hearing officer's own motion.

106

Rule 1106. Right to Challenge.
Other than in connection with the opportunity to submit comments as provided
in Rule 1103, no person shall be granted leave to intervene or to participate or
otherwise to appear in any agency proceeding or otherwise to challenge an order of
disgorgement or creation of a Fair Fund; or an order approving, approving with
modifications, or disapproving a plan of disgorgement or a Fair Fund plan; or any
determination relating to a plan based solely upon that person's eligibility or potential
eligibility to participate in a fund or based upon any private right of action such person
may have against any person who is also a respondent in the proceeding.
