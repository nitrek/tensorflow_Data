ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE

On September 22, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) against Respondents pursuant to Section 12( j) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission
and are delinquent in their periodic filings. A hearing is scheduled for October 11, 2016.
On September 29, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that the OIP was served on Respondents by September 28, 2016, in accordance with
17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2). Respondents’ answers are therefore due by October 11, 2016. OIP at
3; see 17 C.F.R. § 201.160(a)-(b), .220(b). If Respondents do not file timely answers or otherwise
defend the proceeding, they will be deemed in default, the proceeding will be determined against
them, and the registrations of their securities will be revoked. OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a)(2),
.220(f ).
I ORDER that the hearing scheduled for October 11, 2016, is POSTPONED, and that a
telephonic prehearing conference shall be held on November 14, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. Eastern, if
the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
