PROPOSED PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
Overview
1. This Plan of Distribution (“Plan”) proposes a methodology for distributing
disgorgement, civil penalties, and prejudgment interest paid by Southwest Securities,
Inc., Daniel R. Leland, Kerry M. Rigdon, and Kevin J. Marsh (collectively,
“Respondents”) in settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or
“Commission”) of administrative proceedings involving findings of deceptive market
timing of certain mutual funds and annuities (“Affected Funds”). On January 10, 2005,
Respondents consented to the entry of an Order Instituting Public Administrative
Proceedings, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section
15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Section 203(f) of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940, and Instituting Cease-and-Desist Proceedings and Imposing a
Cease-and-Desist Order Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934

1

and Section 9(f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (“Order”).1 (Exchange Act Rel.
No. 51002). The Order found, among other things, that between October 2002 and
September 2003, the Respondents failed reasonably to supervise three registered
representatives who engaged in an illegal market timing scheme.
2. The Order required that Respondents pay $10,275,003 in disgorgement, civil
penalties, and prejudgment interest.

The Order also established a Fair Fund under

Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, 15 U.S.C. § 7246, and 17 C.F.R. §
201.1100, et seq. promulgated thereunder (Order, Paragraph IV.B.3.). The Fair Fund is
the $10,275,003 paid by the Respondents plus $999 post-judgment interest paid by
Respondent Marsh and accrued interest. The Order further required that Respondent
Southwest Securities bear the reasonable cost of compensation and expenses of an
Independent Distribution Consultant “who will be named by order of the Commission,
and who will be responsible for any distribution of any Fair Fund established pursuant” to
the Order (Order, Paragraph III.H.3).
3. The Commission appointed Gilardi & Co., L.L.C. (“Gilardi”) to administer the
Fair Fund and has decided that an Independent Distribution Consultant need not be
named in connection with this distribution. (Order Appointing Fund Administrator and
Waiving the Bond Requirement). Because the Independent Distribution Consultant’s
tasks have been largely completed in this case, and because the funds will be disbursed
by the U.S. Department of Treasury’s Financial Management Service (“FMS”), the
Commission saw the need for a fund administrator only and elected to appoint Gilardi as
such. Gilardi’s compensation or expenses shall be paid first from the interest earned on
the funds, and if the interest is not sufficient, then from the corpus. This submission

constitutes the Plan required by the Order. The Plan is subject to approval by the
Commission, and the Commission retains jurisdiction over the implementation of the
Plan.
Administration of the Distribution Plan
4. Purpose and Background. The Plan was developed pursuant to the Order and the
SEC Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1100, et seq.
(“Rules”). The Fair Fund constitutes a Qualified Settlement Fund under Section 468B(g)
of the Internal Revenue Code, 26 U.S.C. § 468B(g), and related regulations, 26 C.F.R. §§
1.468B-1 through 1.468B-5. The assets of the Fair Fund are subject to the continuing
jurisdiction and control of the Commission, and the Commission shall retain control of
the assets of the Fair Fund, which is currently deposited at the U.S. Treasury Bureau of
Public Debt (“BPD”) for investment in government obligations.
5. Fund Administrator. Rule 1105(a) provides that the Commission “shall have the
authority to appoint any person . . . as administrator of a plan of disgorgement of a Fair
Fund and to delegate to that person responsibility for administering the plan.” Rule
1105(a) also provides that an administrator may be removed at any time by order of the
Commission. The Commission has appointed Gilardi to act as the administrator for the
Plan. Gilardi has extensive experience in distributing SEC Fair Funds.
6. Bond. Rule 1105(c) requires that Gilardi “obtain a bond in the manner prescribed
in 11 U.S.C. 322, in an amount to be approved by the Commission,” but allows the
Commission to “waive posting of a bond for good cause shown.”

The disbursements in

this matter will be made by FMS directly to the Affected Funds, with no handling of
money by Gilardi. The payees, and the relative amounts to be paid by FMS to each, will

3

have been reviewed and approved by the Commission prior to the disbursements. In
summary, Gilardi will not have discretion regarding payment amounts made from the
Fair Fund. Accordingly, waiver of the bond for Gilardi is proposed for this Plan.
Distribution Plan and Procedures
7. Specification of Eligible Fair Fund Recipients. Rule 1101(b)(2) provides that a
plan shall include specification “of categories of persons potentially eligible to receive
proceeds of the fund.” This first requires a decision of whether the distribution should
occur at the fund level, meaning that the Fair Funds would be contributed to the Affected
Funds in which the Respondents’ conduct caused dilution in share value, with the
distribution resulting in an increase in the net asset value of those collective asset
vehicles; or at the individual investor level, meaning that the distribution process would
attempt to “look through” the ownership structure at the mutual fund level to identify the
individual fund shareholders whose shares were diluted in value as a consequence of the
Respondents’ transactions.
7(a). Distribution Amount. The Affected Funds suffered dilution in the amount of
approximately $5.2 million. The Affected Funds shall receive interest on the dilution
amount at the Federal Short-Term rate. The $5.2 million plus interest of approximately
$1.1 million comprise the “Distribution Amount” of approximately $6.3 million.
7(b). Undistributed Funds. A residual within the Fair Fund is established for any
amounts remaining after all assets have been distributed. The residual account may
include distributions from checks that have not been cashed, or from funds returned to
Gilardi.

The remainder of the Fair Fund (“Residual Funds”), i.e., the Fair Fund

4

(approximately $10,276,002) minus the Distribution Amount ($6,344,632), shall be paid
to the U.S. Treasury.
8. Fund Level. A fund level distribution is the appropriate mechanism for this
distribution. This conclusion is based on the observations that, among other factors:
a. 	The amounts likely to be paid to the large majority of individual fund
shareholders would be so small as to be de minimis; and
b. 	Implementing an individual level distribution under the circumstances here
would result in significant expense and delay. Because any costs to prepare and
fully implement the Plan are to be paid out of the Fair Fund, it is highly
probable that an individual level distribution would significantly reduce the size
of the Fair Fund. A fund level distribution would, however, avoid the costs of
collecting large amounts of data from various sources and in different formats
regarding daily purchases and redemptions of funds by individuals. In addition,
complex and time-consuming implementation issues would be present in an
individual level distribution such as this where the trading took place at
hundreds of funds in numerous different fund complexes. The Respondents and
Gilardi in the instant proceedings lack the ability to compel disclosure by the
various funds (not to mention the various brokers, advisors and other
intermediaries) of the daily purchases and redemptions of funds by individuals
that would be essential to any determination of which shareholders of the funds
held fund shares, and how many shares they held, and how many shares were
outstanding, on the various days on which the Respondents engaged in
purchases and redemptions of shares of those same funds.

9. Methodology for Determining Distributions. The Fair Fund will be allocated in
three steps. First, the dilution suffered by each Affected Fund is estimated using the
next-day NAV method. This method calculates the dilution to a fund as the sum of the
profits earned by market timers on purchases plus the losses avoided on sales. This
method assumes that the timer inflows were fully invested at the end of the day after
being received and that the investments were fully liquidated at the end of the day after
being withdrawn.
9(a). The next-day NAV method has been shown to be a valid method of estimating
dilution from market timing2 and has been used previously for fund-level allocations in
previous distributions.3 Based upon the specific facts in this matter, the next-day NAV
method is a fair and reasonable approach. The next-day NAV method was applied to a
database of trades produced by the Respondents. The Respondents represented that these
are the trades referred to in the Order.
9(b). The second and third steps use the estimates of positive dilution experienced by
the Affected Funds from the first step to allocate the Distribution Amount of the Fair
Fund. Therefore, in the second step, the Distribution Amount is allocated pro rata to all
funds with positive dilution.

Funds,” Journal of Financial Economics 65, 131-158, and Greene, J. and C. S. Ciccotello, 2006. “Mutual
Fund Dilution from Market Timing Trades,” Journal of Investment Management 4, 42-66.

9(c). The Residual Funds should be adequate to cover any anticipated tax liability of
the Fair Fund and related costs of tax compliance.
9(d). Consistent with similar distribution plans, this Plan sets a de minimis amount of
$1,000.

This avoids distributing money to funds in cases where the cost of the

distribution exceeds the amount distributed. Accordingly, the third step re-allocates the
Distribution Amount pro rata based on dilution to all Affected Funds that experienced
positive dilution and which had an allocation of at least $1,000 in step two. Of the
mutual funds with positive dilution, the funds listed in the attached Table 1 (“Eligible
Funds”) were found to have dilution of at least $1,000.
9(e). This method is an acceptable method for allocating the Fair Fund on the
specific facts of this case. Each Eligible Fund's share of the Fair Fund (“Share Amount”)
is intended to result in a payment that restores the impaired value of the Eligible Fund.
Some of this impaired value is susceptible to calculation, while some of this impaired
value is not. The method of calculation is intended by the Commission to fairly estimate
the impaired value that each Eligible Fund has suffered and make a payment in that
amount.
10. Procedures for Locating and Notifying Responsible Persons for the Eligible
Funds. Rule 1101(b)(3) provides that a plan shall include procedures “for providing
notice to [potential claimants--in this case, the Eligible Funds] of the existence of the
fund and their potential eligibility to receive proceeds of the fund.” Gilardi will identify
the entity with fiduciary responsibility for each Eligible Fund or its successor entity.
Within 30 days of the approval of the Plan, Gilardi will mail or send by other reasonable
means each such fiduciary a notice regarding the Commission's approval of the Plan and

7

the procedure for distribution. Gilardi will request from each fiduciary information
sufficient to accomplish the distribution, including the Tax Identification Number for the
Eligible Fund, payment address, contact information, and/or wiring instructions.
Furthermore, each Eligible Fund will:

(1) be notified that the Share Amount is

designated solely for the Eligible Fund and is not to be used for administrative or
management fees, and (2) be required to certify in advance that the money will be
deposited into the Eligible Fund as intended (“Certification”).
10(a). If an Eligible Fund does not respond, including providing the Certification,
within twenty-one days from the mailing date of the notice, Gilardi shall send a second
notice by mail. For those Eligible Funds entitled to a Share Amount of $50,000 or
greater that do not respond to the second notice within twenty-one days of the notice’s
mailing date, Gilardi shall make three attempts to contact the Eligible Fund (or its
successor) telephonically within the next seven days. Gilardi will keep records of each
contact attempt for each Eligible Fund, and the response received, if any. These records
will be provided to Commission staff at least 30 days before the scheduled distribution is
to be made.
10(b). If Gilardi determines that an Eligible Fund is no longer in existence, Gilardi
shall notify the Commission and dispose of the Eligible Fund’s Share Amount according
to the Commission’s direction.
11. No Claims-Made Process. This Fair Fund is not being distributed according to a
claims-made process, so the procedures for providing notice and for making and
approving claims are not applicable.

8

12. Procedures for the Receipt of Additional Funds.

Rule 110l(b)(l) provides,

among other things, that a plan shall include procedures “for the receipt of additional
funds.” The Fair Fund has been deposited at the BPD for investment in government
obligations. Other than interest from these investments, it is not anticipated that the Fair
Fund will receive additional funds.
13. Checks or Electronic Transfers. FMS may elect to make payment of the Share
Amount to an Eligible Fund by check or electronic transfer. Distribution checks or
electronic transfers, on their face, or in the accompanying mailing will clearly indicate
that the money is being distributed from an SEC Fair Fund.
14. Validation and Approval of Disbursement of the Fair Fund. The Fair Fund
disbursement to the Eligible Funds will be implemented through FMS, which will
electronically transfer funds through the Automated Clearing House (“ACH”) or mail a
check to each payee. The Fair Fund disbursements will be made as follows:
a.	 Staff will provide Gilardi with appropriate proprietary software for compiling
the information necessary to be submitted to FMS.
b.	 Approximately 30 days prior to the distribution date, Gilardi will compile the
information available into an electronic file in the Agency Input format and
submit the file to the SEC Office of Financial Management to ensure the file
passes all system edits. Any errors or omissions of data will be communicated
back to Gilardi promptly. Gilardi will submit the final electronic file to the
staff. However, the initial distribution shall be made no later than 150 days
following approval of the Plan. Before submitting a validated payment file to
the staff, Gilardi will coordinate with the Tax Administrator to determine

9

whether it is necessary to solicit an IRS Form W-9 (resident entities) or W-8
(non-resident entities) from each Eligible Fund.
c.	 Gilardi will validate the list of Eligible Funds and respective Share Amounts in
the electronic file to the staff.

The validation will state that the list was

completed in accordance with the Plan and provides all information necessary to
make a disbursement to each Eligible Fund. Unless otherwise directed by the
Commission, the staff will obtain authorization from the Commission to
disburse pursuant to Rule 1101(b)(6).
d.	 When the electronic file and validation are approved and the order to disburse is
entered, the Commission, through its Office of Financial Management, will
transmit the electronic file to FMS for the transfer of funds pursuant to the
following FMS procedures. Within 48 hours of receipt by FMS, funds will be
transferred by the ACH or checks will be mailed.
e.	 Gilardi will repeat this process as many times as necessary to complete
distribution of the Fair Fund.
f.	 In the event that any distribution is in the form of a paper check in lieu of an
electronic transfer, each check will state on its face that it is valid for one year.
Gilardi shall notify the Commission, which, in turn, will notify FMS of all
uncashed checks. FMS will credit the SEC account for the Distribution Fund
for the amount of all uncashed checks.
15. Returned Checks Electronic Transfer Procedures.

FMS will notify the

Commission, which, in turn will notify Gilardi of any returned items due to non-delivery,
insufficient addresses, or other deficiencies. Gilardi is responsible for researching and

10

reconciling all errors that result in non-delivery and shall submit a supplemental
electronic file for payment of the returned items. If an Eligible Fund does not deposit its
Share Amount, FMS will notify the staff with the name of the Eligible Fund and the
dollar amount of funds not deposited. The funds not deposited will become part of the
Residual Funds.
16. Termination of the Fair Fund. The Fair Fund shall be eligible for termination,
and Gilardi shall be discharged, after all of the following have occurred: (1) a final
accounting, in an SEC standard accounting format provided by the staff, has been
approved by the Commission, (2) all taxes, fees, and expenses have been paid, and (3)
any amount remaining in the Fair Fund has been received by the Commission. When the
Commission has approved the final accounting, the staff shall seek an order from the
Commission to approve the transfer of any amount remaining in the Fair Fund to the U.S.
Treasury and to approve the termination of the Fair Fund and discharge of Gilardi.
17. Taxes.

The Commission has appointed Damasco & Associates as the Tax

Administrator (“Tax Administrator”) of the Fair Fund (Exchange Act Rel. No. 53460).
Gilardi and Respondents will cooperate with the Tax Administrator in providing
information necessary to accomplish income tax compliance, ruling and advice work
assigned to the Tax Administrator by the Commission. The Tax Administrator shall be
compensated from the Tax Allowance. Gilardi and BPD shall be authorized to provide
account information to the Tax Administrator.
18. Amendment. FMS and Gilardi shall take reasonable and appropriate steps to
distribute the Fair Fund according to the Plan. Gilardi will inform the staff of any
changes needed in the Plan. Upon agreement with the staff, Gilardi may implement

11

immaterial changes to the Plan to effectuate its general purposes. If a change is deemed
to be material by the staff, Commission approval is required prior to implementation by
amending the Plan, which may be done upon the motion of Gilardi or any party or upon
the Commission’s own motion.
19. Procedural Deadlines. For good cause shown, the staff may extend any of the
procedural deadlines set forth in this Plan.
20. Notice of Proposed Fair Fund Distribution Plan. In accordance with Rule 1103,
notice of this Plan shall be published in the SEC Docket, on the Commission website, and
on the Respondents’ website. Any person or entity wishing to comment on the Plan must
do so in writing by submitting their comments to the Commission within thirty days of
the date of the Notice: (a) by sending a letter to the Office of the Secretary, United States
Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC 20549-1090;
