INITIAL DECISION OF DEFAULT
January 20, 2016

APPEARANCE:

Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registrations of Respondents’ registered securities due to
their failures to timely file required periodic reports with the Securities and Exchange
Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On December 17, 2015, the Commission issued an order instituting proceedings (OIP)
pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP alleges that each
Respondent has a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g) and is delinquent in its required periodic filings. Respondents were served with
the OIP by December 23, 2015, and their answers were due by January 5, 2016. Dewpoint
Envtl., Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3471, 2016 SEC LEXIS 42 (ALJ Jan. 6, 2016).
Following Respondents’ failures to timely file answers, I ordered each Respondent to show cause
by January 19, 2016, why the registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due
to its failure to file an answer or otherwise defend this proceeding. Id. To date, no Respondent
has filed an answer or responded to the show cause order.

FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondents are in default for failing to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of
Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.
Dewpoint Environmental, Inc., Central Index Key (CIK) No. 1317840, is a void
Delaware corporation located in Austin, Texas, with a class of securities registered with the
Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic
filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-KSB
for the period ended January 31, 2007, which reported a net loss of $1,675 for the prior twelve
months.
DLR Funding, Inc., CIK No. 1026507, is a revoked Nevada corporation located in
Windsor, Colorado, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-KSB for the period
ended December 31, 2007, which reported a net loss of $4,260,000 for the prior twelve months.
Earth Energy Reserves, Inc., CIK No. 1327557, is a Nevada corporation located in Estes
Park, Colorado, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission,
having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period ended March 31,
2012, which reported a net loss of $2,265,563 for the prior nine months.
ELF Inc., CIK No. 1176188, is a delinquent Colorado corporation located in Littleton,
Colorado, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the Commission, having
not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-QSB for the period ended January 31,
2003, which reported a net loss of $2,881 for the prior nine months.
Expect the Best, Inc., CIK No. 1120816, is a dissolved Colorado corporation located in
Colorado Springs, Colorado, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant
to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed its registration statement on
August 4, 2000.
First Omega of Louisiana, Inc., CIK No. 1050109, is an inactive Louisiana corporation
located in Houston, Texas, with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its periodic filings with the
Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10 registration statement
on November 19, 1997.
In addition to their repeated failures to timely file periodic reports, Respondents failed to
heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with their periodic filing obligations, or through their failures to maintain

2

valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules, did not receive
such letters.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file periodic reports with the Commission. Specifically, Rule 13a-1 requires issuers to file
annual reports and Rule 13a-13 requires domestic issuers to file quarterly reports. See 17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. “Compliance with those requirements is mandatory and may not be
subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice, Inc., Exchange Act Release
No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons. denied, Exchange Act
Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is not required to establish
violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13. See SEC v. McNulty, 137
F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250, 1268 (D.D.C. 1978). By
failing to timely file required periodic reports, Respondents violated Exchange Act Section 13(a)
and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an opportunity for hearing,
that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the Exchange Act or
rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect investors, the
Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s violations, the
isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved, the extent of the
issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and the credibility of
its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondents’ failures to file required periodic reports are serious because they violate a
central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic reporting is “to supply investors
with current and accurate financial information about an issuer so that they may make sound
[investment] decisions.” Id. at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that
Congress fashioned for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate
misrepresentations in the sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st
Cir. 1977). Respondents’ violations are also recurrent in that each repeatedly failed to file
periodic reports. See Nature’s Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009
SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21, 2009); Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864,
2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May 23, 2008). Respondents are culpable because they
failed to heed delinquency letters sent to them by the Division of Corporation Finance, or
through their failures to maintain valid addresses on file with the Commission as required by
Commission rules, did not receive such letters; they were therefore on notice, even before the
OIP issued, of their obligations to file periodic reports. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act
Release No. 70800, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013). Finally, Respondents
have not answered the OIP or otherwise participated in the proceeding to address whether they
3

have made any efforts to remedy their past violations, and have made no assurances against
further violations.
Considering these delinquencies, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of
investors to revoke the registrations of each class of Respondents’ registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registrations of each class of registered securities of Dewpoint Environmental, Inc., DLR
Funding, Inc., Earth Energy Reserves, Inc., ELF Inc., Expect the Best, Inc., and First Omega of
Louisiana, Inc., are hereby REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a party may file a petition
for review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A
party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial
decision, pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of
fact is filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from
the date of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of
finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review
or a motion to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative
to review the initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall
not become final as to that party.
A Respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
