SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the Matter of
L&L ENERGY, INC.,
and DICKSON LEE, CPA

APPEARANCES:

INITIAL DECISION ON DEFAULT
February 17, 2016

Cheryl L. Crumpton for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission
Mark Bartlett, Davis Wright Tremaine LLP, as former
counsel for L&L Energy, Inc.
Russell M. Aoki, Aoki Law PLLC, for Dickson Lee, CPA

BEFORE:

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge

The Division of Enforcement alleges that L&L Energy, Inc., repeatedly and fraudulently
misrepresented in its public filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it had
certain persons serving in critical executive management roles when, in reality, those persons
served in no such roles. L&L was effectively under the single-handed control of Dickson Lee,
who is now in jail for securities fraud. L&L is in default for failing to answer, appear, or
participate in this proceeding, and I deem the allegations true. L&L’s misconduct violated the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, as well as reporting, certification, and
disclosure requirements. A cease-and-desist order against L&L, disgorgement of $748,300 plus
prejudgment interest, and a third-tier civil penalty of $2,675,000 are appropriate and in the public
interest.
This initial decision does not apply to Lee, who settled the proceeding with the
Commission. Dickson Lee, CPA, Securities Act of 1933 Release No. 9799, 2015 SEC LEXIS
2185 (June 1, 2015).
BACKGROUND
The Commission instituted this proceeding in March 2014. L&L was served with the
order instituting proceedings (OIP) no later than April 4, 2014. I stayed the proceeding from
April 3, 2014, to April 28, 2015, pending resolution of the criminal case against Respondents in

United States v. Lee, 14-cr-24 (W.D. Wash.). As noted in my order lifting the stay, Respondents
were convicted and sentenced in the criminal case. See L&L Energy, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings
Release No. 2599, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1601 (Apr. 28, 2015). That order also notified the parties
that a prehearing conference would be held on May 5, 2015. Id.
Counsel for the Division of Enforcement and Dickson Lee appeared at the prehearing
conference. L&L did not participate. L&L’s former counsel Mark Bartlett participated, but
made clear that he was not acting in a representative capacity. At the prehearing conference,
I directed that L&L’s answer to the OIP was due May 26, 2015, and set a procedural schedule to
resolve this proceeding. L&L Energy, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 2636, 2015 SEC
LEXIS 1732 (May 6, 2015). I warned that if L&L failed to file an answer within the time
provided, it would be deemed in default and the proceeding would be determined against it. Id.
L&L did not file an answer. As called for by the procedural schedule, the Division filed
a motion for default and sanctions against the company. Accompanying the motion were three
exhibits: L&L’s plea agreement from the criminal case (cited herein as Plea Agreement), Lee’s
plea agreement, and the Division’s report calculating prejudgment interest. L&L did not file an
opposition, which was due June 12, 2015. Subsequently, at my directive, the Division made two
supplemental filings: In late December 2015, the Division filed a supplemental brief; the
declaration of Ricky Sachar (Sachar Decl.); and two exhibits (Sachar Exs. 1-2). In January 2016,
the Division filed the declaration of Brad Mroski (Mroski Decl.) and twenty-one exhibits
(Mroski Exs. 2-22).
L&L is in default for failing to file an answer, appear at the prehearing conference,
respond to a dispositive motion, or otherwise defend the proceeding.
17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .220(f), .221(f). Accordingly, I deemed the OIP’s allegations to be true
and determine this proceeding based on the OIP, the record, and facts officially noticed,
including L&L’s public filings with the Commission. See 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(1)-(2), .323.
I admit into evidence the declarations and exhibits filed by the Division.
The factual findings and legal conclusions are based on the entire record. I applied
preponderance of the evidence as the standard of proof. See Steadman v. SEC, 450 U.S. 91, 10104 (1981).
FINDINGS OF FACT1
Summary
This action arises from a fraudulent scheme by L&L and Dickson Lee to create the
appearance that L&L was run by a professional management team and conceal Lee’s singlehanded control of the company. L&L is a Seattle-headquartered coal company with all of its

operations in China and Taiwan. At all relevant times, it was led by Lee, who resigned as the
company’s chairman and chief executive officer in April 2014, following the criminal indictment
in United States v. Lee. See Form 8-K filed May 30, 2014. From approximately August 2008 to
June 2009, L&L and Lee repeatedly and fraudulently misrepresented to the public that the
company had certain persons serving in critical executive management roles at the company
when, in reality, those persons served in no such roles.
First, in its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended April 30, 2008, filed on August 14, 2008
(2008 Form 10-K), L&L falsely represented that Lee’s brother served as the company’s CEO
when, in reality, Lee served in that role and ran the day-to-day operations of the company. In
that same filing, L&L represented that a former company employee, Nicol Leung, had become
the company’s acting chief financial officer (CFO).2 See 2008 Form 10-K. In reality, Leung had
emailed Lee a month prior to the filing of the 2008 Form 10-K and rejected the acting CFO
position. In the company’s next three quarterly reports, L&L and Lee continued to misrepresent
that Leung was the company’s acting CFO. For example, L&L’s public filings contained
certifications required under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that ostensibly bore Leung’s
electronic signature when, in reality, Leung had not signed any L&L public filings during this
period; did not provide authorization for her signature to be placed on any L&L public filings;
and did not perform any of the reviews necessary to have a basis for any of the attestations
contained on the Sarbanes-Oxley certifications.
In approximately May 2009, Leung learned that L&L had been falsely representing her as
the company’s acting CFO and confronted Lee and the chair of L&L’s audit committee. In
response, Lee separately admitted to Leung and the audit committee chair that Leung had not
performed the duties of L&L’s acting CFO, and then directed the audit committee chair to
conceal this fact from both the company’s board and the public. Lee maintained his fraudulent
scheme by continuing to falsely represent to L&L’s board of directors that Leung had served as
the acting CFO. Lastly, during the fall of 2009, in connection with an application for L&L to
gain listing on NASDAQ, Lee misled NASDAQ by informing it that the company had made all
of the required Sarbanes-Oxley certifications—including during the period of Leung’s ostensible
service as the acting CFO. As a result, L&L became listed on NASDAQ.
Respondents
1.
L&L is a Seattle, Washington, headquartered coal company with all of its
operations in China and Taiwan. The company became public through a reverse merger in
August 2001. L&L’s common stock is registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange
Act Section 12(b), and its stock was listed on NASDAQ as of the date of the OIP. L&L was
subject to the Commission’s periodic filing requirements and its shares were publicly traded.
Plea Agreement at 3.
2.
Dickson Lee is L&L’s founder and was chairman of its board and chief executive
officer from August 2008 to April 2014, when he resigned. Lee previously served as CEO from
1995 through July 2007 and chairman at various periods. He previously held CPA licenses in
2

The OIP refers to Leung as the purported acting CFO.

Washington and New York (both licenses have lapsed, with the Washington license lapsing in
June 2012) and previously audited public companies. Lee obtained his series 7 license in 1998
and his series 24 and 27 licenses in 2000. Lee was an associated person with a number of broker
dealers until about 2005.
The Scheme
Leung Rejects Acting CFO Position
3.
In August 2007, L&L publicly announced that Lee had resigned his position as
L&L’s chairman and CEO. Lee resigned those positions shortly after he was disciplined by the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), and received a one-year suspension for
conducting private placement offerings of L&L securities in which the private placement
memoranda contained false statements. Lee believed that, if he was an L&L officer, his
suspension would impede L&L from becoming listed on a stock exchange.
4.
At that time, Lee installed his brother as the CEO of L&L. During the one-year
period (August 2007 – August 2008) in which Lee’s brother held the title of L&L’s CEO,
however, Lee continued to run the company as he had when he held the title of CEO.
5.
In January 2008, L&L’s stock became quoted on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin
Board (OTCBB). In order to gain listing on a larger trading venue, such as NASDAQ, Lee
sought to hire a CFO for L&L.
6.
L&L hired a CFO in February 2008, but within two months that person resigned.
As L&L sought a replacement CFO, Lee proposed Leung, a former employee and L&L director,
as a candidate for L&L’s acting CFO position.
7.
In approximately June 2008, Lee, on L&L’s behalf, engaged a U.S.-based
placement agent to assist L&L in raising money from investors. This placement agent
encouraged L&L to hire a CFO. In a June 18, 2008, email, Lee referred to Leung as a member
of the management team that had been requested by the placement agent. In another June 2008
email, Lee wrote that Leung could become L&L’s acting CFO in order to meet the placement
agent’s “requirement.”
8.
On June 23, 2008, members of L&L’s board and Lee held a meeting. At that
meeting, Lee communicated that Leung would be appointed as the company’s acting CFO
because the placement agent “suggested that L&L needs to have [an] [a]cting CFO (a NonOfficer position) as one of the conditions to move L&L’s funding forward.”
9.
On that same day, at Lee’s instruction, Lee’s assistant sent Leung an email
thanking her for becoming L&L’s acting CFO. Leung, however, had never accepted the acting
CFO position.
10.
On July 14, 2008, Leung forwarded to Lee the June 23, 2008, email she received
from his assistant regarding the acting CFO position and informed Lee that she was “unable to
4

become L&L [a]cting CFO as I don’t have time to make any contribution to L&L. I need to take
care of my own job and my kids as well . . . I wish you could find a more suitable CFO soon.”
L&L Falsely Represents Lee’s Brother and Leung
as the Company’s CEO and Acting CFO
11.
On August 14, 2008, L&L filed its 2008 Form 10-K. Lee reviewed the filing
before it was made public.
12.
L&L, in its 2008 Form 10-K, falsely represented that Lee’s brother had performed
the functions of the company’s CEO when, in reality, Lee continued to perform the functions of
the company’s CEO.
13.
Moreover, in that same filing, L&L reported for the first time that Leung had been
named as the company’s acting CFO, disclosing that “she is a CPA with experience of both U.S.
and China accounting practices. She was a senior auditing manager for a New York CPA firm
with PCAOB qualification, and conducted US GAAP audits for US public listed companies.”
The representation that Leung was now the company’s acting CFO was false because Leung had
rejected the acting CFO position.
14.
L&L’s 2008 Form 10-K contained certifications required under Sarbanes-Oxley
for the company’s principal executive officer and principal financial officer, namely, its CEO
and CFO. These certifications contained the electronic signatures of both Lee’s brother and
Leung by which each of them attested to, among other things, the fact that the 2008 Form 10-K
contained no untrue statements of material fact.
15.
Neither Lee’s brother nor Leung, however, provided any such attestation and
neither Lee’s brother nor Leung provided any authorization to have their electronic signatures
placed on their respective Sarbanes-Oxley certifications.
16.
L&L, in its 2008 Form 10-K, also falsely represented that it had, with the
participation of its CEO (Lee’s brother) and CFO (Leung – the purported acting CFO), evaluated
the effectiveness of the design and operation of its disclosure controls and procedures, and based
on such evaluation, the company, its CEO (Lee’s brother), and CFO (Leung) concluded that the
disclosure controls and procedures were effective.
L&L and Lee Continue their Scheme to Falsely Represent
Leung as the Acting CFO
17.
On August 25, 2008, after his one-year NASD suspension was over, Lee officially
returned to the position of L&L’s CEO and chairman.
18.
On September 15, 2008, L&L filed with the Commission its Form 10-Q for the
period ended July 31, 2008 (the First Quarter Form 10-Q).3 Lee signed the filing. Like the 2008
3

The OIP incorrectly notes this period as the period ended July 31, 2009.
5

Form 10-K, the First Quarter Form 10-Q contained a Sarbanes-Oxley certification that was
ostensibly electronically signed by Leung. Moreover, the First Quarter Form 10-Q4 also
contained the representation that the CEO (Lee) and Leung had evaluated the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures and those controls and
procedures were effective.
19.
Leung, however, did not serve as the company’s acting CFO in any capacity; did
not authorize her electronic signature to be placed on the Sarbanes-Oxley certifications; did not
perform any of the reviews or functions enumerated on the Sarbanes-Oxley certifications; and
did not evaluate the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures.
20.
The First Quarter Form 10-Q also contained a Sarbanes-Oxley certification for
Lee. In his Sarbanes-Oxley certification, Lee falsely certified that, to his knowledge, L&L’s
First Quarter Form 10-Q contained no untrue statements of material fact.
21.
In approximately December 2008, L&L retained a U.S.-based investment research
firm to write a research report concerning L&L. In late December 2008, the research firm
emailed Lee a draft research report for his review. The research report contained a prominent
section on L&L’s management team, listed Leung as the company’s CFO and stated that Leung
“coordinates all accounting for L&L.” Lee sent a revised version of the research report to the
research firm with some “minor changes,” but did not correct the false statements regarding
Leung as the acting CFO. This report was published in approximately April 2009 and included
the false statements regarding Leung’s role as the acting CFO.
22.
On December 22, 2008, L&L filed with the Commission its Form 10-Q for the
period ended October 31, 2008, and on March 23, 2009, L&L filed with the Commission its
Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2009. Lee signed both of these filings. These two
public filings again contained false, electronically signed, Sarbanes-Oxley certifications by
Leung as the acting CFO. Moreover, these two filings contained the false statements concerning
Leung’s evaluation of the effectiveness of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures.
23.
These two public filings also contained Lee’s own Sarbanes-Oxley certifications
in which he again falsely certified that, to his knowledge, the Forms 10-Q contained no untrue
statements of material fact.
24.
As noted above, L&L placed electronic signatures on the public filings to reflect
that Leung had signed the requisite Sarbanes-Oxley certifications. The Commission staff
requested from L&L, but never received, the actual signature pages bearing Leung’s signature
for each of the requisite Sarbanes-Oxley certifications.
25.
L&L continued representing to the public that Leung was the acting CFO until
June 2009, when the company filed a Form 8-K announcing that another individual had been
appointed as the company’s acting CFO. See Form 8-K filed June 23, 2009. On August 13,

4

The OIP refers to this filing as the “First Quarter 2009 Form 10-K.”
6

2009,5 L&L filed its 2009 Form 10-K, which contained Lee’s Sarbanes-Oxley certification that,
based on his and the new CFO’s most recent evaluation of the company’s internal control over
financial reporting, all fraud involving management had been disclosed to the company’s
auditors and to the company’s audit committee. This certification was false because Lee had not
disclosed to the company’s external auditors or the company’s entire audit committee that Leung
was misrepresented in L&L’s previous filings as its acting CFO.
Lee Admits that Leung Did Not Perform the Work of the Acting CFO
26.
In approximately May 2009, Leung became aware that L&L had falsely
represented her as the company’s acting CFO in the company’s public filings and, on May 6,
2009, sent Lee an email that included her July 14, 2008, email in which she rejected the acting
CFO position. In the email, Leung wrote that she “clearly indicated that [she] would not accept
the offer of being the [a]cting CFO of L&L,” and asked Lee for an immediate explanation.
27.
On May 13, 2009, Lee emailed Leung and wrote: “[t]here is a misunderstanding
of the [a]cting CFO role . . . Based on your input, your name is removed to please you.” Leung
replied that—just because she and Lee had known each other for ten years—it did not mean “that
you could use my name, without authorisation, to the file 10K to the U.S. SEC.” In response, on
May 19, 2009, Lee emailed Leung and separately admitted, “[y]ou did not actually conduct the
work as [a]cting [CFO].”
Lee Admits to L&L’s Audit Committee Chair that Leung Did Not Serve as Acting CFO
28.
On May 21, 2009, Leung emailed Shirley Kiang, who was then the chair of
L&L’s audit committee and a member of its board of directors. In the email, Leung told Kiang
that she had a “serious and urgent” matter related to L&L’s public information made without her
knowledge and asked Kiang to investigate.
29.
Kiang subsequently contacted Lee and asked whether Leung had actually served
as the company’s acting CFO. Lee initially informed Kiang that Leung had served as the
company’s acting CFO and was making false allegations in an attempt to obtain money from the
company.
30.
Kiang asked Lee for evidence to support his assertion that Leung had served as
the company’s acting CFO. In response, Lee provided Kiang with a letter that appeared to be
addressed to Leung, dated May 28, 2008, and purported to be signed by Lee’s brother as the
company’s CEO. The letter asked Leung to confirm that she had agreed to accept the acting
CFO position and stated that if the company did not receive a response to the letter within ten
days, the company would treat her lack of response as her acceptance of the position.
31.
This letter, however, was not created on May 28, 2008; was not signed by Lee’s
brother; and was never sent to Leung. Rather, this letter was created on May 26, 2009—almost

5

The OIP incorrectly identifies the filing date as August 12.
7

one year after Leung had rejected the position—and was stored in Lee’s L&L computer network
folder.
32.
On June 4, 2009—after receiving no response from Kiang—Leung emailed Kiang
again. Leung again asked Kiang to investigate her allegations, specifically that she was
misrepresented in L&L’s filings as the company’s acting CFO, and included her July 14, 2008,
email to Lee rejecting the position.
33.
After receiving the June 4 email, Kiang again asked Lee for an explanation. Lee
then admitted to Kiang that Leung had not actually served as the company’s acting CFO and that
he had used Leung’s name on L&L’s public filings without Leung’s permission. Lee directed
Kiang to not disclose this information to anyone, including the company’s board of directors or
the public, and told her that if this information became publicly known, L&L’s stock price would
drop.
34.
After this, Lee continued to falsely represent to the company’s board of directors
that Leung had served as the company’s acting CFO.
35.
During the nearly one-year period in which Leung was falsely represented in
public filings as the company’s acting CFO, L&L raised at least $748,300 from investors using
stock purchase agreements and convertible debt in which L&L expressly attested to the accuracy
of its public filings and private placement documents that referred the investor to publicly
available additional information about the company. Mroski Decl. ¶¶ 5, 36.
L&L Makes Materially False and Misleading Statements on NASDAQ Application
to Gain NASDAQ Listing
36.
In approximately September 2009, L&L completed an application to become
listed on NASDAQ. As part of the application process, NASDAQ requested a variety of
information, including confirmation that the company had made all of the required SarbanesOxley certifications.
37.
L&L, in a communication from Lee, confirmed that the company had made all of
the required Sarbanes-Oxley certifications. L&L misled NASDAQ in this communication
because it did not inform NASDAQ that its required CFO Sarbanes-Oxley certifications for its
2008 Form 10-K or its three subsequent Forms 10-Q were false. As a result, L&L gained listing
on NASDAQ in February 2010.
Criminal Proceedings
I take official notice of the proceedings in United States v. Lee, 14-cr-24 (W.D. Wash.).
See 17 C.F.R. § 201.323.
L&L pleaded guilty before a federal magistrate judge to one count of securities fraud in
violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1348. See Minute Entry, Plea Agreement, Report & Recommendation,
Lee (Jan. 22, 2015), ECF Nos. 67-69. The district court accepted that plea and adjudicated L&L
8

as guilty. See Order of Acceptance of Plea of Guilty, Lee (Feb. 6, 2015), ECF No. 71. In its plea
agreement, L&L stipulated to facts along the same lines of the OIP’s allegations. See Plea
Agreement. The court sentenced L&L to five years of corporate probation, fined the company
$175,000, and prohibited the company from listing or offering on any U.S. securities exchange
its securities or otherwise offering securities in the United States. See Judgment, Lee (Apr. 24,
2015), ECF No. 82.
Lee pleaded guilty to two counts of securities fraud in violation of 18 U.S.C. § 1348, and
the district court sentenced him to five years in prison. See Minute Entry, Plea Agreement,
Report & Recommendation, Order of Acceptance of Plea of Guilty, and Judgment, Lee (Sept. 23,
2014, Oct. 8, 2014, and Feb. 20, 2015), ECF Nos. 48, 50-52, 74.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Securities Act Section 17(a), and Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5
Material Misstatements and Omissions
A violation of Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b) is established when a
person 1) makes a material misstatement or omission 2) with scienter 3) in connection with the
purchase or sale of securities 4) by means of interstate commerce or the mails. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b); SEC v. Todd, 642 F.3d 1207, 1215 (9th Cir. 2011); VanCook
v. SEC, 653 F.3d 130, 138 (2d Cir. 2011). By contrast, a violation of Securities Act Section
17(a)(2) turns on whether the respondent has directly or indirectly obtained money or property
“by means of” a material untrue statement or omission in the offer or sale of securities using the
means of interstate commerce. 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2). Liability under Section 17(a)(2) does not
depend on whether the respondent made a false statement and does not require scienter. See
Aaron v. SEC, 446 U.S. 680, 696 (1980); SEC v. Stoker, 865 F. Supp. 2d 457, 464-66 (S.D.N.Y.
2012).
L&L’s public filings contained false statements and omissions. Specifically, the
company’s 2008 Form 10-K reported that Leung (the purported acting CFO) had been named the
company’s acting CFO, despite the fact that she had declined the position. OIP ¶¶ 10-11, 13.
Also, the Form 10-K falsely represented that Lee’s brother had performed the functions of
L&L’s CEO for a period of time, when, in reality, Lee continued to perform those functions;
contained false certifications attesting to the accuracy of the filings and appropriateness of
internal controls; and falsely represented that the company had evaluated the effectiveness of the
company’s internal disclosure controls and found that such disclosure controls were effective,
with the participation of its purported CEO (Lee’s brother) and purported acting CFO (Leung).
Id. ¶¶ 4, 11-12, 14-16. The Form 10-K failed to disclose Lee’s role as performing the functions
of the company’s CEO, id. ¶ 12, and failed to disclose that the company, in reality, had no acting
CFO, id. at 2-7 & ¶ 13; 2008 Form 10-K.
L&L’s next three Forms 10-Q contained false certifications that Lee and Leung had
evaluated the effectiveness of the company’s internal disclosure controls and found that such
disclosure controls were effective; and Lee’s false certification that the reports contained no
9

untrue statements of material fact. OIP ¶¶ 18-20, 22-24. As with the 2008 Form 10-K, the
Forms 10-Q contained Leung’s unauthorized electronic signature. Id. ¶¶ 14-15, 18-19, 24.
Additionally, L&L’s 2009 Form 10-K contained Lee’s false certification that all fraud involving
management had been disclosed to the company’s auditors and audit committee when, in fact,
Lee had not fully disclosed the misrepresentations regarding Leung as the acting CFO to the
company’s external auditors or the entire audit committee. Id. ¶ 25.
These false statements and omissions were material. See Basic Inc. v. Levinson, 485 U.S.
224, 231-32, 240 (1988) (materiality is established when a reasonable investor would have
viewed the misstatement or omission “as having significantly altered the total mix of information
made available” (internal quotation marks omitted)). Indeed, L&L stipulated in its plea
agreement that its false statements were material. Plea Agreement at 2, 4-5. A reasonable
investor would place importance on a company having a bona fide CFO and CEO performing the
functions of those positions, and Lee’s central role in fabricating the false statements and
omissions impugned the company’s integrity, which alone would be material to investors. See
United States v. Hatfield, 724 F. Supp. 2d 321, 328 (E.D.N.Y. 2010) (“It is well-settled that
information impugning management’s integrity is material to shareholders.”); In re Monster
Worldwide, Inc. Sec. Litig., 251 F.R.D. 132, 139 (S.D.N.Y. 2008) (concluding that because a
CEO “personally certified the false statements in this case, they can be seen as impugning the
integrity of management, which in itself would [be] material to investors” (internal quotation
marks and alterations omitted)). Further, the company’s filings with the Commission contained
forged signatures, which “call the entire document[s] into question,” and a reasonable investor
would find it important that a purported officer “did not sign the documents and likely did not
read them.” United States v. Wheeler, 29 F.3d 637, at *1 (9th Cir. 1994) (unpublished).
These false statements and omissions were made with scienter, “a mental state embracing
intent to deceive, manipulate, or defraud.” Aaron, 446 U.S. at 686 n.5 (internal quotation marks
omitted). L&L stipulated as such in its plea agreement. Plea Agreement at 2-3. Although Lee
did not sign the 2008 Form 10-K, he reviewed it prior to its issuance and had single-handed
control over the company. At that time, Lee knew that Leung had rejected the offer to become
L&L’s acting CFO and that his brother did not perform the duties of CEO. As to the next three
Forms 10-Q, Lee signed each of them and, at the time, he knew that Leung had rejected the
acting CFO position. Given Lee’s control over L&L and its filings, Lee’s scienter is imputed to
L&L. See Clarke T. Blizzard, Advisers Act Release No. 2253, 2004 SEC LEXIS 1298, at *20
(June 23, 2004).
L&L’s fraud was committed in connection with the purchase or sale of securities within
the meaning of Exchange Act Section 10(b), and in the offer or sale of securities within the
meaning of Securities Act Section 17(a). See SEC v. Zandford, 535 U.S. 813, 819-20, 825
(2002) (Exchange Act Section 10(b)’s nexus requirement is to be construed broadly and
flexibly); United States v. Naftalin, 441 U.S. 768, 778 (1979) (Securities Act Section 17(a) was
intended to cover any fraudulent scheme in an offer or sale of securities). Where, as here, the
fraud involves the public dissemination of misinformation in public filings with the Commission,
the nexus element is generally met by proof of the means of its dissemination and the materiality
of the misrepresentation or omission. See SEC v. Wolfson, 539 F.3d 1249, 1262-63 (10th Cir.
2008) (collecting case-law); SEC v. Rana Research, Inc., 8 F.3d 1358, 1362 (9th Cir. 1993).
10

L&L’s public filings, like all reports filed with the Commission, were designed to reach investors
and are documents upon which a reasonable investor would presumably rely in deciding whether
to purchase its securities, and as already discussed, materiality is established. See Wolfson, 539
F.3d at 1262-63; SEC v. Benson, 657 F. Supp. 1122, 1131 (S.D.N.Y. 1987); Rita J. McConville,
Exchange Act Release No. 51950, 2005 SEC LEXIS 1538, at *36-37 (June 30, 2005), pet.
denied, 465 F.3d 780 (7th Cir. 2006); OIP ¶ 35.
The interstate commerce element is satisfied because the misrepresentations and
omissions relate to L&L’s public filings, which were filed with the Commission by electronic
means, through the telephone lines or otherwise across state lines using interstate commerce. See
Rita J. McConville, 2005 SEC LEXIS 1538, at *38; Plea Agreement at 4 (L&L’s filings
submitted from Tukwila, Washington).
Further, L&L obtained money or property “by means of” the above materially false
statements and omissions within the meaning of Section 17(a)(2). See 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2);
Stoker, 865 F. Supp. 2d at 465. During the period when these misstatements were made, L&L
raised at least $748,300 from investors using stock purchase agreements and convertible debt in
which the company expressly attested to the accuracy of its public filings and private placement
documents that referred the investor to publicly available additional information about the
company. As already discussed, public filings with the Commission are documents designed to
reach investors and upon which a reasonable investor would presumably rely in making
investment decisions. L&L’s misstatements and omissions in those filings regarding its chief
officers and accompanying false certifications and signatures—made during the very period in
which it obtained investor money through stock offerings—establishes that it obtained money by
means of such misrepresentations.
Accordingly, L&L violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(b), as well as
Securities Act Section 17(a)(2).
Scheme Liability
Under Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), scheme liability extends to
a person who 1) employs any manipulative or deceptive device, or engages in any manipulative
or deceptive act, 2) with scienter 3) in connection with the purchase or sale of securities 4) by
means of interstate commerce or the mails. See 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b); 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(a),
(c); Aaron, 446 U.S. at 691. Deceptive devices and acts include engaging in conduct that has
“the principal purpose and effect of creating a false appearance of fact in furtherance of the
scheme.” SEC v. Brown, 740 F. Supp. 2d 148, 172 (D.D.C. 2010) (quoting Simpson v. AOL
Time Warner Inc., 452 F.3d 1040, 1048 (9th Cir. 2006), vacated on other grounds, Avis Budget
Group, Inc. v. Cal. State Teachers’ Ret. Sys., 552 U.S. 1162 (2008)); see SEC v. Dorozhko, 574
F.3d 42, 50 (2d Cir. 2009) (“In its ordinary meaning, ‘deceptive’ covers a wide spectrum of
conduct involving cheating or trading in falsehoods. . . . [C]onduct prohibited by Section 10(b)
and Rule 10b-5 irreducibly entails some act that gives the victim a false impression.” (internal
citations and quotation marks omitted)).

11

Securities Act Section 17(a)(1) and (3) make it unlawful for a person, in the offer or sale
of securities, and by means of interstate commerce or the mails, “to employ any device, scheme,
or artifice to defraud,” or “to engage in any transaction, practice, or course of business which
operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the purchaser.” 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(1), (3).
Section 17(a)(1) requires scienter, whereas Section 17(a)(3) does not. Aaron, 446 U.S. at 69597.
L&L’s repeated false statements in its periodic filings with the Commission (which
included the false Sarbanes-Oxley certifications) constituted manipulative and deceptive devices
and acts within the meaning of Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), as well as fraudulent devices and practices
within the meaning of Section 17(a)(1) and (3). L&L engaged in conduct to make it appear that
Lee’s brother and Leung were responsible for and performed critical aspects of L&L’s
business—creating false appearances of fact. The company raised at least $748,300 from
investors during the period of its fraud, misleading and defrauding them by using falsehoods in
public documents on which investors would presumably rely in making investment decisions.
Two purposes of this scheme were to raise money from investors and gain L&L’s listing
on NASDAQ. In furtherance of this scheme, Lee fabricated a letter from his brother requesting
Leung to confirm acceptance of the acting CFO position and treating any non-response as
acceptance. OIP ¶¶ 30-31. He then instructed Kiang, the chair of the company’s audit
committee and a board member, to conceal that Leung never served as the company’s acting
CFO, and lied to L&L’s board members regarding the situation. Id. ¶ 33-34. Lee arranged for
Leung’s digital signature to be placed on L&L’s certifications without her authorization, which
enabled L&L to misrepresent to NASDAQ that its Sarbanes-Oxley certifications were complete.
Id. ¶¶ 14-15, 19, 24, 36-37. These acts are imputable to L&L. See Cohen v. Joint Health
Ventures, 107 F. App’x 714, 718 n.1 (9th Cir. 2004) (“[A] corporation always acts through its
officers and agents.”); A.J. White & Co. v. SEC, 556 F.2d 619, 624 (1st Cir. 1977) (a firm “can
act only through its agents, and is accountable for the actions of its responsible officers”).
As already discussed, L&L’s conduct was committed with scienter, in connection with
the purchase or sale of securities within the meaning of the Exchange Act, in the offer or sale of
securities within the meaning of the Securities Act, and by interstate means.
Accordingly, L&L violated Exchange Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5(a) and (c), as
well as Securities Act Section 17(a)(1) and (3).
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require issuers with securities
registered under Section 12 to file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. 15 U.S.C.
§ 78m(a); 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-1, .13a-13. L&L violated these provisions as a result of filing
annual and quarterly reports with the Commission that contained materially false information
and omissions. See SEC v. Kalvex, Inc., 425 F. Supp. 310, 316 (S.D.N.Y. 1975) (“Clearly the
requirement that an issuer file reports under Section 13(a) embodies the requirement that such
reports be true and correct, and a failure to comply with such section would result in violations of
the securities laws.”); Russell Ponce, Exchange Act Release No. 43235, 2000 SEC LEXIS 1814,
12

at *18 n.23 (Aug. 31, 2000) (“A violation of Section 13(a) is established if a quarterly or annual
report contains materially false statements or fails to state material information necessary to
make the statements in it not misleading.”), pet. denied, 345 F.3d 722 (9th Cir. 2003).
Exchange Act Rule 13a-14
In relevant part, Rule 13a-14 requires that principal executive and financial officers
certify that, based on their knowledge, the issuer’s financial statements are accurate, and that,
based on their most recent evaluation of the company’s internal control over financial reporting,
they have disclosed all fraud involving management, whether or not material, to the company’s
auditors and audit committee. 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.13a-14, 229.601(b)(31). The false certifications
in L&L’s periodic fillings violated this rule.6
Exchange Act Rule 13a-15
Rule 13a-15(b) provides that each issuer’s management must evaluate, with the
participation of the issuer’s principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons
performing similar functions, the effectiveness of the issuer’s disclosure controls and procedures,
on a quarterly basis. 17 C.F.R. § 240.13a-15(b). L&L’s public filings falsely represented that its
officers, including Leung and Lee’s brother, performed the required evaluation. But L&L had no
bona fide CFO, as Leung never served in that capacity. For a period of time, Lee’s brother
purportedly served as the company’s CEO when, in reality, Lee performed the CEO functions.
The company therefore lacked any genuine management structure to evaluate the effectiveness
of its disclosure controls and procedures, and, given the knowingly false statements and forged
signatures of Leung and Lee’s brother in L&L’s periodic filings, it is apparent that no such
evaluation took place. L&L therefore violated this rule.
Exchange Act Rule 12b-20
Rule 12b-20 requires that reports filed with the Commission contain further material
information “as may be necessary to make the required statements, in the light of the
circumstances under which they are made[,] not misleading.” 17 C.F.R. § 240.12b-20. L&L
violated this rule by failing to disclose that while Lee’s brother held the title of CEO for a period
of time, Lee still functioned as the company’s CEO. OIP ¶ 12. The company also failed to
disclose that it had no genuine acting CFO in its 2008 Form 10-K and next three Forms 10-Q.

6

At least one district court has held that the Commission could not pursue a Rule 13a-14
violation as an independent claim in federal court. See, e.g., SEC v. Black , No. 04-cv-7377, 2008
WL 4394891, at *16-17 (N.D. Ill. Sept. 24, 2008). However, the Black decision is inconsistent
with the weight of authority, which holds that Exchange Act Section 21(d)(1) authorizes such a
claim in federal court. See SEC v. Brown, 878 F. Supp. 2d 109, 118 & n.4 (D.D.C. 2012)
(collecting cases). Analogously, Section 21C authorizes a Rule 13a-14 claim in this proceeding.
OIP at 1, 8; see 15 U.S.C. § 78u-3(a) (Commission authority to bring a cease-and-desist
proceeding if “any person is violating, has violated, or is about to violate any provision of this
chapter, or any rule or regulation thereunder” (emphasis added)).
13

Section 302 of Regulation S-T of the Exchange Act
In relevant part, Regulation S-T requires that: 1) each signatory to an electronic filing
manually sign a signature page or other document authenticating, acknowledging or otherwise
adopting his or her signature that appears in typed form within the electronic filing; 2) such
document be executed before or at the time the electronic filing is made and retained by the filer
for a period of five years; and 3) the filer provide the Commission staff with a copy of the
document upon request. 17 C.F.R. § 232.302(b). L&L violated this provision, as Leung never
signed the certifications for the 2008 Form 10-K or the next three Forms 10-Q, and Lee’s brother
never signed the certification for the 2008 Form 10-K. OIP ¶¶ 14-15, 18-19, 22, 24. Further,
despite the Division’s requests, L&L never produced any actual signature pages for Leung as the
purported acting CFO. Id. ¶ 24.
Willfulness
Based on the above misconduct and scienter, L&L’s violations were willful. See
Wonsover v. SEC, 205 F.3d 408, 413-15 (D.C. Cir. 2000); Donald L. Koch, Exchange Act
Release No. 72179, 2014 SEC LEXIS 1684, at *48-49 n.139 (May 16, 2014), vacated on other
grounds, 793 F.3d 147 (D.C. Cir. 2015).
SANCTIONS
The Division seeks disgorgement, a cease-and-desist order, and a third-tier civil penalty.
Disgorgement
Securities Act Section 8A and Exchange Act Section 21B authorize disgorgement,
including reasonable interest, in this proceeding. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(e), 78u-2(e); OIP at 8.
Disgorgement of ill-gotten gains “is an equitable remedy designed to deprive a wrongdoer of his
unjust enrichment and to deter others from violating the securities laws.” Montford & Co.,
Advisers Act Release No. 3829, 2014 SEC LEXIS 1529, at *94 (May 2, 2014) (quoting SEC v.
First City Fin. Corp., 890 F.2d 1215, 1230 (D.C. Cir. 1989)), pet. denied, 793 F.3d 76 (D.C. Cir.
2015). “The Division has the initial burden of demonstrating a reasonable approximation of
profits causally connected to the violation.” Jay T. Comeaux, Securities Act Release No. 9633,
2014 SEC LEXIS 3001, at *9 (Aug. 21, 2014) (internal quotation marks omitted). “The Division
need only show but-for causation between a [respondent]’s violations and profits.” Id. “The
burden then shifts to the respondent to demonstrate that the Division’s estimate is not a
reasonable approximation.” Id. at *9-10 (internal quotation marks omitted). “Uncertainty as to
the amount of unjust enrichment will not prevent disgorgement.” Id. at *10.
From the filing of L&L’s 2008 Form 10-K on August 14, 2008, until the filing of a Form
8-K on June 23, 2009, L&L’s public filings with the Commission falsely represented Leung as
the company’s acting CFO. During this same period, the company raised at least $748,300 from
investors using stock purchase agreements and convertible debt in which L&L expressly attested
to the accuracy of its public filings and private placement documents that referred the investor to
publicly available additional information about the company. Mroski Decl. ¶¶ 5, 36; OIP ¶ 35.
14

The $748,300 raised from investors is a reasonable approximation of profits causally
connected to the violation, although my reasons for such finding somewhat differ from those
advanced by the Division. First, although it is correct that I can deem true the OIP’s allegations,
it is questionable whether significant monetary sanctions can or should be imposed without some
meaningful explanation substantiating the requested relief against a defaulted party. See
Rapoport v. SEC, 682 F.3d 98, 108 (D.C. Cir. 2012). In its motion for sanctions, the Division’s
request for disgorgement was supported only by paragraph 35 of the OIP, which alleges that
“L&L raised approximately $750,000” during the relevant period. Motion at 24; OIP ¶ 35. In
other words, the Division’s requested disgorgement amount was originally based on the
$750,000 figure alleged in the OIP. I therefore directed the Division to supplement the record,
and the Division provided the declaration of an assistant chief accountant and exhibits that
support a finding that $748,300 was raised from investors during the period of misconduct. See
Mroski Decl. & Exs. 2-22.
Second, there must be “but-for causation between a [respondent]’s violations and
profits.” Jay T. Comeaux, 2014 SEC LEXIS 3001, at *9. Here, the requisite causal link between
L&L’s violation and the $748,300 raised from investors is present because L&L’s material
misstatements struck at the heart of its public filings and perpetuated a scheme to deceive
investors into believing that it had a bona fide acting CFO and, for a period, that Lee’s brother
was a bona fide CEO. I reemphasize that public filings with the Commission are documents
designed to reach investors and upon which a reasonable investor would presumably rely in
making investment decisions. L&L had no legitimate acting CFO during the time at issue and no
legitimate signature from such CFO on its Sarbanes-Oxley certifications. In these circumstances,
L&L’s public filings were impugned and its public image was a sham; if the truth were known, it
is doubtful that the company could have raised a cent from any reasonable investor.
Third, how a respondent choses to spend ill-gotten gains generally does not entitle the
respondent to an offset in disgorgement. See Richmark Capital Corp., Securities Act Release
No. 8333, 2003 SEC LEXIS 2680, at *34 n.35 (Nov. 7, 2003) (collecting case-law). On the
other hand, money repaid or distributed to investor-victims could offset disgorgement. Although
the purpose of disgorgement is not to compensate victims, it cannot be said that a respondent was
unjustly enriched by amounts repaid to investors.7 See SEC v. Palmisano, 135 F.3d 860, 863-64
7

See, e.g., SEC v. ETS Payphones, Inc., 408 F.3d 727, 735 (11th Cir. 2005) (“[T]he ‘power to
order disgorgement extends only to the amount with interest by which the defendant profited
from his wrongdoing. Any further sum would constitute a penalty assessment.’” (quoting SEC v.
Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1335 (5th Cir. 1978))); SEC v. Loomis, 17 F. Supp. 3d 1026, 1032 (E.D.
Cal. 2014) (directing the Commission to submit disgorgement figures that accounted for funds
repaid to investors); SEC v. Rockwell Energy of Texas, LLC, No. 09-cv-4080, 2012 WL 360191,
at *3 (S.D. Tex. Feb. 1, 2012) (defendants “must receive a set-off ‘for amounts repaid to
investors’” (quoting SEC v. United Energy Partners, Inc., 88 F. App’x 744, 747 (5th Cir.
2004))); SEC v. Haligiannis, 470 F. Supp. 2d 373, 384 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) (“[C]ontributions may
be considered ill-gotten gains as a result of the fraud, although distributions must be subtracted
as they did not unjustly enrich defendant.”); SEC v. Monarch Funding Corp., No. 85-cv-7072,
1996 WL 348209, at *10 (S.D.N.Y. June 24, 1996) (“[I]t is axiomatic that disgorgement should
15

(2d Cir. 1998) (modifying judgment “to provide that to the extent that [the defendant] pays or
has paid restitution [to victims] as ordered in the criminal judgment, such payments will offset
his disgorgement obligation under the present judgment”). Here, however, there is no indication
that any stock proceeds were repaid or distributed to investors. L&L’s 2008, 2009, and 2010
Forms 10-K indicate that the company did not intend to pay dividends and instead planned to
retain all earnings, if any, to finance or expand its business.8 Also, the Division represents that
L&L failed to produce its accounting records despite an investigative subpoena seeking those
records and that, during the investigation, the Division did not become aware of any evidence
that L&L returned any portion of the stock proceeds to investors. Sachar Decl. ¶¶ 3, 5 & Ex. 1.
In this context, any uncertainty in the disgorgement amount falls on L&L, which has chosen not
to appear in this proceeding. See First City Fin. Corp., 890 F.2d at 1230 (“[T]he risk of
uncertainty should fall on the wrongdoer whose illegal conduct created that uncertainty.”).
Accordingly, upon the supplemented record, the Division has met its burden that
$748,300 is a reasonable approximation of L&L’s illicit gains. I will order disgorgement of this
amount, plus prejudgment interest. 9
Cease and Desist
Securities Act Section 8A and Exchange Act Section 21C authorize the Commission to
issue a cease-and-desist order where, as here, the respondent has violated any provision of the
Securities or Exchange Acts. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(a), 78u-3(a); OIP at 9. Although there must be
some likelihood of future violations whenever the Commission issues a cease-and-desist order,
the required showing is “significantly less than that required for an injunction.” KPMG Peat
Marwick LLP, Exchange Act Release No. 43862, 2001 SEC LEXIS 98, at *114 (Jan. 19, 2001),
pet. denied, 289 F.3d 109 (D.C. Cir. 2002). Absent evidence to the contrary, a single past
violation ordinarily suffices to establish a risk of future violations. Id. at *102-03.
In determining whether to issue a cease-and-desist order, the Commission considers,
along with the risk of future violations, the following factors: “the seriousness of the violation,
the isolated or recurrent nature of the violation, the respondent’s state of mind, the sincerity of
the respondent’s assurances against future violations, the respondent’s recognition of the
wrongful nature of his or her conduct, and the respondent’s opportunity to commit future
violations.” Id. at *116. In addition, the Commission considers “whether the violation is recent,
the degree of harm to investors or the marketplace resulting from the violation, and the remedial
be fashioned on the amount of ill-gotten gain currently realized by the defendant and not yet
already repaid.”).
8

See 2010 Form 10-K filed July 28, 2010, at 13, 16; 2009 Form 10-K filed Aug. 13, 2009, at 13;
2008 Form 10-K at 8.
9

L&L continued to misrepresent Leung as the acting CFO until June 23, 2009, when the
company filed a Form 8-K stating that the company had appointed a new acting CFO.
Accordingly, prejudgment interest shall run from July 1, 2009, “through the last day of the
month preceding the month in which payment of disgorgement is made.” 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.600(a). I will define the prejudgment interest rate in the ordering paragraphs.
16

function to be served by the cease-and-desist order in the context of any other sanctions being
sought in the same proceedings.” Id. The Commission weighs these factors in light of the entire
record, and no one factor is dispositive. Id.; accord Montford & Co., 2014 SEC LEXIS 1529, at
*88.
L&L committed serious violations of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws and
such violations were ongoing and repetitive. This warrants a severe sanction. See Peter Siris,
Exchange Act Release No. 71068, 2013 SEC LEXIS 3924, at *23 (Dec. 12, 2013) (the
Commission has “repeatedly held that conduct that violates the antifraud provisions of the
securities laws is especially serious and subject to the severest of sanctions under the securities
laws” (internal quotation marks omitted)), pet. denied, 773 F.3d 89 (D.C. Cir. 2014); Richard C.
Spangler, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 12104, 1976 SEC LEXIS 2418, at *34 (Feb. 12, 1976)
(“When the past misconduct involves fraud, fidelity to the public interest requires us to be
mindful of the fact that the securities business is one in which opportunities for dishonesty recur
constantly and that this necessitates specialized legal treatment.” (internal footnote omitted)).
L&L filed multiple reports with the Commission with forged signatures and created false
appearances that it had an acting CFO, when, in reality, it had no acting CFO for nearly a year.
It also falsely represented having Lee’s brother as a legitimate CEO for a period of time when, in
reality, Lee continued to control the company. L&L has not appeared in this action to rebut the
presumption that such misconduct creates the risk for future violations. Further, as already
discussed, its misconduct was committed with a high degree of scienter—intent to defraud. Lee,
whose actions are imputed to the company, knew that Leung was not serving as the acting CFO
and did not perform the duties of such position, yet deliberately and deceptively misrepresented
her as serving in such position to the public. Although L&L’s guilty plea may serve as some
recognition of the wrongful nature of its misconduct, the company has not appeared in this action
to provide any further assurances.
As the company appears to be inactive, and Lee has been sentenced to prison, it is less
likely that the company will commit wrongdoing in the immediate future. Also, the violations
were not particularly recent. However, such factors are not dispositive. The company is still in
existence and nothing precludes Lee, either directly or through someone else, from again using
L&L as a vehicle for fraud.
The Division has not presented direct evidence of investor harm aside from the
substantial money raised from investors, which does not appear to be have been repaid. In any
event, such harm is evident given the nature of the violations. A reasonable investor would have
felt deceived by L&L’s conduct and, if aware of such conduct, would not have invested in the
company. Lastly, a cease-and-desist order puts the public on notice regarding L&L’s fraudulent
actions and prohibits the company from committing future misconduct.
Civil Money Penalty
Securities Act Section 8A and Exchange Act Section 21B authorize the Commission to
impose civil money penalties in a cease-and-desist proceeding such as this one where the
respondent violated provisions of the Securities and Exchange Acts and such penalty is in the
17

public interest. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(g)(1), 78u-2(a)(2); OIP at 8. A maximum third-tier penalty
is specifically authorized because L&L’s violations involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, and
deliberate and reckless disregard of regulatory requirements; and created a significant risk of
substantial losses to other persons. 15 U.S.C. §§ 77h-1(g)(2)(C), 78u-2(b)(3). To determine
whether a penalty is in the public interest, the Commission considers: (1) whether the violations
involved fraud, deceit, manipulation, or deliberate or reckless disregard of a regulatory
requirement; (2) harm caused to others; (3) unjust enrichment; (4) prior violations;
(5) deterrence; and (6) such other matters as justice may require. 10 15 U.S.C. § 78u-2(c); Jay T.
Comeaux, 2014 SEC LEXIS 3001, at *22 & n.39.
The Division requests that I count four of L&L’s false public filings—its 2008 Form 10K and next three Forms 10-Q—as separate violations. 11 This unit of violation is reasonable and
prejudices L&L less than if I were to count each act and omission committed in relation to each
filing as a separate unit of violation. Cf. Rapoport, 682 F.3d at 108 (“[T]he Commission must
determine how many violations occurred and how many are attributable to each person[.]”). As
to L&L’s 2008 Form 10-K and its next two Forms 10-Q, the maximum third-tier civil penalty for
each violation was $650,000. 12 See 17 C.F.R. § 201.1003, Subpt. E, Table III. As to L&L’s
March 23, 2009, filing of its Form 10-Q for the period ended January 31, 2009, the maximum
third-tier civil penalty was $725,000. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.1004, Subpt. E, Table IV. Within any
particular tier, the Commission has the discretion to set the amount. See Brendan E. Murray,
Advisers Act Release No. 2809, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2924, at *42 (Nov. 21, 2008); Phlo Corp.,
Exchange Act Release No. 55562, 2007 SEC LEXIS 604, at *60 (Mar. 30, 2007).
I incorporate my prior findings and conclusions herein. As already discussed, L&L
violated the antifraud and other provisions of the securities laws with a high degree of scienter,
and raised $748,300 from investors during the period of its fraud. Its fraud primarily consisted
of creating the false appearance that the company had a bona fide acting CFO, when no one
actually performed the CFO role, and hiding the fact that for a period of time Lee was still
functioning as the company’s CEO, by installing his brother as the purported CEO. By
committing such fraud while raising large sums of investor money, the company created a
significant risk of losses to investors. Indeed, Lee knew that there was a significant risk that the
company’s stock price would plummet if the truth about the purported acting CFO became
publicly known. OIP ¶ 33.

Securities Act Section 8A does not contain a list of public interest factors. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 77h-1(g). Nonetheless, the factors listed under Exchange Act Section 21B have been used by
the Commission in assessing sanctions under both provisions. See Francis V. Lorenzo,
Securities Act Release No. 9762, 2015 SEC LEXIS 1650, at *58-59 (Apr. 29, 2015).

The Division does not request penalties for L&L’s false 2009 Form 10-K.

12

The Division incorrectly identifies $500,000 as the maximum amount for violations occurring
in 2008. Motion at 26-27. My civil penalty total of $2,675,000 therefore differs from the
Division’s requested total of $2,250,000.

L&L’s criminal conviction for securities fraud underscores the severity of its misconduct.
Although the harm caused to others is not quantified, it is inherent in the nature of these
violations. Deterrence calls for the severest penalty, to prevent future violations by L&L and to
signal to other issuers that blatant misrepresentations in public filings with the Commission will
not be tolerated. Investors rely on such filings in making investment decisions. Fabricating
officer positions and forging signatures on such filings as part of a scheme to raise investor
money and to be listed on an exchange demonstrates a total disregard for basic regulatory
principles.
In conclusion, I will impose the maximum penalty totaling $2,675,000.
FAIR FUND
I require that the amount of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil money penalty
be used to create a fair fund for the benefit of L&L investors harmed by the violations. See 17
C.F.R. § 201.1100.
