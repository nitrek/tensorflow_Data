The Honorable George Bush

The Honorable Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr.
Speaker, U.S. House of Representatives
Washington, D.C. 20515
Gentlemen:
The fiscal year ended September 30,1983 was another record year, in terms of
the volume and efficacy of the Commission's efforts.
Investor protections and corporations' financing flexibility were increased, and
unnecessary regulatory burdens, paperwork and other expenses were reduced
by over a billion dollars per annum.
As a result of productivity improvements, the Commission's major divisions
have achieved record results, or the highest levels in several years, in each of the
last two fiscal years, despite personnel reductions and budgetary constraints.
By comparison with fiscal 1981, in fiscal 1983:
• 37% more enforcement cases were brought;
• 28% more investment company and adviser inspections were conducted;
.16% more broker-dealer reports were processed;
• and 15% more full disclosure filings were handled;
• than in fiscal 1981, despite a 3% reduction in personnel.
Registration and other fees amounted to 110% of the Commission's fiscal 1983
budget, as compared with 81% and 94% in the two prior years.

"-A record or the highest level in several years.
Enforcement
Enforcement is the largest activity at the Commission. It accounts for a third of
the total budget.
Nearly 60% of the 261 cases brought in fiscal 1983 were injunctive actions.
Most concerned broker-dealers, corporate issuers and associated persons, and
involved alleged hard-core fraud, such as misrepresentations in the sale of
securities, conversions of investors' funds and market manipulation.
Eight percent of the 261 were insider trading cases. The 24 brought in fiscal
1983 and 20 in fiscal 1982 amount to 35% of all the insider trading cases that
have been brought by the Commission.
In fiscal 1983, $11 million in disgorgement and $53 million in asset freeze
orders were obtained for the benefit of investors, and $33 and $37 million,
respectively, the year before.
Most of the 261 cases have been settled under consent decrees in which the
defendants have neither admitted nor denied the charges, but have committed
not to engage in such activities in the future.
Insider Trading Sanctions Act
The Commission proposed this bill in fiscal 1983. It has been approved by the
House and is pending in the Senate. It would permit the courts to levy civil fines
equal to three times insider traders' profits (or losses avoided); and would

iv

increase criminal fines for certain violations, including manipulation and fraud
in the sale of securities, from $10,000 (established in 1934) to $100,000.
Intermarket Surveillance
At the Commission's initiative, the stock exchanges and the National Association
of Securities Dealers (NASD) are enhancing their electronic inter-market surveillance systems and audit trails, which permit the quick identification of
market manipulation and insider trading. This program is expected to "pay for
itself' by reducing transaction reconciliation costs.
Integration
Corporations' registration and reporting requirements (under the 1933 and 1934
securities acts) were integrated in fiscal 1982. Integration has increased corporations' financing flexibility and reduces their fiscal 1983 expenses (for the benefit
of their shareholders) by over $350 million per annum, as well as the Commission's paperwork, but not disclosures to the investing public.
Shelf-Registration
The revised shelf registration rule, adopted in November 1983, permits the
largest and most creditworthy corporations to file a single registration statement
covering securities they expect to sell from time to time within two years.
Over $70 billion of debt and $13 billion of equity offerings have been filed under
the shelf rule.
Based on an independent economic analysis, the discounted present value of
interest saving to corporate debt issuers to date under the shelf rule has been
hundreds of millions of dollars.
Small Business Financings
For the benefit of smaller businesses, in September 1983, the Commission
increased the ceilIng from $5 to $7.5 million for initial public offerings under
Form 5-18, an abbreviated registration statement.
Financing Exemptions
Certain offerings, up to $5 million to others than the general public, were
exempted from registration in fiscal 1982. In fiscal 1983 several states adopted
similar exemptions, which were the first joint state and federal registration
exemptions. The exemptions for larger private placements were also simplified.
In fiscal 1983, over $20 billion of financings were effected under these new
exemptions at substantial savings to issuers.
Book Entry Delivery System
Expansion of the institutional book-entry delivery system is expected to save
brokers and agent banks over $350 million per annum. This recommendation
by the securities exchanges and the NA5D was approved by the Commission in
November 1983.
Option Clearing Corporation Deposits
The July 1983 Commission approval of updated Option Clearing Corporation
deposit requirements is expected to free-up $300 million of securities industry

v

capital. This is in addition to the $700 million freed-up in fiscal 1982, by
updating the net capital and securities clearing house deposit requirements.

SECO Legislation
In a joint effort with the NASD, legislation was enacted in June 1983, which
abolished the SECO program, under which the Commission staff has been
directly supervising and inspecting 600 over-the-counter firms. These firms are
now subject to the NASD's jurisdiction, under the Commission's oversight.

Investment Companies
In August 1983, investment company prospectuses were simplified and improved. This has reduced expenses ultimately borne by investors and the
Commission's paperwork, but not investor protections.

National Market System
In January 1983, the Commission approved establishment of the Intermarket
Trading System as a permanent electronic linkage of all the exchanges, and the
NASDAQ over-the-counter system. In fiscal 1983, over a billion shares were
traded through the Intermarket Trading System.
Last sales in over 700 national market system over-the-counter stocks are now
being electronically reported throughout the country, as they are executed.
In November 1983, the Commission approved expansion of the New York Stock
Exchange's pilot Registered Representative Rapid Response program, which
permits derivatively priced, instant execution by account executives of orders up
to 599 shares in 200 of the most actively traded NYSE stocks.
The experimental linkage of the markets in listed stocks with the off-board
market has not improved the markets in these stocks. Virtually all of the offboard market makers have dropped out of this market. The Commission has,
therefore, deferred action on an order exposure rule. As a result of 267 new
listings in 1983, 649 issues are now eligible for dual trading on the exchanges
and in the off-board market.

Litigation
There were a number of important court decisions in fiscal 1983. A few of the
many in which the Commission was a party or filed amicus briefs, include the
following appellate cases: Dirks u SEC (insider trading); O'Brien u SEC (right to
notice of subpoenas in Commission investigations); Indiana National Corp. u
Rich (private rights of action); and SEC u Clifton (standards for granting and
dissolving Commission injunctions). Important district court case decisions
included: SEC u Musella (parallel proceedings permitted, absent "special circumstances"); SEC u Micro-Therapeutics (joint and several liability for
disgorgement of misappropriated funds); SEC u Scott (officers of underwriter
liable for failure to amend prospectus); and SEC u Materia (financial printer
liable for misappropriation of information).
Of the district court cases decided in fiscal 1983 in which the Commission was
a party, the Commission prevailed in virtually all; and in 38 of the 44 appellate
and Supreme Court cases.

vi

Financial Reporting
In fiscal 1983, the Commission's accounting related requirements were simplified and improved, and the disclosure guidelines for problem loans of bank
holding companies were revised to solicit better information on these risks. The
activities of self-regulatory organizations-including
the Financial Accounting
Standards Board and the American Institute of Certified Public Accountantswere also closely monitored.
Tender Offer Advisory Committee
In July 1983, the SEC Tender Offer Advisory Committee delivered its report to
the Commission and Congress. The Committee's 50 recommendations are
presently being studied by Commission and congressional staffs, with a view to
the proposal of regulatory and legislative initiatives in 1984.
Regulatory Coordination
Firms that engage in securities and commodities brokerage are subject to
supervision by the SEC, the Commodities Futures Trading Commission (CFTC),
the 50 state securities administrators and over 30 self-regulatory organizations.
In fiscal 1983, the following progress was made in simplifying these regulations .
• Standardized financial and operational reports (FOCUS reports) can now
be filed with all regulators .
• The SEC and CFTC net captial rules were harmonized .
• And broker-dealer and associated person registration requirements were
streamlined.
The SEC and CFTC also jointly solicited industry suggestions on the coordination of their regulations. Recommendations under review include:
• development of a single associated person registration form;
• harmonization of the statutory disqualification provisions of the securities
and commodities laws;
• coordination of securities and commodities self-regulatory examinations;
• and consolidation of fingerprint processing.
Task Group
During the past two and a half years, in speeches, congressional testimony and
meetings with cabinet members and the chairmen of key congressional committees, the Commission has advocated the formation of a one year task force
to help simplify, rationalize and reduce the costs of the regulatory structures of
the securities, banking and savings and loan industries for the benefit of investors and depositors.
The Commission's specific recommendations included:
• Regulation by functional activities, rather than by outmoded industry classifications;
• Consolidation of overlapping, duplicative and conflicting regulatory activities;

vii

• And elimination of excessive regulations within and between regulatory
agencies.
In January 1983, Vice President Bush formed the Task Group on the Regulation
of Financial Services. The Commission has been an active participant in the
Task Group, which is expected to propose major legislative initiatives in 1984.
Bank Release
In November 1983, the Commission released for public comment a proposed
rule that would, in effect, require banks that offer public brokerage services or
in-house investment advice and brokerage services, to conduct such activities
in separate affiliates, subject to the same rules and regulations as all others who
engage in such activities.

1984
In addition to ongoing programs, major projects in process include the following:
Electronic Aling
In 1983, a staff task force was formed and a feasible contract let, with a view to
commencing a pilot electronic filing, processing and information dissemination
system in 1984. The objectives are to accelerate the dissemination of corporate
information to investors and securities analysts and to reduce investors', issuers'
and the SEC's expenses.

As corporations file such information electronically with the SEC, investors and
analysts will be able to access it instantly on home and business computer
screens. They will be able to display current comparative price-earning, yield
and other data on securities; instantly refine such lists by industry, size, markets
and other criteria; display the latest SEC filings, annual and quarterly reports of
those companies in which they are interested or that appear to be the most
undervalued; retain their portfolios in their data banks; price them to the market
at any time; and maintain running totals of their dividends, realized and unrealized capital gains and losses. They may also be able to enter orders with their
brokers, directly on their computer terminals and receive confirmations. Hard
copy can be obtained on accessory print-out equipment.
The system is also intended to reduce transcription and oral communication
errors and to accelerate the SEC's identification and processing of filings which
require detailed reviews.
The pilot operation will be tested and debugged for a year or more. Industrywide implementation is intended to coordinate with the growth of home
computers-from
5 million today to over 50 million within five years.
Legislation
The Commission will continue to be an active participant in legislative initiatives
expected by the Bush Task Group, the pending Insider Trading Sanctions Act
and major amendments to the Glass-Steagall Act, the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act and the Public Utility Holding Company Act.

viii

In addition to the extensive recommendations of the SEC Advisory Committee
on Tender Offers, the merger proxy and contest rules and the Investment
Company Act are under review. Regulatory and legislative initiatives in these
areas are also expected in 1984.
Conclusion
Progress is being made in improving investor protections and reducing regulatory burdens. The future offers favorable prospects of major improvements in
the regulatory structures of the financial service industries and the exciting
potential of high speed, electronic communication and analysis of corporate
information.
Sincerely,

John S.R. Shad

Enforcement Program
Key 1983 Results
The Commission maintains an aggressive enforcement program. In fiscal
1983, it commenced 261 enforcement actions, as compared with 254 in 1982,
which was a 30% increase over fiscal 1981.
The total includes 151 civil injunctive actions, compared with 136 brought in
1982 and 115in 1981.There were 416 defendants named in the Injunctive actions
brought during fiscal year 1983 compared with 418 in 1982.
In addition to injunctions against further violations of the Federal securities
laws, the Commission obtained court orders during fiscal 1983 that required
defendants to divest themselves of illicit profits amounting to more than $11
million, either as disgorgement or restitution to defrauded Investors. In response
to actions initiated by the Commission, courts froze assets estimated to exceed
$55 million to protect the assets until appropriate dispositions could be made by
the judge involved.
The Commission instituted 94 administrative proceedings in fiscal 1983, compared with 106 proceedings begun during 1982 and 72 during 1981.There were
189 respondents named in 1983 and 287 respondents named in 1982.
The Commission staff also provided substantial assistance to the Department
of Justice and state authorities in connection with potential or pending criminal
cases. There were 75 criminal indictments or informations obtained in such
cases, many of which arose out of prior Commission investigations.
The emphasis on civil and criminal contempt proceedings is reflected in the 14
actions brought In fiscal 1983 as compared with 9 in 1982.
In addition, there were two reports of investigation under Section 21(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act), including one concerning the
Silver Crisis of 1980. One court order was obtained under Section 21(e) of the
Exchange Act ordering compliance with a previously issued Commission order.
Introduction
The Commission's enforcement program seeks to preserve the inteqnty efficiency and fairness of the securities markets. The Federal securities laws provide
civil and administrative remedies designed to rectify past violations and prevent
future violations.
The Commission's primary enforcement remedy is a Federal court injunction.
An injunction directs an individual or entity to comply with the law in the future. If
the injunction is violated, contempt of court proceedings may result in imprisonment or the imposition of fines. In addition to "obey the law" injunctions, courts
often enter orders providing other equitable relief such as restitution, disgorgement of illicit profits, or other remedies appropriate to a particular case.

Another enforcement remedy against regulated entities is an administrative
proceeding. The principal regulated entities are broker-dealers, investment companies and investment advisers. An administrative proceeding may result in a
censure or a revocation or suspension of registration for up to 12 months. Regulated entities may not conduct business without an effective registration.
Administrative proceedings may also be instituted against persons associated
with regulated entities. The remedies include censure, suspension for up to 12
months or a bar from participation in the securities industry.
In addition, issuers of securities may be subject to administrative proceedings if
they fail to comply in a material respect with the Exchange Act's disclosure
requirements and certain other provisions. They may be ordered by the Commission to comply with these provisions upon specified terms and conditions.
Criminal sanctions for Federal securities law violations include a fine of up to
$10,000 and imprisonment for up to five years for each violation. The Commission has proposed legislation to increase the maximum criminal fine for most
Exchange Act violations from the $10,000 established in 1934 to $100,000.
Program Areas
Some of the areas of enforcement activity in fiscal 1983 are discussed below,
along with illustrative cases.
Corporate Reporting and Accounting-This
category includes violations of
the periodic reporting requirements. The Commission initiated 51 cases in this
area In fiscal 1983 compared to 36 in 1982. I
Financial disclosure violations may involve valuation of inventories, assets or
liabilities: the remuneration of officers and other related parties; the ability of a
corporation to meet its obligations; or the recognition of revenue and expenses.
Violations with respect to non-financial information may include material misstatements concerning corporate operating information, or a failure to disclose
material facts concerning corporate management.
The cases in this category include 22 delinquent filing actions, as compared
with nine in 1982
Closely related to the emphasis on fraud by reporting companies is enforcement of the accounting provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA). In
fiscal 1983 12 such actions were brought. There were 10 in fiscal 1982. The 22
cases brought during the past two years represents two-thirds of all such actions
brought since the FCPA was enacted in 1977.
Recent cases brought under the accounting provisions have included some in
which issuers have improperly deferred expenses, recognized sales prematurely,
overstated inventories and used other improper techniques to inflate profits or
decrease losses. One case involved systematic deferral of the recognition of
promotional and advertising expenses in amounts of up to $3.6 million in a fiscal
period. In another case, the Commission alleged that the defendants caused the
preparation of false documents that failed to reflect a diversion of $2.2 million to
an off-the-books account.
Audited financial statements are the backbone of the disclosure system established under the Federal securities laws. In the past fiscal year, the Commission

2

has alleged that certain fraudulent filings reflected deficient audits by issuers'
accounting firms. An injunctive action was brought against an accounting firm
with respect to its audits of the financial statements of three separate issuers. In
another case, the Commission brought an administrative proceeding in which it
alleged that two auditors, in performing an audit of an insurance company, acquiesced in the use of financial reports based upon an obsolete mortality table.
Several fiscal 1983 reporting cases involved non-financial issues. In one case,
the Commission alleged that an insurance company failed to disclose that it
faced possible loss of the endorsement of two non-profit organizations whose
members bought a substantial portion of its policies. In another case, the Commission alleged that the issuer failed to report that a customer, which had accounted for 15 percent of its revenue and one-third of its earnings, would be
making no purchases during the relevant reporting period, and thereafter would
make purchases at drastically reduced levels. In a third case, the Commission
alleged that an issuer failed to disclose that a control person who had resigned
from the company continued to dominate and control the issuer, and also continued to receive remuneration and other significant benefits.
Securities Offering Violations-Some issuers fail to register public offerings of
their securities, although required to do so by the Securities Act. Some may rely
on purported exemptions to registration requirements which are not available to
them. Some may violate anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws by
making material misrepresentations in connection with a securities offering or
omitting material information in connection with such an offering.
There were 41 cases principally involving offering violations by issuers and
other persons brought during 1983.2 (This figure does not include 32 cases
principally involving offering violations on the part of regulated entities, which are
classified as regulated entity cases.) A total of 48 cases were brought in the
securities offering category in 1982 (exclusive of those cases involving violations
principally on the part of broker-dealers).
Among the injunctive actions alleging securities offering violations were cases
involving issuers that offered investments in tax shelters and oil and mineral
interests. In one case an issuer offered participation interests in an arbitrage
trading program involving U.S. government securities. The Commission alleged
in its complaint that more than 2,000 investors were defrauded of $16 million in a
scheme that promised an eight-to-one tax write-off. The promoters allegedly
made personal use of the funds instead of investing them. In another case the
Commission alleged the sale of $35 million in limited partnership interests in coal
mining projects, without compliance with the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. Among other things, the defendants allegedly inflated various
projections, failed to disclose the identities of the principal promoters and failed
to disclose the profits the promoters made in selling mining interests to the
partnerships.
Offerings by first-time issuers increased significantly in fiscal 1983. A number
of these had no operating history, no permanent employees, or no stated business purpose. In response to these developments the Commission established a
"Hot IssuesTask Force" to co-ordinate investigations involving issuers and related

3

entities. The Task Force consists of members of the staffs of the Commission's
Divisions of Enforcement, Market Regulation and Corporation Finance, various
regional offices of the Commission, and examiners from the National Association
of Securities Dealers.
The Commission also emphasized remedial actions during fiscal 1983 against
professionals who provide issuers with access to the securities markets. Brokerdealers and underwriters who engage in questionable or improper sales practices
are being subjected to increased scrutiny. One example is an administrative
proceeding involving a Denver-based broker-dealer. The Commission alleged
that the broker-dealer, acting as an underwriter, had used a false and misleading
prospectus in connection with two offerings, and had failed to escrow funds
received from investors in a "best efforts" underwriting.
Several cases involving the fraudulent sale of unregistered securities have been
brought against those holding themselves out as investment advisers. In addition,
the Commission alleged in one case that a sham transfer agent was used to
facilitate the distribution of a shell corporation's securities by improperly rernovIng a restrictive legend from the stock certificates.
Regulated Entities and Associated Persons-Fiscal 1983 actions involving
regulated entities, including broker-dealers, investment companies, investment
advisers and transfer agents, ranged from books and records violation to attempts to defraud customers. There were 110 cases involving regulated entities
compared with 118 in fiscal 1982.3 Thirty-two cases involved securities offering
violations by regulated entities. Of the other 78 cases, 43 primarily involved
broker-dealers. 16 investment advisers, four investment companies and three
transfer agents. The total includes 12 actions in which customers or employees
were alleged to have defrauded a regulated entity.
During fiscal 1983 the Commission revoked the registration of 19 firms, suspended 3 and censured 12. This compared with 11 revocations, 9 suspensions,
and 28 censures in fiscal 1982. There were 54 individuals barred, 44 suspended,
and 8 censured in fiscal 1983, compared with 44 bars, 82 suspensions, and 19
censures in fiscal 1982.
One action against a regulated entity involved a failure to maintain proper
books and records. The district court found that a broker-dealer's books and
records were inaccurate, that it had failed to do proper box counts, failed to deliver
customers' money and securities, and used customers' fully paid securities to
satisfy its obligations to deliver securities to other broker-dealers. In another case
involving two investment companies and their investment adviser, the investment
companies were found to have improperly maintained their books and records
and inaccurately valued the price of their common shares. The investment companies had recorded as accounts receivable various expenses they incurred for
which they allegedly were going to be reimbursed by the investment adviser, when
the investment adviser was actually insolvent and unable to meet its obligations.
The Commission brought several cases involving fraud against regulated entities in fiscal 1983. One involving a fraud perpetrated against a broker-dealer by
its managing partner, illustrates the swiftness with which the Commission can
respond to emergency situations. In late January 1983 the Commission acquired

4

information indicating that the managing partner had illegally obtained $47 rrullion from his trading account with the broker-dealer, and that the broker-dealer
was insolvent. The Commission filed a complaint in Federal District Court on
February 5,1983, in which it was alleged, among other things, that securities held
as collateral were valued at $278 million, but were actually worth only $5,000. It
was also alleged that another $105 million in securities, purportedly held as
collateral, did not exist. The court thereupon issued a temporary restraining order
ordering the defendant to refrain from violating the Federal securities laws and
appointed a temporary receiver. On February 10, the broker-dealer consented to
the appointment of a trustee under the Securities Investor Protection Act, for the
purpose of liquidating the firm, and on February 11the court issued a permanent
injunction against future violations. The managing partner eventually pled guilty
to a five-count indictment and was sentenced to 25 years imprisonment.
In another case in this category, the Commission alleged that a foreign corporation engaged in "free-riding" by ordering the sale of $200 million in securities
through U.S. broker-dealers, when it did not have possession of the securities and
was therefore unable to tender the securities sold at the time of settlement. (Freeriding consists of placing a buy or sell order for securities and not satisfying the
obligation to pay for or deliver the securities unless a favorable price movement
occurs.) The Commission alleged that this conduct caused losses of at least $21
million for six American broker-dealers. In another case the Commission alleged
that employees of various broker-dealers facilitated a free-riding scheme by using
misappropriated stock loan funds to finance other securities purchases.
Insider Trading-Insider trading is the purchase or sale of securities by persons
in possession of material non-public information relating to such securities. This
conduct undermines the expectation of fairness and honesty that is the basis of
public confidence in the nation's securities markets. The trading of standardized
options contracts, coupled with tender offers and other acquisitions, has increased opportunities for those with material non-public information to reap
large profits.
Insider trading remained an important enforcement priority during fiscal 1983.
The Commission brought 24 insider trading cases, compared with 20 commenced during fiscal 1982, and a total of 121 brought since 1949.4
Some of the cases brought during the year involved large groups of persons
who learned about a number of prospective offers from informants employed by
firms serving either the targets or offerors in a tender offer. These cases appear to
reflect a trend toward more sophisticated and elaborate schemes to acquire and
benefit from the use of material non-public information.
One case illustrates how an insider may avoid losses by improperly trading
securities while in possession of material non-public information. The Commission alleged that two high corporate executives sold warrants and common stock
while in possession of material non-public information concerning large unanticipated losses by a major unit of the issuer. One defendant, without admitting or
denying the Commission's allegations, consented to an injunction forbidding
violations of the Federal securities laws and agreed to disgorge more than
$80,000.

5

As part of its effort to combat insider trading, the Commission has recommended enactment of the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1983. This Act would
authorize the courts to impose civil money penalties of up to three times the profit
gained or loss avoided in Commission enforcement actions involving the use of
material non-public information. On April 13, 1983, the Chairman, the Commission's General Counsel, the Director of the Division of Enforcement and other
senior staff members testified on behalf of the proposed law before the Subcommittee on Telecommunications, Consumer Protection and Finance of the House
Energy and Commerce Committee. The House of Representatives approved H.R.
559 on September 19, 1983 and, at the close of the fiscal year, the bill was
awaiting action in the Senate.
In July 1983, the Supreme Court issued its opinion in Dirks v. SEC, a case
involving the liability of a person who receives material non-public information
from a corporate insider. Future enforcement actions involving tippees must be
evaluated in light of this opinion, which is discussed in the Section of this report
entitled "Litigation and Other Legal Work."
Market Manipulation-The
Commission is charged with insuring the integrity
of trading on the national securities exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets. The Commission's staff, the exchanges and the National Association of
Securities Dealers engage in surveillance of these markets. The Commission
brought 11 cases involving market manipulation during fiscal 1983.5 Ten such
actions were brought in fiscal 1982.
In one case, the Commission alleged that two individuals falsely created an
appearance of active trading and raised the price of a security through 20 accounts
they maintained with 10 different broker-dealers. In addition, another individual,
an investment adviser, was alleged to have sent "Research Report Recommendations" to 5,000 broker-dealers containing untrue statements and projections
made without a reasonable basis concerning the issuer's sales, earnings and
marketing of new products. During the relevant period, the price per share of the
issuer's stock rose from $4 to $25. The three defendants allegedly made profits in
excess of $1.75 million for themselves and others through this scheme.
The Commission also alleged in an injunctive action that two Canadian citizens
manipulated the price of a stock traded on the Vancouver Stock Exchange and
on the National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotation System
(NASDAQ). The complaint alleged that the defendants induced persons to purchase the issuer's securities on NASDAQ by creating a false impression of the
value of the issuer's oil and gas properties and expected returns in a series of
press releases, paid advertisements, and reports to sharehholders and brokerdealers. The Commission alleged that each of these contained materially false
and misleading information. The price of the issuer's common stock rose over
800 percent during the period in question.
Chenqes in Corporate Control-Sections
13 and 14 of the Exchange Act
govern the activities of persons and entities involved in gaining, attempting to
gain or maintain control or ownership of a corporation. These provisions govern
proxy solicitations and the filing of reports by persons or groups who make a
tender offer or acquire beneficial ownership of more than 5 percent of a class of

6

equity securities registered with the Commission. These requirements are intended to insure that investors have the material information needed to make
Informed investment or voting decisions. Five enforcement actions were brought
in this area during fiscal 1983, while nine were brought in fiscal 1982.6
In one case the Commission alleged that two individuals failed to disclose their
relationship and activities in connection with a proxy solicitation and their substantial direct or Indirect interests in future transactions with the issuer.In another
case an individual and a holding company wholly owned by the individual allegedly failed to disclose their total beneficial ownership position and the close
relationship and financing arrangement they had with a foreign nation.
Related Party Transactions-Fundamental to the relationship between an investor and management is the expectation that a company's assets will be used
for the benefit of the company and not for the personal benefit of its managers.
Accordingly, the Commission's rules require disclosure of transactions by companies with management or related parties. In fiscal 1983 the Commission
brought five cases in this category.7 Four cases were brought in 1982.
In one case the Commission alleged that an issuer failed to disclose certain
transactions between it and companies controlled by the Chairman of its Board
of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, and his family. These transactions involved fuel purchases with two companies totalling over $86 million and equipment leasing with another company amounting to between $100,000 and
$200,000.

Other Developments
Litigation-Most Commission enforcement actions are settled by the defendants or respondents involved without admitting or denying the Commission's
allegations of misconduct. However,a number of the Commission's enforcement
actions are litigated rather than settled, and vigorous defenses are often conducted.
In order to obtain quick, effective relief to protect the investing public the staff
has sometimes asked courts to freezedefendant's assetspending the outcome of
litigation. It also is making increased use of motions for summary judgment.
In addition, civil and criminal contempt proceedings are being used more often
as a means of assuring continuing compliance with the Federal securities laws.
For example, three of the 14 contempt actions commenced during the past year
alleged that an issuer had not complied with an injunctive order requiring the
filing of delinquent reports. In each case a control person was named in the
contempt action, as well as the issuer.Fines of $1,000 per day were levied against
the control persons. The Commission also seeks criminal contempt sanctions in
appropriate cases.
In fiscal 1983, the Commission also obtained a court order, under Section
21(e) of the Exchange Act, to enforce an order previously issued by the Commission under Section 15(c)(4). The Commission's order had directed the issuer to
comply with the reporting requirements of Section 13(a) of the Exchange Act.
Cooperation With Other Authorities-The Commission has developed a close
working relationship with other law enforcement authorities, both In the United

7

States and abroad. The Commission has assisted, and been assisted by, a number of state criminal prosecutors and securities regulators. It has provided assistance to the Department of Justice and a number of U.S. Attorneys' offices in
the prosecution of criminal violations of the Federalsecurities laws. The Commission also cooperates closely with various self-regulatory organizations, including
the National Association of Securities Dealers and the national securities exchanges.
Sources for Further Inquiry-The Commission publishes litigation releases
which describe its civil injunctive actions and criminal proceedings involving
securities-related violations. Among other things, these releases report the violative conduct that is either alleged by the Commission or the Department of
Justice or found by the court, and the disposition or status of the case.
Each of the enforcement actions brought during fiscal 1983 is listed in the
Appendix to this report. Appropriate references are made to the litigation releases
published in the SEC Docket.
In addition, Commission orders that institute administrative proceedings and
provide remedial relief are published in the SEC Docket. The citations to these
orders also are noted.
Copies of the SEC Docket may be reviewed at the Commission's headquarters
or In a regional office. Further information can be obtained by contacting the

Full Disclosure System
The Commission's full disclosure system insures that full and accurate material
information about publicly traded companies is available to investors. Full disclosure fosters investor confidence, contributes to the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets and facilitates capital formation.
Key 1983 Results
The Commission handled 65,550 full disclosure filings in fiscal 1983. Filings
which required detailed reviews Increased significantly. For example, first-time
Securities Act registration statements increased 41% to 1,393; merger proxies
increased 29% to 254; and small offerings registered on Form S-18 increased
135% to 501.
Computer-Assisted Operations-Since the advent of the selective review system in 1980 the staff has made increasing use of computers to aid the screening
process. All filings are screened to identify those which present significant disclosure issues.
In fiscal 1983, the Commission began development of an electronic filing,
processing and information dissemination system.
Projects-The Commission has made substantial progress in its review of the
proxy regulations. The objective is to provide more uniform requirements, less
duplicative disclosure, and reduced compliance costs (at shareholders' expense)
in a manner consistent with investor protection.
The Commission also established the Advisory Committee on Tender Offers
which examined the tender offer rules and related regulations and practices and
made recommendations to the Commission for rulemaking and legislative
changes.
The Proxy Review Program
In fiscal 1983, the Commission continued the major review of the rules and
regulations applicable to the proxy solicitation process begun in 1982. The first
initiative under the proxy review program was the adoption on December 2,1982,
of a new item governing disclosure of management relationships and transactions in proxy statements, registration statements and periodic reports." The new
item integrates what had been two separate disclosure provisions relating to these
matters.
On September 23,1983, the Commission adopted substantial revisions to the
item governing the disclosure of executive cornpensetion.!? The revised item
simplifies the required disclosure by providing that contingent compensation paid
within the year is disclosed in the table and stock option and other contingent
compensation plans are described in the text, and (1) limiting individual dis-

9

closure to the five highest paid executive officers whose cash compensation
exceeds $60,000; (2) imposing a disclosure threshold on noncash, non securities
compensation; (3) requiring disclosure of cash compensation paid all executive
officers, as a group; (4) streamlining disclosure of compensation paid under
plans; (5) requiring disclosure of all fees and other compensation paid directors;
and (6) requiring disclosure of all plans or arrangements triggered by a change in
control of the registrant, a change in a named individual's responsibilities after
such event, or the individual's termination of employment
On July 28, 1983, the Commission adopted a number of rule amendments
relating to the process by which companies communicate with the beneficial
owners of securities registered in the name of a broker, bank or other nominee. I I
The changes originated with recommendations made by the Advisory Committee on Shareholder Communications. These amendments require, among other
things, that brokers keep a record of whether customers object to disclosure of
their names, addresses and securities positions to the company. If they do not
object, companies that request it must be provided with such information. The
timetable for dissemination of the proxy materials was also tightened.
In response to comments received on several different proposals for modifications to the shareholder proposal process.P in August 1983, the Commission
adopted rule revisions that retain the framework of the rule governing shareholder
proposals by continuing to allow security holders access to issuers' proxy statements and also by continuing federal regulation of the security holder proposal
process.'? The revisions change certain requirements, such as those relating to:
(1) the amount of securities a shareholder must hold in order to submit a proposal; (2) the number of proposals which he or she may submit; (3) the staffs
interpretation of one paragraph of the rule so as not to require inclusion of a
proposal relating to a report or committee on a matter involving the registrant's
ordinary business; (4) the exclusion of proposals dealing with substantially the
same subject matter as proposals submitted in prior years; and (5) the percentage of shareholder support required for inclusion of previously submitted proposals in the current proxy statement.

Tender Offer Advisory Committee
In February 1983, the Chairman appointed the Advisory Committee on Tender
Offers to review techniques for acquisition of control of public companies and the
laws applicable to such transactions.l? The Committee members included recognized authorities from the business and financial community, academia and
the legal and accounting professions. The Committee was requested to consider
the acquisition process in terms of the best interests of all shareholders-those
of
target, bidder and bystander corporations. The Committee held six public meetings, which included participation by commentators, shareholders, and professionals.
The Committee's final July 8, 1983 report contained 50 recommendations,
including:
• uniform treatment of cash and exchange offers;

10

• revision of regulations to effect more timely reporting of open market purchases resulting in holdings of over 20% of a class of voting securities;
• regulatory disincentives to partial two-tier bids;
• elimination of the requirement that shareholders be permitted to withdraw
shares tendered to one bidder upon commencement of a competing bid;
• restrictions on the ability of corporations to adopt certain types of "antitakeover" provisions;
• shareholder advisory voting requirements for certain corporate actions; and
• restrictions on "golden parachute" agreements (contracts relating to change
of control compensation).
A copy of the Committee's report was furnished to the Senate Banking Committee. The Commission is studying the report, with a view to regulatory and
legislative initiatives.
Research Forum
To improve communication between the Commission and various users of
corporate full disclosure documents, the Commission initiated the first Research
Forum, held on November 17, 1982. Over 40 people representing various types of
users of Commission documents, such as securities analysts, institutional investors, investment advisers, rating organizations and shareholder groups, were invited to meet with the Commission and staff. The issues discussed related to the
form and content of disclosure documents, including non-financial and financial
reporting, and proxy statement disclosure requirements. The Research Forum
has resulted in improved communication between the Commission and financial
analysts. The Commission anticipates that such forums will be scheduled every
other year.
SEC Government-Business
Formation

Forum on Small Business Capital

The second annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business
Capital Formation was conducted during June and July 1983. The Commission
was directed to host this annual forum by the Small Business Investment Incentive Act of 1980. Participants included other federal agencies, state securities
commissioners and leading small business and professional organizations concerned with capital formation.
Five regional forums were held. Over 125 witnesses made presentations. Although considerable attention was devoted to the difficulties that small businesses encounter in the capital formation process, particularly in the tax area, a
much more diverse and numerous set of recommendations evolved out of the
1983 forum. Certain subjects, such as minorities in small business, were focused
on for the first time. In November 1983, the final report containing the participants' recommendations in the areas of securities regulation, taxation, banking,
small business credit assistance, minorities and certain other small business
concerns was forwarded to Congress.

11

SEC/NASAA Conference on Federal-State Securities Regulation
The Commission and the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA) jointly sponsored a conference in September 1983 to enhance
uniformity of securities regulation.
The Commission and NASAA solicited private sector comments and recommendations for increasing the efficiency of securities regulation through enhanced federal-state uniformity. Also, a joint SEC/NASAA panel conducted a day
of public hearings on September 12,1983.
The state securities administrators and senior Commission staff reviewed the
public comments and met with those who testified, and members of the selfregulatory organizations. An agenda was prepared of the problems to be addressed by the joint efforts of the SEC and NASAA.
The conference represents the first time the SEC and NASAA have met to
consider increasing the efficiency of the dual regulatory process through enhanced cooperation and uniformity. As a result of the conference, permanent
coordinating committees at the SEC and NASAA will address the problem areas
identified and coordinate rulemaking initiatives.
Actions that the SEC and NASAA plan to take, include: (1) the conformation of
state rules to federal registration exemptions; (2) reduction of multiple state filings; and (3) coordination of federal and state enforcement and rulemaking
initiatives.
Small Business Rulemaking

and Interpretive Initiatives

Simplified Registration Form Amended-On
September 23, 1983, the Commission Increased the initial public offering limit under the simplified registration
statement from $5 to $7.5 million.!" The increase is in part In response to a
recommendation of the 1982 SEC Government-Business Forum of Small Business Capital Formation. It adjusts the ceiling for inflation since the short form was
adopted four years ago. The Commission intends to study the need and implications of an additional increase in the ceiling.
The Commission also revised, on a conditional basis, the short form disclosure
requirements for executive compensation. The revisions conform this form, to
the extent appropriate given the size of the issuer and the offerings, to the general
disclosure requirements for other Securities registration forms.
Resales-On September 23,1983, the Commission amended the resale provisions which: (1) define persons deemed not to be underwriters under the Securities Act;17 and (2) govern resales of securities acquired in certain business
combination transactions subject to registration under the Securities ACt.18 The
revisions eliminate the requirement that information about the registrant be publicly available for resales by non-affiliated shareholders who have held the securities for at least three years.
Interpretive Advice on Exempt Offers Rules-On March 3, 1983, the Commission published the views of its staff on various interpretive questions regarding the
recently-adopted exempt offers rules under the Securities ACt.19 By publishing

12

the staffs views on frequently-raised
questions, the Commission
assisted those
persons who wish to make exempt offerings in compliance
with the new rules.
Certain offerings, up to $5 million to others than the general public, were exempted from registration
in fiscal 1982. In fiscal 1983, several states adopted
similar exemptions, which were the first joint state and federal registration exemptions. The exemptions for larger private placements were also simphfied. In fiscal

tender offers.i-' The revised rule requires pro rata acceptance of securities depos-

ited by each depositor during the entire period the offer remains open. The
purpose was to provide security holders adequate time to obtain and respond to
such offers.
Shelf Registration-The Securities Act rule which governs the registration of
securities to be sold on a delayed or continuous basis was adopted temporarily
when the Commission adopted the integrated disclosure system in March
1982.24 The rule was effective until December 31,1983. Subsequent to its adoption, the Commission conducted public hearinqs-? and monitored the operation
and impact of the rule. In June 1983, the Commission once again solicited public
comment in order to afford interested parties the opportunity to provide their
views and experience under the rule so that the Commission may consider all
views in making its final determination with respect to the rule.26
On November 10, 1983. the Commission adopted a revised shelf registration
rule. As revised, the rule is available for traditional shelf offerings and for offerings
of securities which may be registered on Form S-3 or F-3, the short form registration statements. Over $70 billion of debt and $13 billion of equity offerings have
been filed under the shelf rule. Based on an independent economic analysis. the
discounted present value of interest saving to corporate debt issuers to date
under the shelf rule has been hundreds of millions of dollars.
Electric and Gas Utility Guide-On September 16, 1983, the Commission
published for comment proposed amendments to the Electric and Gas Utility
Guides under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act.27 The amendments,
proposed in response to a rulemaking petition filed by the California Association
of Utility Shareholders, would require disclosure by electric and gas utilities of the
effects on book value and on an alternatively computed earnings per common
share. of the issuance of new equity securities at below book value.
Definitional Rule-On September 23, 1983, the Commission adopted a new
rule that defines the terms "earnings statement", "made generally available to its
security holders" and "effective date of the registration statement" for purposes of
Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.28 Under the terms of the rule, the information
and availability requirements of Section ll(a) can be met by the income statements contained in anyone or a combination of a registrant's Exchange Act
filings or reports. The rule is intended to provide clarity and uniformity with
respect to these terms by building upon the integrated disclosure system.
MergerForms-The Commission is completing a review of merger registration
statement forms. These forms relate to transactions involving the issuance or
exchange of securities under a plan of reclassification. merger, consolidation,
acquisition or transfer of assets. The forms can be simplified by building upon the
existing short-form merger registration statement and the integrated disclosure
system. A release seeking comments on a revised business combination is expected to be published early in 1984.
Accounting Matters

Oversight Activities-Among others, the Commission oversees the accountIng profession and the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The

14

Commission looks to these private sector bodies to provide leadership in the
establishment of requirements that guide the activities of auditors and the standards that govern accounting measurement and financial reporting. This oversight entails frequent staff contact with these private sector organizations and
direct staff participation in their meetings, public hearings, and task forces. Such
contacts and participation speed referral of problems that emerge from the review of filings made by the Commission's staff. Thus, the Commission continues
to fulfill its statutory responsibility in these areas through close oversight of private
sector initiatives. However, the Commission remains alert to situations that require
prompt attention and takes regulatory action if indicated by the circumstances.
SEC Practice Section-As of June 30, 1983,426 accounting firms had voluntarily become members of the SEC Practice Section (SECPS) of the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants Division for CPA Firms. These firms audit
85% of all publicly held companies. A SECPS member firm agrees to conduct its
public accounting practice in accordance with prescribed standards. Among
these are requirements to file annual reports, maintain a system of quality control,
and test that system once every three years by submission to an independent
peer review.
An independent Public Oversight Board (POB) oversees and annually reports
on the SECPS. In its report dated June 30, 1983, the POB concluded that the peer
review and special investigative processes have reduced the number of audit
failures by fostering and improving quality control systems of firms belonging to
the Division.P? The Commission agrees with the POB's assessment of the peer
review process and strongly encourages all accounting firms that audit publicy
held companies to participate in this self-regulatory program.
(1) Peer Review-Last
year, the Commission reported that, for the first time, its
staff had reviewed a sample of the working papers underlying peer reviews under
the terms of an "access" arrangement reached by the SECPS and the Commission. This review, combined with the staffs review of the POB's oversight files,
enabled the Commission to determine that it can rely to a great extent on the
POB's oversight function in fulfilling its own oversight responsibilities.
Similar reviews were performed in 1983 and the Commission continues to
believe that this important aspect of the accounting profession's self-regulatory
initiative is functioning adequately. The Commission intends to continue its practice of directly monitoring the peer review process by means of the access
arrangement. Access to the peer review working papers enhances the Commission's ability to evaluate the peer review process and the POB's oversight of that
process.
The SECPS adopted certain procedural changes to the peer review process.
The new procedures require peer reviewers to consult immediately with the Peer
Review Committee when they discover materially substandard performance, establish deadlines enforceable with sanctions to ensure timely submission of peer
review reports, and provide more guidance for the selection for review of audit
work performed by other offices for the office primarily responsible for the overall
engagement. These changes are responsive to situations encountered during the
peer review process and in many instances incorporate suggestions made by the

15

POB and SEC staffs.
(2) Special Investigative Process-In its 1982 Annual Report to Congress, the
Commission stated that it "has no basis for reaching any conclusion" about the
special investigative process, and "believes that visible evidence as to specific
activities is critical to demonstrate to the public the effectiveness of this aspect of
the profession's self-regulation."3o This continues to be the case.
The Commission can express no conclusions on the process or on the POB's
oversight of that process because very little information about the special investigative activities is available to it. The public is also unable to evaluatethat process.
The SECPS will not be widely recognized as a credible self-regulatory body unless
more specific information about the activities of the special investigative process
becomes public.
In addition to urging the SECPS to publicize its disciplinary activities to a
greater extent, the Commission also believes the SECPS should revise the requirements for reporting cases to it. Presently,member firms only need to report
allegations of audit deficiencies relating to SEC registrants. The Speciallnvestigations Committee (SIC) should look into, and member firms should report, all
cases which have generated significant public interest and involve allegations of
audit failure.
FASB Actwities-While the FASB has continued to perform satisfactorily on
most matters, the Commission continues to be disappointed with the absence of
significant progress on the Conceptual Framework Project. A description of this
Project and certain technical agenda items follow.
(1) Conceptual Framework-An
exposure draft of a concepts statement on
reporting Income, cash flows, and financial position was issued in November
1981. Based on review of the comments on the exposure draft, the FASB determined to delay the issuance of the concepts statement until further progress was
made on the recognition and measurement phases of the project. In the interim,
the staff of the FASB is reviewing the reporting of cash flows in 1982 annual
reports. More recently, the FASB decided to consider the measurement, recognition and financial statement display issues concurrently. The Commission believes that it is Important for the FASB to expedite development of the concepts
underlying the reporting of relevant cash flow information.
The accounting recognition and measurement phases of the project deal with
initial recognition of, subsequent changes in, and the appropriate measurement
of the asset, liability and equity elements in financial statements. Failureto resolve
the measurement issue has delayed this phase significantly and raised considerable doubt about the ultimate success of the Conceptual Framework Project.
The most immediate result of the FASB's inability to reach hard decisions in
this Project is that the resolution of emerging accounting problems is hampered
because the underpinnings for resolving those problems have not been decided
In the framework project. Furthermore, the FASB may be unable to point to a
clear basis for its decision when dealing with a specific issue, and thus will be
subject to criticism on all controversial projects. The lack of a conceptual framework makes it difficult to predict the FASB's decisions on basic issues. Although
establishment of a conceptual framework will not eliminate all controversy or

16

uncertainty, it should assist the FASB and others in reaching decisions and also
result in a better understanding of the FASB's decision-making
process.
(2) Financial Reporting Practices for Oil and Gas Producers-In December

1982, the Commission amended its rules to require presentation of supplemental
oil and gas disclosures specified in FASB Statement 69.3\ This action was consistent with the Commission's
policy of deleting its rules whenever they become
unnecessary due to actions of the private sector.
(3) TImely Guidance on Emerging Accounting Issues-Attention has recently been focused on the FASB's role in the area of providing timely guidance
on emerging accounting issues. A report on the operating efficiency of the FASB,
issued in August 1982 by a committee of the Financial Accounting Foundation,
its oversight body, recommended,
among other things, that "the FASB should
develop a plan ... to provide timely guidance regarding the implementation
of
standards and for implementation
questions and emerging issues,"32 The FASB
formed a task force to study the recommendation
and provide advice as to an
appropriate response. In July 1983, the task force issued its report after evaluating
the comment letters received in response to an FASB Invitation to Comment on
this matter. The report recommends that the FASB could improve the provision
of timely gUidance by: (1) broadening the scope of FASB technical bulletins
(which are issued by the FASB staff without formal deliberation by FASB members and without the lengthy due process procedures required of FASB statements or interpretations); and (2) establishing an advisory group to assist the
FASB in identifying financial reporting issues. The FASB is presently considerinq

(4) Accounting for Pensions-The FASB's current project on employers' accounting for pensions addresses a very significant financial reporting matter that
needs to be resolved. In its Preliminary Views document, the FASB proposed
significant changes in the way companies account for pensions. Under this proposal, employers would be required to use a single actuarial method to compute
annual pension expense under defined benefit plans. Where plan benefits measured under this single method exceed the plan's net assets, companies would
report a net pension liability on their balance sheets. Conversely, where the plan's
net assets exceed plan benefits measured by this single actuarial method, a net
pension asset would be reported. The FASB's tentative conclusions on this matter
have generated a great deal of interest and controversy In the business community. While there is lack of agreement as to the appropriate resolution of this
matter, there clearly exists an urgent need for more comparable reporting of
pension costs and liabilities. The FASB's leadership role in establishing accounting standards is being tested by this issue.

17

(5) Other Projects-Other important items on the FASB's agenda include
consolidations and the equity method of accounting, accounting for income
taxes as well as some narrow emerging practice problems. The Commission
concurs with the FASB's decision to address these issues and is particularly
hopeful that determinations made in the consolidations project will help resolve
many of the emerging accounting issues encountered by registrants and their
accountants in this area.
International Accounting and Reporting-The
disclosure of information by
multinational enterprises continues to be of interest to a variety of user groups,
including investors, creditors, governments and employee organizations. A number of regional and international bodies continue to devote substantial time and
resources to improving the quality of the information included in general purpose
reports.
The Commission monitors certain activities of several regional and international standard setting bodies, including those of the European Economic Community, the International Accounting Standards Committee and the International
Federation of Accountants. While not a direct participant in such activities, the
Commission is interested in and supportive of the development of international
standards of accounting and auditing. Some degree of standardization of such
requirements would provide more useful and understandable information for
investors and other users of financial reports and lessen differences between the
reporting requirements applicable to domestic and foreign private issuers which
register securities with the Commission.
In addition to monitoring developments in international accountIng and reporting, the Commission's Office of the Chief Accountant maintains communications
with various national and international standard-setting bodies and comments on
the proposed standards of such bodies from time to time. A staff member from
the Office of the Chief Accountant serves as an expert advisor on the United
States delegations to the regular meetings of working groups on international
accounting and reporting standards established by the United Nations and the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. While the Commission recognizes that the harmonization of accounting and reporting standards is
a long term process, it is hoped and expected that these efforts will continue and
favorably affect the efficiency of the world's capital markets.
Accounting-Related Rules and Interpretations-The
Commission's principal
accounting requirements are embodied in Regulation S-X which governs the
form and content of, and requirements for, financial statements filed under the
Federal securities laws. The Commission also publicizes its views on various
accounting and financial reporting matters in Financial Reporting Releases
(FRRs). Accountmg and Auditing Enforcement Releases (MERs) are issued to
announce the Commission's enforcement activities that involve accounting and
auditing matters. In addition, the Commission's staff periodically issues Staff
Accounting Bulletins (SABs) as a means of informing the financial community of
its views on accounting and disclosure issues-'>
The Commission's accounting-related rules and interpretations serve primarily
to supplement generally accepted accounting principles (GMP), as established

18

by the private sector, by addressing those areas which are unique to Commission
filings or where GMP is not explicit. The Commission continually evaluates its
requirements as the private sector changes financial reporting standards, and
modifies or eliminates those requirements which become unnecessary. To the
extent that the FASB and the A1CPAaccelerate their efforts to enhance financial
reporting, the Commission should be able to place more reliance on private
sector standards.
Sunset Review-During
the past year, the Commission devoted substantial
resources to complete its comprehensive review of existing accounting-related
rules and interpretations. The objective of this review was to ensure that the
Commission's requirements remain necessary and cost-effective in todays environment and that they contribute to the usefulness of financial reporting without
imposing unjustified burdens on registrants. Some specific actions in this area
are discussed below.
(1) ReguLation S-X-During
the fiscal year, the Commission adopted revised
rules regarding financial statement requirements for investment companies and
bank holding cornpanles.>' That action substantially completed the project, initiated in 1980, to establish uniform requirements applicable to virtually all filings
with the Commission as well as annual reports to security holders.
During the fiscal year, the Commission also revised its requirements regarding
independence of accountants-'> and its full cost accounting rules for determining
when it is appropriate for oil and gas producers to exclude costs from immediate
amortization.>"
(2) FinanciaL Reporting Requirements for Banks and Bank HoLding Companies-In addition to revising the financial statement requirements contained in
Regulation S-X, the Commission and its staff undertook a number of other
initiatives involving financial reporting requirements for banks and bank holding
companies. In October 1982, the Commission issued SAB 49 (later supplemented by SAB 49A) regarding disclosures by bank holding companies about
loans in countries that are experiencing liquidity problems. Also discussed was
the related need to provide additional disclosures about restructurings of existing
debt or funding of additional borrowings in these countries. The staff also issued
SAB 50 in March 1983 to express its view as to the appropriate financial statement
and industry guide disclosures in filings involving formation of a one bank holding company. In August 1983, the Commission authorized the issuance of revised
staff gUidelines for disclosures by bank holding companies about nonaccrual,
past due and restructured loans; potential problem loans; foreign outstandings;
and loan concentrations.>? Because of close cooperation with the Federal banking agencies, the amended guildelines relating to the presentation of information
about nonaccrual, past due and restructured loans and foreign outstandings by
bank holding companies are consistent with comparable rules applicable to
banks in reports filed with the banking agencies.
(3) Accounting for Computer Software DeveLopment Costs-In August 1983,
the Commission announced a moratorium on the practice of capitalization of
costs of internally developed computer software for sale or lease to others.38 The
Commission imposed this moratorium in order to prevent further divergence in

19

accounting for these costs. The prohibition of capitalization does not apply to
companies which had disclosed a capitalization practice before April 14, 1983.
This moratorium will automatically be rescinded concurrent with the effective
date of a final FASB pronouncement providing specific accountmg guidance on
this issue.

Regulation of the Securities Markets
Key 1983 Results
Rapid expansion of new financial products and enhancement to automated
securities trading characterized the securities markets during fiscal 1983, while
the Commission continued with its cost savings initiatives. The over-the-counter
market and the stock exchanges were linked for the first time through the Intermarket Trading System (ITS), furthering progress toward a national market system. Legislation initiated by the Commission and signed into law this year ended
the Commission's duplicative program for directly regulating those over-thecounter broker-dealers who are not members of a national securities association
(formerly called "SECO" brokers) by requiring them to join an association. The
range of approved option products expanded to include options on stock indices
and options on certificates of deposit.
The level of activity for processing of broker-dealer reports increased during
fiscal 1983. There were 7,067 broker-dealer reports processed, compared to
6,599 and 6,106 in fiscal years 1982 and 1981, respectively.
The Commission adopted rule amendments in the trading practice area designed to enhance the depth and liquidity of the over-the-counter market by
reducing restrictions on market-making activity before a distribution of securities.
This terminated a 20-year-old program of regulating most purchases by issuers
of their own securities.
In the reporting area, the Commission eliminated a requirement that brokerdealers send immediate confirmations of transactions in shares of certain money
market funds, resulting in an estimated cost savings of $35 million to the industry
and fund shareholders. The Commission rescinded the requirement that brokerdealers file reports concerning stabilizing activities, saving the industry approximately $3 million annually.
The Commission's approval of a set of rule changes requiring certain financial
institutions to confirm, affirm, and settle trades through the facilities of registered
securities depositories, should reduce settlement costs by hundreds of millions of
dollars annually. The Commission also approved changes to the formulas for
determining participants' contributions to the Options Clearing Corporation
clearing fund, thus freeing up more than $300 million in capital.
New transfer agent rules were approved that establish minimum standards and
reporting requirements regarding records of security holders and safeguarding of
funds and securities used in performing transfer agent functions. And, in its
efforts to facilitate the broker-dealer examination program conducted by the selfregulatory organizations (SROs), the Commission granted the SROs access to
computer software for monitoring customer accounts.

21

Securities Markets, Facilities, and Trading
The National Market System (NMS)-The Commission permitted operation,
on an indefinite basis, of the Intermarket Trading System (ITS),39 which is run by
seven national securities exchanges and the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (NASD), and of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange's National Securities
Trading System (NSTS).40 Through its Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis and Office of the Chief Economist, the Commission continued monitoring
trading in Rule 19c-3 securities (i.e. securities not subject to exchange off-board
trading restrictions) through the automated interface between ITS and the
NASD's Computer Assisted Execution System (CAES).41
In adopting Rule 19c-3, the Commission established a program to monitor the
extent of Rule 19c-3 trading and its impact on the market performance of Rule
19c-3 securities. To date, no favorable or adverse effects on the markets for
securities traded under Rule 19c-3 have been found. The volume in Rule 19c-3
eligible securities, as a percentage of composite volume executed in the over-thecounter market, has declined substantially in the past year. The same is true for
Rule 19c-3 eligible securities traded through the automated interface between ITS
and CAES.
Monitoring of the ITS showed that it has become a major trading facility that
increases intermarket competition and improves customers' orders. Monitoring
the National Securities Trading System of the Cincinnati Stock Exchange showed
that the system provided its users with an effective and efficient mechanism for
executing orders and attracting order flow in the eligible securities.
The Commission also deferred action on a reproposed order exposure rule
that would apply to Rule 19c-3 securities traded through the ITS/CAES interface.
The Commission believes that absent evidence of need, and considering the
small amount of over-the-counter trading in these securities, there is insufficient
justification for imposing the costs associated with the rule.42
By the end of 1983 over 700 actively-traded OTC securities had been designated as national market system (NMS) securities under Rule IlAa2-I.43 That
rule requires transactions In NMS Securities to be reported in a real-time system
which, the Commission believes, increases market efficiency and improves execution of customer's orders.
National System for the Clearance and Settlement of Securities Transactions-The
Commission proposed Rule 17Ad-14 that would require registered
transfer agents acting as tender agents for bidders during tender offers to establish accounts with registered securities depositories to permit book-entry delivery
of tendered securlties.v' for an anticipated annual saving to brokers and agent
banks of over $350 million.
The Commission approved rule changes proposed by five registered securities
exchanges and the NASD requiring certain financial institutions to confirm, affirm, and settle institutional trades through the facilities of registered securities
depositories. These rule changes will substantially reduce settlement costs for
those institutlons.s" The Commission also approved a proposal submitted by the
Midwest Securities Trust Company that modernizes the settlement of municipal

22

securities transactions.?"
Options-During
fiscal year 1983, new legislation clarified the Commission's
regulatory responsibility regarding options and futures."? Under that authority,
the Commission approved the issuance and trading of 23 new products including
options on stock market indices,48 foreign currencies.s? U.S. Treasury securities.>? Government National Mortgage Association securities>' and certificates of deposit.V The Commission also raised no objection to the issuance of
futures on a number of stock indices. Trading has not begun on all approved
options and futures.
Market Manipulation-On March 22, 1983, the Commission adopted amendments to Exchange Act Rule lOb-6. The rule governs trading in securities by
persons participating in a distribution of those securltles.P The amendments: (1)
defined the term "distribution" for purposes of the rule; (2) codified existing staff
positions concerning some of the exceptions to the rule; (3) relaxed the prohibitions of the rule to permit participants in a distribution of certain securities and
issuers of those securities to continue purchasing such securities until two business days before the commencement of the sales of the securities being distributed; and (4) excepted non-convertible investment grade debt and preferred
securities from the rule. Simultaneously, the Commission adopted an amendment to Exchange Act Rule 10b-8 that extended the scope of the rule to cover
purchasing activity by broker-dealers who act as "standby underwriters" in connection with a call for redemption by an issuer of its convertible securities.
Issuer Repurchases-On November 30,1982, the Commission adopted Exchange Act Rule lOb-18.54 The rule regulates purchases of an issuer's securities
by or on behalf of an issuer and certain other persons. The rule provides a "safe
harbor" from liability under the anti-manipulative provisions of Section 9(a)(2) of
the Exchange Act and Rule lOb-5 under the Exchange Act for issuer repurchases
complying with specified time, price, and volume limitations.
Issuer Tender Offers-On August 2, 1983, the Commission adopted amendments to Exchange Act Rule 13e-4,55 which regulates cash tender offers and
exchange offers by issuers for their equity securities. The amendments exempt
from the Rule's application tender offers by issuers to purchase shares from
security holders, excluding participants in employee or shareholder stock purchase plans, who own less than 100 shares. A companion amendment to Exchange Act Rule 13e-3 was also adopted.
Stabilization Reports-On September 7, 1983, the Commission amended
Exchange Act Rules 17a-2 and lOb-7 and rescinded related Rule X-17a-1.56 The
effect of the change is to eliminate the requirement that underwriting syndicate
members file a report with the Commission of all of their transactions in a
stabilized security. Instead, the manager of an underwriting syndicate is now
required to maintain, in a separate file, records of only stabilizing transactions by
the syndicate.
Publication of Quotations by Broker-Dealers-On April 26, 1983, the Commission published for comment amendments to Exchange Act Rule 15c2-1).57
The rule generally requires that a broker-dealer have certain information concerning an issuer before initiating quotations on the issuer's securities. The proposed

23

amendments would require broker-dealers to maintain information with respect
to additional categories of issuers and would broaden the types of quotations to
which the rule would apply. The Commission also announced its intention to
review the rule in its entirety.
Exemption from Short Sale Rule-On September 27,1983, the Commission
published for comment an amendment to Exchange Act Rule 1Oa-I, the short
sale rule.58 If adopted, the amendment would permit a broker-dealer selling a
security acquired in the capacity of a block positioner to ignore, for purposes of
compliance with the "tick" provisions of the rule, a hedged short position in that
security arising from arbitrage or hedging activities. The amendment is designed
to facilitate block posrtioninq.
Regulation of Brokers, Dealers, Municipal Securities Dealers, and
Transfer Agents
Broker-Dealer and TransferAgent Examinations-In fiscal 1983, the number
of completed field examinations of broker-dealers was 11% less than the previous
year because the Commission had fewer examiners and some of them were
redeployed to handle widespread problems related to the "hot issue" market.
Nevertheless, the Commission continued to emphasize Improved efficiency, thoroughness, and overall quality of regional office examinations, particularly oversight examinations of SRO member firms. Also, one particular oversight
examination found that an SRO had failed to discover fraudulent activities at one
firm involving approximately $40 million. Consequently, the firm was placed in
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC) liquidation, and the firm's principal officer was barred from the securities business, indicted and sentenced to 25
years In prison.
Refinements were made to the computerized Customer Account Statement
Evaluation System (CASE), which permits more rapid analysis of activity in cus-.
tomer accounts and contributes to increased examiner productivity and effectiveness. Further, the Commission granted SRO access to the CASE program for use
in their exarrunatrons.
During the fiscal year, the staff reviewed approximately 165 transfer agent
examinations performed by the regional offices and the federal bank regulators
and 796 regional office broker-dealer examinations in order to identify any novel
or unique national concerns and to assist in promoting better regional office
examination programs.
Securities Confirmations-On
April 18, 1983, the Commission approved
amendments to Rule lOb-lO, the customer confirmation rule. The amendments
allow use of monthly confurnations as a limited exception from the immediate
delivery requirements of the rule for transactions In shares of those investment
companies usually referred to as money market funds. This exception is expected
to save the securities industry about $35 million annually. The amendments also
require disclosure of yield and call features in transactions in debt securities,
except municipal securities.>?
Fingerprinting-The Commission amended Rule 17f-2 to reduce the cost of,

24

and to simplify the procedures for, requesting certain exemptions from the fingerprinting requirements under the Exchange Act.6o
Transfer Agent Regulation-The
Commission adopted rules establishing uniform minimum standards for registered transfer agents. The rules ensure the
prompt and accurate creation and maintenance of issuer security holder records
and the safeguarding of funds and securities in the possession or control of
transfer aqents.>'
Oversight of Self-Regulatory

Organizations

National Securities Exchanges-As
of September 30, 1983, ten exchanges
were registered With the Commission as national securities exchanqes.v-' During
the fiscal year the Commission granted applications by exchanges to delist 44
equity and 12 debt issues, and granted applications by issuers requesting withdrawal from listing and registration for 22 equity and 10 debt issues. In addition,
during the fiscal year the Commission granted 775 applications by exchanges for
unlisted trading privileges.
The exchanges reported to the Commission 475 final disciplinary actions
imposing a variety of sanctions upon member firms and their employees. This
contrasts to 334 final disciplinary actions in fiscal 1982.
During the fiscal year, the Commission received 194 proposed rule changes
from exchanges. Among the significant rule filings approved by the Commission
were: (1) amendments to the Philadelphia Stock Exchange's by-laws and rules
relatmg to disciplinary procedures.v" (2) amendments to the American Stock
Exchange, Inc. (Amex) listing standards:"? and (3) amendments to the New York
Stock Exchange, Inc.'s (NYSE) Constitution limiting the number of NYSE physical access memberships to 24.65
During the fiscal year, the Commission amended Rule 6a-2 and Form 1 and
I-A under the Exchange Act regarding the form of applications for registration as
a national securities exchange and of periodic amendments to an exchange's
registration staternent.v"
Allocation of Regulatory Responsibilities-On
September 8, 1983, the Commission approved a plan filed jointly by seven SROs: the Amex, Chicago Board
Options Exchange, Inc. (CBOE), Midwest Stock Exchange, Inc. (MSE), NASD,
NYSE, Pacific Stock Exchange, Inc. (PSE), and Philadelphia Stock Exchange, Inc.
(Phlx). The plan allocates regulatory responsibility for certain option-related sales
practice matters with respect to broker-dealers which are members of more than
one participating SRo. It IS designed to reduce regulatory duplication.
National Associsuon of Securities Dealers, Inc.-The NASD, which has 4,232
members, is the only national securities association registered with the Commission. At the close of the fiscal year, the NASD reported to the Commission the
disposition of approximately 227 significant disciplinary actions and 100 summary actions by the NASDAQ Trading Committee, as compared With approximately 429 and 248 a year earlier. In addition, the Commission received from the
NASD 17 filings of proposed rule changes, down 1 from 1982.
Under the amendments to the Exchange Act, the Commission's SECO pro-

25

gram terminated on December 6, 1983.67 The NASD has cooperated with the
Commission to phase out the SECO program and has submitted a number of
rule filings to permit the conversion of SECO members to NASD rnernbers.s"
Cleennq Agencies-The Commission granted full registration to nine clearing
agencies under Sections 17A and 19 of the Exchange Act. 69 The Commission
also extended the temporary registration of two clearing agencies until September 30, 1984.70
Surveillance and Compliance Inspections-During the fiscal year, the staff
conducted 18 inspections of SRO market surveillance, disciplinary, compliance
and operational programs. When notified of the inspection findings, each SRO
took steps to respond to staff recommendations.
During 1983, the staff focused several of its surveillance inspections on the
adequacy of transaction audit trails. Through a series of special inspections, the
staff monitored the NYSE's progress in developing its equity audit trail. In June
1983, the NYSE and member firms completed systems and procedural modifications to use the comparison process to collect and pass through to the exchange
essential audit trail data elements. An inspection of the CBOE found that surveillance for intramarket and intermarket violations at the exchange would be
enhanced greatly by an automated options audit trail. Also, an inspection of the
NASD's program for surveillance of securities quoted in NASDAQ disclosed
siqrnflcant deficiencies caused largely by the NASD's inability to capture and use
for automated surveillance certain detailed information on individual trades. Accordingly, the Commission recommended that the NASD create an adequate
audit trail for transactions in all NASDAQ stocks.
In addition, the staff inspected the NASD's enforcement of its standards for
inclusion of securities in NASDAQ. While the inspection disclosed that the NASD
had improved its tracking of issuers' compliance with qualifications standards, it
also disclosed that the NASD had not verified the accuracy of issuers' financial
filings. The Commission recommended that the NASD hire additional staff to
perform routine analyses of these filings. In addition, the staff completed an
inspection of the CSE which was prompted by the CSE's request for permanent
approval of its National Securities Trading System (NSTS). The inspection disclosed no major problems with the CSE's operational surveillance programs
which would prevent the Commission's permanent approval of the NSTS.
Also during 1983, the staff conducted a series of inspections to examine the
exchanges' capability to detect certain intermarket trading violations. A comparative study of surveillance techniques to detect stock/option manipulation discovered certain surveillance weaknesses at each of the options exchanges, A staff
review of the treatment of frontrunning violations by the options exchanges,
conducted in conjunction with a joint SRO task force, discovered variations in
SRO interpretations of the frontrunning prohibition. Finally, several limited inspections of SRO trading programs for options on debt instruments and foreign
currency disclosed that surveillance capability for these new products appeared
adequate in light of the low trading volume.
At the end of the fiscal year, five surveillance inspections were in progress:
Amex disciplinary program, BSE surveillance and operational programs, PSE

26

stock and options surveillance programs, and the MSE surveillance program.
The staff conducted an inspection of the NYSE to evaluate the exchange's
handling of margin maintenance violations at a member firm. As a result, the staff
recommended the adoption of procedures to assure the prompt abatement of
margin violations by member firms and to assure a more thorough sales practices review. The staff also conducted an inspection of the NYSE concerning
routine examinations of member firms and began an inspection of the NASD
Central Registration Depository. These inspections were in progress at the end of
the fiscal year.
S/PC Assessment-On
May 1,1983, SIPC reimposed its assessment on member broker-dealers at the annual rate of one-fourth of 1% of aggregate gross
revenues from the securities business. The renewed assessment on gross revenues followed SIPe's notification to the Commission that the SIPC fund had fallen
below the statutory minimum of $150 million on April 13, 1983. This is the first
time that the fund dropped below the statutory minimum since that level was
achieved in 1977.
The Commission did not disapprove two SIPC bylaw amendments relating to
the SIPC assessment. On April 29, 1983, the Commission considered, and did
not disapprove, SIPe's requested change in the instructions of the SIPC assessment forms permitting SIPC members a deduction from "gross revenues" of
40% of the interest earned on customers' securities accounts. On August 11,
1983, the Commission considered, and did not disapprove, SIPe's request that, in
computing "gross revenues" for assessment purposes, SIPC members be allowed to net all interest expense in connection with repurchase agreements and
securities borrowing acitivities against the interest income generated by such
transactions.
Clearing Agencies-During
fiscal year 1983, the Commission approved many
proposed rule changes reducing clearing costs and refining clearing agency
systems for controlling financial exposure. For example, the Commission permitted the Options Clearing Corporation to accept letters of credit issued by foreignbased banks to secure participants' margin obllqatlons?" and to modify the
formulas for calculating participants' contributions to the clearing fund, thereby
freeing up three hundred million dollars in capltal.??
Applications for Re-Entry-During the fiscal year, the Division of Market Regulation received 80 applications to permit persons subject to statutory disqualifications, as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange Act, to become
associated with broker-dealers. The following SROs filed applications: NASD-49;
NYSE-22; Amex-6; CBOE-2; and MSE-l. Six of the 80 applications were subsequently withdrawn, 64 were processed and 10 were pending at year end.
Market Oversight and Surveillance System-The
Market Oversight and Surveillance System (MOSS) was initiated on a pilot basis in 1980. It is designed to
automate the Commission's surveillance and oversight capabilities. In August
]981, at the Commission's initiative, the SROs submitted a proposal for an SRO
intermarket surveillance program, to which the Commission would have ready
access. The SRO program, when fully implemented, should result in significantly
enhanced intermarket surveillance. Therefore, the Commission has deferred rna-

27

jor enhancement of MOSS pending Implementation and evaluation of the SRO

program, In the Interest of avoiding unnecessary costs and duplication.
During fiscal year 1983, the staff refined and expanded the oversight and
research capabilities of MOSS. During this period, the SROs made siqrufrcant
progress towards the implementation of their program. Under the requirement in
the Congressional budget authonzation for MOSS, the Commission submitted
reports to Congress on the MOSS project on April 1, 1983 and October 1,1983,
which provide greater detail on MOSS and the SRO project.
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board-As in the case of the NASD, the
Commission reviews proposed rule changes of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB). During the last nine months of the fiscal year,the MSRB
filed 13 proposed rule changes.
A number of these proposed rule changes revised the content of Inter-dealer
and customer confirmations. These changes were necessitated by the Tax Equity
and Fiscal Responsibility Act of 1982, which provided that municipal securities be
issued in registered form to maintain their tax exempt status, and by the advent of
new products, such as the zero coupon bond, which require additional disclosure
on the confirmation 73

28

Investment Companies and Advisers
Key 1983 Results
Despite budgetary constraints and personnel reductions, as a result of increasIng productivity. during fiscal 1983 the Commission completed a record 1,085
examinations of investment companies and investment advisers,an increase over
the 1,065 Inspections conducted in fiscal 1982. In addition, through its examination program, the Commission recovered $5.1 million during the year which was
returned to investment company shareholders and investment advisory clients.
The number of registered Investment companies and investment advisers increased significantly during fiscal 1983: 12% in the case of investment companies and 34% for investment advisers. In anticipation of continued growth in the
industry and in the complexity of financial products, the Commission initiated a
program to increase the number and effectiveness of Investment company and
investment adviser examinations to be conducted in future years. Existing examination procedures will be streamlined through increased use of computers for
developing priorities, scheduling examinations and analyzing collected information. These changes will improve the cost-effectiveness of the inspection program
without reducing investor protections.
Office of Regulatory Policy
Early In fiscal 1983, the Investment Company Act Study Group and the Investment Advisers Act Study Group were combined to form the Office of Regulatory
Policy. This office is responsible for the Division of Investment Management's
ongoing review of the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company
Act), the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (AdvisersAct), and the rules, regulations
and administrative practices adopted under those Acts. The objective is to alleviate regulatory burdens imposed upon investment companies and investment
advisers without reducing investor protection. During fiscal 1983, the Office responded to recent market and industry trends by examining and proposing
several significant deregulatory initiatives.
On the Office's recommendation, the Commission Issued two advance concept releases during the fiscal year.The first requested comment on alternatives
for mutual fund governance 74 The second requested comment on alternatives
for the establishment of a self-regulatory organization to conduct investment
company inspections.?" The Commission also proposed, at the recommendation of the Office. Rule 22d-6 under the Investment Company Act that would
permit investment companies to sell redeemable securities at prices that reflect
different sales loads.?" Also, the Commission proposed Rule 205-3 under the
Advisers Act that would permit registered Investment advisers to charge certain
financially sophisticated chents advisory fees that are based upon capital qains.??

29

The Commission adopted an amended registration form for investment advisers,
thereby reducing their compliance burden.?"
Disclosure Study
The Division established a Disclosure Study Group in fiscal 1979 to undertake
a thorough review of the disclosure requirements for investment companies under the Secunties Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Investment Company Act.
Dunnq fiscal 1983, upon the recommendation of the Study Group, the Commission adopted a new registration form under the Securities and Investment
Company Acts for all open-end management investment companies other than
insurance company separate accounts."? The new form, Form N-IA, establishes
a two-part format for disclosure to investors. The first part is a shortened and
simplified prospectus that may be used to satisfy the delivery requirements of the
Secunties Act. The second is a "Statement of Additional Information" that is
available to Investors upon request, without charge.
The Commission also adopted temporary amendments to Rule 482 under the
Securities Act.8o The temporary amendments permit mutual funds to mail advertisements in the form of an "omitting prospectus" directly to investors. Money
market mutual funds are permitted to include in such advertisements an effective
yield comparable to the compound interest rates advertised by banking institutions.
Insurance Products
Durmq fiscal 1983, the Commission took action on three exemptive rules
relating to variable annuity contracts. These initiatives were designed to eliminate
the many individual exemptive applications under the Investment Company Act
filed by insurance company separate accounts offering variable annuity contracts. The rules codify the standards that the Commission has developed in
connection with certain routine applications for exemption.
On October 18, 1982, the Commission proposed Rule 6c-7 and amended Rule
14a-2 under the Act.'" Proposed Rule 6c-7 would provide separate accounts with
exemptive relief to permit them to comply with applicable Texas law in the sale of
variable annuity contracts to certain employees of Texas institutions of higher
education. Amended Rule 14a-2 expands the availability of existing relief from the
Investment Company Act's minimum net worth requirement. On July 28, 1983,
the Commission adopted Rule lla-2 under the Investment Company Act82 which
eliminates the need for separate accounts to obtain individual orders of the
Commission approving the terms of certain routine exchange offers. Rule 6c-8,
adopted on the same day,83 eliminates the need for individual orders of the
Commission permitting separate accounts to impose a deferred sales load on
their variable annuity contracts and to deduct a full annual fee for administrative
services in certain instances.
Significant Applications and Interpretations
Fidelity Fund, Inc.-During

30

fiscal 1983, the Division approved requests by the

Fidelity and Federated groups of investment companies to effect certain types of
securities transactions with affiliated banks. Such transactions included purchases and sales of municipal securities as well as purchases of certificates of
deposit and repurchase agreements issued by certain of the affiliated banks.
Exemptive relief was particularly important for those funds that are designed for
institutional investors or as "private label" funds sold exclusively to the customers
of a single bank. In both situations, securities trading by the Fidehty and Federated funds with those affiliated banks would have been prohibited by the Investment Company Act without Commission approval. This would have had the
effect of depriving the entire Fidelity and Federated groups of needed portfolio
management flexibility.
American Property Mortgage, Inc.-The Division processed an application of
American Property Mortgage, Inc., for a Commission order under Section 17 of
the Investment Company Act and Rule 17d-l thereunder, which limit transactions
between registered investment companies and their affiliates. This application
concerned the organization of a closed-end investment company, Tax Exempt
Equity Fund, Inc., which proposed to offer investors a new type of investment
opportunity. Under the proposed arrangement, proceeds from the sale of shares
of the fund would be used to purchase tax-exempt, industrial development bonds
from municipalities. The proceeds of the bond sales would be loaned by the
municipalities to companies jointly owned by the fund and an affiliate of the
fund's investment adviser, which would use the loans to purchase and develop
commercial real estate projects for lease to qualified tenants. The applicant represented that Fund shareholders would benefit from this arrangement by receiving
not only a return of principal and tax-exempt interest, but also a share of the
residual value of the real estate projects after the 20 year life of the bonds. The
Division, under delegated authority, issued a notice of the filing of this application
on July 29, 1983.
Venture Capital-During the fiscal year, the Division facilitated the operations
of venture capital companies, including business development companies
(BDCs), by granting them various types of exemptive relief under the Investment
Company and Advisers Acts. For example, orders were issued to Allied Capital
Corporation and to Narragansett Capital Corporation to allow those companies to
pass the Section 18(k) exclusion from the 300% asset coverage test of Section
18(a) of the Investment Company Act (concerning indebtedness of small business investment companies) through to the companies' parents. In addition, the
Division issued an order to Allied Capital to allow that company, which does not
meet the definitional requirements of a BDC under the Investment Company Act,
to engage in certain joint transactions under Section 17 of the Act with downstream affiliates on a basis comparable to that of a BDC. Furthermore, the
Division issued an order to Narragansett to allow it to issue stock options so that it
can attract and retain qualifed managerial talent. While meeting the definitional
requirements of a BDC under the Act, Narragansett, for tax reasons, has not
elected to register as a BDC. Finally, the Division issued an order to Merrill Lynch
Venture Partners I to permit that company to engage in certain parallel investments with affiliates.

31

Repurchase Agreements-Upon the Division's recommendation, the Commission issued an interpretive release revising the Division's position concerning
the basis on which mutual funds should enter into repurchase agreements
(repos). Issuance of the release was precipitated, in part, by a finding of the Office
of the General Counsel that a fund that enters into a repo may be exposed to the
risk that it will be unable to Iiquidate immediately the "collateral" underlying the
repo if the issuing party initiates bankruptcy proceedings, The Division advised
that, pending either judicial or legislative resolution of the uncertainty regarding
the status of repos under the Bankruptcy Code, issuance of a new interpretive
release-'? would be appropriate to ensure that investment companies will avoid
entering Into repo transactions with parties that present a serious risk of becoming bankrupt. The interpretative release announced: (1) that the Division was
modifying a prior "no-action" position by requiring that mutual fund boards of
directors evaluate the creditworthiness of the brokers or dealers with which their
funds propose to enter Into repos; and (2) the Division's position that directors of
money market funds using the amortized cost or pennyrounding valuation methods under a Commission order or Rule 2a-7 are required to evaluate the creditworthiness of all entities with which they propose to enter into repos.
Peavey Commodity Funds, I, /I and /II-On May 2, 1983, the staff advised
PeaveyFunds I, II and 1/1 that, as long as they did not invest in securities, the staff
would not recommend any enforcement action if the funds invested primarily in
futures contracts and other specified forms of options without registering as
Investment companies. This action was taken in light of the jurisdictional accord
between the Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. The
staff said it would treat a fund as being primarily engaged in investing in futures
contracts and other specified forms of options, if investing in such interests is its
primary source of gains and risks, even if the fund's assets consist mostly of
Government securities.
Institutional Disclosure Program
Section 13(f)(5) of the Exchange Act requires certain "institutional investment
managers" to file reports on Form 13F on a calendar quarterly basis. Managers
required to file 13F reports disclose certain equity holdings of the accounts over
which they exercise investment discretion. In fiscal 1983, Form 13F reports were
filed on behalf of 1,050 managers for holdings totalling $703 billion.
Form 13F reports are available to the public at the Commission's Public Reference Room promptly after filing. Two tabulations of the information contained in
Form 13F reports are also available for inspection at the Public Reference Room.
The first of these tabulations includes a listing, arranged according to the individual security, showing the number of shares held and the name of the money'
manager reporting the holding. The second tabulation is a summary listing
showing the number of shares of a security reported by all institutional investment managers filing reports. Both tabulations normally are available 10-14 days
after the deadline for filing Form 13F,which is 45 days following the close of the
calendar quarter.

32

Both tabulations are produced by an independent contractor selected through
the competitive bidding process. The contractor provides its services to the Commission without charge, and IS required to make a vanety of specified tabulations
available to the public at reasonable prices within ten days after receipt of the
reports.

Other Litigation and Legal Work
The General Counsel represents the Commission In all litigation In the United
States Supreme Court and the courts of appeals, defends the Commission and
its employees when they are sued, prosecutes administrative proceedings under
Rule 2(e), and appears amicus curiae on behalf of the Commission in significant
private litigation under the Federal securities laws. In this litigation, the General
Counsel seeks to insure that the objectives of the Commission's enforcement
program are attained, that judicial interpretations of the Federal securities laws
afford adequate protection to investors, and that the Commission is able to
discharge its statutory responsibilities, unimpeded by law suits aqainst the agency
or its staff.
In fiscal year 1983 the Division of Corporate Regulation represented the Commission in court appearances in corporate reorganizations where there was a
substantial public investor interest.
Key 1983 Results
The General Counsel represented the Commission in 239 litigation matters
during the past fiscal year, many of which are still pending. Forty-four appellate
and Supreme Court cases were concluded, 38 favorably to the Commission.
There were 52 appellate cases before the Supreme Court and Federal courts of
appeals in which a party subject to a Commission injunctive action challenged
the lower court's resolution of the case in a manner favorable to the Commission
or, much less frequently, the Commission challenged an adverse decision. Of
these appeals, 16 were concluded, with only two outcomes unfavorable to the
Commission. The foregoing compares with the following cases in fiscal 1982: a
total of 251 matters, of which 62 were appellate cases in which a party subject to
Commission injunctive action challenged the lower court's resolution of the case
In a manner favorable to the Commission, or the Commission challenged an
adverse decision. Of those appellate cases 34 were concluded, two of which were
unfavorable to the Commission.
There were also 19 appellate actions seeking to overturn Commission orders,
primarily those issued in Commission administrative proceedings or those affirming self-regulatory organization disciplinary proceedings against broker-dealers.
Thirteen of these appeals were concluded, with only one adverse result. In fiscal
year 1982, there were 38 such actions.
In 53 cases during the year (compared to 58 such instances in fiscal year 1982)
Commission participation as a friend of the court in litigation conducted by
private parties was considered in order to afford the court the benefit of the
Commission's views on significant questions of concern to the Commission.
Amicus briefs were filed, and 13 private cases in which the Commission participated were concluded. Only one of these resulted in a decision adverse to the

views which the Commission advocated.
In addition, the General Counsel handled more than 115 other proceedings
before the Commission or in the Federal trial courts, compared to 90 in fiscal
year 1982. These Included 35 SUitsbrought against the Commissioners or the
Commission's staff, and 46 suits, including actions under the various public
information statutes, seeking access to Commission documents. In fiscal year
1982, there were 23 suits brought against the Commissioners or the Commission's staff, and 19 suits under the various public information statutes.
During the fiscal year, 79 debtors With publicly issued securities outstanding
entered Chapter 11reorganizations. The Division of Corporate Regulation entered
Its appearance In 15 of these cases, with assets of $19 billion and about 75,000
public investors.
Litigation
Appeals in Commission Iryunclwe Aciions-:-- This litigation consists primarily
of appeals in which a defendant attempts to reverse a trial court's entry of an
injunction. Occasionally however.the Commission appeals the denial of injunctive relief. These appeals frequently raise highly significant issues concerning the
scope and interpretation of the securities laws.
One case which was litigated during the fiscal year raised the constitutionality
of enjoining an investment adviser from publishing a newsletter recommending
securities investrnents.v" The defendant in that case had been criminally convicted of fraud and misappropriation of customers' funds, and the Commission
therefore barred him from the investment advisory industry. Notwithstanding the
bar, the district court, on First Amendment grounds, refused to issue an injunction against further newsletter publication. On appeal, the Commission asserted
that investment advisory newsletters constitute commercial speech which may be
subject to a greater degree of regulation than political or ideological speech. The
Commission further urged that, because of the delicate fiduciary relationship
between an investment adviser and his dent, there is need to protect the public
by barnng unfit persons. (On January 18,1984, the court of appeals reversed the
opinion of the district court.)
The standard for obtaining injunctive relief against future Violations of the
securities laws is a frequent subject of appeals in Commission enforcement
actions. This year the Cornrnissron appealed the refusal of a district court to
enjoin a defendant whom that court found to have violated antifraud, reporting
and proxy provisions of the securities laws.86 The Commission maintained that,
in declining to grant an injunction, the court erroneously afforded undue weight
to a Single factor-whether the defendant's occupation at the time of trial provided an opportunity to commit future violations. The Commission urged that,
consistent with investor protection, the proper analysis requires consideration of
various factors, including the egregious nature of the defendant's past violations,
not merely current occupation.
In another case, the Commission successfully resisted an attempt to vacate a
consent injunction entered in 1976.87 In the defendant's appeal from the district

36

court's refusal to vacate the injunction, the court of appeals relied on the district
court's findings that there was no harm to the defendant flowing from the decree
and that the injunction continued to protect investors. The court of appeals
recognized that "significant governmental interests" were Involved in efforts to
vacate consent decrees, noting that consent injunctions allow the Commission to
secure the protections of an injunction while preserving its own, and judicial,
resources. In exchange for the defendant's consent, the Commission surrenders
its right to the entry of findings of fact. The court of appeals was "reluctant to
upset this balance of advantages and disadvantages" by dissolving consent injunctions, "unless it is clearly inequitable for the decree to continue in effect."ss
Petitions to Review Commission Orders-Petitions to review Commission
orders arise from Commission administrative proceedings and from Commission orders on review of disciplinary action by national securities exchanges and
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Like appeals in injunctive
actions, these administrative cases frequently involve issues central to the Commission's enforcement program and thus to the integrity of the secunties markets. In one such case, the court of appeals upheld Commission sanctions
imposed on a securities salesman based on findings that, Without disclosure to
his customers, the salesman charged excessivemarkups and illegally sold unregistered securitles.P? In another case, the court of appeals affirmed the Commission's determination that a broker introducing accounts to a clearing broker has a
duty to disclose material information concerning the credit-worthiness of its
customers.P?

Commission Participation In Private Litigation-The Commission also participates as a friend of the court in private litigation which raises significant securities laws issues or other issues of concern to the Commission. Privateactions
serve to supplement the Commission's own enforcement program, deterring
violations as well as affording relief to injured investors.Also, becausethe Federal
securities laws provide for both governmental enforcement actions and private
remedies, decisions in private cases which interpret provisions of those laws may
have precedential effect In Commission enforcement actions.
Early in 1983, the Supreme Court adopted the position urged by the Commission in a case which concerned the relation between the express and implied
remedies available to investors under the Federal securities laws (Herman &
McLean v. Huddiestoni'"
In a strongly worded opinion, the Supreme Court
emphasized the remedial purposes of the securities laws and the necessity of
construing them broadly to protect investors. Consistent with this analysis, the
Court held that the availability of the express remedy for falsehoods in registration
statements in Section 11 of the Securities Act does not prevent defrauded purchasers from suing under Exchange Act Rule lOb-5 as well. The Supreme Court
also agreed with the Commission that the standard of proof in private antifraud
cases is a preponderance of the evidence, not the more stringent clear and
convincing evidence standard.
At the request of the Supreme Court, the Commission also filed a brief in
response to a petition for review of IMtlck v. American Stock Exchange in which
the court of appeals had held that private parties cannot seek damages from a

'),,7

stock exchange under Section 6 of the Exchange Act for failure to enforce its
rules.92 The Commission's brief disagreed with the conclusion of the court of
appeals, pointing out that an implied right of action against exchanges is wellrecognized and that the existence of such a right is important to investor protecnon, The Commission stated, however,that review should not be granted because
of the limited precedential value of the case, which interpreted the language of
Section 6 prior to its amendment in 1975. Consistent with the Commission's
recommendation, the Supreme Court denied review.
In 1983, the Commission participated in several private actions which considered the scope of the term "security." In two such cases, the Commission disagreed with lower court decisions requiring instruments that come within the
term "note" in the definition of "security" also to meet the test for "investment
contract," another term in the definition, in order to qualify as securities.v" In
briefs filed in these cases, the Commission expressed concern that the exclusive
use of the investment contract test for determining whether instruments are
securities would restrict the coverage of the securities laws and limit investor
protection.
In another case raising this basic jurisdictional issue, the Commission argued
that time deposits issued to persons in the United States by a foreign bank are
securities if issued in investment--as distinguished from commercial-transactions.?? The Commission argued that, merely because the foreign issuer is a
bank, the securities laws should not be construed to deny United States residents
protection; where instruments, unregulated by Federal banking agencies, are
offered to the general public as investments, the securities laws should apply.
The Commission also urged in several cases that shareholders and their companies can sue for Injunctive and other equitable reliefto enforce Section 13(d) of
the Exchange ACt.95 That provision requires persons who acquire more than 5%
of the securities of an issuer, and thus could potentially effect changes in corporate control, to disclose their holdings and certain other information to the investing public. In one such case, the Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit ruled, in
accordance with the Commission's position, that such a right of action is consistent with congressional intent.96 Other cases raising this issue are pending.
Litigation Involving Trading On Nonpublic Information-Trading on the
basis of material nonpublic information--a practice which impairs confidence in
the integrity of the securities markets--has been the subject of a number of
recent cases. Last year, in Dirks v. SEC, the Supreme Court set aside the Commission's censure of an officer of a securities brokerage firm who had conveyed
adverse nonpublic information received from officers and employees of a corporation to potential sellers.P?This conduct caused institutions to sell $17 million of
securities to public investors who did not know that the securities were in fact
virtually worthless. The decision strongly reaffirmed that both insider and tippee
trading on the basis of nonpublic, material information is prohibited under the
Federalsecurities laws. But the Supreme Court rejected the Commission's theory
that a corporate outsider assumes the fiduciary duties of his inside sources by
receiving confidential corporate information from them. However, the Court
stated that outsiders can acquire a duty to disclose or abstain from trading in

38

several situations. First, outsiders may become fiduciaries of the shareholders
when they receive confidential information solely for a corporate purpose. Second, outsiders acquire derivatively the fiduciary duties of their inside sources
when they obtain confidential corporate information from insiders who transmit it
with the expectation of direct or indirect personal benefit, or make a gift of the
confidential information to the recipient
Following the Supreme Court's ruling in that case, the Commission successfully opposed the Supreme Court review in United States v. Newman, in which
the defendant had been criminally convicted for trading on confidential information concerning possible takeovers. His confederates misappropriated the information from their employer, investment banking firms, and their clients.P" The
defendant purchased securities of the companies that were the subject of the
proposed takeovers and, after the stock rose as a result of announcement of the
takeovers, sold at a profit. The court of appeals held that the proscriptions of the
antifraud provisions are not limited to situations where the fraud is perpetrated on
the purchaser or seller of securlties.P? The defendant's subsequent petition for
Supreme Court review argued that the misappropriation by the defendant and his
confederates did not give rise to liability under the securities laws, but involved
only the breach of state law contractual or fiduciary obligations. The government,
in response, emphasized the broad, remedial nature of the antifraud provisions,
the nexus between the fraud and the defendant's purchase and sale of securities,
and the fact that the misappropriated information concerned proposed purchases of securities by clients of the investment bankers.
The Commission also filed a friend of the court brief in a related private action
for damages. The plaintiff in that case sold shares of a target company on the
same day that the criminal defendant purchased the secuntles.'?? The district
court dismissed the complaint on the ground that any duty owed to the investment banking firms and their clients did not give rise to a separate duty to the
target company's shareholders. In its brief, the Commission recognized that persons who gain superior market information by reason of acumen, industry, or
intelligence owe no disclosure duty to those with whom they trade. The Commission argued that, nonetheless, a person who purchases securities on the basis of
non public information which he knows to have been misappropriated, owes a
duty of disclosure to the selling shareholders-independent
of any other relationship. Otherwise, the Commission argued, the law would encourage theft of information. The court of appeals rejected the Commission's position, commenting
that such a holding would grant a private plaintiff a "windfall "?' In so doing, the
court of appeals distinguished its earlier decision in the criminal case: the critical
defendants traded on the basis of misappropriated information, in violation of
duties owed to their employers and the firms' clients; the defendants did not,
however, violate any duty owed to persons, like the plaintiff, with whom they
traded in the market
Commission Action Under Rule 2(e)--{jnder
Rule 2(e) of its Rules of Practice,102 the Commission may suspend or bar professionals (generally lawyers
and accountants) from practicing before it if they have violated the Federal securities laws or engaged in unethical professional conduct in their Commission

39

practice. Accountants and lawyers playa critical role in the disclosure of information to the investing public. The Commission relies on the integrity of these
professionals, and the ability to bar those who have engaged in misconduct is
necessary to protect the Commission's internal processes.
In the last year, Rule 2(e) proceedings were instituted against one lawyer, five
individual accountants, and one accounting firm. In all but one of these proceedings the respondents agreed to suspensions from practice before the Commission
for varying lengths of time. Before these professionals may be readmitted to practice, they must demonstrate that they have undertaken further professional education and that they will be subject to adequate supervision. The remaining matter
was pending before an administrative law judge at the close of the fiscal year.
Durmg the year,the Commission readmitted two attorneys to practice before it.
Litiqeuon InvoLving Requests For Access To Commission Records-In fiscal
1983, the Commission received 1,424 requests under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) for access to Commission records. The majority of these requests
were for investIgatory files. At the same time, the Commission received 1,392
requests for confidential treatment from persons who submitted information. The
foregoing compares with 1,420 FOIA requests and 939 confidentiality requests in
fiscal 1982.
Despite the large number of requests handled by the Commission's FOIA
office, only 129 requesters appealed the denial of FOIA requests to the Commission's General Counsel, who has been delegated authority to decide such appeals.l?> Additionally, 20 of the confidential treatment requesters filed appeals.
Notwithstanding the number of FOWconfidential treatment appeals decided,
only three court actions were filed against the Commission in 1983. Two of these
actions were settled,'?" and in the third the court upheld the Commission's denial
of access to the documents sought.105
Litigation Against The Commission And Its Staff-During fiscal year 1983,
the Commission and its staff members were defendants in 12 district court
actions in which persons sought to enjoin Commission law enforcement efforts
or to obtain damage awards against the staff. In each case the action was dismissed or the Commission's motion for summary judgment granted. Eight appeals from district court decisions dismissing such actions were taken during the
year. Four of these were decided favorably;106the other four are still pending, 107
although one of those resulted m an unfavorable court of appeals decision. lOB
(On December 2, 1983, one of the pending cases was decided favorably to the
Commission.)
In 0 'Brien v. SEC,109the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit held that,
absent special circumstances, the Commission must notify "targets" of its nonpublic investigations whenever it issues subpoenas to third parties. This notice
requirement could substantially impede the Commission's ability to conduct
investigations by providing targets of investigations with prior notice of all witnesses who are subpoenaed. They would thus be enabled to either attempt to
influence the witness not to cooperate or to file court actions challenging the
Commission's subpoenas. Indeed, since O'Brien, the Commission has defended
three lawsuits brought by subjects of Commission investigations to enforce their

40

"O'Brien rights."11OThe Commission has successfully defended two of these
actions. III Because of the far-reaching ramifications of 0 'Brien on the Commission's investigatory powers, the Commission has petitioned for review of this
decision in the Supreme Court. (The Supreme Court granted the Commission's
petition for a writ of certiorari on January 9, 1984.)
In addition, five actions were filed under the Right to Financial Pnvacy Act
Involving 16 Comrnlssion subpoenas for customer records from financial institutions. In each case, the district court found that the Commission was properly
seeking the subpoenaed records and enforced the Commission's subpoena.

Significant Legislation
Financial Services Industry-Vice President Bush's Task Group and GlassSteagall Legislation-DurIng fiscal year 1983, the Chairman participated as a
member of the Vice President's Task Group on Regulation of Financial Services.
The Task Group resulted in part from the Commission's proposal that a one-year
task force be formed to review the regulatory structure for the securities, bankmq,
thrift and insurance industries; that financial services be regulated by functional
activities rather than by outmoded industry classification; that overlapping, duplicative and conflicting regulatory activities be consolidated; and that excessive
regulations within and between agencies be eliminated.
Of the many significant proposals under the Task Group's consideration at year
end, two of the most relevant to investors were: repeal of the current exemptions
in the Securities Act for registration of securities issued by banks and savings and
loan associations; and transfer to the SEC of administration of the periodic
reporting, proxy solicitation, and shortswing profits provisions of the Act as they
relate to such institutions. These proposals would consolidate within the Commission administration of securities disclosure requirements for banks and savings and loan associations. It would result In more uniform financial disclosure to
public shareholders and securities analysts, facilitating evaluation of comparative
investment risks. Delays in conforming regulations governing bank and savings
and loan association filings with those applicable to all other issues would be
eliminated and duplication of agency staff requirements in establishing, interpreting, processing, and enforcing securities disclosure requirements would be reduced. The Commission would become the repository for filings of all publiclyheld banks, savings and loan associations, and holding companies, as it is for all
other publicly-owned companies.
The Task Group is expected to make recommendations concerning the future
regulatory structure for the financial services industry early in 1984.
The Commission also continued to support legislative efforts to revise the
Glass-Steagall and McFadden Acts in order to reflect the contemporary financial
services marketplace. The Commission has supported legislative efforts that
would allow bank and thrift holding companies to sponsor mutual funds and
underwrite municipal revenue bonds if these activities are carried out by separate
corporate affiliates subject to the Federal securities laws.
Mortgage-Related Securities-In the closing weeks of fiscal 1983, the Com-

41

mission prepared and submitted comments to Congress on legislation to facilitate development of the private secondary mortgage market. The legislation
seeks to expand substantially the role of the private sector in providing home
buyers with mortgage credit supplied by investors. Significant shifts in sources of
housing capital from the savings and loan and banking industries to the investor
community have occurred since the mid-1970s. The Commission staff provided
technical assistance in drafting the two bills introduced in the Senate.
Public Utility Holding Company Act-Two bills proposing modification of the
Holding Company Act were introduced in the 98th Congress. Generally, these
bills would create additional exemptions from the Act and remove some of the
regulatory controls on holding company system financing and diversification.
The Commission testified in support of the objectives of these bills.
Regulatory Reform-In testimony before a congressional subcommittee in
July 1983, the Commission stated that it has, to the extent practicable, voluntarily
incorporated cost-benefit analysis into its rulemaking proceedings. The Commission suggested that Congress, in examining proposals for regulatory reform,
consider the cumulative impact on agencies, and the benefits to the public, of
existing procedural statutes.
Insider Trading Sanctions Act-As proposed by the Commission and passed
by the House on September 19, 1983, the Insider Trading Sanctions Act would
authorize the Commission to seek a civil penalty of up to three times the profit
gained or loss avoided as a result of insider trading transactions. The Commission's authority to obtain injunctive and other equitable relief against such conduct would not be affected. The bill would also increase the current maximum
fine of $10,000 (established in 1934) for a criminal violation of the Act to
$100,000 and would amend Section 15(c)(4) of the Exchange Act to permit
administrative proceedings to remedy violations of Section 14 of that Act. At the
close of the fiscal year,the bill was pending in the Senate.
Corporate Reorganizations
Reorganization proceedings, administered in the United States courts, are
commenced by a debtor or by its creditors. In a reorqaruzation under Chapter 11
of the Bankruptcy Code, a debtor usually continues to operate under the court's
protection while it attempts to rehabilitate its business and work out a plan to pay
its debts. On the average, about 70 companies with publicly held securities file for
Chapter 11relief each year.Reorganization plans often provide for the issuance to
creditors and shareholders of new securities which may be exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933.
Under the Bankruptcy Code, the Commission may enter its appearance and
raise, or present its views on, any issue in a Chapter 11case. Although Chapter 11
relief is available to businesses of all sizes, the Commission generally limits its
participation to cases in which a substantial public investor interest is involved.
The Commission acts to protect the rights of those investors and to render
independent, expert assistance to the courts and parties in these complex
proceedings.
During the fiscal year, 79 debtors with publicly issued securities outstanding

42

entered Chapter 11 reorganization proceedings. The Commission entered its
appearance in 15 of these cases, with aggregate assets of $1.9 billion and about
75,000 public investors. A list of these proceedings is set forth in Table 38 in the
Appendix to this Report. In these cases, and in those pending from prior years,
the Commission presented its views on a variety of Issues including: (1) the need
for appointment of additional committees to represent classes of public debt
holders or equity security holders; (2) the debtor's operations, including proposed sales of major assets; (3) the need for appointment of a trustee to direct
the debtor's affairs or an examiner to conduct an investigation; (4) questions
concerning the status and rights of the securities held by public investors, the
classification of their claims, and proposed treatment in reorganization plans;
(5) the adequacy of the disclosure statements required to be transmitted to
creditors and investors when their votes on a plan are being solicited; (6) the
reasonableness of fees sought by counsel and other professionals, and (7) interpretive questions concerning the applicability of the securities lawsto bankruptcy
proceedings.
During the fiscal year, the commission moved, or supported others' motions,
for the appointment of committees to represent investors in six Chapter 11cases
involving about 90,000 investors. Committees were appointed in all but one of
these cases.
On proof of past mismanagement, the Commission successfully moved for
the appointment of a trustee to direct the reorganization of a debtor with $50
million of claims held by 6,000 investors. The Commission also supported successful motions to appoint a trustee in three other cases. The Commission
moved for the appointment of an examiner to investigate the debtor's affairs in
two cases; one motion was denied and the other is still pending.
During the past year, the Commission reviewed 22 disclosure statements for
plans in 16 cases, filing objections asserting that, without certain specified
amendments, the statements were either misleading or lacked sufficient information to enable a typical investor to make an informed judgment about the plan. In
virtually all instances the plan proponents corrected the deficiencies voluntarily or
after the Commission's objections were sustained by the court.
The Commission was also successful in its objection to full payments in applications for interim allowances filed by professionals.As a result of the Commission's efforts, courts have adhered to the longstanding policy of granting interim
allowances that were less than the full amount claimed. Generally the award was
limited to about 75% of the requested amount.
(After the end of the fiscal year the Commission reviewed its statutory responsibilities under the Bankruptcy Code and adopted a series of recommendations
made by Commissioner Bevis Longstreth after a lengthy study of the Commisions role in reorganization proceedings. A significant recommendation adopted
was the revocation of all delegated authority to the staff in this area and the
requirement that the Commission authorize all participation in and substantive
positions taken in such cases. The Commission transferred management of the
program from the Division of Corporate Regulation to the Office of the General
Counsel.
Although, the Commission voted to reorient its prioritres in appearing and

43

participating in Chapter 11cases involving public investor interest, many aspects
of the Commission's involvement in Chapter 11 cases will not be changed. The
new focus of the Commission's bankruptcy program rests on three major premises: First, so long as public security holders are adequately represented through
the committee process, there is less need for day-to-day Commission participation in reorganization cases; second, the Commission should work even more
closely with United States Trustees and should support expansion of the United
States Trustee pilot program: and third, the Commission should exercise caution
to avoid partisan involvement in negotiations for a plan to reorganize the company.Based on these conclusions, the Commission determined that, as a general
matter, the focus of its participation in Chapter 11cases should principally be on
legal and policy issues which are of concern to public investors generally and
which may have an impact beyond the facts of the particular case. By so concentrating its efforts the Commission will be better able to participate in those
Chapter 11 cases entailing significant investor Interest. The Commission will, of
course, continue to address matters of traditional Commission expertise and
interest relating to securities-for example, by commenting, where appropriate,
on the adequacy of reorganization plan disclosure statements and by participating where there is a Commission law enforcement interest. In addition, where
special circumstances warrant, the Commission may participate on matters
which do not meet these criteria.
The Commission will be participating in Chapter 11 cases in support of the
formation of security holder committees in order to ensure that public investors
are adequately represented and will be monitoring cases having significant public
investor interest in order to identify issues of Commission concern.)

Public Qtility Holding Companies
Composition
Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 (Holding Company Act),
the Commission regulates interstate public utility holding company systems in
the electric utility business or in the retail distribution of gas. The Commission's
jurisdiction also covers natural gas pipeline companies and non utility companies
within a registered holding company system.
There are presently 13 holding companies registered with the Commission. As
of June 30, 1983, their total assets were $66.1 brllion, representing an Increase of
$3.1 billion over the previous 12 month period. Total operating revenues, as of
June 30, 1983, were $31.3 billion, a $1.3 billion increase over the previous year. In
the 13 systems, there are 66 electric and/or gas utility subsidiaries, 65 non utility
subsidiaries and 19 inactive companies, for a total of 163 system companies
(including the parent companies but excluding 7 power supply company subsidiaries). Table 32 in the Appendix lists the systems and Table 33 lists their aggregate assets and operating revenues.
Proposed Legislation
Two bills proposing modifications of the Holding Company Act were introduced in the 98th Congress. The bills would create additional exemptions from
the Act, permit diversification of registered holding companies into non-functionally related businesses, and change the standards under which financings are
approved. The Commission has testified in favor of the legislation.
Financing
During fiscal year 1983, the Commission approved approximately $4.5 billion
of senior securities and common stock financing for the 13 registered holding
company systems. Of this amount, approximately $3.9 billion was long-term debt
financing, $5.1 billion was short-term debt financing and $421 million was pollution control financing. The short-term debt amounted to approximately 17 percent more than the authorized amount in fiscal year 1982. Table 34 in the
Appendix presents the amount and types of securities issued by the holding
company systems under the Holding Company Act.
On September 2,1982, the Commission authorized securities issuers to adopt
alternative procedures, other than those prescribed in Rule 50(b) of the Holding
Company Act, to develop and procure two or more competitive offers for securities. This step was taken in conjunction with the extension of Rule 415 under
the Securities Act of 1933 and applies only to offers which have been authorized
for sale by the Commission under Sections 6 and 7 of the Holding Company Act.

45

During fiscal year 1983, the following companies filed applications for approval
to sell preferred stock with an adjustable dividend rate: New England Power
Company, 112 Central Power and Light Company.'!" West Texas Utilities Company,1I4 The Connecticut Light and Power Company (CL&P),115 and Mississippi
Power & Light Company. 116 The basic terms of the security were similar in each
case. The dividend rate for the initial dividend period is a fixed percentage.
Thereafter, the rate is adjustable each dividend period and is determined on the
basis of a certain percentage above or below a variable index. Typically, there is a
predetermined maximum and minimum percentage rate limit on the variable
rate with a maximum permissible spread of 500 basis points between such limits.
The Commission authorized Georgia Power Company'!" and the CL&p,1I8
utility subsidiaries of registered holding company systems, to organize new,
wholly-owned financing subsidiaries to borrow for the utilities in the Eurodollar
market. The financing subsidiaries will be organized in the Netherlands Antilles.
Their purpose is to take advantage of alternatives and cost savings in the Eurodollar market which may be unavailable in the domestic market. In the case of
CL&P, the financing subsidiary has been authorized to sell intermediate term
debentures and to make the proceeds available to the utility.
The Commission also authorized CL&P to negotiate an interest rate swap.U?
This is a type of hedging agreement for the purpose of effectively converting
variable rate debt into flxed rate debt. Under such an agreement, CL&P, which has
variable rate debt, would be contractually obligated to make fixed rate payments
to a financial institution. The financial institution would, in turn, make variable rate
payments to CL&P.
Nonutility Subsidiary Matters
The Commission authorized Central and South West Corporation (CSW) to
organize and finance a new, nonutility subsidiary.'<? The primary business of the
subsidiary will be to invest and participate in qualifying cogeneration facilities and
in small power production facilities, as defined by the Public UtIlity Regulatory
Policies Act of 1978. Cogeneration is a form of power production in which both
usable heat, usually in the form of steam, and electricity are produced in the
same process. CSW intends to commit up to $50 million toward the activities of
the new subsidiary which will invest with nonaffiliated companies, directly and
indirectly, in cogeneration projects located in the CSW system service area. Sales
of electric power from any project will be made to CSW system companies or to
nonaffiliated, non utility companies.
Fuel Programs and Service Companies
During fiscal year 1983, the Commission authorized over $823.4 million for
fuel exploration and development activities of the holding company systems.
Since 1971, the Commission has authorized over $6.6 billion for such expenditures (see Tables 36 and 37 in the Appendix to this Report).
At the end of calendar year 1982, there were 12 subsidiary service companies
providing managerial, accounting, administrative and engineering service to 11of

46

the 13 holding companies registered under the Holding Company Act. The billings for these services amounted to $1.073 billion or 3.49 percent of the total
revenues generated by the electric and gas operating utilities. The subsidiary
service companies are heavily labor-intensive, employing over 16,790 people, and
have assets of over $474 million. Table 35 in the Appendix lists the subsidiary
service companies along with the total billings, total assets,total personnel, and
number of operating utility companies served.
The Commission's examination of service company and fuel procurement
activities has resulted in savings to consumers during the fiscal year of approximately $12.3 million.

Management, Economic Analysis and
Program Support
Key Management and Program Developments
The Commission's effectiveness has been due in part to its flexibility and
innovation in the face of a changing operating environment. In this tradition, fiscal
1983 was marked by a number of significant initiatives to improve the management, operational efficiency, and analytical resources of the Commission, The
Commission took steps to upgrade its computer and data processing capabilities, Increased emphasis was placed upon economic analysis and statistical
research.
The most noteworthy management initiative was the Productivity Innovation by
Computer (PIC) effort. PIC is a comprehensive, five-year program that will implement a full range of technological applications to increase productivity in the
Commission's regulation, enforcement and management functions.
Despite government-wide budgetary restraints and unprecedented growth and
change in the securities markets, PIC will improve the Commission's productivity.
The Commission plans to commence a pilot electronic filing, processing and
information dissemination system in 1984. The objective is to automate registration and reporting by public companies and regulated entities and to make such
information instantly accessible to investors and securities analysts on home and
office computer screens. Industrywide application is intended to coordinate with
the growth of home computers from 5 million today to over 50 million within five
years. The first steps were in fiscal 1983. A staff task force has been formed and
the Commission has let a contract to the MITRE Corporation to perform the
technical requirements analysis. Optical scanning equipment is being tested and
pilot operations are being planned within the Divtsion of Corporation Finance
(see p. 13).
The PIC initiative also involves efforts to improve and consolidate the Commission's existing management and analytical systems. A number of the Commissions support offices were modernized in 1983.
The Office of the Executive Director conducted management reviews in support of the Division of Investment Management and the New York Regional Office.
The recommendations implemented are designed to improve managerial effectiveness and increase productivity. Management reviews of the Office of the General Counsel and the Administrative Law Judges are scheduled for completion
early in fiscal 1984.
The Office of the Executive Director also performed a cost/benefit analysis of
the Market Oversight and Surveillance System, an assessment of the Commission's fee structure, and an evaluation of staff productivity.
In October 1982, the Commission sponsored a conference on major issues
confronting the nation's financial institutions and markets in the 1980s. The con-

49

ference was attended by over 500 business and government leaders. Some of the
recommendations have been implemented and others are in process.
Two members of the Commission's corps of senior executives were honored
with Presidential rank awards. Lee B. Spencer, Director of the Division of Corporation Finance, was designated the rank of Distinguished Executive, the highest
award given to a Federal employee. Robert H. Davenport, Regional Administrator
of the Denver Regional Office, was awarded the rank of Meritorious Executive.
Economic Research and Statistics
The economic research and statIstics program provides an objective perspective of the Commission's regulatory activities. This task is carried out by the Office
of the Chief Economist and the Directorate of Economic and Policy Analysis.
The program provides the Commission with economic advice and research
studies on rule proposals, established policy and the capital markets. In addition,
it encompasses statistical monitoring and publication of the SEC's Monthly Statistical Review.
To the extent practical, cost-benefit analyses are intended to ensure that
the Commission's rules and regulations are cost effective. The Commission is
committed to reducinq regulatory burdens in a manner consistent with investor
protection.
The rapid erosion of boundaries between segments of the financial service
industry, and the dramatic increase in new financial products and services have
increased the need to assess and respond to changing economic and market
conditions.
Economic research projects completed during fiscal 1983 include: the shelf
registration rule, linkage of exchange and over-the-counter securities trading,
revision of broker-dealer net capital requirements, and aspects of tender offers.
The staff analyzed the impact of the temporary shelf registration rule on issuers'
interest and underwriting expenses, identifying substantial savings which were a
factor in the Commission's decision to adopt a revised rule on a permanent basis.
The effects of over-the-counter trading in exchange listed securities (under
Rule 19c-3) were carefully monitored. These studies indicated that linkage neither
improved nor hurt the market in these securities, which was a factor in the
Commission's decision to defer action on an order exposure rule.
Studies of the effects of updating broker-dealer net capital requirements disclosed that over $500 million of the industry's capital had been freed up for more
productive employment for the benefit of investors and issuers. This additional
capital facilitated the industry's ability to handle the significant increase in the
volume of trading and financings in fiscal 1983.
During the fiscal year the Commission published a Staff Report on the Securities Industry. The report provides a comprehensive analysis of the financial
condition of 2,500 NASD and exchange members which conducted a public
business as broker-dealers. The following are a few of the report's highlights:
• The 10 largest investment banking houses were the outstanding clearing and
carrying firms during 1981;their pre-tax income increased by 36% to over $870

50

million.
• Pre-tax income of the 11 national full line broker-dealers fell 28% from a
record level of $798 million the previous year.
• Interest revenues from margin lending, U.S. government securities trading,
and repurchase agreements increased but did not offset declines in commission
revenue, commodities revenue, and gainS from trading equities and options.
An analysis of the growth of output and productivity in the U.S. and Japanese
manufacturing sectors demonstrated that capital formation is the main determinant of differences in rates of growth and output per worker-hour in these two
countries.
In recent years, the U.S. has experienced a significant increase in the number
and size of tender offers. One of the most widely publicized corporate takeover
contests involved the Bendix Corporation, Martin Marietta Corporation, United
Technologies Corporation and Allied Corporation. A detailed analysis of the effects of this contest upon the shareholders of the four companies concluded that
they were not adversely affected.
During fiscal 1983 advice was given to the operating divisions on the requirements of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, particularly, the economic effects of proposed rules and alternatives for reducing regulatory burdens on small business
entities.
Information

Systems Management

Under the PIC initiative, a number of automated systems have been implemented that have resulted in immediate cost savings and improved internal
controls. During fiscal 1983, the use of microcomputers was expanded to each of
the regional offices and nearly 800 staff members were trained in the usage of
these machines. Using this capability, a computerized data base for broker-dealer
customer accounts was compiled. The availability of these data will aid in expediting broker-dealer examinations and enforcement investigations. Software was
also developed which will enable the Commission to maintain up-to-date registration data on broker-dealers. This system will for the first time provide on-line
access to registration data and will eventually be expanded to include investment
companies and advisers, municipal securities dealers, and transfer agents.
The Commission further improved its internal computing capability with the
creation of the User Support Information Center (USIC).The objective of the USIC
is to provide the professional staff with greater access to automatic data processing facilities. The USIC is being utilized to improve selective review of disclosure
documents, index enforcement case information, track FOlA and Privacy Act
requests, and perform stock transaction analyses. The USIC has become an
important factor in the overall effort to increase the Commission's productivity.
The Commission significantly improved its market surveillance capability by
replacing inefficient contractor-provided services with improved in-house procedures. The staff now retrieves trading information directly from the Securities
Industry Automation Corporation (SlAC), rather than through an intermediate
contractor. In addition, staff developed software provides an internal price history

51

service and eliminates the need for contractual services.These two modifications
are saving the agency $170,000 per annum.
The growing volume of corporate mergers and acquisitions has increased
public demand for the prompt access to tender offer filings. The Commission is
responding to this demand by developing an on-line information system, designed to provide the public rapid access to such filings.
During fiscal 1983, the Commission's automated employee payroll system was
also modified to permit on-line revision of employee status records and direct
interaction with the Commission's personnel management system. An automated property accountability system was implemented which provides a comprehensive inventory of all agency property and interfaces with the Commission's
automated financial accounting systems. This system has improved the Comrnissrons equipment utilization.

Financial Management
During fiscal 1983, the Commission collected a record $98,6 million in fees
for deposit into the General Fund of the Treasury. Such fees amounted to
nearly 110% of the Commission's fiscal 1983 appropriation, compared with 94%
in fiscal 1982. The four sources of fees were: registration of securities under the
Securities Act of 1933 (68%), transactions on securities exchanges (24%), miscellaneous filings and reporting fees (7% ),and the registration of regulated brokerdealers (l %).
The staff processed nearly 34,000 fee checks from filers. For the first time,
microcomputers were used to assist in this labor-intensive effort. The use of
microcomputers to process employee travel vouchers also eliminated time-consuming manual review of agency travel files. These innovations have improved
the accuracy and control of financial operations.
Under a government-wide cash management initiative, the Commission obtained Department of the Treasury approval to conduct fee transactions via electronic funds transfer systems. This will save $35,000 annually in interest that
would otherwise be expended by the Federal government, due to delayed payment of fees. The recently enacted Prompt Payment Act requires Federal agencies to make timely disbursements to private vendors in order to avoid interest
penalties. During fiscal 1983, the Commission did not incur any interest penalties.
Over the past year,the Commission executed six major employee compensation adjustments: the July 1st Federal tax reduction, the executive pay cap raise,
the Medicare tax adjustment, the military buy-back program, the October cost-ofliving adjustment, and health benefit modifications by 30 percent of all Commission employees. To accommodate these adjustments, the Commission significantly expanded the data processing and storage capabilities of its automated
payroll system.

Facilities Management
Fiscal 1983 was the Commission's first full year in its consolidated headquarters buildinq. Adapting the new building to the Commission's needs required the

52

installation of electronic security devices to safeguard sensitive data, the development of more efficient evacuation procedures, improvement of the building's
accessibility for handicapped persons, and tagging all Commission property for
identification purposes.
Greater administrative support was also provided to the regional offices. The
headquarter staff performed seven on-site assessments of regional facilities, and
the Los Angeles Regional and Detroit Branch Offices were relocated.
As part of a government-wide space reduction initiative, the Commission took
steps to reduce space allocations to 135 square feet per employee. A study of the
agency's space requirements produced a plan to comply with GSA space management directives.
Some routine support functions can be performed less expensively by private
contractors than in-house. During the past year, contracts were negotiated with
private firms for transportation, specialty printing, key-punching and other data
processing tasks. An estimated $200,000 in annual savings was realized as a
result of these contracts. The Commission also renegotiated its nationwide stenographic service contract.
The productivity of the Commission's administrative personnel increased significantly dunnq fiscal year 1983, Despite a reduction in staffing, the printing plant
achieved a 10% increase in production over 1982. In addition, the staff handled
nearly two million pieces of mall in 1983, a 21% increase over 1982.
Personnel Management
The Commission had 1,922 total employee staff-years in fiscal 1983. This
compared to 1,881 and 1,982 in fiscal 1982 and 1981, respectively.
Personnel actions and training decisions are evaluated in terms of their impact
on staff productivity. During fiscal 1983, the Commission conducted 193 employee classification reviews; processed over 7,000 personnel actions; and issued
final regulations for its merit pay and performance appraisal system and temporary regulations governing in-grade pay increases for non-merit pay employees.
Fiscal 1983 saw the completion of the first agency-wide merit employee appraisal cycle. A study conducted by an independent consultant determined that
while the Commission's procedures were in compliance with the standards of the
Civil Service Reform Act, managers were in need of greater instruction in the
implementation of the Act's employee appraisal procedures. A managerial training program was therefore established.
The Commission conducted personnel management evaluations of seven of
its regional offices to determine the extent of compliance with Office of Personnel
Management and internal personnel policies. Regional practices were modified
in order to achieve agency-wide uniformity in the administration of personnel
policies.
During fiscal 1983, employee assistance services provided included seminars
to assist employees in selecting health care plans and to advise prospective
retirees of modifications in the Federal Retirement System.
The Commission's commitment to affirmative action led to creation of a minority recruitment program for undergraduates in the fields of business or finance at

53

Howard University.The objective is to place students in permanent careers within
the Commission upon completion of their undergraduate studies. The Commission continued its handicapped employment efforts by tailoring a program to the
needs of disabled veterans.
Public Affairs
Efficient dissemination of information about Commission activities is essential
to the effective enforcement of the securities laws. In fiscal 1983, an estimated
640 articles on Commission enforcement actions, new and revised rules and
regulations and other topics were published and circulated to 700 million readers.
In addition to media coverage, the Office of Public Affairs works closely with the
Commission's major divisions on major projects.
OPA was one of the three offices principally responsible for the Commission's
second Major Issues Conference. This proved to be an extremely successful
event, attracting some 500 leaders of the financial services industry, the private
bar and the accounting profession. The "Proceedings" of the conference were
published and made available to the public.
OPA provided public relations support for the work of the Advisory Committee
on Tender Offers and the SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business;
arranged a seminar on the Commission during the annual meeting of the Society
of American Business and Economic Writers; and produced an updated version
of the Commission's audiovisual program, "Eagle on the Street." Distribution
began during 1983 of "What Every Investor Should Know," a handbook for new
investors that represents the most ambitious effort in this area ever undertaken by
the Commission. Its publication coincided with the beginning of the dramatic
Increase in securities transactions and prices, which has attracted into the market
millions of first-time investors. Free distribution of the first 25,000 copies was
underwritten by the White House Office of Consumer Affairs. Subsequent distribution has been at a price of $4.50 per copy. In July, the Consumer Information
Center operated by the General Services Administration reported that the handbook was its fourth-ranked sale publication.
Consumer Affairs and Information Services
The resurgence in the securities markets was reflected in the workload of the
Commission's consumer affairs program. Investor inquiries and complaints increased 37% to 26,000 in fiscal 1983. Of the complaints, 45% involved investor
conflicts with registered broker-dealers, 27% concerned issuers of securities, and
8% pertained to mutual funds. The remaining complaints were related to transfer
agents, banks and investment advisers. At the same time, the Public Reference
room received 172,000 inquiries, an increase of 23% over 1982.
The Commission also processed 1,424 Freedom of Information Act and 55
Privacy Act requests. In addition, there were 1,392 requests for confidential treatment in connection with documents filed with the Commission, a 48% increase
over 1982. Each of these requests was carefully evaluated, consistent with the
policy of preventing indiscriminate and unwarranted release of information ex-

54

empt from the Freedom of Information Act. During 1983, the Commission also
conducted a training conference for complaint specialists from headquarters and
the regional offices to increase agency-wide uniformity in processing consumer
matters.

Equal Employment Opportunity
During 1983, the number of women at the Senior Executive Service (SES) level
increased from two to seven. Women now represent 15.2% of the Commission's
SES employees. In addition, despite recent staffing constraints, the Commission
has made steady improvement in the overall number of minorities employed.
Minorities represented 27.6% of the Commission's work force In 1983, as compared with 23.8% in 1979.
In conjunction with the Securities Industry Committee on Equal Employment
Opportunity, the Commission continued its support of the achievement scholarship program for outstanding minority students pursuing careers in the securities
industry. During 1983, scholarships were awarded to seven deserving students.
The program's first recipient of a four-year scholarship was graduated from Harvard University in 1983.
More than 100 of the Commission's senior managers and supervisors attended
one-day equal employment training courses this year. These courses provide
Instruction on equal opportunity laws and regulations, affirmative action guidelines, methods of improving employment opportunities for minorities and
women, and techniques for preventing discrimination and sexual harassment.
Observations were conducted in honor of Hispanic Heritage Week, AfroAmerican History Month, Asian-Pacific Heritage Week and the birthdate of Dr.
Martin Luther King, Jr.

Securities Industry Dollar In
1982 For Carrying and Clearing
Firms
Data for carrYing and clearing firms
only are presented here to allow for more
detail, as reporting requirements for iniroducinq and carrying and clearing firms
differ and data aggregation of these two
types of firms necessarily results in loss of
detail. Carrying and clearing firms are
those firms which clear securities transacnons or maintain possession or control of
customers' cash or securities. The 87 percent of industry revenues earned by carrying and cleannq firms in 1982 suggests
that this group IS a suitable proxy for the
Industry.
Securities cornrrussions and trading
gains accounted for 24 cents and 28
cents, respectively, of each revenue dollar
In 1982. Together these two items accounted for 52 cents of each revenue dollar earned in 1982 as compared to 49
cents In 1981. In terms of dollars, they accounted for $13.1 billion of the $25.4 billion of total revenues earned by carrying
and clearing firms. Margin interest income
declined to account for 8 cents of each
revenue dollar in 1982 compared with 14
cents In 1981.
Total expenses consumed 86 cents of
each revenue dollar earned in 1982, a decrease over the 1981 level of 89 cents. The
industry's pre-tax profit margin increased
to 14 cents per revenue dollar In 1982 from
11cents In 1981.
Interest expense, again the Single largest
expense item, in 1982 rose by less than
one percent to absorb 24 cents of each

revenue dollar, which compares to 29
cents in 1981. In dollars, interest expense
grew only slightly to $6,184 million in 1982
from $6,176 In 1981.Employee-related expenses (registered representatives' compensation and clerical and adrnimstrauve
employees' expenses) consumed 34 cents
of the revenue dollar In 1982, one cent
above the 33 cent level In 1981.RegIstered
representatives' compensation while increasing by 22 percent over the 1982 level,
absorbed 18 cents of each revenue dollar
In 1982 as it did the previous year In dollar
terms, employee-related expenses accounted for $8,593 million of the $21,938
of total expenses.
The "NI Other Expense" category,
which includes promotional costs, regulatory fees and expenses and miscellaneous
items, consumed 11cents of each revenue
dollar, compared to 10 cents In 1981.
Total assets of broker-dealers carrymq
and clearing customer accounts rose by
$42 4 billion to $179 1 billion In 1982.
About 91 percent of this increase in assets
can be attributed to four Items: long pOSItions WIth $19.7 billion, receivables from
other broker-dealers WIth $9.4 billion, resale agreements With $6.0 billion and $3.4
billion for receivables from customers.
Total liabilities, including subordinated
debts moved up $397 bilhon or 31 percent to $168.5 bilhon with Increases in repurchase agreements of $12.8 bilhon and
short positions in securities of $10.3 billion. Owners' equity rose 33 percent from
$8.0 billion in 1981 to $10.6 billion and
total capital increased 32 percent to $12.6
billion from $9.6 billion in 1981.

Self Regulatory Organizations:
Revenues, Expenses, Pre-Tax
Income and Balance Sheet
Structure
In 1982 the aggregate total revenue of
self-regulatory orqanizanons ("SROs")
reached $404.0 million, representing an
Increase of 8.5% since 1981 NYSE, Amex,
and NASD account for 69.9% of the aggregate total revenue. Most of the revenue
accrued was generated by various types of
fees, including fees for branch offices and
for listing fees. NYSE reported a total revenue fiqure of $169.0 million of which approximately 568% was made up of listing
and trading fees. NASD reported a total
revenue figure of $54.7 million. Over
56.8% of this figure was derived from listIng and trading fees. Approximately 8.3%
of the aggregate revenues was pre-tax income.
Aggregate total expenses for all SROs by
1982 were $370.3 million, an Increase of
9.5% over 1981. NASD reported total expenses as $51.3 million, representing an
increase of 25.9% over the previous year.
Salaries and employees benefits made up
52.4% of the total NASD expenses.
The aggregate pre-tax income figure of
all SROs declined by 1.7% from the previous year. NYSE reported total pre-tax income of $15.9 million, an increase of
68.9% from the previous year The pre-tax
income for Amex decreased from 1981 by
29.4%, for CBOE by 46.5% and for the
NASD by 44.8%.
The aggregate total asset figure for 1982
was $662.1 million, an increase of 5.2%
over 1981 NYSE's share of the aggregate
total assets was $190.9 million, an Increase
of 15.8% since 1981. BSE's asset figure
declined from $21.3 million in 1981 to
$17.2 million in 1982, a decrease of 18.9%.
MSE's figure also declined from $110.4
million in 1981 to $95.7 million In 1982, a
decrease of 13.3%. For the past two years
total assets for PSE have exceeded those
of the NYSE. This difference occurs because of the manner in which the two

firms report clearing funds and depository
transactions.
The aggregate net worth rose to $258.8
million from $235.5 million In 1981, an increase of 9.9%. Phlx, Amex and NASD reported the largest percentage Increases in
net worth over 1981 figures. Phlx posted
the largest Increase of the three exchanges, 32.0% since 1981.
Aggregate clearing agency revenues for
1982 increased by approximately $13 million over 1981 due, in most part, to the
substantial increase in equity securities
trading volume experienced late In the
year.Revenuesfrom depository services of
the Depository Trust Company ("DTC"')
alone Increased $13 million. While much
of the rise in DTC's revenues IS due to increased equity trading, a sigmficant portion resulted from additional participants.
The number of DTC participants increased by 81 In 1982 for a total of 455 and
the number of shares on deposn Increased
from 19 billion to 26.7 billion.
The Options Clearing Corporation
("OCC"') results are only reported for a SIX
month period due to a change In their year
end. The SIX month results approximated
half the previous year's results because
OCC relates most of its profits, effectively
reducmq its fees to a level that covers its
expenses. Had OCC results for a full year
been presented, aggregate clearing
agency revenues and expenses each
would have been approximately $5 million
higher.
Aggregate clearing agency expenses increased $13 million during 1982. Of this
increase, $9 million IS attributable to additional employee costs incurred by DTC.
Higher labor costs were the result of personnel resources needed to handle DTC's
increased volume as described above.
Additional electronic data processing
expenditures accounted for another $6
million of the Increase In aggregate clearing agency expenses. Of this increase, $4
million and $2 million was incurred by the
National Securities Clearing Corporation
and DTC respectively

Exemptions For Foreign Private
Issuers
Rule 12g3-2 provides various exemptions from the registration provisions of
Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act for the
securities of foreign private issuers Perhaps the most Important of these IS that
contained m subparagraph (b) which provides an exemption for certain foreign ISsuers which submit on a current baSIS
material specified m the rule. Such material includes that information about which
investors ought reasonably to be informed
and which the issuer: (1) has made public
pursuant to the law of the country of domicile or in which it IS incorporated or orgamzed; (2) has filed with a foreign stock ex-

change on which Its securities are traded
and which was made public by such exchange; and or (3) has distnbuted to Its

exemptive provrsion The most current list
is as of October 5, 1983 and contains a
total of 445 foreign issuers.

Rule 10b-6 Exemptions
Exchange Act Rule lOb-6 is an antimanipulative rule that prohibits tradmg in
securities by persons interested m a distnbution of such secunues. During the fiscal year,the Cornrrussion granted approximately 180 exemptions pursuant to paragraph (h) of Rule lOb-6 under circumstances indicating that proposed purchase
transactions did not appear to constitute
mampulatIve or deceptive devices or contnvances comprehended withm the purposes of the rule.

Securities Effectively Registered With S.E.C.

Purpose and Type of Registration
Effective registrations for cash sale for the
account of Issuers in fiscal year 1983
amounted to $179 billion, 56 percent
above the $115 bilhon registered a year
earher.Some $64 billion (36 percent) was
intended for immediate offerings, an increase of $2 bilhon (3 percent) from fiscal
1982. Nearly all of this amount consisted
of secunties registered by business to be
offered to the general public. Such registrations totalled $63 billion, an Increase of
$3 bilhon (5 percent).
Of this $63 bilhon debt secunties accounted for $22 billion (or 35 percent of
this total), preferred stock $6 billion (10
percent) and common stock $35 billion
(55 percent). Cash nqhts offennqs (offerings to security holders) came to $211rrulhon, a decline of 61 percent from the $543
million of such offermqs in the previous
year Immediate cash offerings by foreign
governments in fiscal year 1983 totalled $1
bilhon, approximately the same volume as
in 1982.
Delayed and extended cash sales registered for the account of the Issuer totalled
$115billion (45 percent of all registrations).
Registrations pursuant to Rule 415, (or socalled "shelf' registrations) amounted to
$57 billion, or 50 percent of this amount
Secunties registered for the account of ISsuers other than for cash sale (in conjunc-

non with exchange offers, for example)
amounted to $65 bilhon In 1983, or 25
percent of all registrations. Registrations
of securities for secondary offenngs (for
the account of secunty holders rather than
issuers) amounted to $11 billion (4 percent) of all registrations in fiscal year 1983.
Of these latter registrations, $5 bilhon (45
percent) were for cash sale and $6 bilhon
(55 percent) were for other secondary
offerings.
The value of registrations aggregating
$256 billion in fiscal year 1983 consisted
of $91 bilhon In bonds, debentures and
notes, $15 bilhon In preferred stock and
$150 billion In common stock Of the $91
bilhon of debt secuntres registered, 24 percent ($22 billion) were registered for Immediate cash sale to the general pubhc for
the account of the Issuer Delayed and extended cash sales accounted for $63 bilhon (69 percent) Fifty-eight percent of the
$15 bilhon in preferred stock registrations
consisted of immediate cash offerings,
while non-cash registrations for account of
the Issuer comprised 37 percent of the
total. The $150 billIon In cash common
stock volume consisted of $35 bilhon in
Immediate cash sales, $49 bilhon In delayed or extended cash sales, $56 btlhon of
non-cash registrations for the account
of the Issuer and $10 billion of secondary
offenngs.

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table reflects, the securities laws
provide for a wide range of enforcement
actions by the Commission. The most
common types of actions are injunctive
proceedings Instituted in the Federal dIStrict courts to enjoin continued or threat-

106

ened secunties law violators, and administrative proceedings pertaining to brokerdealer firms and/or individuals associated
with such firms which may lead to venous
remedial sanctions as required in the pubhe Interest. When an injunction is entered
by a court, violation of the court's decree is
a basis for cnminal contempt against the
VIolator.

cause of substantial questions as to the
adequacy. accuracy or availability of public
information concerning the company's financial condition or business operations,
or because transactions in the company's
secunties suggested possible manipulation or other violations.

Foreign Restricted List
The Commission maintains and pubhshes a Foreign Restncted LIst which is
designed to put broker-dealers, financial
insntutions, investors and others on notice
of possible unlawful distributions of foreiqn securities in the United States. The hst
consists of names of foreign companies
whose securities the Commission has reason to believe have been, or are bemg offered for pubhc sale in the United States in
possible violation of the registration requirernent of Section 5 of the Securities
Act of 1933. The offer and sale of unregistered securities deprives Investors of all
the protections afforded by the Securities
Act of 1933, mcluding the right to receive a
prospectus containing the Information required by the Act for the purpose of enablIng the investor to determine whether the
mvestrnent is suitable for him. While most
broker-dealers refuse to effect transactions
in securities Issued by companies on the
Foreign Restricted List, tlus does not neeessanly prevent promoters from illegally
offering such securities directly to investors in the Umted States by mail, by telephone, and sometimes by personal sohcitation. The following foreign corporations
