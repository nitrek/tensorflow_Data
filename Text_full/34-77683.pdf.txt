ORDER DENYING MOTION TO LIFT TEMPORARY SUSPENSION
AND DIRECTING THAT A HEARING BE HELD
On February 25, 2016, we instituted administrative proceedings against Timothy
Quintanilla, CPA, under Commission Rule of Practice 102(e)(3)(i)(A),1 and temporarily
suspended him from appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant (the
“Order”), based on his having been enjoined from violating antifraud and related provisions of
the federal securities laws.2 Quintanilla now requests that we lift that suspension for 30 days to
give him time to “wind up his public audit practice . . . .” For the reasons discussed below, we
deny Quintanilla’s request. We will leave the temporary suspension in place and set the matter
down for a hearing before an administrative law judge in accordance with Rule of Practice
102(e)(3)(iii).3

17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(i)(A) (“The Commission, with due regard to the public interest
and without preliminary hearing, may, by order, temporarily suspend from appearing or
practicing before it any . . . accountant . . . who has been by name . . . permanently enjoined by
any court of competent jurisdiction, by reason of his or her misconduct in an action brought by
the Commission, from violating or aiding and abetting the violation of any provision of the
Federal securities laws or of the rules and regulations thereunder.”).

I.

Facts

In November 2012, we brought a civil action against Quintanilla alleging that he violated
the securities laws by misrepresenting that the 2006 through 2008 financial statements of
Electronic Game Card, Inc. (“EGMI”) were audited in accordance with Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (“PCAOB”) standards, and that those statements “present[ed]
fairly, in all material respects,” EGMI’s financial position.4 The civil complaint alleged that
Quintanilla and his audit team failed to investigate red flags that would have uncovered fraud in
EGMI’s financial statements, and that they failed to audit significant portions of EGMI’s balance
sheet.5 The complaint further alleged that, to conceal their audit failures, employees under
Quintanilla’s supervision created and backdated documents for the EGMI audit file shortly
before a PCAOB inspection.6
On December 4, 2015, Quintanilla consented to entry by the district court of a final
judgment permanently enjoining him from future violations of Sections 10(b), 10A(a)(1), and
10A(b)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and
Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933.7 Based on that injunction, we issued the Order
temporarily suspending Quintanilla, and ordered that the temporary suspension become
permanent unless Quintanilla filed a petition to lift it within 30 days after service of the Order.
The Order further provided that, if Quintanilla filed such a petition, we would “either lift the
temporary suspension, or set the matter down for hearing . . . or both.”8
On March 25, 2016, Quintanilla filed a petition to lift his temporary suspension.
Quintanilla does not challenge our authority to impose the temporary suspension and states that,
when he consented to the injunction, he “understood that the SEC would subsequently seek a
permanent bar . . . which was agreed to during settlement discussions.” Rather, Quintanilla
requests that we lift the temporary suspension for 30 days so that his “issuer client can file [its]
quarterly report on Form 10-Q which work [Quintanilla] began performing prior to receiving the
Order.” After the 30 day period, Quintanilla states that “the Commission may enter a permanent
bar against” him. The Division of Enforcement opposes Quintanilla’s petition asserting, among
other things, that Quintanilla’s conduct involved egregious fraud over a three year period and
that he has offered no “evidence recognizing his wrongdoing” or “any assurances against future
violations.”

Discussion

Rule 102(e)(3)(iii) provides that, upon receipt of a timely petition to lift a temporary
suspension, “the Commission shall either lift the temporary suspension, or set the matter down
for hearing at a time and place designated by the Commission, or both, and, after opportunity for
hearing, may censure the petitioner or disqualify the petitioner from appearing or practicing
before the Commission for a period of time or permanently.”9 We have determined to deny
Quintanilla’s request to lift the temporary suspension for 30 days, and to instead set the matter
down for a hearing. In issuing the Order, we found it “appropriate and in the public interest” to
temporarily suspend Quintanilla because he had been permanently enjoined from violating the
federal securities laws. Quintanilla has provided no reason to question that conclusion.
Instead, Quintanilla contends that, when he consented to the injunction in district court,
he was not advised that the Commission would issue a temporary suspension, and understood
that he “would have time to wind up his public audit practice and would receive notice when the
Commission initiated its permanent bar proceedings.” But Quintanilla, who continues to be
represented by the same counsel who represented him in the district court action,10 does not
explain the basis for his understanding, and, in any event, he was on notice of the Rule 102(e)(3)
procedures that we follow in imposing the temporary suspension. Those procedures contemplate
entry of a temporary suspension under Rule 102(e)(3)(i) within 90 days of the entry of final
judgment.11 Quintanilla’s asserted reason for lifting the suspension is to provide him time to
review an issuer’s 10-Q filing; in light of the serious allegations in the civil complaint and his
consent to a final judgment in that proceeding, it would be inappropriate to permit him to do so.12
Other than stating that he worked on this filing prior to the Order’s entry, he provides no
assurances or evidence that his demonstrated inability to properly comply with the securities
laws would not impact this issuer or other clients in the remainder of his public audit practice.

See 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3) (“No order of temporary suspension shall be entered by the
Commission pursuant to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of this rule more than 90 days after the date on
which the final judgment or order entered in a judicial or administrative proceeding described in
paragraph (e)(3)(i)(A) or (e)(3)(i)(B) has become effective . . . .”). We temporarily suspended
Quintanilla 83 days after the final judgment.
12

In its opposition to Quintanilla’s motion, the Division “respectfully submits that the
Commission should . . . issue an order permanently barring him from appearing or practicing
before the Commission.” Our rules, however, do not contemplate the imposition of such
sanction at this stage, before a hearing has been held and a decision by a law judge issued. See
Rule 102(e)(3)(iii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.102(e)(3)(iii). We do not mean to suggest any view as to the
outcome of this proceeding.

4
Inconvenience to his ability to wind down his audit practice does not change our view that a
temporary suspension remains in the public interest.13
Accordingly, IT IS ORDERED that Timothy Quintanilla, CPA’s petition to lift the
temporary suspension is denied, and that the temporary suspension will remain in effect pending
a hearing and decision in this matter; it is further
ORDERED that this proceeding be set down for a public hearing before an administrative
law judge in accordance with Commission Rule of Practice 110. As specified in Rule of Practice
102(e)(3)(iii), the hearing shall be expedited in accordance with Rule of Practice 500; and it is
further
ORDERED that the administrative law judge shall file an initial decision no later than
210 days from the date of service of this order.
By the Commission.
