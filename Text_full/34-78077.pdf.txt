TODD B. KATZ,

ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER

Respondents.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that ceaseand-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against 2 West, Inc. (“2 West”), Mijust, Inc. (“Mijust”),
KAKids, Inc. (“KAKids”), Alton Partners, Inc. (“Alton Partners”), Old Farm, Inc. (“Old Farm”),
Bloomfield, Inc. (“Bloomfield”), Katz Imports, Inc. (“Katz Imports”), and Todd B. Katz (“Katz”)
(collectively, “Respondents”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondents have submitted Offers
of Settlement (the “Offers”), which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the findings
herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over them and the subject matter of these
proceedings, which are admitted, Respondents consent to the entry of this Order Instituting Ceaseand-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”), as set forth below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondents’ Offers, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
1.
These proceedings arise out of violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M under the
Exchange Act by Todd B. Katz, a Pennsylvania resident, and various unregistered entities
controlled by Katz and through which Katz conducted his securities trading. Rule 105 prohibits
selling short an equity security that is the subject of certain public offerings and purchasing the
offered security from an underwriter or broker or dealer participating in the offering, if such short
sale was effected during the restricted period as defined therein.
2.
From January 27, 2010 through November 10, 2014, Katz violated Rule 105 in
connection with 130 separate offerings, in each case by selling short shares of the issuer during the
restricted period, and then purchasing shares in those offerings. Katz directed the trading in
approximately 69 separate accounts. Some of the accounts were in his own name, but the majority
of the accounts were in the name of family members and in the name of entities he controlled and
through which he conducted his securities trading, specifically 2 West, Alton Partners, Bloomfield,
Katz Imports, KAKids, Mijust, and Old Farm.
3.
Katz is responsible for all of the trading that forms the basis of the Rule 105
violations. He conducted all of the short selling activity in the accounts in his own name and in the
accounts of 2 West, a Florida corporation co-owned by Katz. He used other accounts that he
controlled to purchase shares in the subject offerings.
4.

These violations collectively resulted in profits to Respondents of $1,275,985.

Legal Framework
13.
Rule 105 makes it unlawful for a person to purchase equity securities in certain
public offerings from an underwriter, broker, or dealer participating in the offering if that person
sold short the security that is the subject of the offering during the restricted period defined in the
rule, absent an exception. 17 C.F.R. § 242.105; see Short Selling in Connection with a Public
Offering, Rel. No. 34-56206, 72 Fed. Reg. 45094 (Aug. 10, 2007) (effective Oct. 9, 2007). The
Rule 105 restricted period is the shorter of the period: (1) beginning five business days before the
pricing of the offered securities and ending with such pricing; or (2) beginning with the initial
filing of a registration statement or notification on Form 1-A or Form 1-E and ending with the
pricing. 17 C.F.R. §§ 242.105(a)(1) and (a)(2).
14.
The Commission adopted Rule 105 “to foster secondary and follow-on offering
prices that are determined by independent market dynamics and not by potentially manipulative
activity.” 72 Fed. Reg. 45094. Rule 105 is prophylactic and prohibits the conduct irrespective of
the short seller’s intent in effecting the short sale. Id.
Respondents’ Violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M
15.
From January 27, 2010 to November 10, 2014, Katz, through accounts he
controlled, purchased offering shares in at least 130 separate offerings. In each instance, he also
sold short shares of the issuer prior to the pricing of the offering, during the Rule 105 restricted
period. The relevant trading took place across 69 distinct accounts at seven different brokerdealers.

16.
$1,275,985.
17.

As a result of these violations, Respondents received profits totaling approximately
The profits consisted of the following:

A.
First, Respondents improperly profited from the difference between the
proceeds from their improper restricted period short sales, and the amounts they paid on an
equivalent number of shares received in the offerings of the same issuer’s shares. These
unlawful profits totaled $684,873.
B.
Second, in those offerings where the number of shares they received in the
offerings exceeded the number of shares they sold short during the restricted period (also
known as the “overage”), Respondents improperly obtained an additional benefit in that they
obtained the offering shares at a discount to the market price of the issuer’s shares.
Respondents received benefits from their violative conduct in the form of market discounts
totaling $573,120.
C.
Third, Respondents improperly benefitted in certain offerings where the
offering price exceeded the price at which they had sold the stock short during the restricted
period. Because they purchased their offering shares at a discount to the market price, they
avoided losses in connection with these offerings in an amount that totaled $17,992.
18.
For example, on December 6, 2010, Respondents sold short 320,000 shares of
Citigroup Inc. (“C”), at an average price of $4.3969. Later that day, after the close of the market, a
follow-on offering of C was priced at $4.35. Respondents purchased a total of 2,055,600 shares in
the offering. The difference between Respondents’ proceeds from the restricted period short sales
of C shares and the amount Respondents paid for the equivalent number of shares purchased in the
offering was $15,008. Respondents obtained an additional improper benefit of $415,502.64 by
purchasing the remaining 1,735,600 offering shares at a discount to the market price of $4.5894.
19.
As another example, on October 25, 2011, Respondents sold short 10,000 shares of
GNC Holdings Inc. (“GNC”), at an average price of $24.4518. Later that day, after the close of the
market, a follow-on offering of GNC was priced at $24.75. Respondents purchased a total of
4,960 shares in the offering. Although the offering price exceeded the price at which the
Respondents had sold short the stock during the restricted period, Respondents received an
improper benefit in the amount of $346.20 by obtaining a number of shares equal to the number
the Respondents had sold short at a discount from the market price, which was $24.8198.
20.
As another example, on April 10, 2014, Respondents sold short 5,000 shares of
Arthur J. Gallagher & Co. (“AJG”) at an average price of $43.7960. Later that day, after the close
of the market, a follow-on offering of AJG was priced at $43.25. Respondents purchased 16,850
shares in the offering. The difference between Respondents’ proceeds from the restricted period
short sales of AJG shares and the amount Respondents paid for the equivalent number of shares
purchased in the offering was $2,730. Respondents obtained an additional improper benefit of
$8,887.50 by purchasing the remaining 11,850 offering shares at a discount to the market price of
$44.00.

21.
The 130 offerings in which Respondents violated Rule 105 are identified on Exhibit
A to this Order.
IV.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission deems it appropriate to impose the sanctions
agreed to in Respondents’ Offers.
Accordingly, it is hereby ORDERED that:
A. Pursuant to Section 21C of the Exchange Act, Respondents cease and desist from
committing or causing any violations and any future violations of Rule 105 of Regulation M of the
Exchange Act.
B. Respondents shall pay, jointly and severally, disgorgement of $1,275,985, prejudgment
interest of $42,062, and a civil money penalty of $707,132—for a total amount of $2,025,179—to
the Securities and Exchange Commission for transfer to the general fund of the United States
Treasury, subject to Exchange Act Section 21F(g)(3). If timely payment of disgorgement and
prejudgment interest is not made, additional interest shall accrue pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice
600. If timely payment is not made on the civil money penalty, additional interest shall accrue
pursuant to 31 U.S.C. §3717. Payment shall be made in the following installments:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.

$506,295 within 10 days of entry of this Order;
$379,721 within 90 days of entry of this Order;
$379,721 within 180 days of entry of this Order;
$379,721 within 270 days of entry of this Order; and
$379,721 within 360 days of entry of this Order.

If any payment is not made by the date the payment is required by this Order, the entire
outstanding balance of disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and civil penalties, plus any additional
interest accrued pursuant to SEC Rule of Practice 600 or pursuant to 31 U.S.C. 3717, shall be due
and payable immediately, without further application.
Payments must be made in one of the following ways:
(1) Respondents may transmit payment electronically to the Commission, which will
provide detailed ACH transfer/Fedwire instructions upon request;
(2) Respondents may make direct payment from a bank account via Pay.gov through the
SEC website at http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/ofm.htm; or
(3) Respondents may pay by certified check, bank cashier’s check, or United States postal
money order, made payable to the Securities and Exchange Commission and handdelivered or mailed to:

Enterprise Services Center
Accounts Receivable Branch
HQ Bldg., Room 181, AMZ-341
6500 South MacArthur Boulevard
Oklahoma City, OK 73169
Payments by check or money order must be accompanied by a cover letter identifying the
Respondents in these proceedings, and the file number of these proceedings; a copy of the cover
letter and check or money order must be sent to Gerald W. Hodgkins, Associate Director, Division
of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, N.E., Washington, DC
20549.
C. Amounts ordered to be paid as civil money penalties pursuant to this Order shall be
treated as penalties paid to the government for all purposes, including all tax purposes. To
preserve the deterrent effect of the civil penalty, Respondents agree that in any Related Investor
Action, they shall not argue that they are entitled to, nor shall they benefit by, offset or reduction of
any award of compensatory damages by the amount of any part of Respondents’ payment of a civil
penalty in this action (“Penalty Offset”). If the court in any Related Investor Action grants such a
Penalty Offset, Respondents agree that they shall, within 30 days after entry of a final order
granting the Penalty Offset, notify the Commission's counsel in this action and pay the amount of
the Penalty Offset to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Such a payment shall not be
deemed an additional civil penalty and shall not be deemed to change the amount of the civil
penalty imposed in this proceeding. For purposes of this paragraph, a “Related Investor Action”
means a private damages action brought against Respondents by or on behalf of one or more
investors based on substantially the same facts as alleged in the Order instituted by the
Commission in this proceeding.
V.
It is further Ordered that, solely for purposes of exceptions to discharge set forth in Section
523 of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523, the findings in this Order are true and admitted by
Respondent Katz, and further, any debt for disgorgement, prejudgment interest, civil penalty or
other amounts due by Respondent Katz under this Order or any other judgment, order, consent
order, decree or settlement agreement entered in connection with this proceeding, is a debt for the
violation by Respondent Katz of the federal securities laws or any regulation or order issued under
such laws, as set forth in Section 523(a)(19) of the Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. §523(a)(19).
