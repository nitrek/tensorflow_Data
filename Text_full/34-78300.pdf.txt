SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
(Release No. 34-78300; File No. 4-701)

Self-Regulatory Organizations; Investors Exchange LLC; Notice of Filing of Proposed
Minor Rule Violation Plan
Pursuant to Section 19(d)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Act"), 1 and
Rule 19d-l(c)(2) thereunder, 2 notice is hereby given that on July 11, 2016, Investors’
Exchange LLC (“IEX” or the “Exchange”) filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission ("Commission") a proposed minor rule violation plan ("MRVP") with
sanctions not exceeding $2,500 which would not be subject to the provisions of Rule 19d1(c)(1) of the Act 3 requiring that a self-regulatory organization ("SRO") promptly file notice
with the Commission of any final disciplinary action taken with respect to any person or
organization. 4 In accordance with Rule 19d-l(c)(2) under the Act, 5 the Exchange proposed to
designate certain specified rule violations as minor rule violations, and requested that it be
relieved of the prompt reporting requirements regarding such violations, provided it gives notice
of such violations to the Commission on a quarterly basis.

The Commission adopted amendments to paragraph (c) of Rule 19d-l to allow SROs to
submit for Commission approval plans for the abbreviated reporting of minor disciplinary
infractions. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 21013 (June 1, 1984), 49 FR
23828 (June 8, 1984). Any disciplinary action taken by an SRO against any person for
violation of a rule of the SRO which has been designated as a minor rule violation
pursuant to such a plan filed with and declared effective by the Commission is not
considered "final" for purposes of Section 19(d)(1) of the Act if the sanction imposed
consists of a fine not exceeding $2,500 and the sanctioned person has not sought an
adjudication, including a hearing, or otherwise exhausted his administrative remedies.

The Exchange proposes to include in its MRVP the procedures included in Exchange
Rule 9.216(b) ("Procedure for Violation Under Plan Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 19d1(c)(2)") and violations to be included in Exchange Rule 9.218 (“Violations Appropriate for
Disposition Under Plan Pursuant to Exchange Act Rule 19d-1(c)(2)”). 6 According to the
Exchange's MRVP, under Rule 9.216(b), the Exchange may impose a fine (not to exceed
$2,500) and/or a censure on any Member or associated person with respect to any rule listed
in IEX Rule 9.218. If the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”) Department
of Enforcement or the Department of Market Regulation, on behalf of the Exchange, has
reason to believe a violation has occurred and if the Member or associated person does not
dispute the violation, the Department of Enforcement or the Department of Market
Regulation may prepare and request that the Member or associated person execute a minor
rule violation plan letter accepting a finding of violation, consenting to the imposition of
sanctions, and agreeing to waive such Member's or associated person's right to a hearing
before a Hearing Panel or, if applicable, an Extended Hearing Panel, and any right of appeal
to the IEX Appeals Committee, the Board, the SEC, and the courts, or to otherwise
challenge the validity of the letter, if the letter is accepted. The letter shall describe the act
or practice engaged in or omitted, the rule, regulation, or statutory provision violated, and
the sanction or sanctions to be imposed. Unless the letter states otherwise, the effective date
of any sanction(s) imposed will be a date to be determined by IEX Regulation staff. In the

The Exchange received its grant of registration on June 17, 2016, which included
approving the rules that govern the Exchange. See Securities Exchange Act Release No.
78101 (June 17, 2016), 81 FR 41141 (June 23, 2016) (File No. 10-222). The Exchange
anticipates, upon effectiveness of its MRVP, to file a rule proposal pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Act, and Rule 19b-4 thereunder, to amend Rule 9.218 to specify the
violations to be subject to the MRVP. Exhibit A includes the entirety of Rule 9.216(b)
and anticipated changes to Rule 9.218.

event the letter is not accepted by the Member or associated person, or is rejected by the
Office of Disciplinary Affairs, the matter can proceed in accordance with the Exchange’s
disciplinary rules already approved by the Commission, which include hearing rights for
formal disciplinary proceedings. 7
The Exchange proposes that, as set forth in Exchange Rule 9.218, violations of the
following rules would be appropriate for disposition under the MRVP: Rule 2.160(p) –
Continuing Education Requirements; Rule 4.511 (General Requirements related to books and
records requirements); Rule 4.540 ( Furnishing of records); Rule 5.110 (Supervision); Rule 8.220
(Automated submission of trading data requested); Rule 11.151(a)(1) (Market Maker two-sided
quotation requirement); Rule 11.290 (Short sales); Rule 11.310 (Locking or crossing quotations
in NMS stocks); and Rule 11.420 (Order audit trail system requirements).
Upon the Commission's declaration of effectiveness of the MRVP, the Exchange will
provide to the Commission a quarterly report for any actions taken on minor rule violations
under the MRVP. The quarterly report will include: the Exchange's internal file number for the
case, the name of the individual and/or organization, the nature of the violation, the specific rule
provision violated, the sanction imposed, the number of times the rule violation occurred, and the
date of the disposition.
Additionally, the Exchange proposes that, going forward, to the extent that there are any
changes to the rules applicable to the Exchange's MRVP, the Exchange hereby requests that the
Commission deem such changes to be modifications to the Exchange' s MRVP.
