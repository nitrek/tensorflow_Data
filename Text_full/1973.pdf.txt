Important
Developments

MARKET STRUCTURE

AND REGULATION

In the past few years, increasing
stresses on the nation's securities mar
kets have made necessary the consid
eration of broad changes in the structure
of those markets. Among the many fac
tors contributing to the stresses observed
were: increased institutional dominance of
our markets; a substantial increase in the
number of so-called "block transactions;"
and the fragmentation of trading in listed
securities.
As previously noted,' the Commission
has assumed the initiative in defining
structural changes in the securities mar
kets. These initiatives began in 1968,
with administrative hearings concerning
the commission rates which all national
securities exchanges require their mem
bers to charge.
In October 1971, the Commission held
hearings which focused specifically upon
the issue of an appropriate structural
blueprint for the further development of
our securities markets. Based in part
upon these hearings, the Commission, in
February 1972, issued its Policy State
ment on the Future Structure of the Secu
rities Markets in which it discussed the
major policy issues confronting the na
tion's capital market system, and deline
ated the directions in which the Com
mission intended to go in order to alle
viate those problems. The Commission
recommended that the following steps

be taken to develop and implement the
policies enunciated
in the
Policy
Statement:
1. the formation by the Commission of
Advisory Committees which would study,
report on, and make recommendations
with respect to (a) the development of a
comprehensive market disclosure system;
(b) the structure, regulation and govern
ance of a central market system; and (c)
rules designed to ease the impact and
improve the handling of large blocks of
secuntles:
2. the reduction of the level above
which commission rates would be nego
tiated from $500,000 to $300,000;
3. the formulation and promulgation by
the NASD,at the Commission's direction,
of rules designed to prohibit the use of
portfolio executions by investment com
pany managers to reward broker-dealers
which sell the investment company's
shares;
4. the prompt adoption by all exchanges
of rules excluding from membership any
organization whose primary function is
to route orders for the purpose of rebat
ing or recapturing commissions, directly
or indirectly; and
5. consultation with exchanges and
other interested persons with the object
of formulating exchange rules designed
to require that exchange members en
gage in a "predominantly public" broker
age business.
During fiscal 1973, the Commission
3

took important
and major steps to im
plement
the recommendations
in Its
PolIcy Statement-these
are set forth
below. At the same time, in response
to the recommendations
set forth in its
Study of Unsafe and Unsound Practices
of Brokers and Deelers," and the Con
gressional mandate expressed In the Se
currtres Investor Protection Act of 1970,
the Commission
embarked upon a pro
the finan
gram designed to strengthen
cial responsibility
of brokers and dealers
in securities
and to ensure a broader
measure of protection
to the investing
public. These efforts to increase the pro
fessional quality and capabilities
of par
trcipants in the brokerage industry were
combined
with a program
designed to
avoid duplication
with respect to their
reporting requirements
or other respon
slbrlities which may impair the efficient
functioning
of the brokerage industry.
During the last fiscal year, the Com
mission and ItS staff have also been in
creasingly
preoccupied
with legislative
efforts by subcommittees
of both houses
of the Congress. The Commission's
ac
tions foreshadow
basic changes in the
structural
and regulatory
framework
of
the securities
industry.
It is anticipated
that these changes WIll result in a truly
competitive
and efficient capital market
system-one
capable of providing public
investors a broad range of services with
a minimum of risk.

Industry Advisory Committees
Following the issuance of the Com
mission's
February
1972 Policy State
ment, three industry
advisory commit
tees were established
to provide the
Commission
with detailed recommenda
tions for implementation
of some of the
Statement's major proposals. These com
mittees were asked to analyze and make
recommendations
concerning
the effec
tive dissemination
of information
to in
vestors, block trading and the structure,
regulation
and governance
of a central
market system.
Committee
on Market
Advisory Committee on
Market Disclosure met from April through
(1)

Advisory_.

Disc/osure--The

4

September 1972, and issued two reports.
The first specified a recommended
for
mat and method of operation for a com
posite last sale reporting
system. The
second made Similar recommendations
with respect to a composite
quotation
system.
The report on the last sale reporting
system recommended
that there be two
separate "streams"
of data, one consist
ing of all trading in stocks listed on the
New York Stock Exchange and the other
consisting of all trading In all other quali
fied listed stocks, in each case on a realtime. baSIS. All domestic transactions
in
listed secunties
rnvolvmg a registered
broker-dealer as principal or agent would
be reported, with certain exceptions for
transactions
such as underwntings,
The
report contemplated
a central processor
or service bureau, which would be free
from the control of any particular market
center and which would receive, validate,
sequence and retransmit last sale reports
from the various
participating
self-reg
ulatory orgaruzations. The report also dIS
cussed conditions under which access to
and retransmission
of last sale reports
could be regulated, and recommended
a
review procedure for those denied access
or the right to retransmit. The information
to be reported would include the price,
size and location of each transaction, and
this information
would be displayed by
means of both moving tickers and inter
rogation
devices.
It was also recom
mended that the maximum time from the
execution of a trade until its entry in the
system should be one minute, after which
the trade would be considered as reported
out of sequence.
The report on a composite
quotation
system recommended that the system be
open to all listed securities and be availa
ble for use by all market makers pre
pared to undertake certain responsibili
ties with respect to each stock for which
they

would

enter

quotatlens.

Generally,

a market maker would be required to deal
in a particular
security in a stabilizing
manner for a specified

minimum

period of

time, such as one year, and would not be
permitted

to cease such dealings

except

for good cause. Other broker-dealers
would have to Insert quotations through
eligible market makers, whether on their
own behalf or for customers. Surveillance
and capital requirements for participat
ing market makers were also discussed.
The Committee recommended that the
quotation system be administered by the
same central processor recommended for
the last sale reporting system. The in
formation to b~-displayed would include a
designation representing the market
maker, or the exchange, and its respec
tive bid and offer. Market makers would
be permitted, but not required, to indicate
the number of shares their bids and
offers covered, if in excess of one unit
of trading. Quotations would have to be
"firm" for at least one unit of trading, or
whatever size was shown, unless a market
maker could demonstrate that he was in
the process of updating his market after
having consummated a transaction. The
Committee recommended that the quota
tion system be an exclusive system: all
quotations in listed securities would have
to be stored in a common data bank to
which all users of the system would have
access and all elements of the system
would be governed by a single set of
rules. The quotation system would be
compatible with existing cornrnumcations
equipment and would thus encourage
the development of improved equipment
and methodology. In closing, the report
emphasized the importance of the auc
tion process generally in trading listed
securities and specified limited criteria
for denials of access, with a right of ap
peal to the Commission.
Many of the recommendations of the
Committee's report on a last sale report
ing system are embodied in Securities
Exchange Act Rule 17a-15, adopted on
November 8, 1972, which is discussed
below.
(2) Advisory Committee on a Central
Market System-The Advisory Committee
on a Central Market System met from
Apnl through December 1972, and also
Issued two reports. The first specified the
minimum regulatory changes deemed
necessary to implement a composite last

sale reporting system. The second con
tained the Committee's recommenda
tions on the structure, regulation and
governance of a central market system.
The first report recommended three
prerequisites to full operation of a com
posite tape: (1) adoption of a uruforrn
rule regulating short sales in all markets
for listed securities; (2) adoption of a
uniform rule by all exchangesto prevent
use of the tape for manipulative pur
poses; and (3) development of a mecha
nism to coordmate trading suspensions
in cases where a security is traded in
more than one market. The report ana
lyzed the problems raised by a uniform
short sale rule in considerable detail, and
set forth various specific recommenda
tions. The Commission adoptedthose rec
ommendations in its PolIcy Statement on
the Structure of a Central Market Sys
tem, issued on March 29, 1973. The
Statement is discussed more fully below.
The report on a central market system,
presented two distinct points of view
analyzing tha best means of developing
such a system. Several members of the
Committee were in favor of introducing
.the composite last sale and quotation
reporting systems and perrrutlng regula
tory and operational rules to evolve as
dictated by experience with the new
equipment. Other members of the Com
mittee, however, expressedthe view that
the regulatory Jinks between market cen
ters would never evolve adequately with
out affirmative Commission rulemaking
at the outset, in conjunction with the in
troduction of communication ties. An
other principal point of difference be
tween the two groups was that those who
favored the first approach also believed
that all trades in listed secunties should
ultimately be limited to exchanges-that
is, they supported the eventual elimina
tion of the "third market" in listed
securities.
(3) AdvIsory cornmrttee on Block
Transactions-The Advisory Committee
on Block Transactions submitted its reo
port to the Commission on August 7,
1972. The report reviewedthe rapid trend
toward the institutionalization of the na
5

tion's secunties markets and studied the
manner and method of integrating block
transactions
into a central market sys
tem. The Committee considered the pos
sibility
of
directly
restricting
an
institution's
freedom to buy and sell
blocks of particular securities as well as
restrictions
that would accomplish
the
same thing indirectly-for
example, by
limiting price changes in the trading mar
kets. The Committee
concluded,
how
ever, that institutions should remain free
to purchase and sell in a future central
market system "In a manner and at a
time of their own choosing,"
although
the Committee did note that the ability
of the market to absorb large blocks of
stock should be strengthened.
In ItS report, the Committee specifically
recommended:
(1) that the Commission
re-examine present regulation
over the
alternative means for disposing of blocks

use; (2) that Institutions

within the meaning of Exchange Act Rule

1Ob-6.
In line with Its recornmendatron
that
the Commission reexamine ItS regulations
affecting the disposition of blocks of se
cunties with the object of facrlrtating such
drsposition,
the Committee
urged a re
examination of Exchange Act Rule 10b-2.
That rule generally prohibits the practice
of strmulating exchange jctivity
in securi
ties which are the subject of a drstnbutron
by prohibiting payment of extra or special
compensation for soliciting purchases of
the securrtres being distributed.
On April
9, 1973, the rule was amended to permit
a broker or dealer who is participating
or
financially Interested In a distnbution
to
pay compensation
to regular employees
for such solicitation
not only in the form
of regular salary (as previously permitted)
but also in the form of usual and custom
ary cornrnissrons."
The Committee concluded that the evo
lutronary nature of the block trading proc
ess makes impracticable
any definitive
mandate to create a block trading market
structure, but indicated ItS willingness to
meet with and advise the Commission
on a case-by-case basis as special prob
lems anse.

Central Market System
Policy Statement
On March 29, 1973, the Commission
issued ItS Policy Statement on the Struc
ture of a Central Market System-setting
forth the results of ItS extensive review
of the recommendations
contained
in
the advisory reports just discussed, two
recent Congressional
studies'
and an
analysis by ItS staff with respect to the
development of a central market system
for listed securities. The Policy Statement
is Intended to give direction to the devel
opment of the structure and regulatory
framework within which such a system
would operate. In the Commlssron's view,
a central market system, by bringing to
gether all existing
curities,

competition would be encouraged, result
ing in a substantial benefit to investors.
At the heart of the central market sys
tem described In the Policy Statement
would be a comprehensive communica
tions linkage between market centers con
sisting of a real-time composite last sale
reporting system, a composite quotation
system displaying the bids and offers of
all qualified market makers in listed se
curities, and a central electronic reposi
tory for limit orders. Implementation of
such a communications system would
necessarily precipitate major changes in
the way securities are traded today.
Rather than let such changes occur with
out direction, the Commission anticipated
some of the problem areas and sketched
out a broad regulatory framework within
which the new communications network
could operate efficiently.
The major proposals may be grouped
into three broad categories: first, regula
tion to maintain the integrity of the com
munications linkage, such as eligibility
criteria for secuntres to be included, short
sale regulation and anti-manipulative
rules; second, regulation of competing
market makers within the system, partic
ularly with regard to their responsibilities
to maintain a fair and orderly market; and
third, regulation to ensure that the system
will maintain the best auction features of
the exchange markets and thereby pro
vide a favorable environment for individ
ual public investors. These auction fea
tures include an "auction trading" rule
and a "public preference" rule, both of
which are designed to maximize the op
portunity for public orders to meet with
out the intervention of a dealer. These
rules should have the effect of centraliz
ing all buying and seiling Interest in listed
securities and eliminating the fragmenta
tion which heretofore has plagued our
markets.
The Policy Statement sets forth in de
tail the Commission's preliminary con
clusions and the steps It plans to take,
or to request the self-regulatory bodies
to take, for their realization. The Com
mission emphasized, however, that be

cause of the complexity of the issues and
the unique efficiency already attained by
our domestic capital markets, any major
structural changes must be analyzed in
detail before, and monitored closely after,
their implementation. Therefore, the
Commission requested comments from
all Interested persons-including inves
tors, self-regulatory bodies, brokerdealers and government agencies-on all
aspects of the views expressed In the
Policy Statement.
Work towards implementing the con
crete steps recommended in the last
section of the Policy Statement is cur
rently underway, and it is anticipated
that a considerable amount of progress
will be achieved during the present year.

Commission Rates
In its February 1972 Policy Statement,
the Commission indicated its determina
tion to require that fixed commission
rates on that portion of orders above
$300,000 be eliminated, and thrs ob
jective has been accomplished. Fixed
rates on the portion of orders over $500,
000 had previously been eliminated at
the Commission's urging.
In March 1973, the Commission an
nounced that It would not seek any fur
ther reduction in the breakpoint until
April 1974, when It would be reduced
from $300,000 to $100,000. The Com
mission considered an interim reduction
at that time Imprudent in light of, among
other things, the capital and operational
pressures to which the member firm com
munity had been subjected in recent
years, and the Immediate financial
stresses produced by a combination of in
flated costs and declining profitability.
On September 11, 1973, the Commis
sion announced that it would not take the
halfway measure of seekmg a further
breakpoint reduction in April 1974. In
stead, it will act promptly to terminate
entirely the fixing of commission rates
by stock exchanges after April 30, 1975,
if the exchanges do not adopt rule
changes achievmg that result."

NASD Reciprocal Brokerage Rule

this rule expired July 31, 1973, and the
Commission's
staff is currently
consid
ering the comments received.

The Commission's
February 1972 Po/
Statement
noted the widespread
practice by investment
company mana
gers of usrng portfolio brokerage of mu
tual funds to reward broker-dealers
for
sales of fund shares. It reviewed the reg
ulatory problems and abuses related to
this practice and urged the NASD to
initiate
measures designed to end its
members' participation in such practices.
Subsequently,
the NASD filed with the
Commission
proposed amendments
to
its Rules of Fair Practice which were
designed to accomplish that result. On
May 14, 1973, the Commission
an
nounced that It had reviewed and would
not disapprove
the proposed
amend
ments." The amendments, which became
effective July 15, 1973, are Intended to
prohibit members from favonng or dis
cnminating
against the distribution
of
shares of open-end
Investment
com
panies (mutual funds) on the basis of
brokerage commissions
received, solicit
ing or making promises of an amount
or percentage of brokerage commissions
In connection
with the distnbutron
of
such shares, and seeking orders for the
execution of portfolio transactions on the
basis of sales of fund shares. While the
Rule does not, by its terms, apply to
possible reciprocal
brokerage practices
In connection
with the distribution
of
shares of other types of investment com
panies, such as closed-end funds, vanable
annuities and vanable life separate ac
counts, the Commission
has requested
the NASD to consider the question of
whether or not comparable
regulatory
measures should be adopted in these
areas. The appropnate
NASD commit
tees
are currently
consrderrng
such
measures.
In order to assure equality of treat
ment for all broker-dealers, the Commis
sion, on June 27, 1973, issued a release
proposing the adoption of Rule 15b1D-10
under the Exchange Act to prohibit simi
lar reciprocal
brokerage
practices
by
SECO broker-dealers-those
registered

In its February 1972 Policy Statement,
which reflected the culmination
of more
than four years of study of various as
pects of the operations of the nation's
secuntres
markets, the Commission out
lined the specific problems It had ob
served In the functioning
of the securi
ties industry and their relationship to the
development of a central market system.
The problems noted by the Commission
included: the growing "institutionaliza
tion" of the securities markets; disper
sion of trading, resulting In an erosion of
the public's ability to know whether best
execution of orders has been obtained
and Impairment of marketplace liqurdlty:
proliferation
of reciprocal practices; and
increased trading In listed secunties not
disclosed to the public. The Statement
committed the Cornrnissron
to a program
of upgrading competition
In the securi
ties industry. In addition to reaffirming
the Congressional
goal that exchange
membership
should be used for public
purposes!
the Commission
also called
for elimination
of the so-called "parent
test"-the
means by which some ex
changes had precluded some institutional
affiliates from gaining direct access to
the exchange marketplace."
On May 26, 1972, the Commission
requested each national securities
ex
change to adopt, no later than July 31,
the substance of a proposed rule dealing
With the appropnate
utilization
of ex
change membership. On August 3, 1972,
after it had become apparent that most
of the exchanges had not adopted the
rule suggested by the Commission, the
Commission
published
proposed

oral hearings

presented their views and were questioned by the Commission and Its staff.
On January 16, 1973, the Commission
adopted Rule 19b-2." Pursuant to the
rule, each securities exchange registered
with the Commission must adopt rules
which require every member of that exchange "to have as the principal purpose
of Its membership the conduct of a public securities business." For purposes of
the rule, it is presumed that a member
is conducting a public securities business
If at least 80 percent of the volume of
exchange secunties transactions effected
by it (a) is effected for or with other
than affiliated persons," or (b) consists of
certain kinds of transactions which contribute to the liqurdity or stability of the
markets, such as those effected by a stock
exchange specialist in a security in which
he is registered, or a bona fide arbitrage
transaction. A phase-in period was included in the rule whereby exchange
members, who acquired their membership prior to January 16, 1973, were given
up to three years to comply fully with
ItS provisions. The Commission stated
that, following the adoption of the Rule,
all exchanges would be expected to
amend their access provisions to the extent necessary to eliminate any parent or
related test.
Subsequent to the adoption of the rule,
various parties, Including the Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington Stock Ex.
change (PBW), sued to test its validity."
On March 19, 1973, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
stayed the effectiveness of the rule as to
PBW members whose membership antedated the rule's adoption. On March 22,
the Commission announced that all ex.
changes which had not yet adopted Rule
19b-2 would be required to do so sub.
ject to these conditions: (1) all members
who jomed an exchange after January 16,
1973, the date of the rule's adoption,
would be expected to comply fully with its
terms; (2) those members who Joined
prior to that date could continue in memo
bership, if their exchange so decided,
without complying with the rule's public

business requirements, provided that
their volume of business did not increase
substantially pending the outcome of the
litigation as to the rule's validity."
Rule 19b-2, as adopted by the New
York and American Stock Exchanges, requires all members to abide by the public
business requirement, no matter when
they joined the exchange. The rule as
adopted by the other exchanges applies
that requirement only to members who
joined on or after January 16, 1973.
On September 28, 1973, the Court of
Appeals for the Third Circuit granted the
Cornrnisston's motion to disrruss for lack
of JUrisdiction the lawsuit seeking to test
the validity of Rule 19b-2.

Consolidated Tape
One of the more Significant steps taken
by the Commission during the past fiscal
year to implement its Policy Statement
on the Future Structure of the Securiues
Markets was the adoption of Rule 17a-

15 under the Exchange Act." That Rule
requires registered national securities exchanges, national securities associations
and broker-dealers who are not members
of such organizations, to make available
on a composite basis price and volume
reports as to completed transactions In
listed securities.
Rule 17a-15 contemplates that registered securities exchanges and associanons (and nonmembers thereof) will file
"plans," on a joint basis if desired, which
will specify the manner of disseminating
the required rnformatron. In order to become effective, such plans must be approved by the Cornrmssron. The New
York, American, Midwest, PBW and Paerne Stock Exchanges, and the NASD,
filed a joint plan with the Commission
pursuant to the Rule on which the Commission invited public comment. Near the
close of the fiscal year, the Commission
announced that It had sent a letter to the
sponsors of the plan commenting on
certain of ItS aspects. The Comrnissron
made the text of ItS letter public and
invited further comment from the sponsors and other interested persons."

Option Market Regulation
A significant event of the past year was
the registration of the Chicago Board
Options Exchange, Inc. ("CBOE") as a
national securities exchange." The Com
mission determined to permit the CBOE,
as a new exchange and the first national
securities exchange to experiment with
the trading of options, to test the market
for such options within a controlled en
vironment. The CBOE operation is cur
rently limited to trading in call options 18
in approximately 20 underlying stocks but
it intends gradually to increase that num
ber and to extend operations to other
types of options as experience is gained,
and the market and its regulatory arrange
ments are tested. The CBOEnot only pro
vides a market place for the initial buying
and selling of option contracts but has
also established a secondary market for
the resale of options during their lifetime.
Prior to the formation of the CBOE, op
tions initially were bought and sold overthe-counter, with only a very limited sec
ondary market. The options traded on the
CBOEare registered under the Securities
Act,19 and relate to underlying stocks
which are listed on another national se
curities exchange. The initial option reg
istration related solely to the underlying
common stocks of companies listed on
the New York Stock Exchange.
For the period of the CBOE's experi
mental status, and in line with the needto
maintain flexibility in regulating this new
kind of exchange market, the Commission
decided to postpone a definitive determi
nation as to whether the CBOEshould be
required to include in its rules a non
member access provision. The Commis
sion also determined, pending further
consideration regarding the viability of
existing fixed commission rates and the
nature of the CBOE's actual operations,
to permit the CBOEto structure its com
mission rates in a manner analogous to
those provided by other national secu
rities exchanges.
On April 26, 1973, the date upon which
the CBOE's registration as a national se
curities exchange became effective, the
10

Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice filed suit alleging that the main
tenance of minimum commission rates,
floor brokerage and other fees by the
CBOEviolated Section 1 of the Sherman
Act."" The CBOE, it is alleged, is engaged
in an unlawful combination to restrain
trade and commerce in the providing of
brokerage services for the trading of
options.
Interest in the trading of put and call
options has increased markedly the past
few years causing the Commission to
assess the adequacy of existing protec
tions available to public investors who
participate in this activity. In an effort to
ensure that investors in options are af
forded protections similar to those pro
vided investors in more common debt or
equity securities, the Commission has
already promulgated some rules 21 and
proposes to adopt other rules relating to
trading in options. Thus, on January 9,
1973, the Commission announced that it
was considering the adoption of Rule 9b
1 under the Exchange Act."" The rule, as
proposed, specifies procedures to be fol
lowed in connection with the adoption
or alteration of rules of a registered na
tional securities exchange relating to acts
and transactions in options on the ex
change. The Commission is considering
the comments it has received on pro
posed Rule 9b-1 and expects to act with
regard to this subject in the near future.
In addition to overseeing exchange
rules relating to trading In put and call
options, the Commission has proposed
rules directed to the options themselves
as well as those persons who deal in
them.
On February 8, 1973, the Commission
published for comment proposed Securi
ties Act Rule 238."" That rule would
exempt put and call options from the
registration requirements of the Securi
ties Act if certain conditions were met.
These conditions are: (1) that the security
underlying the put or call option is either
registered on a national securities ex
change or meets certain criteria if traded
only over-the-counter; (2) that the gross
proceeds from the sale of related options

entities and would coordinate ItS activi

regard to deposrtories, transfer agents
and c1eanng agents incorporated as
banks, however, the Federal bank author

bill's provisions.

Such prohibition would not become ef
fective prior to the last date on which any
national securities exchange maintains
or enforces any rule fixmg rates of com
rrussion,or prior to April 30, 1976, which
ever is later. Moreover, the prohibition
would not be absolute until the expira
tion of two years from the date that fixed
commission rates are totally eliminated,
or Apnl 30, 1976, whichever is later.
S. 470 would also amend the Invest
ment Company and Investment Adviser
Acts: (1) to provide that under specified
conditions, it would not be unlawful or a
breach of fiduciary duty for an investment
adviser to pay a higher commission to a
broker for effectmg a transaction than
that charged by other brokers for effect
ing similar transactions; and (2) to estab
lish standards with respect to the sale
of an interest in an mvestment adviser.
The latter section is designed to remedy
certain problems raised by a recent court
decrsron,> which held that the general
principle in equity that a fiduciary cannot
sell his office for personal gain is im
pliedly incorporated into Section 15(a) of
the Investment Company Act requiring
shareholder approval of any new invest
ment advisory contract. For a more de
tailed discussion, see Part 5.

Tax Shelters
(2) S.470
On June 18, 1973, S. 470 was passed
by the Senate and sent to the House of
Representatives for consideration. This
bill would grant the Commission authority
to regulate or prevent trading by mem
bers on national securities exchanges,
either on or off the exchange floor, for
the member's own account or the ac
count of any affiliated person, and make
it unlawful for a member to trade in con
travention of rules the Commtssion might
adopt. The bill would also make it unlaw
ful after a prescribed period, for a mem
ber of a national securities exchange to
effect any transaction on such exchange
for or with its own account or that of any
affiliated person or managed institutional
account.

During the fiscal year, the NASD and
the Commission's staff gave extensive
consideration to the regulatory problems
associated with the public offering of taxshelter programs. Shortly after the close
of the year, the Commission announced
that it was requesting public comments
on proposed NASD Rules of Fair Practice
which would establish a system of regu
lation for the distribution of such pro
grams.""The proposed rules, among other
things, would prohibit NASD members
from participating in the distribution of
tax-sheltered programs which did not
meet prescribed standards of fairness and
reasonableness. These standards relate
to the underwriting and other terms and
conditions of the public distribution, in
cluding all elements of compensation to
be paid to sponsors or broker-dealers,and

to the operation, structure and manage
ment of such programs SUitability stand
ards for investment in such programs,
and requirements concerning the content

also be established.
The Commission has requested public
comment on the NASO's proposals not.
only to aid in ItS consideration of the
specifics of the NASO's proposed plan,
but also to provide It with a broadened
base upon which to develop its own poli
cies in the area of tax shelter programs.

numerous comments receivedconcerning
these recommendations were reviewed
and considered by the NASO.
On June 1, 1973, the Commission pub
lished a number of releases dealing with
the first phase of the "hot issues"

DISClOSURE.RELATED

MATTERS

"Hot" Issues
In February 1972, the Commission
began public, fact-finding investigatory
proceedings on "hot issues" securities
markets (l.e., markets in which new is
sues have experienced substantial price
rises in their after-markets) to determine
the adequacy of existing disclosure and
regulatory protection for investors.
On July 26, 1972, following comple
tion of the first phase of the hearings, the
Commission requested the registered na
tional securities exchangesand the NASO
to consider the establishment of appro
priate standards to alleviate some of the
problems found to exist in such mar
kets-particularly
with respect to the
adequacy of investigations by underwrit
ers and the suitability for customers of
the securities being distributed. As a re
sult of this request, the NASO estab
lished a committee to review the Com
mission's comments and to make appro
priate recommendations designed to
strengthen regulatory and disclosure con.
trol over the sale of new issues of secu
rities to public investors. On March 14,
1973, the NASO's Board of Governors re
quested membership and public com.
ments on the committee's recornmenda
tions that: (1) special customer suita
bility rules be adopted with respect to
first time offerings of companies in a
promotional stage; (2) a rule be adopted
to require that written procedures be

may have on the registrant's business. In
addition, it now requires disclosure in

In October 1972, the Commission
in

Rule 146
The so-called "private offering" exemp
tion from registration under the Securities
Act provided by Section 4(2) has long
been a source of uncertainty for issuers
wishing to sell their secunties in private
placements. In November 1972, the Com
mission released for comment proposed
Rule 146 under the Securities Act, "Trans
actions by an Issuer Deemed Not to In
volve Any Public Offerlng.":ro The pro.
posed nonexclusive
rule IS intended to
provide more objective standards for de
termrning when the offer or sale of se
curities by an issuer is a transaction
not
involvrng any public offering Within the
meanrng of Section 4(2). In general, the
proposed rule would require that (1) no
general advertising be used in the offer
and sale of the securities; (2) all offerees,
or their representatives,
be persons With
knowledge and experience In frnancial and
business matters; (3) all offerees be able
to bear the economic risk of the invest
ment; (4) all offerees, or their representa
tives, have access to the type of informa
non that registration would disclose; (5)
there be no more than 35 purchasers of
16

the issuer's securities in any 12 month pe
riod; and (6) that certain steps be taken
to prevent resale of the securities in vio
lation of the registration
provrsrons,
In
addition, a Form 146 would have to be
filed describing the transaction.
In con
nection with Rule 146, the Commission
proposed an amendment to Rule 257 to
allow an offering under Regulation A not
in excess of $100,000, WIthout use of an
offering Circular, for certain employee
benefit plan offerings. The Commission
is presently considering the comments re
ceived on the proposed rule,

Rule 147
The application of Section 3(a)(11) of
the Securities Act, which exempts from
registration secunties that are part of an
issue offered and sold only to persons
resident in a spectfic state by an issuer
that is also resident and dorng business
Within that state, has also been a source
of inquiry and uncertainty for many years.
In January
1973, the Cornrnlssron re
leased for comment proposed Rule 147
which IS intended to define certain terms
In, and clarify certain condrtions of, the
Intrastate offering exemption."
In general
it would define "part of an issue" to in
clude all offers and sales of securities by
an issuer and its afftliate Within a six
month period. In addition, It would define
"person resident"
and "doing business
within"
for purposes of the exemption,
and would also place certain limitations
on reoffer and resale. The Commission
is presently consrdermg the comments
received on the proposed rule.

hne-of-business disclosure and summary
of operations Information similar to that
required in the annual report on Form
10-K. In the areas of discretionary re
leases and interim reporting, the Com
mittee observed that guidelines would be
useful and made some specific sugges
tions for improving dissemination of in
formation. The Committee also made rec
ommendations relating to the use of
Forms 5-7, S-8 and S-9, coordination
of disclosure by the stock exchangesand
the Commission and by the states and
the Commission, guidelines for filing doc
uments under the ExchangeAct, and Im
proved line-of-business reporting.
On January 22, 1973, a Task Force on
Forms and Reports was appointed from
the Commission staff to develop specific
proposals based on the recommendations
of the Advisory Committee.

Quality of Earnings
In December 1972, the Commission
announced that it was proposing to
amend Guide 22, "Summary of Earn
rngs", of the Guides for the Preparation
and Filing of Registration Statements
under the Securities Act of 1933." The
proposed amendment is designed to
make more meaningful and understand
able disclosure of financial information
presented In prospectuses. Item 6 of
Forms 5-1 and 5.7 requires that, in ad
dition to the columnal presentation of
summary financial data, registrants must
supply information of material signifi
cance to investors In appraising the re
sults shown. The proposed amendment
would clarify the type of supplementary
information and data to be included In
order to enable investors to appraise the
quality of earnings reported in the sum
mary. A non-exclusive list of examples
that registrants should consider In mak
ing disclosure would be set forth. The

Commission announced that it is con
sidering adoption of the substance of the
amended Guide22 as GUide1 of proposed
Guides for the Preparation and Filing of
Reports and Registration Statements
under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. The comments received on these
proposals are being studied by the staff.

The applicability of the Federal securi
ties laws to the sale of real estate units
is an area of evolving interpretation and
practice. The Commission has under
taken a number of actions to state Its
position on questions In thrs area, and has
sought the advrce of the industry regard
ing future actions.
(a) Real Estate Advisory Committee-

On May 3, 1972, the Real Estate AdVI
sory Committee was established by the
Cornmissron to examine disclosure pro
cedures and policy objectives In the area
of real estate security interests. The
Committee, in ItS report dated Octo
ber 12, 1972, concluded that proper in
vestor protection can best be achieved
through informative, understandable and
Uniform economic disclosure In real
estate secunty offerings.
The report
stated that such a process should result
in more competition among various types
of real estate securities and between real
estate securities and all other types of
securities In the equrty markets. The
Committee also stated that the various
regulatory agencies involved in regulat
ing the offer and sale of real estate secu
nties should act so as to facilitate an
equitable, competitive flow of funds into
such secuntres from the investing public.
The committee recommended, among
other things, that the Cornrnissron estab
lish a "staffed permanent real estate
advisory committee, composed of rep
resentative state regulators, securities
associations, the real estate Industry,
attorneys and accountants." Although It
urged the Commission to continue ItS
enforcement of applicable provrsions of
the Securities Act and the ExchangeAct,
It recommended that the Commission
refrain from developing new regulatory
17

procedures with respect to real estate
securities pending the formation and rec
ommendations
of the committee.
In addition,
the Committee
made
specific recommendations
in areas relat
ing to the offer and sale of real estate se
curities such as sales literature,
fees,
conflicts
of interest among promoters
and managers, the applicability of Regu
lation "T", and the broker-dealer regis
tration, net capital and reporting require
ments of the Exchange Act as they may
relate to those who sell real estate securi
ties such as condominiums
and coopera
tives.
Since publication of the Committee's
report, the Commission has taken a num
ber of steps relating to the offer and sale
of real estate secunties. For example, as
discussed below, the Commission has is
sued guidelines with respect to the appli
cability of the Federal securities laws to
offers and sales of condominiums or units
in a real estate development,
and, as
noted above, has asked for public com
ments on NASD proposals relating to tax
shelter programs, including those involv
ing real estate. The Cornrnlsston's staff is
currently
studying
other recommenda
tions made by the Committee.
(b) Interpretations
Regardmg Condo
rnrmurns and Other Real Estate UnltsIn January 1973, the Commission Issued
guidelines as to the applicability
of the
Federal securities
laws to offers and
sales of condominiums
and other types
of units In a real estate development."
The Commission stated that an offering
of condominiums
or other Units will be
viewed as an offering of securities
in
the form of Investment contracts If they
are offered and sold: (1) with emphasis

rrussron noted that there might be other
types of arrangements, not presently an
ticipated, that might render an offering
of condominiums an offenng of securities
and stated that the staff of the Com
mission will respond to written inquiries
on such matters.
In April 1973, the Commission issued
a release '3 emphasizing the applicability
of certain requirements of the Federal se
curities
laws to advertismg
and sales
practices In connection with units of real
estate which are deemed to be securities.
The release discusses the effect of Rules
134 and 135 under the Securities Act on
the types of communications
which may
be used before, during and after the reg
rstration process. The release also notes
the protubiiton on acceptance of purchase
pnce payments,
deposits or purchase
commitments
prior to the time a regis
tration statement IS effective and a sta
tutory
prospectus
delivered to a pur
chaser.

Accounting
During the year the Commission issued
proposals for supplemental disclosure by
registrants
of their accounting
policres
and any changes made In those policies,
and of data concerning Income tax ex
pense, leased assets, and items affecting
liquidity. Studies are being conducted to
determine whether improvements can be
effected for the benefit of the investing
public in other areas, including line-of
business reporting,
pro forma financial
statements, and reporting and audit re
quirements for broker-dealer firms.
The Commission is also studying ways
to assist accountants practicing before it
to maintain their independence, and to
aid in Improving thelt audit procedures
and practices. In cooperation
With the
accounting
profession, the Commission
has developed a new approach in its con
tinurng effort to correct deficient auditing
practices. This approach, which was ap
plied dunng the year In disciplinary pro
ceedings against an accounting
firm,"

calls for an Investigation to be made of
an accounting
firm's professional
prac
tice to insure that the firm is following
proper auditing
standards
and proce
dures. The investigation
may be made
either by the staff of the Commission, or
by a team of qualified professional ac
countants selected either by the Ameri
can Institute of Certified Public Account
ants (AICPA) or by the Chief Accountant
of the Commission
from
persons the
AICPA designates.

Mutual Fund Distribution

During the last fiscal year, the Com is
sion, after reviewing the Study of the
Potential Economic Impact of the Repeal
of Section 22(d), conducted by ItS staff,
and the Economic Study of the Distribu
tion of Mutual Funds and Variable An
nuities, conducted for the NASD, deter
mined that it would be appropriate
to
re-examine traditional administrative
pos
itions and explore new possibilities
in
order that mutual funds may be marketed
more efficrently at a reasonable cost to
investors. Section 22(d) requires, in part,
that in the sale of a mutual fund security
to the public, the principal underwriter
and any dealer must sell the security at
the current

to such a

solicited
the
views of all interested persons." The no
tice also requested comments With re
spect to the following
matters: further

from all facets of the mutual fund indus
and expressed a broad

range of opinions. At the end of the fiscal
year, the Commission's
staff was in the
process of analyzrng
the views and in
formation presented.

Variable Life Insurance
On January 31, 1973, the Commission
announced ItS conclusions on regulation
of variable life insurance," Variable life
insurance refers to Insurance contracts
in which the death benefit, cash surren
der value and other benefits vary to re
flect the Investment experience of a life
insurance company's
separate account
which Invests primarily in equity securi
ties. The Commission's
action stemmed
from public hearings last year on rules
proposed by the American Life Conven
tion and the Life Insurance Association
of America which would have exempted
certain variable life insurance contracts,
issuers and related persons from the se
curities acts.
In brief, the Cornrnlssron
determined
that: (1) the investment character of vari
able life contracts would make them secu
rities, so that any public offering of the
type of contracts
contemplated
In the
hearings would have to be registered
under the Securities Act; (2) people seil
mg these variable life contracts would
generally have to register as broker-deal
ers under the Exchange Act; (3) the sep
arate account of a company engaged in
Issuing and selling these variable life
contracts would fall Within the definition
of an investment company under the In
vestment Company Act; and (4) an in
surance company or other entity provid
ing investment advice mcidental to the
Issuance of variable life contracts would
be an investment adviser under the Ad
visers Act. However, the Commission de'
termined to exempt by rule such separate
accounts from the elaborate regulatory
requirements of the Investment Company
Act in deference to state regulation of
insurance and because of complex admin
istrative problems that would arise in pro
19

viding the substantial
exemptions from
the Act that would be necessary to make
the operations of these accounts feasible.
For essentially
the same reasons, the
Commission
determined
to exempt by
rule from the Advisers Act insurance com
panies or affiliated companies acting as
advisers to these accounts.
In determining not to adopt an exemp
tive rule with respect to variable life con
tracts under the Securities Act, the Com
mission in its release said: "(T)he im
portant investment features of the con
tract-the
opportunity
to participate in
the investment experience of the separate
account In order to achieve Increased life
insurance benefits Including death pro
tections and cash value--require
that
contract-holders
be afforded the protec
tions of full disclosure which would be
developed by registration of the contracts
under the Securities Act."
At the same time, the Commission de
cided not to exempt these contracts from
the provisions of the Exchange Act be
cause the complex nature of the invest
ment elements of variable life insurance
make it particularly
important
that the
disclosure
made be communicated
by
salesmen and firms subject to Commis
sion regulation.
After the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission
proposed amendments
to
the rules granting exemptions from the
Investment Company and Advisers Acts
which would, if adopted, condition the ex
emptions on prior Commission determi
nation that state law and regulations
applicable to variable life insurance con
tracts provide investor protections sub
stantially equivalent to those afforded by
the acts!'
The Commission also announced that

Proposed Offshore Fund
legislation
In April 1973, the Commission sub
mitted to Congress legislative proposals
which would enable creation of Foreign
Portfolio Sales Corporations or Trusts to
be organized in the United States for the
sale of mutual fund shares to foreign
ers." The legislation was prepared by the
staff of the Commission With the assist
ance of the staff of the Treasury Depart
ment and would amend the Investment
Company Act and the Internal Revenue
Code. The proposals were developed by
an Inter-agency Offshore Fund Task Group
assembled on the initiative of the Com
mission and comprised of representatives
of the Commission, the Treasury Depart
rnent, the State Department and the Fed
eral Reserve Board. The Task Group also
received valuable advice and assistance
from an informal advisory group.
The Task Group was formed as a fol
low-up to recommendations

After reviewing existing United States

posal for a Foreign Portfolio Sales Cor
poration as a new form of United States
mutual fund, organized
in the United
States and registered with the Commis
sion but directing its sales efforts at non
residents and noncitizens of the United
States.
Under the proposed legislation, the In

Company
Act
would
be
amended to provide specifically
for the
registration
and regulation
of domestic
Investment companies organized for the
sale of their securities to foreigners. Re
lated amendments
would provide the
Commission with greater flexibility under
the Act in allowing registration

and would
enable the Commission to deal with the
problem of "shell" companies organized
in the United States with foreign officers,

proposed legislation will be considered

Swiss Treaty
On May 25, 1973, the United States

the two legal systems. A representative

The treaty contains 41 articles grouped

Weis's chairman, was charged with

All of the defendants pleaded not guilty
to the charges.
In June 1973, the Commission ordered
public administrative proceedings against
Memll Lynch, Pierce, Fenner and Srmth,
Inc., persons in its research department
and 47 account executives, arising from
the sale to approximately 4,000 Memll
Lynch customers of more than 400,000
shares of Scientrfrc Control Corporation
at prices ranging from $24 to $70.
The proceedings are based upon staff
allegations that Mernll Lynch prepared
research reports and wire flashes recommending SCientific stock which were misleading and Without a reasonable basis.
Much of the information on which the recommendation was based allegedly
emanated from SCientific'S management
and was not verified through independent
analysis or inquiry. The order alleges that
Mernll Lynch failed to conduct a diligent
analysis of, among other things, the financial condition, business actrvitres and
prospects of Scientific.
It is further alleged that, in the offer
and sale of Sclentrfrc stock, the 47 account executives made a series of material misstatements and omissions concerning, among other things, projections
of the future price of Scientific shares,
the likelihood of the shares being listed
on a national securities exchange, and
comparisons of Scientrftc With highly successful and well established companies
in the computer industry."

NEW OFFICE OF REGISTRATIONS
AND REPORTS
On October 29, 1972, the Commission
created the Office of Registrations and
Reports (ORR) in order to concentrate in
a single organization the receipt, initial
24

examination and distribution of over
150,000 filings and reports received by
the Commission annually.
ORR IS also responsible for performrng the substantive examination of (1)
ownership ("Insider") reports, (2) reports of sales of unregistered stock pursuant to Rule 144, and (3) applications
for registration as a broker-dealer or investment adviser (and amendments to
such applications). In addition, ORR is
responsible for analyzing and responding to investor complaints; extracting
data from all filings for computer input;
preparing certain data-based publications
and directones: and determining which
registrants are delinquent In filing required reports.
Since It was established, ORR has
made Significant progress toward the
goals set by the Commission which include (1) one-stop service to the filing
public; (2) the elimination of duplicative effort; (3) a unified system of processing; (4) the assignment of personnel
to areas of peak workload; (5) streamlined computer input; (6) prompt service to operating divrsrons, regional offices
and other staff offices; and (7) a single
authontative source of information respecting the processing of all filings and
reports.

Part 2
The Disclosure
System

A basic purpose of the Federal securi
ties laws is to provide disclosure of ma
terial financial and other information on
companies seeking to raise capital
through the public offering of their se
cunties, as well as companies whose
securities are already publicly held. This
aims at enabling Investors to evaluate the
securities of these companies on an in
formed and realistic basis.
The Securities Act of 1933 generally
requires that before securities may be of
fered to the public a registration state
ment must be filed with the Cornrrussron
disclosing prescribed categories of infor
mation. Before the sale of securities can
begin, the registratton statement must
become "effective." In the sales, inves
tors must be furnished a prospectus con
taining the most significant information
in the registration statement.
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934
deals in large part with securities already
outstanding and requires the registra
tion of securities listed on a national se
curities exchange, as well as over-the
counter securities in which there is a sub
stantial public interest. Issuers of regis
tered securities must file annual and
other periodrc reports designed to pro
vide a public file of current material in
formation. The Exchange Act also re
quires disclosure of material information
to holders of registered securrties in soli
citations of proxies for the election of di
rectors or approval of corporate action at

a stockholders' meeting, or in attempts
to acquire control of a company through
a tender offer or other planned stock ac
quisition. It provides that insiders of com
panies whose equity secunties are regis
tered must report their holdings and
transactions in all equity securities of
their companies.

PUBLIC OFFERING: THE 1933
SECURITIES ACT
The baSICconcept underlying the Se
curities Act's registration requirements is
full disclosure. The Commission has no
authority to pass on the merits of the se
cunties to be offered or on the fairness
of the terms of distribution. If adequate
and accurate disclosure is made, It can
not deny registration. The Act makes It
unlawful to represent to Investors that the
Cornrnrssron
has approved or otherwise
passed on the merits of registered secu
rities.

Information Provided
While the Secunties Act specifres the
information to be included In registration
statements, the Commission has the au
thority to prescnbe appropriate forms and
to vary the particular Items of informa
tion required to be disclosed. To facrh
tate the registratron of securities by dif
ferent types of issuers, the Cornrnissron
has adopted special registration forms
which vary in their disclosure require
ments so as to provide maximum dis
29

closure of the essential facts pertinent in
a given type of offering while at the same
time minimizing the burden and expense
of compliance with the law. In recent
years, It has adopted certain short forms,
notably Forms S-7 and S-16, which do
not require disclosure of matters already
covered in reports and proxy material
filed or distributed under provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act. During the last
year, certain amendments were made to
Form S-16 to clanfy the disclosure required, and to expand the situations In
which the form may be used.'

Reviewing Process
Registration statements frled with the
Cornrrussion are examined by Its Division
of Corporation
Finance for compliance
with the standards of adequate and accurate disclosure Various degrees of review procedures are employed by the
Division. ~While most deficiencies are corrected through an Informal letter of comment procedure, where the Commission
finds that material representations
In a
registration statement are rrusleading, inaccurate, or incomplete, It may, after notice and opportunity for heanng, Issue a
"stop-order"
suspending
the effectiveness of the statement.

Environment and Civil Rights
As discussed in last year's Annual Report 7 the Commission has taken certain
actions to require disclosure

rights and environmental

competitive posrtlon of an issuer and its
subsidiaries
Information would also be
required on pending government,
and
private enforcement
proceedings under
environmental
laws or regulations, and
any such proceedings contemplated
by
government authorities.
Upon review of
the letters of comment received on the
proposals, the Cornrnissron adopted the
amendments,
effective July 3, 1973.'"
Apart from disclosure of environmental
matters, the amendments also reduced
from 15 to 10 percent of current assets
the standard of materiality With respect
to disclosure of legal proceedings involving pnrnanly a claim for damages.
In Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc. v. SEC., 7 the petitioners had previously sought direct review in the Court
of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Crrcuit of the Cornrnissron's denial of
their request that It adopt amendments
to ItS rules to conform them to what the
petitioners
claimed to be the requirements of the National Environmental PolICy Act [NEPAl" The court of appeals drsmissed the petition,
holding that the
Commission's
actron
In declining
to
adopt the requested rules was not a final
order subject to review In a court of appeals under the review provisions of the
Securities Act or the Exchange Act. It also
stated that whether the Commission had
improperly delayed action under NEPA or
had Improperly interpreted that Act were
Issues that could be resolved in a United
States District Court.
Subsequently, the petitioners brought
SUIt in the United States District Court
for the Drstnct of Columbia'
seeking,
among other things, to compel the Comrnrssron to complete the review it was
then conducting to determine whether
ItS rules and regulations
should
be
amended In light of the enactment of
NEPA. Shortly thereafter,
the Commission completed its review, and as noted

above, adopted amendments to its forms
and reports to comply with the man
dates of NEPA.The petitioners promptly
petitioned the Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit to review the
sufficiency of the Commission's amend
ments. That action 8 is presently pending,
and petitioners' motion to stay the dis
trict court proceedings pending appellate
review was granted by the district court.

Foreign Offerings
In February 1973, the Commission
adopted Rule 434C under the Securities
Act to permit United States issuers of
fering their secunties simultaneously in
Japan and the United States to use a dif
ferent prospectus in each country, each
prospectus complying with local law."
Thrs rule was born of the fact that Japan
requires offerings in that country to be
made by a prospectus which differs in
form and content from that required by
the Securities Act. ThUS,the rule recog
nizes both the appeal of the United States
capital markets to Japanese investors.
and Japan's interest in regulating its own
securities markets.

Time for Registration
The Commission's staff tries to com
plete examination of registration state
ments as quickly as possible. The Secu
rities Act provides that a registration
statement shall become effective on the
20th day after it IS filed (or on the 20th
day after the filing of any amendment).
Most registration statements require one
or more amendments and do not become
effective until some time after the statu
tory 20-day period. The period between
filing and effective date is Intended to
give investors an opportunity to become
familiar with the proposed offering
through the dissemination of the prelimi
nary form of prospectus. The Commission
can accelerate the effective date to
shorten the 20-day waiting period-taking
into account, among other things, the
adequacyof the information on the Issuer
already available to the public and the
ease with which facts about the offering
can be understood.

During the 1973 fiscal year, 3,281 reg
istration statements became effective. Of
these, 192 were amendments filed by in
vestment companies pursuant to Section
24(e) of the Investment Company Act
of 1940, which provides for the registra
tion of additional securities through
amendment to an effectrve registration
statement rather than the filing of a new
registration statement. For the remaining
3,089 statements, the median number of
calendar days between the date of the
original filing and the effective date was
4l.

Organizational Changes
During the past fiscal year, the Division
of Corporation Finance completed cer
tain orgarnzatlonaland personnelchanges
necessitated In part by the Cornrrussron's
reorganization of August 1972." These
changes Involved disclosure procedures
with respect to Investment companies,
and the creation within the Division of
Offices of DIsclosure Policy and Proceed.
ings and International Corporate Finance.

Investment Company Disclosure

Policy and Procedure

Beginning with the assumption of its
responsrbrutresfor investment company
disclosure, resulting from the Cornrms
sion's reorganizatron, the Dtvision com
menced a study of the substance, use,
and review of Investment company pro
spectuses and other filings. While this
study IS not yet complete and many of
ItS findings will not be made public until
fiscal 1974, some Significant steps were
taken.
In September 1972, the Commission
published the Divrsron's procedures for
processing investment company posteffective amendments." Theseprocedures
were designed to curtail the amount of
time spent in review,and to separatemat
ters of disclosure from matters of regula
tory policy under the Investment Com
pany Act during the review process.
This latter objective is reflected In the
report of the Advisory Committee on
Investment Companies and Advisers
submitted to the Commission on Decem
31

ber 29, 1972, which included recom
mendations for a simplified prospectus
and an integrated reporting system. As a
result of these recommendations and its
own independent judgment, the Division
is considering a new registration
form
which will completely supplant those pre
sently in use.
In addition, to make prospectuses more
readable and understandable through vis
ual aids and otherwise, the Commission
made clear, during the past year, that in
vestment company Issuers could include
in their prospectuses "sales literature" as
defined in the Cornrnission's Statement
of Policy."
The nature of investment companies
which filed and had their registration
statements declared effective during the
past year IS indicative of both the econ
omy and of the types of business to which
capital IS currently allocated by Investors.
As a result of current interest rates, bond
funds, primarily of the closed-end, man
agement type, registered and offered to
the public securities having a total offer
ing price of over $2 billion. A substantial
number of these companies were spon
sored and managed by Insurance com
panies or bank affiliates.

Oil and Gas
In April 1971, the Dlvisron assigned to
its 011 and Gas Section processing re
sponsibility for all oil and gas dnlling pro
gram filings as well as filings on Form
5-10 covering fractional undivided inter
ests in 011 and gas rights. This assign
ment was the first attempt by the Division
to concentrate all filings of one industry
type in one processing unit. The result
has been an improved handling of the
registrations and more unrform and com
plete disclosure. Filed during the fiscal
year were 105 registration statements
for oil and gas drilling programs, totaling

$894 million, and 10 statements covering
fractional undivided interests in oil and
gas rights, aggregating $7.4 million.
Additional data regarding the types and
amounts of oil and gas filings IS contained
in the Information in thrs Part relating to
Regulation

B.

Tax Shelters
In February 1972, a branch of the DIvision of Corporation Finance was desig
nated to process all registration state
ments covering tax shelter programs other
than oil and gas and real estate invest.
ment trusts. These programs Include real
estate syndications, condominiums with
an investment feature, cattle feeding, cat
tle breeding and citrus and pistachio
groves and other agn-business.
The disclosure generally emphasized In
tax shelter registration statements has in
cluded the compensation paid or to be
paid to the program sponsors, the con
flicts ot Interest inherent in such offer
ings, the record of the general partner
in prior offerings of tax shelter invest
ments, a delineation of Investment ob
jectives for the program to be offered,
and the effect of Federal tax provisions.
In real estate syndications, the trend
continues to be strongly in the direction
of "blind pool" programs-I.e., programs
with either no properties specified for
purchase or construction programs with
no economic history upon which to base
an investment decision.
The U.S. Department of the Treasury,
on April 30, 1973, submitted a number
of proposals for tax change in this area
to the Congress. The potential Impact of
these proposals on the number or types
of filings in the tax shelter area cannot be
assessedat thrs time.
In July 1973, the Division reorganized
the non-oil and gas tax shelter registra
tion statement processing responsibility
into a two branch function With one
branch havmg responsibility for cattle
feeding and breeding, agn-business, and
condominium offerings, and the second
branch having responsibility for real es
tate and the other miscellaneous tax shel
ters. A third branch has processing re
33

sponsrbllity
for all 011 and gas tax shelter
offerings.
See the discussion in Part 1 under the
heading "Real Estate Matters" for a deSCription of certain releases relating to
condominiums and real estate units.

SMALL ISSUE EXEMPTION
The Commission is authorized under
Section 3(b) of the Securities Act to ex
empt securities from registration if it
finds that registration for these securities
is not necessaryto the public interest be
cause of the small amount offered or the
limited character of the public offering.
The law Imposes a maximum lirnitatron
of $500,000 upon the size of the Issues
which may be exempted by the Commis
sion.
The Commission has adopted the fol
lowing exemptive rules and regulations:
Regulation A: General exemption for
U.S. and Canadian issues up to
$500,000.
Regulation
B. Exemption for frac
tional undivided interests in 011 or
gas rights up to $250,000.
Regulation F. Exemption for assess
ments on assessablestock and for
assessable stock offered or sold
to realize the amount of assess
ment up to $300,000.
Rules 234-236: Exernpions of first
lien notes, securities of coopera
tive housing corporations, and
shares offered in connection with
certain transactions.
Under Section 3(c) of the Securities
Act, the Commission IS authorized to
adopt rules and regulations exempting se
cunties issued by a small business in
vestment company under the Small Busi
ness Investment Act. The Commission has
adopted Regulation E,which conditionally
exempts such securities issued by compa
nies registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 up to a maximum
offering price of $500,000. The regulation
IS substantially similar to Regulation A,
described below.
34

Regulation A
Regulation A permits a company to ob
tain needed capital not in excess of
$500,000 (including underwriting com
missions) in anyone year from a public
offering of ItS securities Without registra
tion, provided specified conditions are
met. Among other things, a notification
and offering circular supplying basic in
formation about the company and the
securities offered must be filed with the
Cornrnissron
and the offering Circular
must be used in the offering. In addition,
Regulation A permits selling shareholders
not in a control relationship with the is
suer to offer In the aggregate up to $300,
000 of securrties which would not be in
cluded in computing the issuer's $500,
000 ceiling. During the fiscal year, the
Commission amended Regulation A, ef
fective August I, 1973, to require, in the
case of new ventures, delivery of the of
fering circular to prospective purchasers
48 hours in advance of the mailing of a
confirmation of sale. The Regulation was
also amended to require dealers trading
in securities offered under the Regulation
where the issuers are not subject to the
reporting requirements of the Exchange
Act, to deliver an offering circular for a
period of 90 days after commencement
of the offering to any purchaser who has
not previously received one.
During the 1973 fiscal year, 817 noti
fications were filed under Regulation A
covering proposed offerings of $298,634,
215 compared with 1,087 notifications

lion in the prior year. A total of 578 re
ports of sales were filed reporting aggre
gate sales of $106,395,501. Such reports
must be filed every 6 months while an
offering is in progress and upon its ter
mination. Sales reported during fiscal
1972 had totaled $107 million. Various
features of Regulation A offerings over the
past 3 years are presented In the statisti
cal section of this report.
In fiscal 1973, the Commission tem
porarily suspended Regulation A exernp
tions With respect to 20 issuers where it
had reasonto believe there had been non

compliance with the conditions of the
regulation or with the disclosure stand
ards, or where the exemption was not
available for the securities. Added to 19
cases pending at the beginning of the
fiscal year, this resulted in a total of 39
cases for disposition. Of these the tem
porary suspension order became perma
nent in 20 cases: in 7 by lapse of time, in
4 cases after hearings, and in 9 by ac
ceptance of an offer of settlement. In one
case the temporary suspension order was
vacated. Eighteen cases were pending at
the end of the fiscal year.

CONTINUING DISCLOSURE: THE
1934 SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
The secuntles Exchange Act of 1934
contains significant disclosure provrsions
designed to provide a fund of current ma

security holders who are solicited to ex
ercise their voting rights, or to sell their
securities in response to a tender offer,
are furnished pertinent information.

During the 1973 fiscal year, 725 of
fering sheets and 1,020 amendments
thereto were filed pursuant to Regulation
B and were examined by the Oil and Gas

Issuers of securities registered under
Section 12 must transmit an inforrnatron
statement comparable to proxy material
to security holders from whom proxies
are not solicited wrth respect to a stock
holders' meeting.
During the 1973 fiscal year, 7,023
proxy statements in definitive form were
filed, 7,000 by management
and 23 by
nonmanagement
groups
or lndrvidual
stockholders.
In addition,
141 informa

information
statements
related to 6,820
companies, and pertained to 6,744 meet
ings for the election of directors, 369
special meetings not involving the elec
tion of directors,
and 28 assents and
authorizations.
Aside from the election of directors,
the votes of security holders were so
licited with respect to a variety of mat
ters, including
mergers, consolidations,
acqursitions, sales of assets and drsso
lution of companies (321); authorizations
of new or additional securities, modifica

During the 1973 fiscal year, 401 pro
posals submitted by 56 stockholders for
action at stockholders'
meetings were in
cluded in the proxy statements
of 224
companies.
Typical of such proposals

A total of 264 additional proposals sub

from

the proxy statements

of 117 com

panies In accordance with the provisions
of the rule governing such proposals. The
most common grounds for omission were
that proposals were not submitted
on
time or were not accompanied by a proper
notice of intentron to present the pro
posals.
In fiscal 1973, 23 companies were in
volved In proxy contests for the election
of directors which bring special require
ments into play. In these contests, 451
persons, including both management and
non management,
filed

directors was involved in 18 instances.
In seven of these, management retained
control. Of the remainder, six were set

four were won by
nonmanagement
persons, and one was
pending at year end. In the other five
cases, representation on the board of di
rectors was involved.
Management
re
tained all places on the board in one con
test, opposition candidates won places on
the board in two cases, and two were
pending as of June 30, 1973.

Takeover Bids, Large Acquisitions
Sections 13(d) and (e), and 14(d), (e)
and (f) of the Secunties Exchange Act,
enacted in 1968 and amended In 1970,
provide for full disclosure in cash tender
offers and other stock acquisrtlons
in
volving changes in ownership or control.
These provisrons were designed to close
gaps in the full disclosure provisions of
the secunties laws and to safeguard the
interests of persons who tender their se
curities In response to a tender offer.
During
the
1973 fiscal year, 950
Schedule 130 reports were filed by per
sons or groups which had made acquisi
tions resulting In their ownership of more
than 5 percent of a class of securities.
Seventy-five such reports were filed by
persons or groups making tender offers,
which, if successful, would result in more
than 5 percent ownership. In addition, 37
Schedule 140 reports were filed on solici
tations or recommendations
in a tender
offer by a person

other than the maker

of the offer. Ten statements

were filed for

the replacement of a majority of the board
of directors otherwise than by stockholder
vote. Onestatement was filed under a rule
on corporate reacquisitions of securities
while an issuer IS the target of a cash
tender offer.

Insider Reporting
Section 16 of the Securities Exchange
Act and corresponding provisions in the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of
1935 and the Investment Company Act
of 1940 are designed to provide other
stockholders and investors generally with
information on insider securities trans
actions and holdings, and to prevent un
fair use of confidential information by
Insiders to profit from short-term trading
in a company's securities.
Section 16(a) of the Exchange Act re
quires every person who beneficially
owns, directly or indirectly, more than
10 percent of any class of equity security
which is registered under Section 12, or
who is a director or an officer of the
issuer of any such security, to file state
ments with the Commission disclosing
the amount of all equity securities of the
issuer of which he is the beneficial owner
and changes in such ownership. Copies
of such statements must be filed with ex
changeson which the securities are listed.
Sirrular provisions applicable to insiders
of registered public-utility holding com
panies and registered closed-end invest
ment companies are contained in the
Holding Company and Investment Com
pany Acts.
In fiscal 1973, 111,689 ownership re
ports were filed. These included 17,850
initial statements of ownership on Form
3, 87,791 statements of changes in
ownership on Form 4, and 6,048 amend
ments to previously filed reports.
All ownership reports are made avail
able for public inspection when filed at
the Commission's office In Washington
and at the exchanges where copies are
filed. In addition, the information con
tained in reports flied With the Commis
sion is summarized and published In the
monthly "Official Summary of Security
Transactions and Holdings," which is dis
38

tributed bythe Government Printing Office
to about 11,500 subscribers.

ACCOUNTING
The securities acts reflect a recogni
tion by Congress that dependable finan
cial statements are Indispensable to in
formed investment decisions. A major
objective of the Commission has been to
Improve accounting and auditing stand
ards and to assist in the establishment
and maintenance of high standards of
professional conduct by public account
ants. The primary responsibility for this
program rests With the Chief Accountant
of the Commission.
Under the Commission's broad rulemaking power, it has adopted a basic
accounting regulation (Regulation S-X)
which, together With opinions on account
ing principles published as "Accounting
Series Releases," governs the form and
content of financial statements filed
under the securities laws. The Commis
sion has also formulated rules on ac
counting and auditing of broker-dealers
and prescribed uniform systems of ac
counts for companies subject to the Pub
lic Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.
The accounting rules and opinions of the
Cornrnlssron, and its decisions in partic
ular cases, have contributed to clarifica
tion and wider acceptanceof the account
ing principles and practices and auditing
standards developed by the profession
and generally followed In the preparation
of financial statements.
However,the specific accounting rules
and regulations-except for the uniform
systems of accounts which are regula
tory reports-prescribe accounting prin
ciples to be followed only in certain lim
ited areas. In the large area of financial
reporting not covered by its rules, the
Commission's principal means of protect
ing investors from Inadequate or im
proper financial reporting is by requiring
a report of an independent public ac
countant, based on an audit performed in
accordance with generally accepted au
diting standards, which expresses an
opinion whether the financial statements
are presented fairly in conformity with

accounting principles and practices that
are recognized as sound and have at
tained general acceptance. The require
ment that the opinion be rendered by an
independent accountant, which was ini
tially established under the Securities
Act of 1933, is designed to secure for the
benefit of public investors the detached
objectivity and the skill of a knowledge
able professional person not connected
with management.
The accounting staff reviews the finan
cial statements filed with the Commis
sion to insure that the required stand
ards are observed and that the account
ing and auditing procedures do not re
main static in the face of changes and
new developments in financial and eco
nomic conditions. New methods of doing
business, new types of business, the com
bining of old businesses, the use of more
sophisticated securities, and other in
novations create accounting problems
which require a constant reappraisal of
the procedures. It IS anticipated that in
fiscal 1974, a new publication senes will
be initiated. It Will provide information
to the public regarding informal admirus
trative practices and gurdellnes developed
by the accounting staff with respect to
specific accounting and auditing prob
lems considered in the review of the finan
cial data filed.

Relations With the Accounting

Profession

In order to keep abreast of changing
conditions, and in recognition of the need
for a continuous exchange of views and
information between the Commission's
accounting staff and outside accountants
regarding appropriate accounting and au
diting pohcies, procedures and practices,
the staff maintains continurng contact
with individual accountants and various
professional organizations. The latter in
clude the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) and the Fi
nancial Accounting Standards Board
(FASB), the principal professional or
ganizations concerned with the develop
ment and improvement of accounting and

auditing standards and practices. The
Chief Accountant also meets regularly
with his counterparts in other regulatory
agencies to improve coordination on poli
cies and actions between the agencies.
Because of its many foreign regis
trants and the vast and increasing for
eign operations of Amencan companies,
the Commission has an interest in the
improvement of accounting and auditing
principles and procedures on an interna
tional basis. To promote such improve
ment, the Chief Accountant, in October
1972, participated in the 10th Interna
tional Congressof Accountants in Sydney,
Australia, and held informal discussions
with representatrves of the Ministry of
Finance in Tokyo. In March 1973, he con.
ferred with foreign accountants in Mex
ico City. A committee to develop baSIC
lnternatronal accounting standards was
recently formed by representatives of ac
countancy groups from nine countries.
The Commission Will cooperate closely
with the committee In its efforts to pro
mote improvements.

Accounting and Auditing Standards
The FASBhas supplanted the Account
ing Principles Board (APB) of the AICPA
as the orgamzatron which establishes
standards of financial accounting and
presentation for the guidance of issuers
and public accountants. A new organiza
tional structure had been recommended
by a committee appomted by the AICPAin
early 1971 to explore ways of irnprovmg
this function. Under the new structure,
a financial accounting foundation consist
ing of representatives of leading profes
sional organizations appoints the seven
members of the FASBwho serve on a sal
aried, full-time basis, and the members
of an Advisory Council to the Board who
serve on a voluntary basis. The Commis
sion endorsed the new structure, which
it feels will provide operational efficien
cies and insure an impartial Viewpoint in
the development of accounting standards
on a timely basis.
The Chief Accountant and the FASB
have developed liaison procedures for
39

consultation on projects of either the
Board or the SEC which are of mutual
interest. The Board has moved expedi
tiously in adopting an initial agenda cov
ering seven topics which urgently require
consideration. They include accounting
for foreign currency translation, accrual
of future losses, reporting by diversified
companies, accounting for leases by
lessee and lessor, accounting for such
costs as research and development, ma
teriality criteria, and broad qualitative
standards for financial reporting.
Another committee was appointed in
early 1971 by the AICPAto study and re
fine the objectives of financial state
ments. It has studied the basic questions
of who needs financial statements, what
information should be provided, how it
should be communicated, and how much
of it can be provided through the account
ing process. The committee's conclusions
and recommendations will provide valua
ble guidance to the FASB in determining
the direction and future priorities of its
efforts.
During the fiscal year, the APB effected
significant improvements in accounting
and financial reporting standards through
the issuance of seven opinions pertain
ing to accounting for stock issued to em
ployees, early extinguishment of debt,
accounting for lease transactions by
manufacturer or dealer lessors, interim
financia I reporting, accounting for non
monetary transactions, reporting the re
sults of operations, and disclosure of
lease commitments by lessees.The Board
or its chairman also approved for publica
tion Accounting Guides prepared by other
committees of the AICPA on the subjects
of accounting for retail land sales, profit
recognition on sales of real estate, and
accounting for motion picture films all of
which will Improve practices in these
areas of accounting. Improvements in
auditing standards were also effected dur
ing the fiscal year by the AICPA'sissuance
of Audit GUides applicable to stock life
insurance companies, savings and loan
associations, broker-dealers, and invest
ment companies.
40

Other Developments
During the fiscal year the Commission
issued 18 Accounting Series Releases to
provide interpretations or gurdelines on
matters of accounting princrples and au
diting standards, to require improved dis
closure of financial information by
amendment of reporting forms or Regula
tion S-X, or to announce decisions in dis
ciplinary proceedings under Rule 2(e) of
the Commission's Rules of Practice con
cerning accountants appearing before it.
An advisory release 17 was issued which
set forth current guidelines employed by
the staff in resolving questions concern
ing the independence of accountants in
relation to their clients who are regis
trants of the Commission. Two interpreta
tive releases 18 were issued pertaining to
the applicability of pooling-of-interests ac
counting in certain situations connected
with Rule 145 under the Securities Act.
Other interpretative releases dealt With
the reporting of leases in financial state
ments of lessees," disclosure of contin
gent liabilities arising under the Economic
Stabilization Act of 1970,"°accounting for
catastrophe reserves," financial state
ments of life insurance companies," and
the reporting of cash flow and other re
lated data."
In conjunction with the Division of In
vestment Management Regulation, an ad
visory release 24 was Issued discussing the
development of an adequate economic
data base for mutual fund sales charges.
This release was intended to stimulate
comments during hearings on mutual
fund distribution and the potential im
pact of the repeal of Section 22(d) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940.
A general revision of Article 9 of Regu
lation S-X, pertaining to financial state
ments of banks and bank holding com
panies, was adopted"" in consonance
with major revisions made in the prior
fiscal year in several other sections of the
regulation. Subsequently, two releases"
were issued containing Interpretations of
various items in the revisions and minor
amendments to them.

Amendments to various registration
and reporting forms were adopted in a release " to require more detailed and
timely reporting, and timely review by independent accountants, of extraordinary
or unusual charges and credits to income
or provisions for material losses effected
by registrants.
Additional proposals for amendments
to Regulation S-X were issued for public
comment which would require improved
disclosures in registrants' financial data
regarding accounting policies followed,"
components of income tax expense,"
leased assets and related lease commitments,"" and compensating balances, effective interest rates on borrowings and
other items affecting liquidity." After
comments on these proposals are received and considered, amendments to
the regulations will be issued.
In connection with administrative proceedings under Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice, the Commission
permanently disqualified an accountant
from practice before it," accepted the resignations of three others," and censured one accountant." In another actron." based upon the entry of a consent judgment of permanent injunction
against an accounting firm in an action
brought by the Commission, the Commission ordered that the firm be: (1) prohibited, for a period of 30 days, from accepting new professional engagements
from new clients which could be expected
to result, within a year, in filings, submissions or certifications with or to the Commission; (2) prohibited, for a specified period, from effecting any merger with or
acquisition of any other accounting firm
without first submitting to the Chief Accountant of the Commission evidence
that its procedures respecting mergers
or acquisitions are being followed; and
(3) required to permit an investigation to
ascertain whether it is conducting its professional practice in compliance with the
standards and procedures required by
the injunction.

EXEMPTIONS FOR
INTERNATIONAL BANKS
Section 15 of the Bretton WoodsAgreement Act, as amended, exempts from registration securities Issued, or guaranteed
as to both principal and interest, by the
International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development. The Bank IS required
to file with the Commission such annual
and other reports on securities as the
Commission determines to be appropriate. The Commission has adopted rules
requiring the Bank to file quarterly reports
and copies of annual reports of the Bank
to its Board of Governors. The Bank is
also required to file advance reports of
any distribution in the United States of
its primary obligations. The Commission,
acting in consultation With the National
Advisory Board on International Monetary
and Financial Problems, is authorized to
suspend the exemption for securities issued or guaranteed by the Bank. The following summary of the Bank's activities
reflects information obtained from the
Bank. Except where otherwise indicated,
all amounts are expressed In U.S. dollar
equivalents as of June 3D, 1973.
Net income for the year was $186 million, compared With $183 million the previous year. At July 31,1973, the Bank had
taken no action regarding disposition of
its net income for fiscal 1973.
Repayments of principal on loans received by the Bank dUring the year
amounted to $455 million, and a further
$123 million was repaid to purchasers of
portions of loans. Total principal repayments by borrowers through June 3D,
1973, aggregated $5.3 billion, including
$3.3 billion repaid to the Bank and $2
billion repaid to purchasers of borrowers'
obligations sold by the Bank.
Outstanding borrowings of the Bank
were $8.9 billion at June 3D, 1973. During
the year, the bank borrowed $440 million
through the Issuance of 2.year U.S. dollar
bonds to central banks and other governmental agencies in some 60 countnes; D. M. 1.2 billion (U.S. $371 million) in Germany; 180 billion yen (U.S.
$605 million) in Japan; SwF 100 million
(U.S. $31 million) in Switzerland; KD 27.5
41

million (U.S. $84 million) in Kuwait; and
the equivalent
of U.S. $153 million in
other countries outside the United States.
The above U.S. dollar equivalents
are
based on officral exchange rates at the
times of the respective borrowings. The
Bank also issued $10 million in bonds
that had been sold in previous years un
der delayed delivery contracts.
These borrowings,
in part, refunded
maturing Issues amounting to the equiv
alent of $518 million. After retirement of
$60 million
equivalent
of obligations
through sinking fund and purchase fund
operations,
the Bank's outstanding
bor
rowings showed an increase of $1.9 billion
from the previous year, of which $1 bil
lion represented appreciation in terms of
U.S. dollars of the value of the non-dollar
currencies in which the debt was denom

mated.
The Inter-American Development Bank
Act, which authorizes the United States to
participate in the Inter-American Develop
ment Bank, provides an exemption for
certain secunties which may be issued
or guaranteed
by the Bank similar to
that provided for securities
of the In
ternational
Bank for Reconstruction
and
Development. Acting pursuant to this au
thorrty, the Commission
adopted Regu
lation lA, which requires the Bank to file
with the Commission
substantially
the
same type of information, documents and
reports as are required from the Inter
national Bank for R'econstruction and De
velopment. The following data reflects in
formation
submitted by the Bank to the
Commission.
On June 30, 1973, the outstanding
funded debt of the Ordinary Capital re
sources of the Bank was the equivalent of
$1.3 billion, reflecting a net increase in
the past year of the equivalent of $230

FREEDOM OF INFORMATION
ACT LITIGATION
The meaning of various exemptions
from the general disclosure requirements
of the Freedom of Information Act was
the subject of litigation Involving the
Commission dunng the fiscal year.
In Steadman Security Corporation v.
SEC.,'o parties to a then pending ad.
ministrative proceeding, who had been
denied discovery of the contents of the
Commission's Investigatory file, sought
to obtain access to the file pursuant to
the Freedom of Information Act." The
United States District Court for the Dis.
trict of Columbia granted the Commis
sion's motion for summary judgment and
refused to enjoin the administrative pro
ceeding, holding that the documents
sought were exempt from the disclosure
requirements of the act because they
were "Investigatory files compiled for
45

law enforcement purposes ....
" ss The
court further held that some of the documents were exempt because they were
"commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or
confidential." 39 While the court recognized that it might, in a proper case,
have junsdiction to enjoin an agency
proceeding pending resolution of a claim
under the Act, It did not find thrs to be
such a case. The court also held that it
did not have junsdlctlon to review the
order entered by the administrative law
Judge In the administrative proceeding,
which had denied the plaintiffs discovery of the documents they sought. That
order was held to be reviewable only by
the Commission and thereafter a United
States Court of Appeals.
In Moore v. S.E.C.,'" the United States
District Court for the District of Columbia
granted the Commission's motion for
summary judgment in an action brought
under the Freedom of Information Act
to obtain disclosure of transcripts of
testimony given in the course of the Commlssron's investigation into the collapse
of the Penn Central railroad company.
The Commission successfully argued
that even though the non-public transcripts had been utilized in the preparation of a Commission staff study on the
Penn Central debacle," which study had
been made public, the transcripts were,
nonetheless, exempt from disclosure
under the Act as "investigatory files
compiled for law enforcement purposes ... ," particularly since enforcement action was under active consideration at the time the disclosure request
was made.

Regulation of
Securities Markets

In addition to the disclosure provisions
discussed in the preceding chapter, the
Exchange Act assigns to the Commission significant regulatory responsibilities for securities markets and persons
in the securities business. The Act, among
other things, requires securities exchanges to register with the Commission
and provides for Commission supervision of the self-regulatory responsibilities
of registered exchanges. The Act requires registration and regulation of
brokers and dealers doing business in
the over-the-counter markets, and permits registration of associations of
brokers or dealers exercising self-regulatory functions under Commission supervision. The Act also contains provisions
designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive,
and manipulative acts and practices on
the- exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets. Some recent developments
concerning regulation of the securities
markets are discussed in Part 1.

REGULATION OF EXCHANGES
Registration
The Exchange Act generally requires
an exchange to register with the Commission as a national securities exchange
unless the Commission exempts it from
registration because of the limited vollime of transactions. As of June 3D, 1973,
the following 13 securities exchanges
were registered with the Commission:

American Stock Exchange, Inc.
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board Options Exchange,
Inc!
Chicago Board of Trade •
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange,Inc.
National Stock Exchange
NewYork Stock Exchange,Inc.
Pacific Stock Exchange,Inc.
PBWStock Exchange,Inc.
Intermountain Stock Exchange
SpokaneStock Exchange

Delisting
Pursuant to Section 12(d) of the Exchange Act, securities may be stricken
from listing and registration upon application to the Commission by an exchange, or withdrawn from listing and
registration upon application by an issuer,
in accordance with the rules of the exchange and upon such terms as the Commission may impose for the protection of
investors.
The standards for delisting vary among
the exchanges, but generally delisting actions are based on one or a combination
of the following factors: (1) the number
of publicly held shares or shareholders
is insufficient (often as a result of an
acquisition or merger); (2) the market
value of the outstanding shares or the
trading volume is inadequate; (3) the
company no longer satisfies the ex51

change's criteria for earnings or financial
condition; or (4) required reports have
not been filed with the exchange.
During fiscal 1973, the Commission
granted exchange applications for the delisting of 100 stock issues and 32 bond
issues. The largest number of applica
tions came from the New York Stock Ex
change (33 stocks and 30 bonds). The
number of applications granted other ex
changes are American (27 stocks); Na
tional (23 stocks); PBW (6 stocks); Mid
west (5 stocks and 2 bonds); Pacific (3
stocks); Cincinnati, Detroit and Inter
mountain (1 stock each).
The Commission also granted the ap
plication of one issuer to withdraw its
securities from listing and registration
on the Pacific Stock Exchange.
In Commission review of a delisting
action, the Cornrnissron granted the
American Stock Exchange'sapplication to
delist the stock of Ecological Science
Corp. (ESC).' The delisting application
was based on ESC's failure to meet the
exchange's guidelines for continued list
ing of its secunties due to net losses in its
two most recent fiscal years and a net
tangible asset deficit. In its decision, the
Commission reiterated its view that in
evaluating delisting applications it IS not
the Commission's function to substitute
its judgment for that of an exchange,and
that where the rules of an exchange with
respect to delisting have been complied
with, the Commission is required to grant
a dehsting application, its authority in
such cases being limited to the imposi
tion of such terms for the protection of
investors as it deems necessary.

Exchange Disciplinary Actions
Although the Exchange Act does not
specifically grant the Commission au
thority to monitor disciplinary actions
taken by exchanges,' each national se
curities exchange reports to the Commis
sion action taken against members and
member firms and their associated per
sons for violation of any rule of the ex
change or of the ExchangeAct or of any
rule or regulation under the Act.
52

During the fiscal year, 6 exchanges re
ported 62 separate disciplinary actions in
cluding the imposition in 3 cases of fines
ranging from $10 to $30,000; the revoca
tion of the membership of 5 firms and the
expulsion of 3 individuals; the suspen
sion from membership (for periods rang
ing from 1 month to 1 year) of 6 mem
ber firms and 16 Individuals; and the
censure of 26 member firms. The ex
changes also reported the imposition of
various other sanctions against 13 regis
tered representatives and other employ
ees of member firms.

Exchange Rules
The Commission's staff continually re
views the rules and practices of the na
tion's registered securities exchanges to
deterrnrne the adequacy and effectiveness
of the self-regulatory scheme. To facili
tate Commission oversight, each national
securities exchange is required to file
with the Commission a report of any
proposed change in rules or practices
net less than 3 weeks (or such shorter
period as the Commission may author
ize) before acting to effectuate the
change.
During the fiscal year, 163 proposed
changes in exchange rules and practices
were submitted to the Commission. The
following are among the more significant:
1. In 1935 all of the national securi
ties exchanges adopted, at the Commis
sion's request, a rule which provided that
no specialist or odd-lot dealer, no firm
in which such specialist or odd-lot dealer
was a participant, and no partner of such
firm, could acquire, hold or grant, directly
or indirectly, any interest in a put, call,
straddle, or option in any security in
which such specialist or odd-lot dealer
was registered. All the national securities
exchanges also prohibited a member
while on the floor from initiating the pur
chase or sale of securities on the ex
change for any account in which he or his
firm or any participant for the firm held
or had granted an option.
Several firms presently dorng business
on other exchangesas specialists or mar
ket makers applied for membership on

the new Chicago Board Options Exchange
(CBOE). Some of those exchanges have
been considering changes In the above
rules in order to permit such firms to act
(and continue to act) as specialists, mar
ket makers or floor traders in the same
secuntres that underlie options In which
SLJchfirms would act as dealers on the
CBOE and perhaps elsewhere. In view
of the actual and potential abuses which
led to the original adoption of those rules,
the Division of Market Regulation has re
quested the exchanges not to change
their rules to permit such activities
pending the Commission's review of the
Issues raised by the proposed changes.'
2. All of the exchanges adopted rules in
connection with the Commission's new
Rule 19b-2 under the Exchange Act. For
further drscussion of these changes, see
Part 1.
3. The New York Stock Exchange's
Wholly-owneddepository and the Midwest
Stock Exchange's Wholly-owned clearing
and depository entity submitted by-law
and rule changes and other information
to the Cornmlssron in connection with
their respective proposals to operate as
limited purpose trust companies. The pro
posals included the proposed rules under
which the depositories would operate and
the procedures and systems they would
utilize. After consideration of the pro
posals, the Cornrmssion commented fa.
vorably on them, and they were adopted.

Litigation on Exchange Rules
Thill v. New York Stock ExchangeThis case raises the issue of whether the
NYSE's fixed minimum commission rate
system, and the rules necessary to pre
serve the integrity of that system such
as the anti-rebate rule, are legal under
antitrust laws. In 1970, the Court of
Appeals for the Seventh Circuit reversed
a district court order granting summary
Judgment to the Exchange." The Com
mission and the Antitrust Division of the
Department of Justice subsequently inter
vened in the district court proceedings.
In 1972, during the course of those pro
ceedings, the Exchange appealed to the
Seventh Circuit the district court's denial

of its motion to refer to the Commission
the question of whether the NYSE's anti
rebate rule is "necessary to make the
Securities ExchangeAct work." The Com
mission opposed the NYSE's request for
a primary jurisdiction reference on the
ground that it had already irnphcrtly
found the exchange's rule "necessary or
appropriate" under the standards of Sec
tion 19(b) of the Exchange Act. The
Seventh Circuit sustained the order deny
ing referral, but stated that the Com
mission's argument that "the anti-rebate
rule should be reviewed by the SEC
under the standards of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 rather than by a
court [under the standards of the anti
trust laws]" had been adversely decided
to the SEC's position in the earlier ap
peal.' The case then proceeded to trial.
While the Cornmissron did not partici
pate on a day-to-day basis, It did file post
trial briefs in which it took the position
that the antitrust action was incompatible
with its pervasive ongoing regulatory
jurisdiction
over national securities
exchanges.

Inspection
An important element of the Commis
sion's supervision of exchange self-regu
lation IS its program of regular inspec
tions of various phases of exchange
activity. These mspections enable the
Cornmissronto recommend, where appro
priate, Improvements designed to in
crease the utility and effectiveness of

selt-regulation.
In fiscal 1973, the Commission's staff
conducted 13 Inspections. Included were
general Inspections Involving the Boston,
Cincinnati, Chicago Board Options, Mid
west (two general Inspections) and Pa
cific Stock Exchanges. Five separate in
spections were made at the New York
Stock Exchange covering ItS net capital
rule, advertising rules, financial surveil
lance, stock watch and floor surveillance
(including specialists), and disciplinary
activities.
In additron an inspection was made of
the Pacific Stock Exchange's depository.

lJIF NASD

The Exchange Act provides for regis
tration with the Commission of national
securrties associations and establishes
standards and requirements for the reg
istration and operation of such associa
tions. The Act contemplates that such
associations will serve as a rnedrurn for
self-regulation by over-the-counter brok
ers and dealers. In order to be eligible for
regrstration,
an association must have
rules designed to protect investors and
the public interest, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, and to meet
other statutory requirements. National se
cunties associations operate under the
general supervisory authority of the Com
mission, which is authorized, among
other things, to review disciplinary ac
nons taken by an assocratron, to disap
prove changes In association rules and
to alter or supplement rules relating to
specified matters. 'The National Associa

preclude members from dealing with a
nonmember broker or dealer except on
the same terms and conditions and at
the same pnce as the member deals with
the general public. The NASD has
adopted such rules. As a practical mat
ter, therefore, membership is necessary
for profitable participation In underwrit
ings since members may properly grant
price concessions, discounts and similar
allowancesonly to other members.
At the close of the fiscal year, the
NASD had 3,884 members, reflecting a
net loss of 346 members durrng the year.
This loss reflects the net result of 228
adrrussions to and 574 terminations of
membership. The number of members'
branch offices nevertheless increased by
206, to 6,790, as a result of the opening
of 1,454 new offices and the closing of
1,248. DUringthe fiscal year, the number
54

of registered representatives and princi
pals (these categories include all part
ners, officers, traders, salesmen and
other persons employed by or affiliated
with member frrrns in capacities which
require registration) increased by 7,125
to 205,028 as of June 3D, 1973.8 This in
crease reflects the net result of 28,203
initial registrations, 27,466 re-registra
tions and 48,544 terminations of registra
tion during the year.
DUring the fiscal year, the NASD ad
ministered 72,142 qualification examina
tions of which 44,129 were for NASD
qualification, 2,567 for the Commission's
SECDprogram, and the balance for other
agencies, including major exchanges and
various states.

NASD RULES
Under the Exchange Act, the NASD
must fIle for Commission review copies
of any proposed rules or rule amend
ments 30 days prior to their intended
effective date. Any rule changes or addi
tions may be disapproved by the Com
mission If it finds them to be inconsistent
With the requirements of the Act. The
Commission also normally reviews, In ad
vance of publicatron, general policy state
ments, directives, and Interpretations
proposed to be issued by the Associa
tion's Board of Governors pursuant to its
powers to administer and interpret
NASD rules.
During the fiscal year, numerous
changes in or additions to NASD rules,
polrciss and interpretations were sub
mitted to the Cornrrussron for its con.
sideration. Among the more significant
whrch were not disapproved by the Com
rrusslon were:
(1) Amendments to the Code of Arbi
tration Procedure to authorize the Board
of Governors to compel a member to
arbitrate any dispute arising out of or in
connection With its securities business,
including disputes between member firms
and their associated persons, at the in
stance of a member or an associated per
son. The Code previously provided for
arbitration only of disputes arising out of
a securities transaction at the Instance

of another member or a public customer.
In addition, the eligibility period for the
submission of a dispute to arbitration was
extended from 3 to 5 years.
(2) Amendments to Schedule D of the
NASD By-laws to provide for restructuring
the daily lists made available to nEWS
papers and other media of prices and
volume in securities quoted on NASDAQ,
automated quotation
the Assoclatron's
system. Under the new format, the NASD
makes available for pubhcation price and
volume data of the 1,400 most active
NASDAQ stocks as determmed by trad
ing volume" and price data only for the
900 next most actrve NASDAQ stocks.
Securities must also meet certain price
criteria to be eligible for inclusion on
either list.
At the end of the fiscal year, another
significant rule proposal was pending be
fore the Commission. This proposal,
which would add a new Section 34 and
Appendix C to Article III of the NASD's
Rules of Fair Practice, would require
NASD members to obtain blanket fidelity
bond coverage. Every NASD member hav
ing employees which is required to join
the Securities Investor Protection Cor
poration and is subject to the Commis
sion's net capital rule, would be required
to obtain such coverage.

Inspections
The Commission is charged with the
general oversight of national securities
assocratrons
10 the performance of their
self-regulatory functions, and the staff
conducts periodic inspections of various
phases of NASD activity. DUring the frscal
year, the staff inspected the overall opera
tions of the Association's district offices
in Atlanta, Cleveland, Philadelphia and
New Orleans. These inspections included
a broad review of the operations of each
district office, including its examination
program, financial morutoring and dis
ciplinary policies and procedures in order
to determine their effectiveness and,
where appropriate, to make recommenda
tions for changes in existing programs or
the institution of new programs. In ad

ditlon, the staff reviewed the operations
of NASDAQand the NASD's Membership
Department.

NASD Disciplinary Actions
The Commission receives from the
NASD copies of Its decrsions in all cases
where disciplinary action IS taken against
members and persons associated with
members. Generally, such actions are
based on allegations that the respondents
violated specified provisions of the
NASD's Rules of Fair Practice. Where vio
lations by a member are found, the NASD
may impose sanctions which include ex
pulsion. suspension. fine or censure. If
the violator IS an individual, hrs registra
tion with the Association may be sus
pended or revoked, he may be suspended
or barred from being associated with any
member, and he may be fmed and/or
censured.
During the past fiscal year, the NASD
reported to the Commission its final dis
position of 629 disciplinary complaints
(including
210 cornplamts involving
NASDAQ)in which 526 members and 451
mdividuals were named as respondents.
Complaints against 62 members and 64
individuals were dismissed for failure to
establish the alleged violations, Forty-two
members were expelled from membership
and 20 members were suspended for
periods ranging from 1 day to 6 months.
In many of these cases, a fine was also
imposed. In 384 cases, members were
fined amounts ranging from $25 to $25,
000, and in 18 cases members were
censured.
In disciplinary sanctions imposed on in
dividuals associated with member firms,
98 persons were barred or revoked, and
78 had their regrstratrons suspended for
periods ranging from 1 day to 5 years. In
addition, 211 other individuals were cen
sured and lor fined amounts ranging from
$100 to $25,000.

Review of NASD Disciplinary

Actions

Disciplinary action taken by the NASD
is subject to review by the Commission
on ItS own motion or on the timely appli
55

cation of any aggrieved person. In these
cases, effectiveness of any penalty im
posed by the NASD is automatically
stayed pending Commission review, un
less the Commission otherwise orders
after notice and opportunity for hearing.
If the Commissron finds that the Vis
ciplined party committed the acts found
by the NASD and that such acts violated
the specified rules, the Commission must
sustain the NASD's action-unless
it
finds that the penalties imposed are ex
cessive or oppressive, in which case it
must reduce them or set them aside.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, 25
proceedings to review NASD disciplinary
decisions were pending before the Com
mission and, during the year, 22 addi
tional cases were brought up for review.
The Commission disposed of 25 cases. In
nine cases, the Commission affirmed the
NASD's action. It permitted the with
drawal of two applications for review and
remanded one case back to the NASD.
In nine cases,the NASD's findings and/or
penalties were modified, and in four cases
the NASD's action was set aside. At the
close of the fiscal year, 22 cases were
pending.

Review of NASD Membership
Action
1he Exchange Act and NASD By-laws
provide that no broker or dealer can be
an NASD member if he or any person
associated with him is subject to speci
fied disabrlitles. These disabilities can be
waived only with specific approval of the
Commission. Commission approval or a
direction by it to admit a person to mem
bership in the Association or to continue
the. membership of any person is gen
erally made after initial submission to
the NASD by the member or applicant
for membership.
The NASD in its discre
tion may then file an application with the
Commission on behalf of the petitioner. If
the NASD refuses to sponsor an appli
cation, the broker or dealer may apply
directly to the Commission for an order
directing the NASD to admit him to or
56

to continue him in membership. At the
beginnmg of the fiscal year, eight appll
cations for approval of admission to or
continuance in membership were pend
ing. During the year, nine additional ap
plications were filed, sevenwere approved
and six were withdrawn, leaving four ap
plications pending at the end of the year.

BROKER. DEALER REGULATION
Registration
Brokers and dealers who use the mails
or other means of interstate commerce in
the conduct of an over-the-counter se
curities business are required to register
with the Commission.
As of June 30, 1973, 4,407 brokerdealers were registered compared with
4.734 a year earlier. This reduction reo
suited from the termination of 704 regis
trations as against only 377 new applica
tions filed. For further comparative sta
tistics, see the statistical section.
On July 3, 1973, the Commission is
sued a proposal to amend Form BD, the
form usedto apply for broker-dealer regis
trction and for amendments to that

appllcaticn."
The principal change would add an in
quiry as to whether the registrant, ap
plicant or certain associated persons
were ever an officer, director, general
partner, 10 percent shareholder or con
trolling person of a broker or dealer for
which a Securities Investor Protection
Corporation (SIPC) trustee was ap
pornted. Under the SIPCAct the Commis
sion may bar or suspend such persons if,
after notice and opportunity for hear
ing, it finds such action to be in the pub
lic: interest.
The Commission found that many
broker-dealer failures which resulted in
the appointment of a SIPC trustee have
involved a gross failure to maintain
proper books and records and substan
tial violations of financial responsibility
rules. The proposed amendment is de
signed in part to detect an attempt on the
part of persons who may have been re
sponsible for such violations to effect re

entry into the securities business, giving
the Commission an opportunity to take
remedial action prior to the effective date
of registration.

Financial Reports
Registered broker-dealers are required
to file annual reports of financial condi
tion with the Commission. Generally,
these reports must be certified by an
independent public accountant. Dunng
the fiscal year, 4,446 annual reports were
filed, compared to a total of 4,224 filed
during fiscal 1972.

Income and Expense Reports
In 1968, the Commission adopted Ex
change Act Rule 17a-lO, effective Janu
ary I, 1969. The rule requires registered
broker-dealers and exchange members to
file income and expense reports for each
calendar year with the Commission or
with a registered self-regulatory organi
zation (an exchange or the NASD) which
has qualified a plan under the rule. The
self-regulatory organizations are required
to send copies of the reports filed with
them to the Commission.
Since 1970, the Commission has ap
proved plans of the NASD,the American,
Midwest, New York and PBW Stock Ex
changes." These plans provide that the
self-regulatory organization will adopt and
implement appropriate internal proce
dures for review of the reports submitted
by members, review all reports filed for
reasonableness and accuracy, transmit
edited reports to the Commission, and
undertake certain other obligations.
The reports covering calendar year
1972 of SECD broker-dealers 13 and nonNASD members of those exchanges
which have not qualified a plan have been
received and reviewed by the Commis
sion. The 1972 reports of all NASDmem
bers and of non-NASDmembers of those
exchanges which have qualified a plan
have been received by the Commission
from the respective self-regulatory orga
nizations. Information based on these re
ports is included in the statistical section.
11

Early Warning System
Rule 17a-11 was adopted to provide
the Commission and the self-regulatory
authorities with an adequate and timely
flow of Information on the financial and
operational condition of broker-dealers. It
is a part of the early warning system that
the Commission has developed to eval
uate the condition of registered brokerdealers.
The rule has four major provisions:
(1) immediate telegraphic notice to the
Commission and to any self-regulatory
organlzation of which It is a member, fol
lowed by a financial report within 24
hours, when a broker-dealer's net capital
falls below the level required by any cap
ital rule to which it IS subject; (2) the
filing of special monthly reports until its
capital position shows improvement for
3 successive months when a brokerdealer ascertains that its aggregate in
debtedness exceeds 1,200 percent of its
net capital-or that its total net capital
is less than 120 percent of the minimum
net capital required of It by any capital
rule to which It is subject; (3) telegraphic
notice to the appropriate regulatory au
thorities, followed by a written report
within 48 hours, when a broker-dealer's
books and records are not current; and
(4) notification to the Commission by a
self-regulatory organization when it learns
that a member has failed to give notice
or file any report required by the rule.
During the past fiscal year, a total of
339 broker-dealers sent telegrams and/
or filed reports pursuant to the rule.

Advisory Committee on Reports
and Registration
In September 1972, the Commission
appointed an Advisory Committee on
Broker-Dealer Reports and Registration
Requirements composed of knowledge
able persons from the securities indus
try, the accounting and legal professions,
and the Commission's staff to study
methods of simplifying and standardizing
reports and eliminating duplicative rec
ordkeeping requirements.
57

In its report submitted to the Com
mission in December 1972, the Commit
tee concluded that present regulatory
reports submitted by broker-dealers re
quire a wasteful duplication of effort by
firms and regulators. The Committee
made a number of recommendations for
improvement including (1) the elimina
tion of provisions requiring a brokerdealer to file reports concerning its fi
nancial condition and operational activ
ities with more than one regulatory au
thority, and (2) the adoption of the Joint
Regulatory Report of the New York Stock
Exchange, with appropriate modifica
tions, as a replacement for other reports
currently in use, such as Form X-17A-5
and Form X-17A-I0.
In February 1973, the Commission ap
pointed a task force composed of staff
members to analyze the recommenda
tions and to prepare specific proposals in
regard to both the method and cost of
implementing them. The Commission also
sought the advice of self-regulatory au
thorities and SIPCas to the best methods
for implementation of the Committee's
proposals. During the next fiscal year,
the Commission intends to develop and
implement a coordinated report program
with the objective of eliminating duplica
tion.

Broker-Dealer Examinations
The Office of Broker-Dealer Examina
tions was established by the Commission
in January 1972, in order to deal more
effectively with the problems detailed in
the Commission's 1971 "Study of Un
safe and Unsound Practices of Brokers
and Dealers." By creating this new Of
fice, the Commission has substantially
strengthened its continuing efforts to pre
vent a recurrence of the crisis which
confronted the secunties industry in the
years 1968 through 1970. During that
period, there occurred widespread fail
ures of broker-dealer firms, accompanied
by substantial customer losses of cash
and securities. One major outgrowth of
these crises was the passage in 1970 of
the Securities Investor Protection Act.
58

There are three types of examinations
used in the Commission's nationwide pro
gram of broker-dealer examinations:
routine, cause and oversight. Routine ex
aminations cover all aspects of a brokerdealer's operations and generally involve
broker-dealers which are not members
of any self-regulatory organization (SECO
broker-dealers), but members of the selfregulatory organizations are also subject
to such examinations. The Office is work
ing to establish a regular examination
cycle in which each SECO broker-dealer
is examined 30 to 60 days after it be
comes registered with the Commission
and on an annual basis thereafter.
Cause examinations are usually con
ducted as a result of a complaint received
from a customer or another broker-dealer
which indicates a need to review certain
aspects of the operations of a particular
broker-dealer. Cause examinations are
usually limited to the subject matter of
the complaint. The examiner, however,
may enlarge the scope of the examina
tion if he believes that the firm's opera
tions warrant further study.
The oversight examination program is
a two-fold operation consisting of (1)
examinations of members of self-regula
tory organizations to determine if they
are in compliance with the securities laws,
and (2) examination of a member of a
particular self-regulatory organization to
gether with a concurrent review of the
report and working papers of the latest
examination performed by that organiza
tion to determine whether its examination
program is thorough and effective.
In conjunction with its oversight ex
amination functions, the Office has insti
tuted a program of continuous review of
the policies and procedures used by the
various self-regulatory organizations in
examining their members to insure that
stated policies and procedures are being
implemented and that all areas of a
broker-dealer's operations are being
examined.
In fiscal 1973, the Commission con
ducted a total of 1,044 broker-dealer ex
aminations which is a 17 percent increase
over the previous year's total of 893. Of

the 1,044 examinations conducted, 387
were routine, 451 were for cause and
206 were oversight examinations.
In an effort to improve the caliber of
the examination staff of both the Com
mission and self-regulatory authorities,
the Office developed a series of training
courses for broker-dealer examiners.
During fiscal 1973, it conducted or spon
sored six such programs in various areas
of the country. These programs were at
tended by members of the Commission's
staff as well as representatives of the
NASD, the several stock exchanges, the
Federal Reserve Board, SIPC, and various
law enforcement and related agencies.
The Office also supervised the develop
ment of a computerized surveillance sys
tem. The implementation of Phase I of
this system will provide data to be utilized
in coordinating examinations conducted
by the Commission's staff and the various
other regulatory authorities. Work IS con
tinuing on improvements and expansion
of this program in an effort to accumulate
and organize pertinent data concerning
all broker-dealers registered with the
Commission.
In addition to the above-described ac
tivities, members of the staff of the Office
serve on an Advisory Committee on a
Model Compliance Program for BrokerDealers. This Committee, which includes
representatives of the various exchanges
and the NASD, IS considering the feasi
bility of developing a Model Guide to
Broker-Dealer Compliance covering all as
pects of a broker-dealer's regulatory re
sponsibility to its customers.

Rule Changes
Uniform Net Capital Ru/e-On Decem
ber 5, 1972, the Commission proposed
the adoption of a uniform net capital
rule for broker-dealers which will provide
minimum standards for both exchange
members and nonmembers." The most
significant feature of the proposed rule
is a minimum equity requirement aimed
at insuring permanency of broker-dealer
capital. This provision would require that
at least 30 percent of a broker-dealer's
total capitalization consist of equity, thus

limiting the amount of subordinate debt
that could be incurred.
Among other things, the proposed rule
would (1) eliminate the exemption from
the Commission's present net capital rule
for members of exchanges that have net
capital rules deemed more cornprehen
sive than the Commission's, (2) reduce
the maximum permissible ratio of ag
gregate indebtedness to net capital from
20 to 1 to 15 to I, (3) establish minimum
capital requirements for market makers
and writers and endorsers of options,
and (4) include new provisions for the
treatment of stock record differences,
free shipment of securities and dividends
and interest receivable.
The Commission has received com
ments on this proposal and its staff is
currently analyzing those comments.
Reserve and Segregation Require.
ments-The Securities Investor Protec
tion Act of 1970 authorized the Com
mission to prescribe rules regarding the
custody and use of customers' funds and
securities. On January 15, 1973, Rule
15c3-3 under the ExchangeAct became
effective." The rule provides a formula
for the maintenance by broker-dealers of
basic reserveswith respect to customers'
cash and cash realized through the utili
zation of customers' securities, and enun
ciates standards for broker-dealers with
respect to the physical possession or
control of customers' fully-paid and ex
cess margin securities.
The rule is designed, among other
things: (1) to insure that customers'
funds held by a broker-dealer are used
only in safe areas of a broker-dealer's
business relating to the servicing of cus
tomers, or deposited in a reserve bank
account; (2) to require a broker-dealer
promptly to obtain and maintain posses
sion or control of all customers' fullypaid and excess margin securities; (3)
to accomplish a separation of the firm's
brokerage business from other activities;
(4) to require a broker-dealer to maintain
more current records; (5) to motivate
the securities industry to process its
securities transactions in a more expe
dltrous manner; (6) to inhibit the unwar
ranted expansion of a broker-dealer's
59

business through the use of customers'
funds, and (7) to ensure that all fullypaid and excess margrn securities in the
possession or control of a broker-dealer
will constitute property of the customers
entitled thereto, as evidenced by the
broker-dealer's records or as otherwise
established.
Pending further study, the Commis
sion subsequently suspended, with re
spect to exempted securities, the provi
sion of the rule requiring a broker-dealer
to buy-in securities sold for a customer
when the broker does not obtain posses
sion of the secunties within 10 business
days after the settlement date." The
Commission has published releases clari
fyrng the rule for the gurdance of the
broker-dealer community and self-regula
tory authorities."
Margin Exemption for Credit to Mar
ket Makers and Block Positioners-Under
the Exchange Act, the Board of Gover
nors of the Federal Reserve System has
authority to regulate credit in the securi
ties markets while the Commission has
administrative and enforcement respon
sibilities with respect to these credit
regulations.
In 1969, the Board amended its Reg
ulation U to exempt from specified mar
grn requirements loans by banks to
broker-dealers which make over-the
counter markets in securities placed by
the Board on its list of aTC margin stocks.
The Board deemed it desirable, in the
interest of fair and orderly markets, to
grant such an exemption if a brokerdealer met certain net capital require
ments and was a bona fide market
maker. In order to implement the Board's
rule, the Commission adopted Rule 17a
12 under the Exchange Act to require
reports from market makers in aTC
margin stocks. During the fiscal year, the
Commission amended its rule to elimi
nate the filing of reports by brokerdealers which do not use the credit

exemption."
In September 1972, the Board
amended Regulation U to grant a simi
lar exemption to over-the-counter market
makers in listed securities ("third mar
60

ket makers") and broker-dealers who
position blocks of securities in order to
facilitate the sale or purchase by their
customers of quantities which cannot
otherwise be absorbed by normal ex
change facilities. Simultaneously, the
Cornrnissron adopted Rules 17a-16 and
17a-17 under the Exchange Act impos
ing certain minimum net capital and
other requirements on broker-dealers
who desire to use this exemption, and
requinng them to file certarn notices and
reports with the Comrnlssron."
As of June 3D, 1973, 59 broker-dealers
had filed notices that they were using
or intended to apply for aTC market
maker exempt credit under Rule 17a-12;
6 broker-dealers filed notices under Rule
17a-16 that they were using or intended
to use third market maker exempt credit;
and 14 broker-dealers filed notices under
Rule 17a-17 that they had applied or
intended to apply for block positioner
exempt credit.
Reports to Customers-Qn June 30,
1972, the Commission adopted amend
ments to Rule 17a-5 under the Exchange
Act which require broker-dealers (other
than mutual fund dealers and broker.
dealers who do not carry customer funds
or securities) to report their financial
condition to customers." Customers are
to receive quarterly and annual balance
sheets along with statements setting
forth, among other things, the brokerdealer's net capital position.
In addition, the broker-dealer must
make available to its customers for in
spection a statement setting forth any
comments made by the broker-dealer's
independent accountant concerning ma
terial rnadequacies in the broker-dealer's
accounting system, its internal account
ing control or its procedures for safe
guarding securities.
The amended rule also requires brokerdealers to furnish additional financial
statements to the Commission.
Mortgage Dealing Exemptions-The
Commission has been working with the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corpora.
tion (FHLMC) in connection with FHLMC's
responsibility to expand the secondary
market in conventional mortgages (not

guaranteed
or insured by a Federal or
State agency) on residential
property.
As part of this effort, the Commission has
adopted Rule 3a12-1 under Section 3(a)
(12) of the Exchange Act!' The principal
impact of the new rule is that brokerdealers dealing solely in certain mort
gages and other exempt securities
are
not subject to the registration, net capital
and other provisions of the Exchange Act
which are not by their terms applicable to
"exempted
securities."
Transactions
in
securities exempted by Section 3(a)(12)
or Commission rules adopted thereunder
are still subject to the antifraud provisions
of the Exchange Act.

Employment Discrimination-In

No

vember 1972, a petition was filed with
the Commission
requesting that It pro
mulgate
rules requiring
the securities
industry
to take affirmative
action to
eliminate
discrimination
in employment
practices. Smce the petition raised com
plex questions concernmg the Commis
sion's authority
to adopt rules m this
area as well as the merits of adopting
the rules proposed, the Commission
in
vited public comment on the petition."
To aid further
in ItS inquiry, the Com
mission sought and obtained the views
of various governmental
agencies, in
cluding the Department
of Justice. The
comment period, after one extension, ex
pired on March 13, 1973.
The Commission
has received a sub
stantial
number of responses from in
terested
mdividuals
and groups
and
those comments,
along with possible
statutory
bases for adoption of rules of
the type proposed, are currently
being
studied
by the Commission's
Division
of Market Regulation which expects to
submit its conclusions
and recommen
dations to the Commission
in the near
future.

SECO Broker-Dealers

broker-dealers
23

who are not members

DUring the fiscal year, the number of
nonmember
broker-dealers
registered
With the Commission decreased from 294
to 276 and the number of associated per
sons of such firms (i.e., partners, officers,
directors and employees not engaged in
merely clerical or ministerial
functions)
decreased from 20,600 to approximately
16,303'"
(Investors Diversified Services,
Inc., which joined the NASD rn Septem
ber 1972, accounted for a decrease of
5,902 SECO associated persons.)
On December 4, 1972, the Commission
adopted
Rules
and 15blO-9
under the Exchange Act relating to the
public offering by SECO broker-dealers of
their
own securities
or those
of an
affrhate." Similar rules had been adopted
by the NASD as described in the Commis
sion's last annual report."
Rule 15b-l0-8
requires, with respect
to publrc offerings of the secunties of non
member broker-dealers,
whether or not
self-underwritten,
that: (1) certain finan
cial statements
be included in the pro
spectus; (2) sales by stockholders amount
to no more than 25 percent of their re
spective equity interests; (3) the amount
of the offering not exceed three times
the nonmember's
net worth; (4) the non
member's net capital ratio not exceed 10
to 1 after completion of the offering; (5)
certain financial data be sent regularly
to shareholders;
and that (6) no subse
quent offering be made to the public for
at least one year.
Rule 15blo-9

SIPC Litigation
S.E.C. v. Oxford
Securities,
Ltd.:8This was an appeal by the Securities Investor Protection
Corporation
(USIPC")
and the Commission to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
of an order of the district court denying
an application
of SIPC, under the Securities Investor Protection Act," for the
appointment of persons it had designated
to be trustee and counsel to the trustee
for the purpose of liquidating
Oxford, a
broker-dealer
in securities.
The district
court had held that Section 5(a)(2) of the
SIPC legislation,
which provides that a
court supervising a liquidation under the
Act is to appoint as trustee and attorney
for the trustee such persons as SIPC may
62

designate, was unconstitutional
in that it
Imposed purely ministerial duties on the
court, offending the separation of powers
of the legislative, Judicial and executive
branches of the government. The court of
appeals, per curiam, reversed the district
court order, and on remand the persons
designated by SIPC were appointed.

Enforcement

The Commission's enforcement activ
ities, designed to combat securities fraud
and other misconduct, continued at a
high level during the past year. These
activities encompass civil and criminal
court actions as well as administrative
proceedings conducted internally. Where
violations of the securities laws or rules
are established, the sanctions which may
result range from censure by the Com
rmsslon to prison sentences imposed by
a court. The enforcement program is de
signed to achieve as broad a regulatory
impact as possible within the framework
of resources available to the Commis
sion. In light of the capability of selfregulatory and state and local agencies
to deal effectively with certain securities
violations, the Commission seeks to pro
mote effective coordination and coopera
tion>between its own enforcement activ
ities and those of the other agencies.

DETECTION
Complaints
The Commission receives a large vol
ume of communications from the public.
These consist mainly of complaints
against broker-dealers and other mem
bers of the securities community. During
the past year, some 5,000 complaints
against broker-dealers were received,
analyzed and answered. Most of the
above-mentioned complaints dealt with
operational problems, such as the fail

ure to deliver securities or funds
promptly, or the alleged mishandling of
accounts. In addition, there were some
4,000 complaints received concerning
investment advisers, issuers, banks,
transfer agents and mutual funds.
The Commission seeks to assist per
sons in resolving complaints and to fur
nish requested information. Thousands
of investor complaints are resolved
through staff inquiry to firms involved.
While the Commission does not have au
thority to arbitrate private disputes be
tween brokerage firms and investors or
to directly assist investors in the legal
assertion of their personal rights, a com
plaint may lead to the institution of an
investigation or an enforcement proceed
ing, or it may be referred to a self-regu
latory or local enforcement agency.

Market Surveillance
To enable the Commission to carry out
surveillance of the securities markets,
its staff has devised procedures to iden
tify
possible manipulative activities.
These include surveillance of listed se
curities, coordinated with the stock watch
ing operations of the New York, American
and regional stock exchanges.
The Commission's market surveillance
staff maintains a continuous watch of
transactions on the New York and Ameri
can Stock Exchanges and reviews reports

since the subpoenas caJledfor documents

not demonstrate facts showing either the

their enforcement. The court further held
that absent "evidence of abuse" by the
Commission, it was entitled to conduct a
fuJI inquiry into both potential coverage
and potential violation of the Federal se
curities laws. The court did state that the
Commission was not at liberty to act un
reasonably and that in appropriate cir
cumstances a court could inquire into the
reasons for an investigation and into its
effects, but the burden of showing that an
agency subpoena was unreasonable "re
mains with the respondent" and "is not
easily met." FinaJly, the court agreed
with the Commission that the district
court's requirement that a statement be
made to each witness was unjustified.

ENFORCEMENT

PROCEEDINGS

The Commission has available a wide
range of possible enforcement actions. It
may in appropriate cases refer its files to
the Department of Justice with a recom
mendation for criminal prosecution. The
penalties upon conviction are specified
in the various statutes and include im
prisonment for substantial terms and
fines.
The securities laws also authorize the
Commission to file injunctive actions in
the Federal district courts to enjom con
tinued or threatened violations of those
laws or applicable Commission rules. In
injunctive actions the Commission has
frequently sought to obtarn anciJlary relief
under the general equity powers of the
Federal district courts. The power of the
Federal courts to grant such relief has
been judiciaJly recognized.' The Commis
sion has often requested the court to ap
point a receiver for a broker-dealer or
other business where investors were likely
to be harmed by continuance of the exist.
ing management. It has also requested,
among other things, court orders restrict
ing future activities of the defendants, reo

quiring that rescission be offered to secu
rities purchasers, or requiring disgorge
ment of the defendants' ill-gotten gains.
The SEC'sprimary function is to protect
the public from fraudulent and other un
lawful practices and not to obtain dam
ages for injured individuals. Thus, a re
quest that disgorgement be required is
predicated on the needto deprive defend.
ants of profits derived from their unlaw
ful conduct and to protect the public
by deterring such conduct by others.
If the terms of any injunctive decree
are violated, the Commission may file
criminal contempt proceedings, as a re
sult of which the violator may be fined
or imprisoned.
The Federal securities acts also author
ize the Commission to impose remedial
administrative sanctions. Most common
ly, administrative enforcement proceed
ings involve aJlegedviolations of the se
curities acts or regulations by firms or
persons engaged in the securities busi
ness, although the Commission's jurisdic
tion extends to aJl persons. GeneraJly
speaking, if the Commission finds that a
respondent willfuJly violated a provision
of or rule under the securities acts, failed
reasonaby to supervise another person
who committed a violation, or has been
convicted for or enjoined from certain
types of misconduct, and that a sanction
is in the public interest, it may revoke or
suspend the registration of a brokerdealer or investment adviser, bar or sus
pend any person from the securities busi
ness or from association with an invest
ment company, or censure a firm or in
dividual. Proceedings may also cover
adequacy of disclosure in a registration
statement or in reports filed with the
Commission. Such cases may lead to an
order suspending the effectiveness of a
registration statement or directing com
pliance with reporting requirements. The
Commission also has the power to sus
pend trading in a security summarily
when the public interest requires.
Proceedings are frequently completed
without hearings where respondents
waive their right to a hearing and submit
settlement offers consenting to remedial
69

action which the Commission accepts as
an appropriate disposition of the pro
ceedings. The Commission tries to gear
its sanctions in both contested and settle.
ment cases to the circumstances of the
case. For example, it may lirnrt the sanc
tion to a particular branch office of a
broker-dealer rather than sanction the en
tire firm, prohibit only certain kinds of
activity by the broker-dealer during a pe
riod of suspension or only prohibit an
individual from engaging in supervisory
activities.

ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEEDINGS

Summarized below are some of the
many administrative proceedings pend
ing or disposed of in fiscal 1973.

Disciplinary Proceedings
Continental Investment Corporation.
During the fiscal year, proceedings were
instituted against Continental, two brokerdealer subsidiaries, Waddell & Reed Inc.
and Kansas City Securities Corporation
{KCSC}, and The First National Bank of
Boston. Waddell & Reed is investment
adviser and principal underwriter for the
United Funds complex, a group of regis
tered investment companies with net as
sets in excess of $2.5 billion.
The Continental respondents were
charged by the Commission's staff with
abuse of their fiduciary duty in that they
effected Fund portfolio transactions prin
cipally for their own benefit, rather than
for the benefit of the Funds and their
shareholders. Among other things, it was
alleged that portfolio transactions were
effected through KCSCalthough its serv
ices were not needed, and that Conti
nental and Waddell, together with First
National, improperly used Fund custo
dian accounts and the balances therein to
provide compensating balances for a loan
to Continental. The loan, originally for
about $82.5 million, was used by Con
tinental to purchase Waddell. As part of
70

this course of conduct, the respondents
were charged with causing United Science
Fund to enter into a custodian contract
with First National on a basis less favor
able than that enjoyed by the bank's other
custodial clients.
On June 13, 1973, the Commission is
sued an order censuring First National
pursuant to an offer of settlement! First
JIlational renegotiated its fee structure
with United Science Fund and recom
puted its fees, thereby effecting a repay
ment of approximately $117,000 to the
fund.
Butcher and Sherrerd.5-This firm, a
broker-dealer and investment adviser, and
six partners submitted a settlement offer
consenting to certain fmdings without ad
mitting staff allegations against them.
The Commission found, pursuant to the
offer, that the respondents violated anti
fraud provisions of the securities laws in
connection with their activities and trans
actions with respect to the common stock
of Penn Central Company. For a 10-year
period, the firm induced customers to pur
chase Penn Central stock on the basis of
the firm's investment judgment. Then
the firm changed its recommendation so
as to advise sale of the stock instead of
purchase, but the change was communi
cated only on a selected basis to certain
preferred customers, and not to others
who still held shares of the stock which
they had purchased on the firm's recorn
mendation. Pursuant to the offer, the
Commission suspended the retail sales
department of the firm for 10 business
days and suspended the firm's partners
for varying periods from association with
any broker-dealer, investment adviser or
investment company. In addition, the firm
established a $350,000 escrow fund for
customers in order to ameliorate their
losses on Penn Central transactions.
During the past fiscal year, the Com
mission stepped up its enforcement ac
tivities with respect to the improper use
of inside information. During that time,
seven proceedings were instituted against
approximately 50 tippers and tippees. As
the Commission noted in the Faberge
case, discussed below, "few practices,

short of manipulation, have as deleterious
all effect on the investing public's con
fidence in corporate institutions and the
securities markets as the selective dis
closure of and misuse of inside informa
tion." 8
In connection with trading in Faberge
stock, the Commission ordered adminis
trative proceedings against three broker.
dealers and a bank based on staff charges
that the broker-dealers conveyed adverse
inside information concerning the sales
and earnings of Faberge, Inc., for its third
quarter ended September 30, 1970, to
certain select customers, and recom
mended the sale of Faberge securities
while in possession of such Information.
The brokers, according to the charges,
received the information from a Faberge
VICe,president,' and the bank, from a
broker-dealer. The Commission an.
nounced at the same time that it had ac
cepted waivers of the formal institution
of administrative proceedings, and con.
sents to certain findings and conclusions,
from two other broker-dealers and three
firms operating as investment advisers
of investment companies, in connection
with misuse of the same inside inforrna
tion, Based on the waivers and consents,
the Commission found that the conduct
of the five firms violated antifraud pro
visions of the Exchange Act and was
censurable.
In its opinion accepting the waivers
and consents," the Commission stated
that proper and adequate disclosure of
significant corporate developments can
only be effected by a public release
through the appropriate public media, de
signed to achieve a broad dissemination
to the investing public generally and
without favoring any special person or
group. To hold otherwise, the Commis
sion asserted, would be to sanction com.
petition for tips in which the ordinary in
dividual investor would inevitably be at
a serious disadvantage.
The Commission emphasized the im
portance and necessity of broker-dealers
investment advisers, and institutional in:
vestors, as well as issuers, instituting and
implementing effective procedures cal

culated to deter and detect the misuse
of inside Information. The opinion in
cluded a discussion of some elements of
an effective compliance program, includ
ing the training and education of em
ployees and an ongoing review of trading
to spot trading concentrations by em.
ployees.

The complaint In that action further al
leged that Laventhol was not Independent

statements because partners or em
ployees of the branch office working on
the Takara audit received approximately
$17,000 In payments from the general

by the firm
and on ItS acceptance of certain new
professional engagements.
Stuart SchIffman. 1°-Stuart Schiffman,
a lawyer, was permanently suspended
71

from practice before the Commission
under Rule 2(e)(3) of the Commission's
Rulesof Practice. The order of suspension
was based upon an injunction against
violations of the registration and anti
fraud provisions of the securities acts
that had been entered against Schiffman
in December 1972," and upon fmdings
by the Commission in an administrative
proceeding that Schiffman willfully vio
lated and willfully aided and abetted vio
lations of antifraud, net capital, recordkeeping and reporting provisions of those
acts." In the Rule 2(e) proceeding, Schiffman did not petition the Commission to
lift the temporary suspension it had or
dered, and the suspension therefore be
came permanent by operation of Rule
2(e)(3)(ii).
Emanuel Fields!8-The
Commission
entered an order pursuant to Rule 2(e)(3)
of the Commission's Rules of Practice
summarily suspendmg FIelds, a lawyer,
from appearing or practrcrng before it.
The order was based upon the entry of a
judgment in SEC v. Emanuel Fields, et
a/.," permanently enjoinmg Fields from
violating the registration and antifraud
provisions of the Federal securities laws.
Pursuant to Rule 2(e)(3), Fields peti
tioned the Commission to lift the tern
porary suspension. The Commission
denied the petition and, as required by
the rule, set the matter down for hearing
to determine what ultimate sanction, if
any, should be imposed. Fields then
waived an evidentiary hearing, and, after
briefing and oral argument, the Com
mission issued an order permanently
disqualifying him from appearing or prac
ticing before it. The Commission rejected
Fields' contention that his summary sus.
pension violated due process. It stated
that summary action was appropriate
when predicated on previous findings of
serious misconduct."

Reports
Great Southwest Corporation.'G-ln a
detailed opinion, the Commission di
rected Great Southwest to file amended
financial statements on Form 1D-K for
the years 1968 and 1969 in order to ex72

elude profits on certain transactions and
eliminate related sales and cost of sales.
The company's annual reports, filed pur
suant to Exchange Act requirements,
treated certain real estate transactions,
involving amusement parks in Texas and
Georgia and raw land in California, as
sales, and recorded profits.
The Commission found that although
the transactions may have met the formal
legal requirements for a sale, the corpo
ration retained control over management
of the properties and substantially all
risk of loss and opportunity for gain. Ac
cordingly, the Commission concluded that
the method of accounting employed by
the corporation did not reflect the eco
nomic realities of the transactions at
issue.

Trading Suspensions
The Securlties ExchangeAct authorizes
the Comrrussron summarily to suspend
trading in a security traded on either a
national securities exchange or in the
over-the-counter market for a period of
up to 10 days if, in the Commission's
opinion, it is required in the public
interest.
During fiscal 1973, the Commission
suspendedtradmg in the securities of 174
companies, an increase of about 270 per
cent over the 47 securities suspended in
frscal 1972. In most instances, this action
was taken either because of substantial
questions as to the adequacy, accuracy
or availability of public information con
cerning the companies' financial condi
tion or business operations or because of
transactions in the companies' securities
suggesting possible manipulation or other
vrolations. Although trading suspensions
are freauently a prelude to other enforce
ment action, the Commission during 1973
began temnorarily susnending trading in
the securities of issuers who were delin
quent in filing reauired reoorts with the
Cornrnisslon." This was dane in order to
alert the public to the lack of adequate,
accurate and current information concern
ing such issuers. Of the 174 susoenslons
initiated by the Commission this year, 95
were instituted for that reason. For ex

arllple, trdlding in Met eports Centers,
Inc. was suspended in February 1973 for
failure to file ID-K Annual Reports for
1970, 1971, and 1972, ID-Q quarterly
reports for 1971 and 1972, and a 9-K
report for the 6 months ending March
1970.'8 The following examples Illustrate
circumstances under which the Commis
sion may suspend trading.
On March 28, 1973, the Commission
suspended exchange and over-the-counter
trading in all securities of Equity Funding
Corporation of America, listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, because rumors
concerning the financial condition and
operations of the company were circulat
ing in the investment community." The
suspension was also ordered because of
an increased volume of trading and a
dramatic decline in the prices of Equity's
securities.
In April 1973, at the request of Giant
Stores Corp., the Commission suspended
trading in the company's securities, listed
on the American Stock Exchange, because
of the unavailability of adequate and ac
curate financial information concerning
the company and indications of possible
record-keeping irregularities in connection
with the preparation of its financial state
ments." Subsequently, several members
of the company's management resigned,
and the company's independent auditors
withdrew their opinion on company finan
cial statements because of certain irregu
larities in connection with the accounts of
the company and its subsidiaries.
Trading in the securities of Marcon
Electronics Corporation was suspended in
January 1973, at a time when five brokerdealers were making a market In the stock
of the company, because it had been
adjudicated bankrupt in 1969 and had no
stockholder equity remaining, its assets
having been sold and the proceeds dis
tributed to creditors." Additionally, the
company had no offices, no transfer
agent, and the Secretary of State of New
Jersey had declared it a "voided corpo
ration" because of its failure to pay taxes.
On December 5, 1972, the Commission
suspended trading in the securities of
U.S. Financial, lnc., listed on the New

York Stock Exchange." The suspension
was initiated because of the lack of accu
rate and reliable information concerning
the company's flnancial condition. The
company's independent auditor had With
drawn its certification of the company's
1971 annual report, and the company had
announced that it intended to re-audrt
its 1971 financial statements and con
duct a special audit With respect to finan
cial reports contained in 1972 filings.
On June 5, 1973, the Commission sus
pended trading in the securities of
Coastal States Gas Corp., listed on the
New York Stock Exchange, because of
rumors concerning the company's gas
reserves and its abllity to meet con
tractual commitments, and the impact of
such rumors on the market for Coastal
securities.'"

CIVIL PROCEEDINGS
During fiscal 1973, the Commission
instituted a total of 178 injunctive ac
tions. Some of the more noteworthy of
these injunctive proceedings and signifi
cant developments in actions instituted
in earlier years are reported below.
Coordination between self-regulatory
bodies and the Division of Enforce
ment resulted in several enforcement ac
tions, as well as investigations. Among
the more important actions was an in
junctive suit, S.E.C. v. Eisenberger, et
el.," resulting from a joint effort by the
Commission and the American Stock Ex
change. Eisenberger, an unregistered in
vestment adviser, had purchased stock of
Vetco Offshore Industries, Inc. and call
options on the stock for his own account,
for a limited partnership of which he was
the general partner, and for accounts
maintained with a European investment
adviser which had given him discretionary
authority to invest funds in the accounts.
Through such purchases of stock and call
options, control was acquired over ap
proximately 27 percent of Vetco's out
standing stock. The Commission charged
that Eisenberger, the limited partnership,
lind the foreign investment adviser con
stituted a "group" within the meaning of
Section 13(d)(3) of the Exchange Act
73

(The Williams Act) and had failed to file
the required Schedule 130 with the Com
mission disclosing ownership interests
and other information. Consent injunc
tions were obtained from Eisenberger
and the limited partnership, as well as
from the European investment adviser
which had not been named a party to
tile litigation. Pursuant "thereto, a state
ment on Schedule 130 was filed with the
Commission reflecting the dates and
amounts of purchases and sales of the
Vetco shares and options, the manner in
which certain of the option transactions
were effected, and the effect such trans
actions may have had on transactions in
underlying Vetco common stock on the
American Stock Exchange.
As a further result of cooperation with
self-regulatory bodies, an investigation
was begun into the improper disclosure
of inside information concernmg the earn
ings decline of Liggett & Myers, Inc. in
the second quarter of 1972. The Commis
sion charged, in a complaint filed on
June 25, 1973, that Liggett & Myers
and an assistant vice president of the
company violated antifraud provisions by
disseminating undisclosed material inside
information concerning the earnings de
cline to certain preferred individuals."
The case is still pending.
SEC v. Shapiro."'-In
this injunctive
action, the district court permanently
enjoined two partners of a firm specializ
ing in corporate mergers and acquisitions
from further violations of Rule 10b-5
under the Exchange Act, and ordered
them to disgorge to a court-appointed
trustee the profits derived from their un
lawful purchases of stock of Harvey's
Stores, lnc., a publicly held corporation
listed on the American Stock Exchange.
The court held that these defendants had
violated the rule by purchasing stock
without disclosing to the sellers material
nonpublic information concerning a pro
posed merger which they had acquired
as a result of their positions as finders
and through friendship with corporate of
ficials of the prospective merger partners.
The court further held that the defend
ants were also SUbject to liability for
74

'tipping" inside information concerning
the proposed merger to others in order
that the "tippees" might benefit. Prior to
the court's decrsion all other defendants
in the action, including tippees of parties
privy to the merger negotiations, con
sented to the entry of fmal judgments of
permanent rnjunctron and orders of dis
gorgement.
In rejecting the defendants' contention
that they did not have to make disclo
sure since the possibility of merger was
remote and the information was there
fore not material, the court found that at
the time of the defendants' first pur
chases the proposed merger was a "via
ble possibility" which became "even
more distinct" during the period encom
passing their subsequent purchases. Fol
lowmg the standard for materiality enun
ciated in S.E.C. v. Texas Gulf SUlphur
CO.,21the court considered the defend
ants' own trading activities as the most
convincing factor illustrating the mate
riality of the information, noting that
there existed "very significant [uxtaposl
nons between the timing of the defend
ants' purchases and critical events in
the negotiations" and that "the pace
and quantity of defendants' purchases
increased as developments grew more
prorrusing for an eventual merger." The
court also held that injunctive relief was
particularly appropriate in view of the
fact that the defendants' repeated and
persistent violations arose out of their
activities as corporate "marriage bro
kers" and there was no indication that
they planned to change professions or
cease their business activities. At fiscal
year-end, appeals taken by these defend
ants were pending.
S.E.C. v. Bausch & Lomb, Inc., et
al."'-In
another action alleging the im
proper disclosure and use of inside in
formation, the Commission filed an in
junctive complaint against Bausch &
Lomb, its chief executive officer, and nine
other defendants. The information in
question related to the company's dis
appointing sales and earnings from its
soft contact lens. The complaint alleges,
among other things, that one of the tip

pees, a brokerage firm secunties analyst,
withdrew his "buy"
recommendation
shortly after receiving the adverse inside
information during the course of an inter
view with Bausch & Lomb's chief execu
tive officer, and that, after receipt of the
information, the head securities trader at
the brokerage firm sold 2,300 shares of
Bausch & Lomb common stock held in
his and 13 family-related accounts. It is
further alleged that an investment adviser
and an investment manager caused the
sale of 72,000 and 3,000 shares, respec
tively, of Bausch & Lomb stock after
receipt of the information.
S.E.C. v, Lums, Inc. et al.""-Investors
Diversified Services, Inc. (IDS), a defend
ant in another Commission suit involving
inside information, consented, without ad
mitting or denying the allegations of the
complaint, to a permanent injunction
which among other things, required the
firm to implement the Statement of Policy
described below." The Commission's
complaint had alleged the improper use of
adverse inside information in connection
with the sale of IDS's position of 83,000
shares of Lum's common stock. The
Statement of Policy requires an IDS em
ployee who receives "material informa
t;on about a company which he knows or
has reason to believe is directly or indi
rectly attributable to such company (or its
insiders), [to] determine that the informa
tion is public" before utilizing it. If the
employee has any doubt at all as to
whether the information has been made
public, he must consult with IDS' in-house
counsel.
S.E.C. v. J. C. Bradford & Company, et
al.31-Qn
November 10, 1972, the Com
mission, in another action in this area,
filed an injunctive complaint against J. C.
Bradford & Co., a New York Stock Ex
change member firm, two of its officers,
and two Bradford subsidiaries includ
ing Life Stock Research Corporation, a
registered investment adviser. The action
sought an injunction for alleged violations
of antifraud provisions, and disgorge
ment of defendants' profits for allegedly
trading in securities of The Old Line Life
Insurance Company of America while in

possession of material non-public infor
mation. That rnforrnatron concerned an
other corporation's interest rn acquiring
Old Lme by offering a share for share ex
change of stock that would have nearly
doubled the value of Old Line shares. The
defendants, without admitting or denying
the allegations of the cornplarnt, con
sented to entry of an injunction and
agreed to set up a fund of more than
$100,000 to provide for payment of
claims arising out of their trading in Old
Line stock. As part of the settlement, the
defendants also consented to the impost
tion of admmistrative sanctions."
S.E.C. v. Bangor Punta Corporeuon.s-«
This was an appeal from a district court
order denymg mjunctrve relief in a Com
mission action alleging violations of the
antifraud provrsions of the Securities Act
and the Exchange Act in connection With
a contest between Bangor Punta Corpora
tion and Chns-Craft Industries, Inc. for
control of Piper Arrcraft Corporation. On
May 29, 1969, Bangor filed With the Com
mission a registration statement and pro
spectus for an offering of ItS securities in
exchange for Piper stock, in which It was
not disclosed that the Bangor and Aroo
stook Railroad, owned by Bangor and
earned on its books at $18,400,000, was
being negotiated for sale at between $5
and $7 rrnlnon." The district court found
that the safe of the railroad was not de
layed, as the Cornrnissronhad charged, to
avoid an adverse effect on the tender
offer, but that the registration statement
was rmsleading m orrnttrng to disclose the
negotiations to sell the railroad at a
greatly reduced value. The district court
directed Bangor to make a restricted offer
of rescission to Piper shareholders who
had accepted the Bangor exchange offer,
but denied injunctive relief sought by the
Commission to restrain Bangor from fu
ture violations of the securities laws.'" On
appeal, a divided panel of the Court of Ap
peals for the Second Circuit affirmed (2 to
1) the district court's denial of injunctive
relief. The court of appeals, however,
found that the failure to disclose "clearly
was unreasonable" and demonstrated
"reckless disregard" so that the refusal
75

of the distnct court to award damages
in the related private action was
erroneous." In addition, the court of ap
peals affirmed the order requiring Bangor
to offer rescission, and, as urged by the
Commission, concluded that a condition
Imposed on the offer by the district court
was inappropriate. On May 8, 1973, the
court of appeals denied the Commis
sion's motion for rehearing and sugges
tion for rehearing en banc, three judges
dissenting. On August 15, 1973, the Com
mission filed a petition with the United
States Supreme Court for a writ of
certiorari to overturn the court of appeals
affirmance of the denial of injunctive
relief.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit In Securities and Exchange Com
mission v. Untted Financial Group, Inc.,3.
affirmed the district court's conclusion
that It had JUrisdiction under the Securi
ties Act and the Exchange Act over the
activities of the defendant offshore
mutual funds, although there had been
only a few sales by those funds to Amer
ican investors. The court stated that the
proper focus should be upon the activi
ties of the defendants in this country and
the impact of those activities on Amer
ican investors, that the Federal securi
ties laws should be broadly construed to
promote their remedial purposes and,
that the "jurisdictional hook need not
be large to fish for securities laws
violations...
The court also construed Section 30(b)
of the ExchangeAct which provides that
the Act does not apply to any person
"Insofar as he transacts a business in
securities without the jurisdiction of the
United States," unless in contravention
of Commission rules adopted to prevent
evasion of the Act. The court held the
section inapplicable, stating that the
"jurisdiction of the United States" does
not mean terntorial limits. Moreover, of
fers and sales were made by defendants
to United States citizens, and defendants
carried on substantial activities in the
United States in order to facilrtate the
sale of secunties abroad.
76

In S.E.C. v. Computer Statistics, tnc;"
the United States Court of Appealsfor the
Distnct of Columbia CirCUItaffirmed, in
a per cut/am order, the district court's
entry of summary judgment in the Com
mission's favor requinng the defendant
to file timely and proper periodic
reports." It also affirmed the lower court's
denial of defendant's motion to dismiss
for improper venue or, in the alternative,
to transfer venue to the Northern District
of Texas where the defendant had its
principal place of business. The court of
appeals rejected the contention that sum.
mary judgment should not have been
granted because there was an issue of
fact as to whether a reasonable likeli
hood of future vlolatrons existed in light
of the defendant's assertion that it would
attempt to comply with reporting require
ments In the future.
S.E.C. v. Allegheny Beverage Corpora
t/on.o6_ln
May 1973, the Commission
instituted an injunctive action against Al
legheny and 24 other defendants alleging
violations of reporting, antifraud, and reg
istration provisions of the securities acts.
In addition to Allegheny, the defendants
include Value Vend Credit Corporation
(VVCC) (an Allegheny subsidiary), four
Allegheny officers, the company's audi
tors, the underwriter of a VVCC public
offering, counsel for the underwriter,
counsel for VVCC,and the escrow agent
for the public offering, Suburban Trust
Company.
The complaint alleges that various
Allegheny financial reports disseminated
to the public and filed with the Commis
sion in 1971 and 1972 were materially
false and misleading. The reports alleg
edly included income from improperly
reported sales and materially understated
certain expenses. Another portion of the
cernplaint relates to a 1971 public offer
ing of $25 million of WCC debentures.
The prospectus stated that $10 million
of such debentures had to be sold and
paid for within a specified period or all
money received from subscribers, to be
maintained in a special account at Subur
ban, would be returned. It is alleged that
VVCCwas able to sell only $500,000 of

the
lent
the
$10

debentures but entered into fraudu
arrangements,
aided by certain of
defendants, to make it appear that
million had been sold.
S.E.C. v. Frlg/temp Corp.'.-In
March
1973, the Commission filed an injunctive
complaint
against
Frigitemp
and four
other defendants
alleging violations
of
the registration and antifraud provisions
of the Federal securities
laws. There
after, the defendants, without admitting
or denying the allegations, consented to
entry of a permanent injunction and cer
tain
ancillary
relief
sought
by the
Commission.
The Commission had alleged that the
defendants filed false and misleading reg
istration
statements,
offered and sold
unregistered Frigitemp securities, rnanlp
ulated the market for Frigitemp stock,
and engaged in a fraudulent scheme in
volving cash payments to "induce the
awarding of contracts to Frlgrternp. As
requested by the Commission, the four
individual defendants agreed to pay the
company $185,000,
approximating
the
monies paid by Frigitemp to induce the
awarding of contracts.
The defendants
also agreed to Implement a plan under
which independent directors would super
vise Frigitemp's operations for a specified
period.
S.E.C. v. General Host Corporation, et
al.41-ln connection with its surveillance
of corporate takeover attempts, the Com
mission filed an injunctive action against
General Host and nine other defendants
charging a fraudulent scheme to acquire
control of Armour and Company. In ad
dition, the suit alleged violations in con
nection with General Host's efforts to dis
pose of its Armour noldmgs to Greyhound
Corporation and further violations 10 con
nection with General Host's acquisition,
through merger, of U'I General Stores,

District
of Rhode Island preliminarily
enjoined further violations of the registra
tion and antifraud provisions of the se
cunties laws in connection with the offer
and sale of scotch whiskey warehouse re
ceipts and certrfrcates
of beneftcral inter
est in certain trusts. It held, in accord
ance With the Cornrnlssron's
VIews, that
the warehouse receipts offered by some
of the defendants were securities, noting
that "the
success of most, if not all, of
the investors in said scotch whiskey ware
house receipts is dependent on the advice
of the brokers thereof." The district court
also rejected the defendants' contention
that the certificates of beneficial interest
in the trusts were exempt from the regis
tration requirements of the Securities Act
by virtue of Section 3(a)(3)"
which re
lates to various forms of short term com
mercial paper, hold 109 that the certif
icates could not be considered to be
within the class of prime quality negoti
able commercial
paper not normally
available for purchase by the general
public which Congress intended to be
covered by the exemption."
During the past fiscal year, the Com
mission sought injunctive relief against
three
so-called
pyramid
promotion
schemes. In all three cases, the promo
ters purported to offer franchises for the
retail sale of goods or services. In S.E.C.
v. Glenn W. Turner Enterprises, Inc." the
defendants purported to offer "distribu
torships"
for the sale of tape recorded
self-improvement
courses through Dare
to Be Great, lnc., a subsidiary of Turner
Enterprises. The overwhelming emphasis
of defendants'
promotion,
however, was
upon the financial rewards that an in
vestor might obtain by sharing with the
promoters
in the profits to be derived
from the recruitment
of other investors
into the scheme. The new recruits could,

offered and sold were secuntres within the
Securires Act's descnptive terms "investment contract," "certificate of Interest or
participation In any profit-shanng agreement," and "any interest or Instrument
commonly known as a 'secunty.''' The
district court observed that "the subjection of the Investor's money to the risk of
an enterprise over which he exercises no
managerial control ISthe basic economic
reality of a securities transaction."'7 It
preliminarily enjoined defendants from
offering or seiling such securities absent compliance with the registration provisions of the SecuntresAct and all other
applicable provisions of the federal securities laws.
The United States Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circurt affirmed, holding the
Interests sold to be "Investment contracts" and hence "secunties.' It applied the test for an "Investment contract" contained in S.E.C.v. W. J. Howey
Co.,"-"an
investment of money In a
common enterprise wrth profits to come
solely from the efforts of others."
Although it was necessary for Investors
to perform some recruitment functions,
the court of appeals concluded that the
"efforts" whrch Howey requires to be
made by persons other than the investor
are "the undeniably significant ones,
those essential managerial efforts which
affect the failure or success of the enterprise." 49 Defendants have petitioned
the Supreme Court for a writ of certloran
to which the Comrrussion has filed a
memorandum In opposition.
In SEC. v. Koscot Interplanetary,
lnc.," the Commission sought to enjoin
the fraudulent offer and sale of unregistered interests in a substantially identical pyramid promotion scheme run by
Koscot Interplanetary, lnc., another subsidiary of Turner Enterpnses. Contrary
to the conclusion reached by the Court
of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in Turner
Enterprises,
however, the United States
Distnct Court for the Northern District of
Georgia held that the interests offered
78

and sold by Koscot were not securities
Within the statutory definitions. Accordingly, the court granted defendants' motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim
upon which relief could be granted. The
Commission's appeal of this decision is
now pending before the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit."
The third pyramid case, SEC. v. Holiday Magic, Inc. et al."' Involves a substantially Similar but unrelated promo.
tron The action is now pending in the
United States District Court for the
Northern District of California where the
Commission has requested an Injunction
against future violations of the registration and antifraud provrsions, as well as
an accounting and disgorgernent of profItS and the appointment of a receiver for
the assetsof the company.
S.E.C.v. Datronics Engineers, Inc.03The United States Court of Appeals for
the Fourth Circuit held, contrary to the
decision of the district court, that spinoff drstnbutions by Datronics to its
shareholders of stock of nine non-public
companies involved the "sale" of unregistered securities and therefore violated
the registration provisions of the Securities Act. Agreeing with the decision in
S.E.C. v. Harwyn Industries Corp.,"' the
court concluded that the spin-off distributions-which were effected solely to
create trading markets in the spun-off
stocks-were "dispositions of a secunty . . . for value" and thus "sales"
within the meaning of Section 2(3) of the
Act. The court found that "value" accrued to Datronics and to ItS officers and
agents in that the creation of trading
markets gave added value both to the
spun-off stock retained by Datronics and
to the stock received by its officers and
agents as compensation for legal and
other services rendered to the spin-off
companies.
The court further ruled that the spinoffs were not exempt as transactions by a
person other than an issuer, underwriter
or dealer under Section 4(1) of the Securities Act, since Datronics was "actually an issuer, or at least a co-issuer."
Datronics was also found by the court to

be an underwriter within the meaning of
Section 2(11) of the Act In that it pur
chased stock from the spin-off cornparues
wrth a view to the distribution of the stock
to Datrorucs shareholders.
Having determined that the spin-off
distributions were sales, the court further
held that the defendants violated the anti'
fraud provisions of the Exchange Act by
disseminating false and misleading infor
mation in connection with the spin-offs.
The court also found that the nature and
extent of the violations, including the
number and magnitude of the unreg
istered distributions, warranted the grant
of an injunction to prevent recurrences,
and accordingly directed that a prelimin
ary injunction be entered.
In two enforcement actions, S.E.C. v.
Continental
Commodities
Corporation,
et
al.'" and S.E.C. v. Goldstein, Samuelson,
lnc., et al."" the Comrnissron urged that

schemes which in form purported to in
volve the offer and sale of options on
commodity futures involved, in sub.
stance, the offer and sale of "securities"
within the meaning of the Federal securi
ties laws. In both cases the promoters
undertook to pay a sum of money to in
vestors contingent upon favorable market
price movements of certain unregulated
commodities. The Commission alleged in
each case, however, that neither the "op
tion" acquired nor the payment made by
an investor had any necessary relation
ship to any commodities futures or
actual commodities to be bought, sold,
accepted or delivered
the defendants.
Accordingly, the contributed capital of all
investors, which was subjected to the
risks of the promoters' corporate enter
prise, could be devoted to any purpose
unrelated to commodities that the pro
moters might choose; and whether the
promised payment could be made to in
vestors depended upon the successof the
promoters' management of the enterprise
to Which the investors' funds had been
committed. Consistent with these facts it
was alleged that the Interests offered and
sold were "investment contract[s],"
"evidence[s] of indebetedness" and in

0/

terests or Instruments "commonly known
as a security."
On March 21, 1973, the district court
In the Continental case appointed a tem
porary receiver for the company's as
sets at the request of the Commission.
Thereafter, however, the court denied the
Commission's motion for a prelimmary in
junction on the ground that neither the
interests sold in the form of purported
commodity options nor the promissory
notes that were issued to Investors in lieu
of payments due them were securities
within the statutory definitions. The
Cornrnissron has appealed the ruling on
the promissory notes to the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit. The
temporary receivership remains in effect
pending appeal.
The Goldstein case is stili pending in
the district court.
S.E.C. v. Geo Tek Resources Fund,
Inc."7-ln May 1973, the Commission
brought suit seeking the appointment of
a receiver for Geo Tek and an injunction
restraining the company and 25 other
defendants from violating registration,
antifraud and reporting provisions of the
securities acts. According to the com
plaint, from January, 1964 through Jan
uary, 1972, the defendants obtained
about $30 million in violation of the se
currties acts from more than 2,000 public
investors in various oil and gas programs.
The Commission alleged that the defend
ants (1) sold unregistered securities and
certain of them misappropriated the pro
ceeds, (2) disseminated to investors and
prospective investors materially false and
misleading prospectuses, reports and
offering circulars; and (3) filed with the
Commission materially false and mislead
ing information as to (a) the financial
conditron and business operations of vari
ous oil and gas programs, and (b) trans
actions involving certain officers, direc
tors, employees and affiliates of the
programs

S.E.C. v. Flotuie East Coast Railway
Company."'-In January 1973, the Com
rnisston instituted an Injunctive proceed
ing against the railroad and three other
defendants alleging violations of the re
79

porting, proxy and antifraud provisions of
the securities acts.
The Commission charged that the railroad filed a false and misleading proxy
statement with the Commission in February, 1972 pertaining to a proposed increase In Its authorized capital stock and
an exchange of that stock for its outstanding First Mortgage Bonds. The complaint also charged the Alfred I. duPont
Testamentary Trust, one of the defendants, with purchasing the bonds whrle in
possession of material non-public rnformatron
concerning the proposed exchange offer, and the railroad, with purchasing its Second Mortgage Bonds in
the open market while in possession of
material non-public information concerning their retirement. The Commission sought a permanent injunction and
certain ancillary relief.
In May 1973, the railroad disseminated to stockholders new proxy soliciting material in cvnnection with obtaining
a new shareholder vote on the exchange
offer. The Commission filed a motion for
a preliminary injunction and a temporary
restraining order to prevent the holding
of a scheduled stockholders' meeting and
a vote on the matters raised in the proxy
materials, which the Cornrrussionalleged
were materially false and misleading. The
court denied the motion for a temporary
restraining order and consolidated for
trial the motion for a preliminary injunction and the action seeking a permanent
injunction.
In October 1972, the Commission fi'ed
two complaints in the United States District Court for the Western District of Tennessee seeking to enjoin a total of 7
municipal bond dealers, not registered
With the Cornrruaslon,and 23 individual
de'endants from Violations of antifraud
provisions of the Federalsecurities laws.
In one case, S.E.C. v. Investors Associates of America, Inc., et al .... all of the
defendants consented to preliminary injunctions, with the exception of one
dealer and one individual who consented
to permanent injunctions." The defendants were charged with having engaped
in a scheme to sell municipal bonds by
80

means of high pressure, "boiler-room"
sales techniques. It was alleged that, in
furtherance of the scheme, they employed a campaign of mtensive long
distance telephone solicitation of customers in order to induce the purchase
of low quality rnurucrpal bonds by means
of fraudulent representations concerning
among other things, the source, quality
and market price of the bonds. In the
second case,S.E.C.v. Charles A. Morris &
Associates, tnc.," the Commission alleged that similar misconduct had occurred. Following a hearing, the court
granted the Commission's motion for a
preliminary injunction against all of the
defendants, with the exception of three
who consentedto ::J permanent injunction.
In S.E.C.v. American Agronomics Corporation et aLG' the Commission obtained
consent decrees of permanent injunction
against 14 defendants alleged to have
violated the registration and antifraud
provisions of the Federal securities laws
in connection with the sale of orange
grove investment contracts. In addition to
consenting to permanent injunctions,
Agronomics, its wholly owned subsidiary,
- and two principal owners and officers
agreed to a court ordered undertaking
whereby rescission will be offered to all
orange grove investors for whom the investment is determined to be unsuitable
by a special counsel appointed by the
court. Additionally, the two owners and
officers agreed to deposit with the corporation 60,000 shares of their personal
Agronomics stock to defr..y any expense
incurred by the corporation as a result
of the Comrntssion's action and the conduct alleged In its complaint. The settlement also requires the corporation to take
steps to assure the proper allocation of
investors' orange grove maintenance fees
and the proper intercompany transfer of
funds, and to keepgrove owners informed
as to the condition and care of their individual groves.
SEC v. Westgate-CalIfornia Corporation, et alo, is an injunctive action instituted by the Commission in May 1973
against Westgate and others alleging
violations of registratlon, antifraud, re-

porting and proxy provisions of the securities acts. The defendants Include C. Arnholt Smith. (chairman,
chief executive
and former president of Westgate). Philip
Toft (president and director of Westgate),
and several privately-held
companies allegedly owned and controlled
by Smith
or M. J. Coen, another defendant.
The complaint alleges that Smith and
Toft assisted Westgate In perpetrating
a
fraudulent
course of business by lending
its assets on an Interest-free
basis to
corporations
controlled
by Smith. These
cornparues
would allegedly
pledge the
"lent assets" as collateral for millions of
dollars worth of loans from the United
States
National
Bank of San Diego,
owned in part and controlled
by Smith.
In order to avoid detection, the lent assets
would allegedly be returned to Westgate
apparently
unencumbered,
just prior to
exarninatron of ItS accounts by independent auditors.
This complaint

SEC v. Normandie Trust Company, et
al.°7-The Commission in this case ob
tained Injunctions against Normandie
Trust Company ("Normandie") and ten
Individuals. Normandie was an off-shore
company incorporated In Panama for the
purpose of defrauding U.S. citizens
through the sale of letters of credit. The
defendants prepared a fraudulent bal
ance sheet which showed Normandie as
having more than $170,000,000 in as
sets, when in fact it had little if any. The
defendants informed purchasers that
Normandie's letters of credit could be
utilized to obtain loans from banks, and
purchasers were required to pay into es
crow in advance anywherefrom 1 percent
to 4 percent of the face value of the
letter of credit to show their "good
faith." The money was then paid out of
escrow to the defendants upon the issu
ance of a letter of credit to the purchaser.
In this manner, defendants obtained ap
proxirnatelv $150,000 in exchangefor let
ters of credit having a face value of more
than $25.000,000.
In SEC. v. First American Bank &
Trust Company," the court of appeals re
versed a distnct court order that had de
nied, except in one respect, the Commis
sion's request for an injunction restrain
ing the defendants from violating anti
fraud provisions. The Commission had
82

alleged that a sales brochure distributed
by the defendants describing certain se
curities Issued by the bank contained
various materially false and misleading
statements. The only statement that the
district court enjoined was the represen
tation that the bank, which was not sub
ject to Federalor State deposit insurance,
was "bonded and insured for the protec
tion of depositors." The court of appeals
affirmed this aspect of the order. The
district court also found misleading the
brochure's statement that the bank paid
"guaranteed" interest on deposits, but
the court ruled that the misstatement
was not matenal because there was no
evidence that any investor had relied on
the statement. The court of appeals dis
agreed with this position stating, as the
Commission had argued, that the ques
tion of reliance has no part in the con
sideration of whether the materiality
standard has been met. In addition, the
court of appeals indicated dissatisfaction
with the district court's finding that cer
tain other statements in the brochure
were not misleading because they were
recognizable as mere "puffing."
Securitres and Exchange Commission
v. Radio Hill Mines Co., Ltd.so-The court
of appeals held in this case that a Federal
district court has power to include within
an injunctive decree, prohibiting further
violations of the registration and anti
fraud provisions of the Federal securities
laws, a requirement that the defendant
file with the Commission an initial and
periodic reports of his secunties holdings
and transactions, where such ancillary
relief is necessary to aid enforcement of
the injunction. The Commission's show
ing that the defendant had made a prac
tice of concealing his illegal transactions
necessitated the reporting requirement.
The court of appeals further held, citing
California v. Byers," that the Fifth Amend
ment privilege against self-incrimination
may not be invoked as a basis for non
compliance with the reporting require
ment, Since "securities regulation is an
essentially 'non-criminal and regulatory
area of inquiry' n, the ownership of se
curities "is generally a completely 'lawful

activity' ", and "disclosure of such own
ership is not an admission of an '10
herently suspect' activity."
SEC. v. Spectrum, Ltd.71-The district
court refused to enter a preliminary in
junction agarnst a lawyer who wrote an
opinion letter stating that the common
stock of Spectrum, Ltd., held by some 58
persons, could be sold without registra
tion under the Securities Act. In fact, as
the court found, the 58 persons included
a number of nominees for a statutory
underwriter of the shares in question, and
the letter had been sought as part of a
scheme to sell the shares illegally. The
court stated that the lawyer could be an
aider and abettor of the Section 5 viola
tions only if he had knowledge of the
improper scheme and, with the purpose of
furthering it, had performed an act neces
sary to its execution. The court concluded
that while the lawyer may have been
negligent in preparing the opinion letter,
there was insufficient evidence that he
was guilty of more serious misconduct.
The Commission appealed, arguing (1)
that the district judge erred in declining
to hold an evidentiary hearing even
though he found various facts concern
ing the lawyer's knowledge of the scheme
to be in dispute, and (2) that the Com
mission may obtain injunctive relief
against an attorney who issues an opin
ion that securities may be sold without
registration where a reasonable investi
gation would havedisclosed that such was
not the case.
S.E.C. v. Ezrine "-The
Commission
brought an enforcement action to enjoin
Ezrine, an attorney, from continuing to
appear and practice before it in violation
of Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules
of Practice and orders issued by the Com
mission pursuant thereto. The Commis
sion charged that after Ezrine had been
temporarily and then permanently sus
pended from practice before the Commis
sion, he continued to appear and prac
tice by representing certain respondents
in an administrative proceeding con
ducted before an administrative law judge
of the Commission and by continuing to
serve as house counsel to a broker-dealer,

advising the broker-dealerwith respect to
its responsibilities under the Federal se
cunties laws. Ezrine's temporary suspen
sion was predicated on his misconduct in
volving a public offering of securities of
Manor Nursing Centers, Inc. for which
he had been permanently enjoined in an
earlier Commission enforcement action
from further violations of the registration
and antifraud provisions of the Federal
securities laws." He was thereafter per
manently disqualified from appearing and
practicing before the Commission by op
eration of Rule 2(e)(2) as a result of his
being convicted of conspiracy to violate
Federal Reserve Board Regulation T, a
felony."
In addition to seeking injunctive relief,
the Commission requested the district
court to direct Ezrine to disclose to all
persons who seek to retain his services in
connection With any matters relatmg to
the Federal securities laws, the fact that
he has been permanently disqualified
from appearing and practicing before the
Commission. The Comrnissron further re
quested that Ezrine be restrained from
obtaining any legal fees or other consid
eration for services he may render 10
volving matters before or within the juris.
diction of the Commission, and that he be
ordered to disgorge all legal fees obtained
for services rendered during the period
of hrs disqualification.
The United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York, on the
Commission's motion for temporary reo
lief, preliminarily enjoined Ezrine from
continuing to appear and practice before
the Commission. For purposes of the in
junction, the term "appearing and prac
ticing" was determined to include, (1)
participatmg in a representative capacity
in an admmistrative proceeding or in
vestigation instituted by the Commission;
(2) participating in a representative ca
pacity in any formal or informal confer
ence with the Commission or its staff;
(3) representing or advising any entity or
person in connection with the prepara
tion or filing of documents with the Com
mission; and (4) representing, in connec
tion with any matters arising under the
83

Federalsecurrtres laws, any broker-dealer,
investment company or Investment ad
viser registered or required to be regis
tered with the Commission. The court
further ordered that, pending disposition
of the Commission's request for perma
nent relief, Eznne advise all present and
prospective clients, who have retained or
seek to retain his legal services in con
nection with matters involving the Federal
securrtres laws, that he cannot and will
not practice before the Commission. The
court also restrained Ezrine from receiv
mg or retaining legal fees or other com
pensation which he may receive or claim
for services rendered subsequent to the
date of the order and in contravention
thereof.
S.E.C.v. EverestManagementCorp."
The court of appeals affirmed the district
court's denial of a motion by an invest
ment company and its adviser to inter
vene as plaintiffs in a Commission en
forcement action for the purpose of
seeking damages from certain of the 44
defendants named in the suit. The Com
mission had charged the defendants with
violations of antifraud provisions of the
Investment Company Act designed to
prevent self-dealing and gross abuse of
trust. In holding that the district court
did not abuse its discretion In denying the
request for intervention, the court of ap
peals agreed with the Commission's argu
ment that the action would become
unduly confused and complex since inter
vention would add new issues and inter
fere with the expeditious conduct of the
action and the possibility of negotiating
consent decreeswith some of the defend
ants. The court noted that, while under
unusual circumstances it might be appro
priate for a district court to allow a pnvate
party to intervene in a Commission en
forcement action, the propriety of the dis
trict court's denial of intervention was
clearly supported where the complicating
effect of the additional issues and addi
tional parties outweighed any advantage
of a single dlsposrtion of the common
issues.
SEC. v. National Student Marketing
Corporation
("NSMC")'6-The
Com
84

mission brought suit to enjoin 20 defend
ants, including NSMC and a number of
its officers and directors, its outside audi
tors, its outside legal counsel, various of
ficers and directors of, and outside coun
sel to Interstate National Corporation
("Interstate"), a company acquired by
NSMC,and a lawyer representing the pur
chasers of a company sold by NSMC,
from further violations of the antifraud,
proxy and reporting provisions of the Fed
eral securities laws. The law firm that had
been outside counsel to NSMCand one of
the firm's partners filed a motion to dis
miss based on improper venue in the Dis
trict of Columbia and an alternative mo
tion to sever the claims against them and
transfer them to the Southern District of
New York. The district court denied both
motions. On the venue claim, the court
held that, since the Commission had al
leged a common scheme among the de
fendants to violate the securities laws and
since some of the transactions alleged to
have been made in furtherance of the
scheme had concededly occurred in the
District of Columbia, venue was proper
there as to all of the defendants, whether
or not a particular defendant had him
self performed a violative transaction in
the Distnct of Columbia. In addition, the
court held that venue once established
under either the Securities Act or the Ex
change Act is sufficient for both acts. The
court denied the alternative motion for
severance and transfer on the grounds
that while such a severancemight be con
venient to the moving defendants, it
would be inconvenient to other parties
and witnesses who, as a result of the
transfer, would have to undergo two
separate trials.
The court also denied motions for sum
mary judgment and, in the alternative, to
dismiss, which were filed by the president
of Interstate and its counsel. The allega
tions 'against these defendants concern
the closing of a merger between NSMC
and Interstate and a contemporaneous
sale of NSMCstock by certain Interstate
insiders after these defendants had re
ceived a draft "comfort letter" from
NSMC's auditors stating that the finan

cial statements of NSMC that had been
presented to the shareholders
of both
companies
in seeking their approval of
the merger required certain significant
adjustments.
In denymg the motions, the
court observed that receipt of the draft
comfort letter "would provide the basis
for an inference of an awareness that
previously received financial information
was false and misleading,
and, conse
quently, that the acts performed by the
movants were done knowingly and wil
fully." The court granted summary judg
ment in favor of three other Interstate
directors who had been present at the
closing and had sold NSMC stock on
that day on the theory that, assuming
these defendants had knowingly and wil
fully violated the securities laws, there
was no reasonable likelihood of a future
violation by them, since they had either
retired or were approaching retirement.
The Commission
moved to have dis.
missed from the action cross-claims filed
by various of the defendants against their
co-defendants. The court dismissed them,
observing
in Its opinion that "[w]here
suit IS brought by the government to en
force the law, public
policy militates
against the pendency of pnvate claims
and the concomitant
delay, confusion
and cornnlexrty they introduce."
However, over the Commission's
op
position, the Judicial Panel on Multidis
trict
Litigation,
pursuant
to 28 U.S.C.
S 1407, ordered the action consolidated

Safeway Portland Employees' Federal
creon Union v. C. H. Wagner & Co.,
Inc."-Thls
is a private action brought
under Section 12(1) of the Securities Act
by a purchaser of brokered certificates of
deposit. The Commission has argued in
ite armcus cunee bnef in the court of
appeals that such certificates must be
registered under the Securities Act and
do not fall within the "bank-issued
secunties" exemption of Section 3(a)(2)
of that Act. A brokered certificate of de
posit is a bank certificate combined with
a broker's promise to pay bonus inter.
est over and above the interest payable
by the bank. The interest to be paid by
the broker comes from a person who
wishes to borrow money from the bank
but lacks sufficient funds to satisfy the
bank's compensating balance require.
merit. The prospective borrower ap
proaches a broker who undertakes to fmd
an investor to purchase a certmcate of
deposit in the bank in lieu of the com
pensating balance, and the broker
charges a fee to the borrower, part of
which fee the broker uses to pay the
bonus interest to the investor. The Com.
mission has taken the position that the
brokered certificate is an Investment con
'tract issued by the broker since the
broker offers an investment involving a
different economic inducement and a
different degree of risk from those asso
ciated with a bank certificate of deposit.
In a suit against C. H. Wagner & Co.,
Inc. and various corporations and in
divrduals affiliated with it, the Commis
sion obtained a permanent injunction
against the defendants' sale of "bro
kered" certlfrcates of deposits." No ap
peal was taken.
Lanza v. Drexel & Co.83-ln this case,
the court of appeals, sitting en bane, held
that a director of a corporation engaged
in selling its securities is not liable for
damages to a purchaser of those secur
ities under Exchange Act Rule lOb-5,
even though the purchaser acquired the
86

securities on the basis of materially false
and misleading statements by the corpo
ration. The court based its decision on a
district court opinion, rendered after trial,
which concluded that the director in ques
tion did not know that any of the infor
mation supplied to the purchaser was
false or mrsleading and, under the cir
cumstances, did not have any reason
to believe that it was. At the request of
the court, the Commission participated
amicus curiae in this case. In its brief,
the Commission asserted that it could
not be determined from the district
court's opinion whether the director had
reason to believe that other corporate
officers had engaged in improper con
duct. The Commission urged that if the
district court on remand were to find the
circumstances such as to put a rea
sonable director on notice of improper
conduct, then the director's failure to
discover the false statements was
actionable.
The court of appeals, with four judges
drssenting, rejected the Commission's
position on the ground that a corporate
director owes no "duty of diligence to
prospective purchasers to insure that all
material adverse information is conveyed
to such purchasers. . . ." After review.
ing the evidence and finding that the di
rector was not negligent, the court held
that directors are not insurers. It con
cluded that "proof of a willful or reckless
disregard for the truth is necessary to establish liability under Rule lOb-5."
In Travis v. Anthes Imperial Limited,"
the United States Court of Appeals for
the Eighth Circuit held, as the Commis
sion had urged, that the district court
erred in dismissing a suit by Missouri
residents who alleged that, in the course
of telephone calls they placed from Mis
souri to Canada, Canadian defendants
had fraudulently induced them to refrain
from selling certain securities, in viola
tion of Section lO(b) of the ExchangeAct
and Rule lOb-5 thereunder. The court
accepted the Commission's position that
the Exchange Act was applicable even
though the plaintiffs initiated the tele
phone calls and even though the securi

ties in question were neither issued by an
American corporation nor traded on an
American exchange. The court stated that
the "real question is whether the mails
or instrumentalities of interstate commerce were used to mislead the plain.
tiffs."
In its brief the Commission had also
urged the court to abandon the doctrine
established by Birnbaum v. Newport Steel
Corp.," that permits only a purchaser or
seller of securities to recover monetary
damages in a private action under Rule
1Ob-5. While the court found it unnecessary to reach this issue-holding that the
plaintiffs were in fact sellers of securities
since they eventually sold the securities
they had allegedly been fraudulently induced to hold-it did express some doubt
as to the doctrine's validity.
In Blakely v. Lisac," a private action
for damages under Section lO(b) of the
Securities ExchangeAct and Rule lOb-5,
the Commission filed a memorandum as
amicus curiae expressing its views concerning the showing of reliance and causation requited to support recovery. Some
of the plaintiffs had purchased shares of
a company based upon a fraudulent prospectus during the initial public offering; other purchases had been made in
the after-market when materially misleading company reports were being released.
The Commission argued, in accord with
MIlls v. Electric Auto-Lite Co.51 and Affiliated Ute Citizens v. United States," that
causation would be adequately established by proof that material omissions
had been made in the prospectus or reports. Accordingly, there would be no
need for individual proof of causation
whether through reliance or otherwise. As
to affirmative misrepresentations, the
Commission argued that, at least where
injury is alleged to result from the adverse impact of fraudulent statements
upon the market price of a security,
causation would be adequately demonstrated by a showing of materiality, and
no individual proof should be required
from individual members of the class.
In Naftalin & Co., Inc. v. Merrill Lynch,
Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc.," the United

States Court of Appeals for the Eighth
Clrcurt, while remanding for further proceedings, expressed general agreement
With the previously reported decision of
the district court
m a proceeding
brought by six broker-dealers to have
Naftalrn & Co., Inc., also a broker-dealer,
adjudicated an involuntary bankrupt. The
district court had found that Naftalm purported to sell secunties It did not own
through special cash accounts it maintained With each of the SIXbroker-dealers,
and that the broker-dealers failed to
liqurdate those accounts until long after
the dates on which Naftalm agreed to
make delivery of the securities. The district court disallowed the broker-dealers'
claims to the extent they arose out of
unlawful extensions of credit to Naftalin
in Violation of the provisions of the Federal ReserveBoard's Regulation T." In accord with views expressed by the Comrnissron as amicus cutiee, the court of
appeals generally agreed with the district
court that the broker-dealer appellants
had Violated Regulation T if they had
not timely bought in securities to cover
Naftalm's sales when Naftalin failed to
make prompt delivery of the securities,
but disagreed with that court that (by
analogy to the seven-day liquidation period applicable to purchase transactions) "' delivery was required on or before the seventh day after sale. The court
of appeals recognized, as the Cornmission had argued, that the good faith of a
broker-dealer in expecting prompt delivery is determinative; that at some point
In time inquiry is required, and that only
reliance upon a credible explanation for
further delay would prevent a violation
from occurring. The court of appeals further held that a broker-dealer's Regulation T Violation limited its claim against
Naftalin, notwithstanding Naftalin's perpetration of a fraud, to the difference between the sales price of the securities
sold for Naftalin and the price at which
the broker-dealer should have bought in
the securrtres when Naftalin failed to
deliver.

Douglas Aircraft Company, Douglas, its
underwriters
and Its accountants were'
charged with filing a false and misleading
registration
statement
and prospectus
and with violations of the antifraud pro
vrsrons of the securities laws. The de.
fendants attempted to introduce evidence
of "approval"
of certain statements in
the prospectus
by Cornmissron
staff
members
at
pre-filing
conferences.
Plaintiffs moved to exclude this evidence.
The Commission filed a memorandum as
amicus curiae in support of the motion,
arguing that responsibility
for the ac
curacy of a registration statement is upon
those who participate in its preparation
and file it; and that responsibility cannot
be shifted to the Commission, which does
not have authority to "approve" registra
tion statements. In any event, the Com
mlssion noted, views expressed by mem
bers of the Commission's
staff do not
necessarily reflect the views of the Com
mission. The court held that evidence of
the conferences was inadmissible as to
whether the statements in the prospectus
were accurate, and also inadmissible to
prove the "due dilligence" defense of all
defendants except the accountants.

Cooperation with Other

Enforcement Agencies

In recent years the Commission has
given increased emphasis to cooperation
and coordination of Its own activities with
the various other enforcement agencies,
including
the self-regulatory
organiza
tions, enforcement agencies at the State
and local level, and certain foreign agen
cies. Its programs In this area cover a
broad range. For example, the Commis
sion believes that certain cases are more
appropriately enforced at the local rather
than the Federal level where the viola
tions, while involving the Federal secu
rities laws, are of a local nature. In these
instances, the Commission authorizes the
referral of the case to the appropriate
State or local agency, and members of
the staff familiar with it are made avail
able for assistance to that agency in its
enforcement action.
The Cornrnissron has also fostered pro

The

resulting

beneficial to all concerned, and the use
of this approach has been expanded.
The Commission's
Proceedings and
Litigation Records Branch provides one
of the means for cooperation on a con
tinuing baSIS with other agencies having
enforcement responsibilities. The Branch
acts as a clearinghouse for information
regarding enforcement
actions in secu
rities matters that have been taken by
State and Canadian authorities,
other
governmental
and self-regulatory
agen
cies, and the Commission itself. It an
swers req uests for specrfic information
and in addition publishes a penodic bul
letin which IS sent to contributing
agen
cies and to other
enforcement
and
regulatory bodies. During fiscal 1973, the
branch received 3,710 letters either pro
viding or requesting Information, and sent
out 3,099 communications to cooperating
agencies. Records maintained
by the
Branch reflect a steady increase In recent
years in the number of enforcement ac
tions taken by State and Canadian au
thorities. The data in the SV (Securities
Violation) Files, which is computerized is
useful in screening issuers and applicants
for registration as securities or commod
ities brokers or dealers or investment
advisers, as well as applicants for loans
from such agencies as the Small Business
Administration.

FOREIGN RESTRICTED LIST
The Commission maintains and pub
licizes a Foreign Restricted List designed
to alert broker-dealers, financial institu
tions, investors and others to possible
unlawful distnbutions
of foreign secun
ties. The list consists of names of foreign
companies whose securities the Com
mission has reason to believe have re
cently
been, or are currently
being,
offered for public sale In the United
States in violation of registration require
ments. Most broker-dealers refuse to ef
fect transactions
in securrties issued by
companies on the list. This does not nec
essarily prevent promoters from Illegally
offering such securities directly to United
States investors. During the past fiscal
year 14 corporations were added to the

Foreign Restncted List, bringing the total
number of corporations on the list to 75.
The following
companies
were added
dunng the year:
Rodney Gold Mines Llmited."\3-This is
a Canadian corporation that was inactive
from 1946 until November 1971. Its only
known asset IS a mining claim rn Ontano.
In December 1971 it registered 633,214
shares with the Ontano Secunties Com
mission includmg a secondary offenng of
383,214
shares
acquired
that
same
month for less than 1/5 of a cent per
share. The shares m the secondary offer
ing were sold at prices ranging from 35
cents to 48 cents per share. On Febru
ary 2, 1972, the Ontano Secunties Com
mission
suspended trading
in this se
curity due to the apparently
unjustified
sharp increase m ItS market price.
Antel International
Corporation.
Ltd.,
Canterra Development Corporation,
Ltd.,
Cardwell 0" Corporation, Ltd.""-These
three interrelated
Canadian corporations
were placed on the list at the same time.
Antel was the successor to Amencan Mo
bile Telephone & Tape Company Ltd.,
already on the list, which had sold un
registered shares fraudulently,
whose in
vestors had never received their shares,
and whose officers
had pleaded nolo
contendere to the felony of selling shares
not qualified under California
securities
laws. Antel was to merge with Canterra
in a purported effort to give defrauded
investors some measure of restitution,
until the California
Department
of Cor
porations determined that Canterra was
not a viable entity srnce it had no income
from business operations. The proposed
reorganization
contemplated
issuance of
unregistered
shares of Cardwell, which
appeared to be the true assignee of the
telephone devrce purportedly transferred
from American Mobile to Ante!.

Part 5
Investment Companies
and Advisers


Under the Investment Company Act of
1940 and the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940, the Commission IS charged with
extensive regulatory and supervisory re
sponsibilities over investment companies
and investment advisers. Unlike the other
Federal securities laws which emphasize
disclosure, the Investment Company Act
provides a regulatory framework within
which investment companies must oper
ate. Among other things the Act: (1) pro
hibits changes in the nature of an in
vestment company's business or Its in
vestment
policies without
shareholder
approval; (2) protects against manage
ment self-dealing, embezzlement or abuse
of trust; (3) provides specific controls to
eliminate or mitigate inequitable capital
structures;
(4) requires that an invest
ment company disclose its financial con
dition and Investment policies; (5) pro
vides that management contracts be sub

The August 1972 reorganization of the
Commission for the first time placed re
sponsrbrhty
for both Investment compa
nies and Investment advisers in one DIVISion-the
Divrslon of Investment Com

more accurately,
the DiVISion's name was changed to the
Division of Investment Management Reg
ulation.

Proposed Oil and Gas 

lnvestment Act 

Another business area where the Commission deems further regulation neces.
sary for investor protection is that of oil
and gas drilling funds and programs. In
June, 1972, the Commission submitted
t o the Congress legislation which would
provide such protection by requiring
registration of oil programs and by subjecting them to comprehensive reguiation.
I t would provide controls designed t o pre.
vent c o ~ f l i c t s of interest a n d unfair
transactions between oil programs and
their managers, and t o insure financial
responsibility of program managers: pro.
hibit changes in fundamental policies of
an oil program without approval o f the
participants; and require t h a t a person
acting as a program manager do so under
a written contract which contains certain
provisions. Some provisions of the pro.
posed statute would be administered
primarily by the National Association of
Securities Dealers with Commission over.
sight. These relate t o sales charges, sales
literature, sdtability of an investment and
a classification system for the various
forms of management compensation.
The legislation was introduced in both
houses of the 92d Congress, but was not
acted upon. It was reintroduced i n the
93d Congress in 1973.'

Sale of lnvestment Adviser
I n 1972, the Commission also pro.
posed legislation ' t o modify those sec.
tions of the lnvestment Company Act
that were affected by the decision of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit
in Rosenfeld v. Black.B I n that case, the
court held that the general principle in
equity that a fiduciary cannot sell his
office for personal gain is impliedly in.
corporated into Section 15(a) of the Act
requiring shareholder approval of any
new investment advisory contract. Consequently, a retiring investment adviser
of an investment company viol&:es the
Act by receiving compensation 'which
reflects either (1) a payment contingent

upon the use of influence to secure approval of a new adviser or (2) an assurance of profits for the successor adviser
under a new advisory contract and
renewals.
In submitting the proposed legislation.
the Commission expressed its view that
the principles of equity were appropri.
ately applied t o the facts of the above
case, which involved an outright sale
by an investment adviser of its advisory
contract with a registered investment
company. While the Rosenfeld case did
not involve the sale of an outgoing investment adviser's assets, the sweep of
the Court's language nevertheless cast
doubt on whether an investment adviser
could profit when it sold its business in
that manner.
I n its statement accompanying the
legislation, the Commission suggested
that it would be in the public interest t o
remove the uncertainty in the mutual fund
industry generated by the Rosenfeld
decision. Thus, the proposed amendments are intended t o permit an investment adviser, or an affiliated person of an
adviser, to obtain a profit in connection
with a transaction which results in an
assignment of the advisory contract if
certain conditions are met. These conditions are designed t o prevent a retiring
investment adviser or an affiliate, in connection with the sale of the adviser's
business, from receiving any payment or
other benefit which includes any amount
reflecting its assurance that the investment advisory contract will be continued.
The proposed bill was not enacted in
vear
the 92d Congress. Durina the oast
.
i t was reintroduced in modified form and
passed by the Senate.'
>

Municipal Bond Rating Services
I n March 1973, a bill was introduced in
the House of Representatives which would
amend the lnvestment Advisers Act to
provide substantive regulation of persons
rating municipal bonds and qualitative
assessment of municipal bond ratings.'

as to the ob-

MUTUAL FUND DISTRIBUTION
As in pnor years, the Commission's
concern over the cost to investors of particlpatrng in mutual funds, and with regulatory problems associated With the distnbution
system, was manifested
in a
number of areas.
As discussed in Part 1 of this report,
extensive hearings were held by the Commission on these matters during the fiscal
year. In addition,
certain specifrc proposals were made. The Commission,
on
December 21, 1972, proposed an amendment of Rule 22d-1 under the Investment
Company
Act to permit
quantity
discounts for group purchases of open-end
investment company securities under certain limited circumstances.
Section 22(d)
of the Act, in effect, prohibits registered
investment
companies
from selling redeemable securities to any person other
than a dealer or princrpal underwriter
at
a pnce less than that at which the secunties are sold to the public, but provides
that the Commission
may permit excepnons to this retail price maintenance provision by rule. R'ule 22d-1 adopted under
Section 22(d), presently permits quantity
purchasers, their
discounts to rndividual
spouses and children under 21, and to
trustees of single fiduciary accounts, includmg
qualified
pension
and profttsharing
plans, but not to groups
of
purchasers.
The proposal would, in effect, give each
Issuer a choice between (a) giving quantity discounts to the persons now speerfred in Rule 22d-1 and not to groups or
(b) offering
quantity
discounts
to certain "bona fide" groups as well as to
purchasers to whom they are presently
available.
Eligible groups would be defined to exclude any groups not in existence for at least six months or which
have no other purpose than to purchase
mutual fund shares at a discount.
In
addition to written comments, the Comrnlssron solicited comments on the rule
proposal from those appearing
at the
mutual fund distribution
hearings held
10 February 1973.
The need to develop new markets for
fund shares IS a product of increased
99

competition
for investors' savings. One
means adopted by certain funds to attract
investors has been to reduce or eliminate
the sales load previously Imposed on
sales of their shares. As a result of the
Commission's
opinion in United Funds,
lnc.," which granted certain open-end in
vestment companies an exemption from
Section 22(d) to permit their shareholders
to use redemption
proceeds to repur
chase shares Without the payment of
a sales load Within 15 days after request
ing redemption,
numerous applications
were received from open-end companies
for similar exemptions. During the fiscal
year, the Commission published for com
ment proposed Rule 22d-2." The pro
posed rule is designed to codify the
exemptive relief afforded United Funds,
Inc. and to extend the permissible period
between redemption
and reinvestment
from 15 to 30 days. No final action has
yet been taken on the proposal.
During the fiscal year, the Commission
continued
to seek liberallzation
of its
mutual fund advertising
rules," which
may also have an impact on the drstrrbu
tion

process. On January

ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

SERVICES

On January 23, 1973, the Commission
released the report of the Cornrnlssron's
Advisory Committee on Investment Man
agement Services for Individual Investors.
This industry committee was appointed
by the Commission rn October to study
problems in the development of invest
ment management services for direct in
vestors with relatively small amounts to
invest. A major problem for those wishing
to develop such services is the uncer
tainty as to when such services can be
deemed to involve the sale of a security
or the operation of an investment com
pany and thus be subject to the vanous
registration
provisions.
The Advisory Committee's
report con
tains the results of a survey on practices
in the selection and use of brokers, cus
todial and record-keeping
services, the
designation of investment objectives, the
use of model accounts and approved lists,
and other ingredients of the mvestment
management process.
Among
the
Committee's
principal
recommendations:
(1) Investment man
agement
services for small accounts
should not be treated as investment com
panies for purposes of the Investment
Company Act, whether or not they furrush
individualized service, as long as there is
no pooling of clients' accounts; (2) These
services should not be treated as in
volving the public offering of a security
for purposes of the Securities Act if they
furnish clients individualized
service or
make recornrnendations only and have no
discretion
in the execution of portfolio
transactions; (3) The Commission should
adopt guidelines, as suggested by the
Committee,
for persons offering these
services to determine what constitutes
"individualized
service;" (4) Firms offer
ing these services should be required to
give

prospective

closure
ciding

statement
whether

a particular

(5)

The Commission

should adopt rules or publish

interpreta

tions to provide necessary protection for
clients of small account services against
cortain conflicts of interest, such as those
that can arise from fee-sharing promo
tronal arrangements,
broker affiliations.
and the use of mside mforrnatron: (6) The
Commission should take appropnate ac
tion to promulgate standards governing
thE' professional qualifications and finan
cial responsibility of investment advisers
and a system of self-regulation
for rn
vestment advisers.
The Cornrnissron is studying the Com
mittee's recommendations
and consider
ing staff proposals for action based on the
recommendations.

INVESTMENT ADVISER
REGULATION
Dunng the latter part of the fiscal year,
the Cornmissron directed the Drvrsion of
Investment
Management
Regulation to
develop for Commission consideration a
comprehensive program to tighten regula
tion of investment advrsers, The program
may include new rules regarding dis
closure, reportmg and other matters con
cerrung advisory operations, a staff in
qurry into exrsting industry practices, and,
where such inquiry reveals substantial
defrciencres, the proposal of additional
new rules or legislation. Particular con
sideratron WIll be given to the necessity of
minimum qualifications for advisory em
ployees, frnancial responsibility of invest
ment advisers, and problems of potential
conflrcts of interest.

NUMBER OF REGISTRANTS
As of June 30, 1973, there were 1,361
investment companres regrstered under
the Act, with assets having an aggregate
market value of over $73 billion. Com
pared With corresponding totals at
June 30, 1972, those figures represent an
increase of 28 in the number of regis
tered companies but a decrease of nearly
$8 bilhon in the market value of assets.
Further data is presented in the statistical
section of the report.
On June 18, 1973, the Commission
determined that more than 750 invest
ment advisers were no longer in existence
or were not engaged in business as in
vestment advisers and issued an order
cancelling their registratrons." The Com
mission had previously Issued a nonce of
mtentron to cancel the registrations of
more than 800 registered investment ad
visers," principally based on the fact that,
despite prior cornrnurucations that annual
assessments for 1971 and/or 1972 were
due and payable, payments had not been
made. Fourteen of those investment ad
vrsers Withdrew from registration, and the
Commission received payment of 1971
and/or 1972 annual assessments, total
ing approximately $8,300, from about 59
registrants. At June 30, 1973, 2,892 in
vestment advisers were registered WIth
the Comrnisston, representing a decrease
of 919 from a year before.
During the fiscal year, the staff of the
Cornrrussion conducted 170 investment
company examinations and 272 invest
ment adviser examinations, representing
increases of 60 percent and 84 percent,
respectively, over the prior fiscal year.
During the same penod, approximately
$815,628 was recovered by investment
102

cornparues and their shareholders as a
result of the Commission's various com
pliance and enforcement actlvttres.

APPLICATIONS
One of the Commission's principal
activities in its regulation of investment
compames and investment advisers is
the consideration of applications for
exemptions from various provisions of the
Investment Company and Investment Ad
visers Acts or for certain other relief un.
der those Acts. Applrcations may also
seek determinations of the status of per
sons or cornpanies. During the fiscal year,
347 applications were filed under both
Acts, and final action was taken on 326
applications. As of the end of the year,
158 applications were pending under both
Acts!' Of the totals described, the pre
dominant number were applications un
der the Investment Company Act. With
respect to the Advisers Act, 3 applications
were flied, final action was taken on I,
and 2 were pending at year end.
Under the Investment Company Act,
affiliates of a registered investment com
pany cannot participate In a joint arrange
ment with the registered company or
purchase from or sell securities to the reg
istered company unless they first obtain
the Comrnlssron's approval. life Insur
ance Investors, Inc., a registered openend investment company which owned
8.06 percent of the stock of Old line Life
Insurance Company, certain affiliates of
Life Insurance Investors who also owned
stock of Old Line, and Old line, filed
an application for an order permit
ting them to vote their holdings of
Old Line stock to merge Old Line with a
wholly-owned subsrdiary of USLIFE Cor
poration and to receive common stock of
USLIFEthrough the conversion of all the
outstanding common stock of Old line
into common stock of USLIFE. As orlg
inally contemplated, the merger terms
called for the payment of a $650,000 fee
to an affiliate of Life Insurance Investors
for arranging the merger. After the staff
pointed out that payment of such a fee
might raise problems under the standards
of Section 17 of the Act. the applicants

eliminated provision for this fee and Im
proved, by a comparable amount in the
aggregate, the terms offered all Old Line
shareholders. During the pendency of
this application, it became apparent that,
in previously acquiring stock of Old Line,
certain affiliates of Life Insurance Inves
tors might have violated provisions of the
securities laws. The Commission com
menced a legal action in a Federal court
charging such violations against these
persons, seeking a preliminary and per
manent injunction and an order directing
the defendants to disgorge all profits."
Council for defendants then represented
that certain defendants would (and they
subsequently did) deposit certain sums
in an escrow account, subject to determi
nation in such action as to how the ac
count should be distributed. In ruling on
the application, the Commission noted
that separate action to achieve accounta
bility for any violations arising from previ
ous acquisitions of Old Line stock was
available to the Commission and other
interested persons, and concluded that,
under those circumstances and in view of
the total stockholder Interests affected by
the proposed merger, an order granting
the application was appropriate."
In Chase Investors Management Cor
poration New York,'" the applicant re
quested that the Commission issue an
order declaring that it was not an invest
ment adviser as defined in Section 202
(a)(l1) of the Advisers Act. The appli
cant was a subsidiary formed by Chase
Manhattan Corporation, the bank holding
company which also owns Chase Man
hattan Bank, to take over and expand the
advisory services conducted by the bank.
The subsidiary indicated its intent to
offer investment research, advisory and
management services to the bank, to the
public, and to institutional Investors such
as employee benefit funds and, possibly,
investment companies. The applicant
argued that its status as a bank holding
company subsidiary subjected It to the
same regulation as a bank or bank hold
ing company, thereby qualifying it for
the "bank" exclusion from the Advisers
Act. A hearing was ordered by the Com

mrssron
on the application. Prior to
commencement, the hearing was can.
celed when the applicant withdrew ItS
application and registered under the Ad
visers Act. Subsequently, a number of
other non-bank investment advisory sub
sidranes of bank holding companies have
registered with the Commission under
the Advisers Act.
In order to market its shares effectively
in foreign countries, a registered mutual
fund may find it necessaryto conform to
seiling practices prevailing abroad. Those
practices, however, may In some In
stances conflict with the requirements of
the Investment Company Act, and the
utilization of different practices in diverse
locations may itself be impermissible
under that Act. For example, a practice
in Japan pursuant to which shares of
mutual funds are sold to the public in
block offerings at prices based on net
asset values previously determined rather
than at prices determined after the sale,
as required by the Act, could not be fol
lowed by a registered fund without an
order of exemption. Similarly, a registered
fund may not, without another exemption,
sell its shares to the public in Japan at
prices, including sales loads, which differ
from those applicable in the United
States. The Commission granted exemp
nons to The Dreyfus Fund, Incorporated
to permit ItS shares to be sold In Japan
at prices and with sales loads which are
determined in conformity with the usual
and customary Japanese practice with
respect to the sale of mutual fund
shares."
Under the Investment Company Act,
an affiliated company of a registered in
vestment company cannot sell any secur
ity to or participate In any joint arrange
ment with the investment company abo
sent an order of the Commission. Chris
tiana Securities Company, a closed-end
Investment company with assets valued
at market in excess of $2.2 billion and
which owns 28 percent of the common
stock of E. I. duPont de Nemours and
Company, filed a [ornt application with
duPont for an order permitting Christiana
and duPont to merge. DuPont common
103

stock held by Christiana represents 98.7
percent of the value of Christiana's as
sets. Pursuant to the merger terms,
duPont common stock would be issued
to the Christiana common shareholders,
whose Christiana shares would be retired,
and duPont would be the surviving cor
poration. For purposes of the merger, the
Christiana common shares were valued
at approximately
97.5 percent of their
net asset value. The Commission held
hearings In response to requests from
several shareholders
who alleged the
merger terms were unfair." After the close
of the fiscal year, the Commission heard
oral argument in the matter and took It
under advisement.
In September 1971, Pacific Scholar
ship Trust
Sponsored
by the Pacific
Schotarship Fund filed an application re
questing exemptions from certain sec
nons of the Investment Company Act to
pel mit the sale of scholarship plans. The
plans would require investors to deposit
sums in bank savings accounts, from
which earnings would
be penodrcally
transferred to a trust fund and invested
to provide funds for the eventual college

who did attend college would be derived

cessfully, or If the investor failed to main.
tain his savings account or to make
required periodic payments. In order to
offer plans which include such a forfeit
ure feature, the trust required exemp
tions from several sections of the Act,
including
an exemption
from Section
27(c)(1),
which prohibits
the sale of

June 17 through June 21, 1972. An ini
tial decision by the administrative
law
judge was waived, and the Commission
heard oral argument on March 9, 1973.
No decision had been reached by the
end of the fiscal year.
Section 22(d) of the Investment Com
pany Act prohibits a registered invest
ment company from selling its redeem
able securities at a price other than the
current public offering price described in
the prospectus. Putnam Investors Fund,
Inc., a registered open-end investment
company, filed an application
for ex
emption from Section 22(d) so that its
shares could be issued in exchange for
the assets of Refractory Service, lnc., a
personal holding company." As the appli
cation was originally filed, only 23.5 per
cent of the assets of Refractory were se
curities which would be retained in Put
nam's portfolio. Following staff comment
with regard to the brokerage costs to
Putnam shareholders for resulting port
folio adjustments,
Refractory's portfolio
was adjusted prior to the transaction at
its expense so that securities to be re
tained would amount to a minimum of 60
percent.

RULES AND GUIDELINES
Continued implementation
of the in
vestment Company Amendments Act of
1970 as well as the normal continuing re
view of rules In light of changing con.
drtions and administrative
experrence
resulted in the revision of various rules
under the Investment Company and In
vestment Advisers Acts during the fiscal
year.

in this area. Subsequently,
after further examination
in its report,
Public Policy Implications of Investment
Company Growth," the Commission rec
ommended that the Investment Company
Act be amended to empower the Com
mission to adopt rules for the protection
of investors In connection with purchases
or sales of securities by persons with
access to the investment
company's
decision-making
process ("access
per
sons"). In response to this recommenda
tion Section 170) was added by the In
vestment Company Amendments Act of
1970.
On December 26, 1972, the Commis
sion proposed for public comment Rule
17j-l
to implement
the provisions of
Section 17(j).%5 As proposed, the rule
would provide a general antifraud provi
sion, similar to those contained in Rules
10b-5_and
15c-2 under the Exchange
Act and Section 206 of the Advisers
Act, in the context of the purchase or
sale by an access person of a security
which is held or to be acquired by the
investment
company with which he is
affiliated. Further, it would contain a spe
cific antifraud provision prohibiting any
access person from purchasing or seil
ing a security for his own account when
he knows the investment
company IS
purchasing or selling it or the investment
adviser is recommending or is consider
ing recommending
that the investment
company purchase or sell that security.
This prohibition would apply to situations
where consideration
of a recommenda
tion has reached an advanced stage. To
enforce the general and specific anti
fraud provisions, proposed Rule 17J-l in
cludes a reporting requirement for access
persons which is patterned after Rule
204-2(a)(12)
under the Advisers Act.
Finally, the rule proposal would require

protection for access persons, Rule 17j-l
would permit Codes of Ethics to allow
"prior clearance" procedures under which
access persons could receive pre-trans
action guidance as to the applicability of
the specific antifraud provisions. During
the comment period, the Commission re
ceived 105 letters concerning various pro
visrons of proposed Rule 17j-1. As a re
sult of these comments, it is expected
that the Commission will revise the rule
and re-circulate It for public comment.

Performance

Fees

Section 205 of the Advisers Act was
amended by the Investment Company
Amendments Act of 1970 to deal with
the problem of unfair compensation ar
rangements between Investment advisers
and their clients. Many performance fees
did not decrease when performance was
poor, or, if they did, the decrease was dis
proportionate
to the increase for good
performance. The 1970 amendment was
designed to align, as nearly as possible,
the interests of the Investment adviser
and its clients by prohibiting
incentive
fee arrangements where the compensa
tion does not increase or decrease pro
portionately with investment performance
over a specified period in comparison
with the investment record of an appro
priate index of securities
prices. The
"fulcrum"
point from which increases
and decreases must be measured is the
fee which is earned or paid when the in
vestment performance
of the advisory
account IS equivalent to that of the index.
Section 205, as amended, allows such in

which requires that the performance portion of the advisory fee be more closely
based upon the assets upon which performance was achieved and not be influenced unduly by the amount of assets

from the advisory
account."

Recordkeeping Requirements
During the fiscal year, Rule 31a-2
under the Investment Company Act was
amended to allow microfilm
records to
be maintained by investment companies
in lieu of hard copy records."
The
amended
rule requires,
however, that
equipment and facilities for reading and
making hard copies from microfilm
be
available, and contains certain other safeguards, such as requiring
the maintenance of duplicate copies at other locations in case of fire or other loss.

Part 6
Public Utilities
Holding Companies

Under the Public Utility Holding Com
pany Act of 1935, the Commission regu
lates interstate public-utility holdingcompany systems engaged in the electric
utility business and/or retail distribution
of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also
covers natural gas pipeline companies
and other non-utility companies which are
subsidiary companies of registered hold
ing companies. There are three principal
areas of regulation under the Act: (1)
the physical integration of public-util
ity companies and functionally related
properties of holding-company systems,
and the simplification of intercorporate
relationships and financial structures of
such systems; (2) the financing opera
tions of registered holdmg companies
and their subsidiary companies, the ac
quisition and disposition of securities and
properties and certain accounting prac
tices, servicing arrangements, and in
ter-company transactions; (3) exemptive
provisions relating to the status under
the Act of persons and companies, and
provisions regulating the right of persons
affiliated with a public-utility company to
become affiliated with another such
company through acquisition of securI
tles,

COMPOSITION
At fiscal year-end, there were 23 hold
ing companies registered under the Act.
Twenty were included in the 17 "active"
registered holding-company systems.'

The remammg three registered holding
companies, which are relatively small,
are not considered part of "active" sys
tems" In the 17 active systems, there
were 84 electric and/or gas utility sub
sidiaries, 62 non-utility subsidiaries, and
16 inactive companies, or a total, includ
ing the parent holding companies and the
subholding companies, of 182 system
companies. A table in Part 9 lists the ac
tive systems and their aggregateassets.

PROCEEDINGS
Cities of Lafayette and Plaquemine,
Louisiana v. SEC."The Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit af
firmed the Commission's denial of a mo
tion filed by the cities of Lafayette and
Plaquemine, Louisiana ("Cities"),' seek
ing reopening of the record, closed 14
months prior to the filing of the motion,
and affirmed the Commission's approval
of the acquisition of the common and
preferred stock of Arkansas-Missouri
PowerCompany by Middle South Utilities,
lnc., a registered holding company." The
Cities had alleged that certain activities
of Louisiana Power & Light Company, a
subsidiary of Middle South, violated
Federalantitrust laws. The court observed
that where the administrative process is
far advanced in a particular case, a party
seeking to present new evidence must at
least demonstrate the probability that
consideration of such evidence would
alter the agency's decision, a showing the
109

court
found wanting.
In essence, the
court found that since the CIties' objec
tion was untimely
and their allegations
bore only a dubious nexus to the trans
action at Issue, their motion was properly
denied.

During the
fiscal year, the administrative

The
other Commissioners
considered that an
exempt holding company should be permitted to engage only In such non-utility
activities as are related or complementary in a significant
way to its utility
business. Other non-utility activities, they
said, would dilute the predominant utility
orientation
and tend to Impair the stability associated by Investors with publicutility operations.
The result of the even division of the
Commission was not the same in the two
cases. In Pacific, the issue was whether
a 1936 exemption order should be revoked or modified;
the even division
left the exemption in effect. In National,
the question was whether the company's

FINANCING
Volume
During fiscal 1973, a total of 14 active
registered holding-company
systems issued and sold 55 Issues of long-term debt
and capital stock for cash aggregating
$2.71 billion 11 pursuant to authonzations
by the Commission under Sections 6 and
7 of the Act. All but 3 of these Issues were
sold at competitive bidding to raise new
capital. The public utility fmancmg table
in the statistical
section presents the
amount and types of securrtles Issued
and sold by these holding

systems.
The volume of external financing during 1973 decreased by 3 percent from
the record amount issued and sold during fiscal 1972. Bonds, debentures and

Leasing
In recent years, the use of leases to
finance significant additions to utility fa
cilities has developed. Such transactions
are involved in only a small portion of
the massive expansion the utility indus
try has experienced in this period, but are
far from negligible in absolute amount.
The title retained by the lessor, usually
a financial Institution, under such a lease
makes It the owner of a utility facility.
As such, it would be defined as an electric
or a gas utility company by Sections 2(a)
(3) and 2(a)(4) of the Act and subject to
various obligations
thereunder.

Corporate
Reorganizations

The Commission's
role under Chapter
X of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides
a procedure for reorganizing corporations
in the United States district courts, dif
fers from that under the various other
statutes which it administers. The Com
mission does not- initiate Chapter X pro
ceedings or hold its own hearrngs, and it
has no authority to determine any of the
Issues in such proceedings. The Commis
sion participates
in proceedings under
Chapter X to provide independent, expert
assistance to the courts, participants, and
investors in a highly complex area of
corporate law and finance. It pays spe
cial attention to the interests of public
security holders who may not otherwise
be represented effectively.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of
a debtor corporation exceeds $3 million,
Section 172 of Chapter X requires the
jUdge, before approving any plan of re
organization,
to submit it to the Com
mission for its examination and report.
If the indebtedness does not exceed $3
million, the judge may, if he deems it
advisable to do so, submit the plan to
the Commission before deciding whether
to approve it. When the Commissron files
a report, copies or summaries must be
sent to all secunty holders and creditors
when they are asked to vote on the plan.
The Commission has no authority to veto
a plan of reorganization or to require its
adoption.
The Commission has not considered it
necessary or appropriate to participate in

every Chapter X case. Apart from the ex
cessive administrative
burden, many of
the cases involve only trade or bank
creditors and few public investors. The
Commission seeks to participate princi
pally in those proceedings in which a sub
stantial
public investor interest
is in
volved. However, the Commission
may
also particrpate because an unfair plan
has been or is about to be proposed, pub
lic security holders are not represented
adequately. the reorganization
proceed
ings are being conducted in violation of
important provisions of the act, the facts
indicate that the Commission can per
form a useful service, or the judge re
quests the Commission's
participation.
The Commission in its Chapter X activi
ties has divided the country into five geo
graphical areas. The New York, Chicago,
Los Angeles and Seattle regional offices of
the Commission each have responsibility
for one of these areas. Supervision and
review of the regional offices' Chapter X
work is the responsibility of the Division
of Corporate Regulation of the Commis
sion, which, through its Branch of Re
organization, also serves as a field offrce
for the southeastern area of the tlmted
States.

PROPOSED CHAPTER X RULES
The
mittee
of the
States

Advisory Committee of the Com
on Rules of Practice and Procedure
Judicial Conference of the United
has proposed new Chapter X rules.
117

In response to a general invitation for
comment, the Commission's
staff sub
mitted a comprehensive
report, dated
July 5, 1973, generally critical of many
aspects of the proposed rules. Subse
quently, the Commission
adopted the
staff report as its official position, con
tending that the draft rules repeatedly
abolish, without comment, carefully de
vised Congressional safeguards for pub
lic investors. In the Commission's view,
the rules would also make it more diffi
cult to perform the responsibilities
im
posed upon the Commission by Congress
with respect to Chapter X proceedings,
and do not adequately reflect the differ
ences between procedures needed to
bring about the reorganization of an en
terprise under Chapter X in order that it
may continue as a going concern, and
procedures
necessary
to
accomplish
liquidation
in ordinary bankruptcy pro
ceedings.

SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES
In fiscal 1973, the Commission entered
18 new Chapter X proceedings involving
companies with aggregate stated assets
of approximately
$750 million and ag
gregate indebtedness of approximately
$664 million.
Including the new proceedings, the
Commission was a party in a total of 117
reorganization
proceedings
during the
year.' The stated assets of the companies
involved in these proceedings totaled
approximately $2.2 billion, and their in
debtedness about $1.8 billion.
During the year, 8 proceedings were
closed, leaving 109 in which the Com
mission was a party at fiscal year-end,

ADMINISTRATIVE

MATTERS

In Chapter X proceedings, the Com.
mission seeks to have the courts apply
the procedural
and substantive

The Commission also attempts to secure
judicial

as urged by the Commission,

affirmed Without opinion the order of the
lower court in transferring this Chapter X
proceeding
from
Texas
to
Denver,
Colorado.'
Petitioning creditors had argued on ap
peal that the judge did not afford them
an opportunity to file exceptions to the
special master's recommendation
pur
suant to Rule 53 of the Federal Rules
of CIvil Procedure. The Commission
pornted out that the order conformed to
the standard practice in the Texas dis
trict court, that it did not prejudice ap
pellants' appeal, and that the departure
from Rule 53 was permitted by General
Order 37.
& Steel Company,
Congaree Iron
Inc.'-A lawyer who had actively repre
sented creditors in the filing of an in
voluntary Chapter X petition was later
appointed general counsel to the Chap
ter X trustee. The debtor's answer to the
involuntary petition questioned the valid.
ity of the claim of one of the petitioning
creditors, thereby creating a situation
where the general counsel to the trustee
would have to inquire into the validity of
a former client's claim.
Though not participating in the case,
the Commission urged the court that
counsel was not disinterested
as re
quired by Sections 157 and 158 of
Chapter X, even though he had ceased to
represent the petrtioning creditors on his
appointment as general counsel to the
trustee. The matter is still pending before
the district court.
Titco, Ine."-A lawyer, associated with
the law firm which acted as counsel for
the debtor within 2 years oreceding the
filing of the Chapter X petition, was ap
pointed by the court as general counsel
to the Chapter X trustee. The law firm
as well as an individual partner were
named as defendants in three class ac
tions brought against the debtor corpo
ration and its principals. The Commission
advised the lawyer that he was not disin
terested as required by Sections 157 and
1"R of Chanter X. and he resigned.
The debtor, Tllco, is a publicly-held
holding
company
with a number
of
wholly-owned subsidiaries engaged in the
business of producing oil and gas. One of

the debtor's
subsidiaries,
Natural
Re
sources Fund, Inc. (NRF), is the general
partner in six limited partnerships formed
for the purpose of exploring, drilling, and
operating oil and gas properties. About
5,500 Investors contributed
in excess of
$27 million for interests In the SIX limited
partnerships."
The debtor's Chapter X petition pur
ported to include all wholly-owned
sub
sidraries.
NRF's only source of income
was its fees and charges as general part
ner In the various limited partnerships.
Although it had approximately $1 million
in cash on hand, this represented earn
ings of the respective limited partner
ships. The Cornrnisston
took the position
that these funds, as well as the proper
ties which generated them, belonged to
the publicly-owned
hrruted partnerships
and could not be appropriated for Trlco's
Chapter X proceeding. The Commission
supported NRF's management in obtainIng an order authorizing the distribution
of approximately $750,000 of the limited
partnerships'
accumulated
earnings to

Commit
tee which has represented common stock

order directing it to frle new authorrza

tee had fully complied With Section 211

The Commission
supported the com
mittee's appeal. Although the Commis
sion acknowledged
that the Chapter X
court has broad power to regulate com

argued that the type of mforrnation
sought from individual shareholders was
not relevant to the Committee's

Traders Compress Co."-The
debtor is
a small publicly-owned corporation en
gaged primarily in the sale and drstnbu
tion of hqurfied petroleum gas ("LPG")
to over 8,500 rural customers In Okla
homa. A major supplier sought to dis
continue sales of LPG to the debtor,
asserting a shortage in supply. The sup
plier made no attem pt to ration LPG to
its customers, but proposed to solve the
shortage by eliminating the debtor's allo
cation completely.
Since other sources of supply were
unavailable, the trustee sought an inJunction to restrain the supplier from ter
minating the supply of LPG. The trustee
urged that termination
of the contract
to supply the debtor would jeopardize
any hope for a successful reorganization
and would leave many of the debtor's
customers without a source of supply. He
contended that the laws of Oklahoma pro
hrbrtsd such drscnrnlnation.
The Com
mission argued that the Chapter X court
had jurisdiction to enter an injunction to
preserve the going-concern value of the
debtor for the benefit of its creditors
and shareholders if the governing local
law prohibited the attempted termina
tion. The district court found that it had
jurisdiction,
and permanently
enjoined
the supplier from terminating its agree
ment to supply the debtor, finding that
the action of the supplier was discrimi
natory and violative of the Oklahoma
public utility and antitrust laws. The in
junctive order has been appealed to the
court of appeals, where the matter is
now pending."
Sales of major assets under authority
of Section 116(3) of Chapter X rather
than pursuant to plans of reorganization
were involved in four cases in this fiscal
year. The Commission objected to only
one.
The Commission

is satisfied that any

(10), dealing wrth plans of reorganization,
expressly permits a plan to provide for
the sale of any or all of the debtor's
property, that power is not committed
to the court's sole discretion,
but is
dependent
upon compliance
with the
safeguards with which Congress has sur
rounded adoption of a plan of reorgani
zation.
In particular,
it requires the
consent of the statutory majority of the
creditors and stockholders who are bene
ficial owners of the property being dealt
with. Resort to Section 116(3) as a sub
stitute for Section 216(10)
effectively
drsenfranchrses
the creditors and share
holders and normally reduces the plan
of reorganization to ratlftcatron of a fait
accompli.
In short, there must be a
strong presumption against the propriety
of such a transection
However, the pre
surnptron is not conclusive. There are
situations in which use of the powers
granted by Section 116(3) may be jus
tified. The case of a warehouse full of
deteriorating produce is not the only, or
even the most important, example." The
emphasis on the "wasting asset" con
cept rs is an unfortunate and misleading
turn taken by the law in this field. The
trustee should not be required to cry
"spoiled fish" in order to justify a sale.
With the increasing cornplexrtres
of
corporate business, and particularly the
indiscriminate dlversrftcatron
which may
precede corporate failures, the need to
prune a debtor's business Into reorga
ruzable shape has become an almost
routine aspect of Chapter X administra
tion. Chapter X does not require that the
debtor be frozen in the unsatisfactory
position which caused its insolvency.
Sound business judgment may require
rather substantial sales independent of a
plan of reorganization.

Bubble Up Delaware, Inc., et al.'9_
After competitive
bidding and negotia
tions, the trustees presented to the court
two offers to purchase substantially all of
the debtors' operating assets. They relied
on Section 116(3) of Chapter X as author
ity for the sale.
Although sales and profits of the debt
ors had increased dunng the Chapter X
proceeding, one of the trustees testified
that in his opinion the business had
reached its peak; that operating difficul
ties could set in as a result of an ad
verse court decision In an antitrust SUit;
and that controversies as to the relative
rights of the creditors and stockholders of
the several corporations
involved might
take time to litigate, thus precluding a
sale pursuant to a plan of reorganiza
tion. After an extensive evrdentiary
hear
ing, the judge found that an emergency
situation confronted the trustees and ap
proved the sale to the party he found had
made the highest offer. An appeal by the
unsuccessful bidder was withdrawn and
the sale was consummated.

trustee's decision to sell, but opposed ac
ceptance of the initial offer on the ground
that there was no showing that the price
was adequate and reasonable. The court
ordered an auction to be held, setting
$8.1 million as the minimum upset price.
The operating assets were ultimately sold
for $9.4 million, and additional assets
were sold for about $1.4 million.

TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATION
A complete accounting for the steward.
ship of corporate affairs by prior manage
ment is a requisite under Chapter X. One
of the primary duties of the trustee is to
make a thorough study of the debtor to
assure the discovery and collection of all
assets of the estate, Including claims
against officers, directors, or controlling
persons who may have mismanaged the
debtor's affairs. The staff of the Commis
sion often aids the trustee in his in
vestigation.
King
Resources
Company. "-The
trustee resolved several primary problems
regarding the estate durmg the past
year. For one, he was successful In nego
tiating a compromise
settlement
With
some 83 lien creditors and other parties
asserting conflicting claims to 25 domes
tic oil or gas leases. Under the terms
of this settlement,
each of the lien
creditors agreed to release his lien, and
forego contractual interest and attorney's
fees, in return for a cash payment of 75
percent from accumulated
production
and allowance of the 25 percent balance
as an unsecured claim. As part of the
settlement,
the balance on production
payments due to various parties was
reduced by $519.000. These production
payment holders will receive their agreed
share of the 011 and gas produced, thereby
reducing the burden of interest payments
on the estate.
The trustee also settled for $2.5 mil
lion a plenary SUIt he had brought
against the surety under a fidelity bond
of the debtor. The suit was based on
misappropriation
of the debtor's funds
in connection With former management's
attempt to take control of Investors Over
seas Service. The settlement
as ap
proved by the court amounted to 50
percent of the bond. The trustee used
these funds to reduce the balance of his
outstanding
certificates.

The trustee rejected two pre-Chapter
X agreements by the debtor to sell frac
tional interests in Canadian 011 and gas

The rejection of the con.
tracts was approved by the drstnct court

DoIly Madison Industries,

shareholders filed a class action against
the debtor, certain of Its former officers
and directors,
and its former account
ants, alleging violations of the antifraud
provisions of the Federal securities laws
in that certain financial statements
of
the debtor were false and misleading.
The plaintiffs also filed a class proof of
claim In the reorganization proceeding to
enforce the same liability
against the
debtor. The class actions sought about
$10 million for the loss sustained
by
shareholders
who had purchased
the
debtor's stock during the period from No
vember 8, 1969, when the financial state
ments were made public, to February 18,

One shareholder, who failed to file a

fiscal year, the shareholder entered into
a stipulation with the debtor, which the
court approved, providing for withdrawal
of the appeal and permitting a late filing
at 75 percent of the claim. The Commis

involves substantial public investor interest and presents significant
problems.
When no such formal report IS filed the

affirmed the Chapter X court's order approving the plan of reorganization which
included a settlement of claims asserted
against the debtor by persons who had
allegedly been fraudulently
induced to
purchase its stock in violation of Federal
securities laws." Pursuant to the com.
promises embodied in the plan, the de'
frauded stockholders,
whose claims ex-

ceeded $100 million, received one-third of
the equity of the reorganized company
valued at $11.4 rrullron." Holders of unsecured claims against the debtor, totaling
about $27 million, received the remainrng equity valued at $22.8 million. Since,
as a consequence of the settlement, the
debtor was insolvent, the plan made no
provision for stockholders who had purchased their stock after the filing of the
Chapter X pennon and disclosure of the
alleged fraud.

ALLOWANCES
Every reorganization case ultimately
presents the difficult problem of determin
ing the compensation to be paid to the
various parties for services rendered and
for expenses incurred in the proceeding.
The Commission, which under Section
242 of the Bankruptcy Act may not re
ceive any allowance for the services it
renders, has sought to assist the courts

in assuring economy of administration
and In allocating compensation equitably
on the basis of the claimants' contribu
tions to the administration of estates and
the formulation of plans. DUring the fiscal
year, 319 applications for compensation
totaling about $14 million were reviewed.

appeals, as urged by the Internal Revenue
Service and the Commission, reversedthe
order of the lower court which awarded
the trustee and his counsel fees that
equaled the remaining cash left in the
debtor's estate after liquidation of all
of its assets,"
The court vacated the order allowing
the fees, and directed that the case be re
assigned to another district judge, stating:
"The notice was clearly in viola
tion of the mandatory requirements
of Section 247 even as the petition
violated Section 249 and Rule X-IS.
But our concern here runs deeper
than the statutory derelictions. It
goes to the applicants' paramount
interest in their own fees and to the
court's purporting to permit the en
tire estate to be wiped out by the
fees in a Chapter X proceeding which
was improvidently commenced and
should have been quickly terminated
with little or no expense. The fact
that it was not does not tend to re
flect favorably upon the fee appli
cants nor upon the court's super
vision of them."
It directed that notices of future fee ap
plications be served on all persons speci
fied by Section 247, and that:
"Notices of presentment of peti
tions shall in particular be served
upon the Secretary of the Treasury
and the Securities and Exchange
Commission sufficiently in advance

the debtor's European debenture issue
filed an application for a final allowance
of $362,653, of which $123,653 was for
its own services and $239,000 for reim
bursement of payments made to its local
and New York counsel.
The Commission noted that a large
portion of the time of the indenture
trustee and its counsel was devoted to
reviewing papers filed by others m the
proceeding. It pointed out that a creditor
cannot be compensated as an auxiliary
trustee, and that there was a duplication
of effort of major proportions by counsel
and the indenture trustee. The fact that
the indenture trustee had already paid
its counsel did not entitle it to recover
such payments from the estate since the
allowance of fees is within the exclusive
jurisdiction of the court which cannot be
negated by a private arrangement be
tween a client and his attorney.
The Commission recognized that the
indenture trustee's responsibilities were
large, and that it dealt with novel and
important issues of law. The fact that its
legitimate concern for the interests of
debenture holders conflicted at times
with the objectives of the trustee should
not affect its right to compensation. Ac
cordingly, the Commission recommended
allowances of $190.368 for the services
of the indenture trustee and its counsel,
and reimbursement of expenses. The dis
trict court awarded $158,012_

that counsel were experienced in stock

However, the Commission noted that fee
standards in such actions are quite dif.
ferent from those prevailing in Chapter
X. It also pointed out that the charges

would share in the fee awarded in that

Accordingly, the Commission recom

applicants sought fmal allowances and
reimbursement of expenses in the total
amount of about $720,000, and the Com
mission recommended payment of
$382,000. The court awarded fees and
expenses aggregating about $530,000.
Since the estate did not have sufficient
funds, (he Commission suggested that,
to the extent funds were not available,
payments should be made on a deferred
basis and not in stock of the reorganized
company.
The issuance of stock to claimants for
administrative expenses does not fall
within the exemption from registration
under Section 5 of the Securities Act pro
vided by Section 264a(2) of Chapter X.
In the absence of registration, securities
issued for such expenses cannot be re
sold unless some other exemption under
the Securities Act is available.
The court, however, ordered that ap
plicants allowed more than $10,000 be
paid 75 percent in cash and 25 percent
in newly issued common stock valued at
25 percent below the current market price
to compensate for its restricted status.
One applicant agreed to accept stock

INTERVENTION

IN CHAPTER XI

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act pro.
vides a procedure by which debtors can
effect arrangements with respect to their
unsecured debts under court supervision.
Where a proceeding is brought under that
chapter but the facts indicate that it
should have been brought under Chapter
X, Section 328 of Chapter XI authorizes
the Commission or any other party in in
terest to make application to the court
to dismiss the Chapter XI proceeding un
less the debtor's petition is amended to
comply with the requirements of Chapter

X, or a creditors' petition under Chapter X
is filed.
Attempts are sometimes made to misuse Chapter XI so as to deprive investors
of the protections which the Securities
Act and the ExchangeAct are designed to
provide." In such casesthe Commission's
staff normally attempts to resolve the
problem by informal negotiations. If this
proves fruitless, the Commission intervenes in the Chapter XI proceeding to
develop an adequate record and to direct
the court's attention to the applicable provisions of the Federal securities laws and
their bearing on the particular case.
Ateo Umversal."-The
company, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of VTR, lnc.,"
had not been in operation for over 2 years
and had virtually no assets. A plan of
arrangement called for the issuance of
over one million shares of the debtor's
stock to more than 300 of its unsecured
creditors in reliance upon the Section
393a(2) exemption of Chapter XI. The
Commission intervened and filed a brief
suggesting that the issue of these securities appeared to be motivated by stock
market considerations rather than by any
serious desire to rehabilitate a business, and that a plan so conceived lacked
the "good faith" required by Section
366(4) of Chapter XI. The debtor was
subsequently adjudicated a bankrupt.
Meister Brau, Ine."-A
Section 328
motion was filed by shareholders to have
the proceeding transferred to Chapter X.
The Commission after making a preliminary investigation took no position because of its doubt that the debtor, a large
regional brewer, could be reorganized.
The lower court denied the shareholders'
motion. The court requested that the
Commission continue its investigation
into the debtor's affairs as an aid to the
court. Subsequently, the staff filed an
extensive factual report on the financial
history of the debtor. The report was
prepared entirely from the debtor's records and other public information and
stressed the primary reason for the
debtor's financial problems-a series of
improvident attempts at diversification on
borrowed money in the face of an in-

creasingly difficult competitive situation.
It also pointed out that the debtor had
sold Its established brands just prior to
its filing, and had little hope of re-estabhshing a Viable brewery operation. Efforts to revive the debtor were fruitless
and It was adjudicated a bankrupt.
DCA Development Corporation.""-The
debtor, a tile-rnakmg and housing development concern, attempted to effect
a Chapter XI arrangement with its unsecured creditors, including public debenture holders. The proceeding aborted
when the debtor was not able to raise the
necessary capital to fund its proposed
arrangement. It thereupon filed a Chapter X petition.
At the request of the Commission, the
court held an evidentiary hearing on the
"good faith" of that petition, which was
being contested by some creditors. Smce
the tile business was not In operation
and the housing business was not viable,
the court held "that it is unreasonable
to expect that a plan of reorganization
can be effected." Accordingly, it dismissed debtor's Chapter X petition pursuant to Section 146(3). The proceeding
then reverted to Chapter XI. Shortly
thereafter, the debtor, being unable to
effect a new arrangement, was adjudicated a bankrupt.

SEC Management
Operations

Major changes occurred in fiscal 1973
affecting the Comrmsslon's organlzation,
the management of its two cntical re
sources, people and money, and its in
formation handling.

onstrated that the new structure has ef
fectively focused Cornmtssron resources
on its major responsibilities and facili
tated the vigorous and efficient carrying
out of staff duties.

ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES

Office of Policy Planning

Creation of Major Divisions
In August 1972, the first major re
organization of the Commission in 30
years occurred, changing the Commis
sion's structure from one based on the
various Federalsecurities statutes to one
based on the Commission's three primary
functions-regulation,
disclosure and
enforcement.
Three divisions were created to carry
out the basic regulatory responsibilities
for the diverse areas of Commission
jurisdiction. Market Regulation was given
responsibility for securities markets,
broker-dealers and the self-regulatory
agencies; Investment Management Reg
ulation was made responsible for invest
ment companies, investment advisers,
and other money managers; and Cor
porate Regulation was given jurisdiction
over public utility holding companies as
well as bankruptcy and reorganization
matters. All disclosure activity was con
centrated in the Division of Corporation
Finance. Finally, responsibility for all in'
vestigative and enforcement matters was
consolidated in the new Division of En.
forcement. Experience to date has demo

In October 1972, an Office of Policy
Planning was established to improve the
Cornmrssron's ability to anticipate and
plan for, rather then react to, possible
future capital market and investor needs.
Creation of such an office was recom
mended by, among others, Congressman
John Moss of California, Chairman of the
House Subcommittee on Commerce and
Finance of the Cornrruttee on Interstate
and Foreign Commerce, and the SEC's
1972 Advisory Committee on Enforce
ment Policies and Practices (the Wells
Committee).
The office is responsible for identify
ir.g new trends in the financial markets,
such as the Increasing impact of instrtu
tional investors, and then assisting the
Commissron in developing appropriate
public policy. The office also works with
other offices and divisions to suggest
improvements In the Commission's rules
and procedures and in those of the se
curities industry's self-regulatory or
ganizations, and to develop proposals for
changes in the statutory framework. The
office also provides Commission repre
sentation on various bodies concerned
with international finance, assists the
133

Commission and its staff in interpreting
important
legislative developments,
and
provides liaison with members of Congres
sional committees and their staffs.

New Staff Units
Three new staff units were created to
improve the Commission's
service to the
public and internal efficiency. The Office
of Registrations
and
Reports,
which
merged 8 separate units with about 100
employees, was created to centralize the
receipt, initial examination
and drstribu
tron of the more than 150,000 filings and
reports
the Commission
receives an.
nually. The office has full responsibility
for receiving
filings,
issuing
receipts,
checking for rules compliance, extracting
data for computer input, calculating fees,
writing defrciency letters, and assigning
material to the appropriate branch for reo
view, as well as performing
substantive
examination of those forms which do not
need professional
review. Among the
benefits stemming
from this consolrda
tion of functions was the introduction of a
central filing facility to which members
of the public can both submit filings and
raise questions as to the status of their
filings. A further description of the office
is contained in Part 1.
The Office of Records was established
to improve the Commission's control over
its records and to make such records
more readily available to the public and
the Cornrnlsstori's
staff. The wealth of in.
formation
submitted to the Commission
over the past 40 years provides a unique
and valuable data base for professionals.

Since the ability and motivation of the
staff is the major determinant of the qual.
ity of the Commission's
performance,
every effort was made to attract, motivate
and employ effectively a high quality staff
in fiscal 1973. Normal recruiting patterns
were interrupted
midway through
the
year, first by a government-wide
hiring
freeze and then by budgetary limitations
within the agency. The combined effects
of attrition
and the freeze posed a po
tential workload
problem at times, but
the Commrssron was able to avoid a seri
ous disruption.
An aggressive catch-up
effort resulted in the hiring of 315 new
employees, as compared with 319 ter
minations.
The deployment
of the staff was sig
nifrcantly affected by the reorganization.
More than 600 employees were trans.
ferred, had their job classifications
reo
Viewed. or were given new functions to
perform. A major new career ladder was
created by development
of a new Se
cunties Compliance
Examiner series of
jobs, a title which encompasses certain
examiners, investigators and accountants
in grades 5 through 13.
Efforts to recognize and reward out.

continued. Dlsttn

Increases or cash awards in recognition
of high quality or special service were
also granted to 150 employees. In the
course of the year, 445 staff members
earned promotions to higher grades.
Finally, two exciting
new programs
were developed to help attract talented
professionals
to the SEC. The Attorney
Fellow and the Accounting
Fellow Pro
grams provide for two-year appointments
of outstanding
professionals
from the
private sector. The agency is expected to
benefit from the infusion of new Ideas
and perspectives, while the professionals
gain the opportunity of working with top
SEC staff members on significant
legal
and accounting
problems. The first Ac
counting Fellow entered on duty in June
1973.

FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT
In fiscal 1973, the Commission greatly
accelerated
its efforts to minimize the
cost of Cornrnissron operations
to the
general public through
(a) rigorous re
view and improved control of the utiliza
tion of Cornrnissron resources, and (b)
the recovery of a fair but significant pro
portion
of Commission
costs through
user fees.
As part of the planning for the fiscal
1974 budget, the Cornrnissron's 29 op
erating
divisions,
regional
offices and
support units were required to analyze
thoroughly
the current use of their re
sources and the proposed use of any
additional
resources requested. Precise
estimates were made of workload, cur
rent productlvrty, and the benefits, time
tables, and costs of special projects. The
result was the establishment
of a data
base

operations

INFORMATION HANDLING
The handling of information is one of
of the SEC's most fundamental
tasks.
Steps were taken In 1973 to Improve
both the supply of Information
to the
public and its internal processins.
To further ItS primary goal of timely
disclosure,
the Commission
awarded a
two-year contract at no cost to the gov
ernment for the dissemination
of nonconfidential
data filed with the SEC.
Building on earlier microfiche and copy
ing services, the new contract
incor
porates (1) a new comprehensive
master
rndexrng service for corporate
filings,
both by Issuer and subject, (2) paper
copy reproductions of SEC documents In
public reference rooms at lower cost to
the public, (3) a new program aimed at
increasing dissemination
of SEC infor
mation through libraries open to the pub
lic, and (4) a discount for college and
university users of SEC microfiche pack
ages to offset charges for the new docu
ment Indexing service.
The Commission
also held two infor
mal briefings to acquaint members of the
professional communications
community
With SEC activities and responsibilities.
It IS the Commission's
hope that these
bnefmgs will stimulate a greater under
standrng by the public of the SEC's role.

Broker-dealer complaint information re

to the operational Complaint Processing
System. This system and a centralized
data file containing statistical Information

by the various regulatory bodies will be

planned by the Commission.
A computer file of data collected
through the Registered Investment Ad.

which assisted the staff in its development
of the proposed Institutional Disclosure
Act. Another system developed in fiscal
1973 will replace the Commission's pres
ent addressograph mailing process with
a computerized mailing list. Many addi
tional EDP projects are planned for the
future.

Statistics


THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY
Securities Industry Dollar
Of each dollar
received
by brokerdealers in calendar 1972, a total of 45.9
cents was derived from the securities
cornrrusston business, 13.3 cents from
trading actrvitres,
12.1 cents from the
underwriting
business and the remain
ing 287 cents from secondary sources
of revenue such as Interest income on
customers' accounts, sale of Investment

company securities and gain or loss from
firm investments.
Total expenses amounted to 79.7 cents
of each securities Industry dollar. The two
largest

components

of

expenses were
compensation,
18.3 cents per dollar, and clerical and
adrnrrnstrative employee costs, 23.3 cents
per dollar of revenue. Operating income
before partners' compensation and taxes
accounted for 20.3 cents of the average

Income and Expenses
Gross revenue of broker-dealers from
all activities rose 8 percent to $7.8 billion in 1972 from $7.2 billion in 1971.
Except for securities commission income
and interest income on customers' aCcounts, the major income sources registered minor declines compared to 1971.
The miscellaneous category "other business" increased by $371 million, more
than double the increase in any other
revenue item.

Total expenses increased 9 percent to
$6.2 billion in 1972 from $5.7 biliion
in 1971. interest expense and compensation paid to registered representatives
and clerical and administrative employees
accounted for more than two-thirds of
the $522 million increase. Each of the
other expense items also showed an
increase in 1972. Broker.dealersP operating income, before partners' compensation and taxes, increased only slightly
over the 1971 figure, reaching $1,574

Assets and Liabilities
Broker-dealers' reported assets totaled
$61.5 billion at year-end 1972 compared
wtih $63.3 billion at year-end 1971. This
decline In total assets was attributable
to assets unrelated to the securities busi
ness which decreased from $35 billion
at year-end 1971 to $28 billion at year
end 1972. Most of these assets represent
a small number of firms principally en
gaged in the insurance business. Of
assets related to the securities business,
long positions in securities totaled $12.4
billion at year-end 1972, or 20 percent
of total assets. Debit balances earned for
customers' securities accounts (including
both cash and margin accounts)
amounted to $13.4 billion, nearly 22 per
cent of total assets.
Total liabilities, not including sub.
ordinated borrowings, were $49.9 billion
at year-end 1972, compared with $52.2
billion at year-end 1971. During this
period, liabilities unrelated to the secu
rities business decreased from $29.1 bil
lion to $22 billion. Of liabilities related

to the securities business, the largest
component was money borrowed, which
amounted to $14.5 billion at the end of
1972.
Free credit and other credit balances
owed securities customers aggregated
$5.0 billion. Subordinated borrowings for
capital purposes-including subordinated
loans. accounts covered by equity or sub
ordination agreements and secured
demand notes-totaled $1.4 billion at
year-end 1972. Equity capital for both
secunties and non-securities related ac
tivities amounted to $10.2 billion.

Registered

Broker-Dealers

During fiscal 1973, there was a further
net decline of 327 in the number of
broker-dealers registered with the Com
miSSIOnto 4,407. Since fiscal 1970, the
net decline has totaled 817. However,
the number of registered firms at the
end of the past year was still substantially
higher than that at the end of fiscal 1967
when the number of registered brokerdealers was only 4,175, the lowest num
ber since 1954.

the end of fiscal 1968 only about 54 percent of the registered broker-dealerswere
corporations.

Broker-Dealers, Branch Offices,
Employees
The number of broker-dealers and
branch offices has declined in each successive year Since 1969. The number of
employees declined between 1969 and
1970 but then Increased during 1971 and
1972. There were about 390,000 employees at year-end 1972. Registered representatives employed by the securities
industry totaled 234,000, or about 60 percent of total employment.

SECO Broker-Dealers
The number of broker-dealers who are
not members of a registered securities
association has declined in each fiscal
year since 1969. Of all broker-dealers
registered at the end of fiscal 1973, there
were 276 SECObroker-dealers compared
with 455 at the end of fiscal 1969.
The largest decrease in this category
was in the ranks of broker-dealers whose
principal business is the selling of variable annuities, which dropped from 134
in 1969 to 18 in 1973. This was due
primarily to the deregistration In fiscal
1970 of 94 general agent broker-dealers
who became employed by a single SECO
broker-dealer. The principal type of business of SECO broker-dealers is the general securities business.

lnvestment Companies
AS of the end of the 1973 fiscal year,
1,361 investment companies were registered with thecommission, an increase of
27 from the number one year earlier. Of
the registered companies, 100 were
classifled as "iflactive". Approximately
62 percent of the active companies were
management opemend companies ("mutual funds").
The 1,261 active companies had total
assets having an approximate market
value of $73.1 billion, with mutual funds

accounting for about 75 percent of that
value. The $73.1 billion figure represents
about a 10 percent decline from the $80.8
billion total at the end of the last fiscal
year, the highest yeavend figure since
the lnvestment company Act was passed.
An appreciation of the tremendous
growth of the investment company in.
dustry in the intervening period may be
gained by noting that in 1950 there were
366 investment companies with total
assets of about $4.7 billion, and that, as
recently as 1960, there were only 570
companies with assets of $23.5 billion.

basis. In 1972, NASDAQ volume was 2.2
billion shares, equivalent to 49 percent
of NYSE share volume and almost double
that of the AMEX. This trading volume
reflects the number of shares bought and
sold by market markers plus their net
inventory changes.

Third Market Volume
During 1972, over-the-counter sales of
common stocks listed on the New York
Stock Exchange continued to increase
both in share and dollar volume as they
have every year since 1965, when reports
to the Commission regarding so-called
"third market" transactions were first
required. The rate of increase, however,
was considerably less than in former
years, reflecting the lack of institutional
activity in the latter part of the year which
particularly affected the third market

where institutions are the prime participants.
In
1972,
third
market
volume
amounted to 327 million shares valued
at $13.6 billlon, compared with 298 million shares and $12.4 billion the previous
year. The increase in over-the-counter
sales of NYSE common stocks kept pace
with the increase in sales of all stocks
on the exchange. The ratio of third market
volume to NYSE volume was 7.3 percent
on a share basis and 8.5 percent on a
dollar basis, both ratios slightly higher
than in 1971.

which takes place off the floor of the
exchange, usually after trading hours.
The block is offered by firms at a price
USUally below the last transaction. In

the block sell order. The exchange distribution method was used 26 times in
1972. representing the transfer of $30

Purpose of

Registrations of secondary offerings
(where the proceeds accrue to the selling
shareholders) declined nearly onethird
from the level of the previous year to
approximately $5 billion.
Registrations of immediate cash offer.
ings amounted to over $27 billion i n fiscal
1973, down 10 percent from 1972 and
nearly 30 percent below the record level
of 1971. Of that total, debt offerings
amounted to $14.7 billion while equity
issues totaled $12.6billion.
Registrations of extended offerings
amounted to nearly $17 billion in fiscal
1973, a small decline i n value from the
previous year. Again, investment corn.
pany shares represented the largest por.
tion of extended offerings amounting t o
$9.6 billion, down slightly from the year
earlier.

Registration

Securities registered for cash sale for
the account of the issuers aggregated
$44 billion in fiscal 1973.This was over
10 percent less than in fiscal 1972 and
25 percent less than the record 1971
amount. The decrease reflects the sharp
drop in the registration of debt issues;
approximately $15 billion of bonds,
debentures and notes were registered for
the account of the issuer during the year
compared with $20 billion in 1972 and
nearly $28 billion i n 1971. Securities
registered for the account of the issuer
for other than cash sale, primarily common stock issues used in connection with
merge= and consolidations, rose substantially, reflecting the new registration
requirements of Rule 154 (effective January 1973).

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table below reflects, the secu
rities laws provide for a wide range of
enforcement actions by the Commission.
The most common types of actions are
injunctive proceedings instituted in the
Federal district courts to enjoin con

tinued or threatened securities law vio
lators, and administrative proceedings
pertaining to broker-dealer firms and/or
individuals associated with such firms
which may lead to various remedial
sanctions as required in the public in
terest. When an Injunction is entered
by a court, violation of the court's
decree is a basis for criminal contempt
action against the violator.
