FOREWORD
HR Policies are the prime mover for the optimum utilisation and contribution by human resources
and also for their morale and motivation in any organisation. HR Management is a dynamic
process and hence HR policies require continuous review and updation. It has become more
important now because of fast changing trends in the HR Management. Changing economic and
organisational scenario in ONGC has thrown a challenge for HR Professionals to respond quickly
and appropriately to meet employees’ aspirations to keep them highly motivated on the one hand
and ensuring that organisational goals are achieved.
In order to equip HR professionals to take quick decisions on ‘first time right’ and ‘first thing
first’ principle, a sound and dynamic HR Policy platform is inevitable. Towards this objective, the
HR Manual “Human Resource Management in ONGC” containing a gist of all the rules,
regulations and policies governing the functioning of Personnel & Administration was published
in 1998.
As a number of changes in HR Policies have taken place since then and a number of
facilities/benefits/allowances etc. have been revised, this updated, improvised and enlarged edition
of HR Manual has been published to cater to the needs of employees for quick reference. This
Manual contains summary of existing instructions on various subjects in HR area. However, for
further details and authenticity on each subject, the relevant circulars should be referred to.
I would like to complement Shri R.N. Ramji, Executive Director (HR) and his team of officers
namely Shri A.K. Shah, Chief Manager (P&A) and Shri N. Mani, Manager (P&A) for their
commendable efforts and contribution in bringing out this Manual in the present shape.
I hope you will find this Manual handy and useful.

SENIORITY*
Seniority of the employees in E-0 level and above (centralised cadres) is maintained
at Headquarters, Dehradun.
Seniority of decentralised categories of the employees is maintained Region wise.

PRINCIPLES FOR DETERMINING SENIORITY
The following principles are observed for determining seniority:(A)

Direct Recruits:

(i)

Inter-se seniority of candidates selected on any one occasion is determined in order
of merit in which they are placed by the Selection Committee.

(ii)

Where persons recruited initially on probation are confirmed subsequently in an
order different from the order of merit indicated at the time of their selection,
seniority follows the order of confirmation and not the original order of merit.
In cases, where the period of probation of an employee is extended on account of a
vigilance or disciplinary case pending against him and the employee is
subsequently exonerated, his probation is regularised from the date on which it
would have otherwise been regularised but for the pendency of the vigilance or
disciplinary case.

(iii)

A candidate who is offered an appointment in the Company against direct
recruitment has to join within 45 days from the date of receipt of offer, in order to
retain his seniority. When a candidate at the time of applying or interview
indicates, that he would need more time and this fact is duly noted when placing
him on the selection list, he may be allowed to join within a maximum period of
100 days (without losing his seniority) from the date of issue of the order.
If, however, the candidate is an employee of the Corporation and cannot join within
the aforesaid period of 45 days on account of exigencies of work, then the
Appointing Authority may if it is satisfied that the candidate is unable to join duty
in the exigencies of the Company’s work, extend the period (within which the
candidate would be permitted to join without losing his seniority) by a maximum of
105 days (inclusive of 45 days allowed initially).

(iv)

(v)

Such Government employees as are selected in direct competition through open
advertisement but are appointed on foreign service terms are deemed to be direct
recruits for the purpose of determination of their seniority. Seniority of such
persons, once determined, is not affected by their retirement from their parent office
or their continuance in the Corporation’s employment beyond such retirement.
Government pensioners and retrenched employees, who are re-employed in the
Company after their retirement or retrenchment, shall also be treated as direct
recruits for the purpose of determination of seniority.

(B)

Departmental Promotees:
(i)
Inter-In cases where the period of probation of an employee is extended on
account of a vigilance or disciplinary case pending against him and the employee is
subsequently exonerated, his probation is regularised from the date on which it
would have otherwise been regularised but for the pendency of the vigilance or
disciplinary case.

(iii)

Where promotions to a grade are made, either from more than one grade, or from
the same grade divided into different cadres on Regional basis, eligible persons are
placed in separate lists in order of their inter-se-seniority in the respective grades or
cadres thereafter:
(a) If promotion is to be made on the basis of merit alone, the Departmental
Promotion Committee prepares a “Select List “ on the basis of merit.
Promotion is made from this “Select List” in order in which the names are
finally arranged ; and
(b) If promotion is to be made on the basis of Seniority –cum-fitness, i.e. seniority
subject to the rejection of unfit, the Departmental Promotion Committee places
the candidates from the various lists into one “Consolidated Seniority List”
based on the total length of service rendered in that grade or cadre and makes
recommendation for promotion on the basis of this “Consolidated List”. The
inter-se-seniority of the candidates in their respective lists in not disturbed in the
“Consolidated List” .

(C)

Relative Seniority of Direct Recruits and Departmental Promotes:

(i)

When the vacancies on any one occasion are reserved for departmental promotion
and direct recruitment, names of the promotees shall be released first and the direct
recruits shall be released thereafter and appointments made subsequently. In case
the Departmental Promotion Committee panel is not available, the vacancies for
direct recruitment will not be filled on regular basis instead, officiating
arrangements shall be made.
Amongst the departmental promotees and direct recruits so appointed on any single
occasion the departmental promotees shall be treated as senior enbloc to the direct
recruits.

(ii)

(D)

Seniority of decentralised categories :-

(i)

In the event of transfer of an employee belonging to decentralised category, from
one Region to the other in the interest of the Corporation, seniority of the employee
is retained in his original Region, and the employee is considered for promotion, in
his turn, in his parent Region .

(ii)

When such an employee is due for promotion to the next higher post in his parent
Region, he is posted back to that Region. In case, on account of exigencies of work,
it is not possible to post the employee back to the Parent Region, the employee is

permitted to take over the promoted post in the other Region with the approval of
competent authority.
(iii)

Where the Corporation decides that the employee concerned should go back to his
parent Region on promotion, and he refuses to do so, the promotion is not to be
given to him .

(iv)

In case, an employee belonging to a decentralised category is transferred on his own
request from one Region to another , his name is struck off from the parent Region
and he is placed at the bottom in the seniority list of the Region to which he is
transferred.

(v)

The experience for the purpose of his eligibility for promotion is considered only
with effect from the date he joins in the new Region.

(E)

Fixation of Seniority on absorption of employees from one cadre to another:

(i)

The Corporation is free to transfer employees from one cadre to another
temporarily, on administrative grounds e.g. transfer of work, non-availability of
suitable men, etc.

(ii)

Such employees retain their lien and seniority in the parent cadres and have no right
for absorption in the cadres to which they are transferred temporarily.

(iii)

If, as a very special case, they are considered for absorption in the cadres to which
they are temporarily transferred on their own request, their seniority counts only
from the date of their transfer to the cadre at the time of their absorption.
In case, such a transfer is effected in the interest of the work of the Corporation, the
transferee carries his original seniority in the cadre from which he is transferred to
the new cadre.

Corporation into any extra expenditure. The officer will not leave the headquarters,
without prior permission.

(b)

the quantum of evidence against the accused is not strong enough to justify
the assumption that if the proceedings were continued, the officer would be
removed or dismissed; and

cheaper to the public exchequer to accept the resignation.

An employee under suspension is entitled upto the first six months of the period of
suspension to Subsistence Allowance at an amount equal to the leave salary which he
would have drawn had he been on half pay.
The Competent Authority may vary the amount of Subsistence Allowance for any
period exceeding the first six months as follows:(a)

The amount of Subsistence Allowance may be increased by an amount not exceeding 50%
of the Subsistence Allowance admissible during the period of the first six months if the

period of suspension has been prolonged for reasons to be recorded, in writing, not directly
attributable to the officer concerned; and
(b)

the amount of Subsistence Allowance may be decreased by an amount not exceeding 50%
of the Subsistence Allowance admissible during the period of the first six months if in the
opinion of the competent authority the period of suspension has been prolonged due to
reasons to be recorded, in writing, directly attributable to the officer concerned.

Promotion/Reversion of the officer who is under suspension.
The suitability of such an officer should be assessed by DPC and if found suitable, it
should be recorded separately in a sealed envelope subscribed “Findings regarding Merit and
Suitability for Promotion or Confirmation” (not to be opened till the termination of suspension).
The proceedings should also make a mention “the findings are contained in the sealed cover.”
A vacancy should, as far as possible, kept open so as to accommodate him in case of
exoneration or in case it is filled, the next first vacancy should be given to him. His seniority in
the next higher grade should be fixed as if he had been promoted with the position assigned in the
list.
An officer placed under suspension while officiating in a higher post can be reverted to the
lower post otherwise than as punishment even during his suspension.

SEXUAL HARASSMENT *
Guidelines to deal with Sexual Harassment of Women at Work places.
1.
In the case of Visakha & Ors. versus State of Rajasthan & Ors. (JT 1997 (7) SC 384), the
Hon’ble Supreme Court has laid down guidelines and norms to be observed to prevent sexual
harassment of working women at their work places.
2.
The definition of sexual harassment includes such unwelcome sexually determined
behaviour (whether directly or by implication) as :a) Physical contact and advances ;
b) A demand or request for sexual favours ;
c) Sexually coloured remarks ;
d) Showing pornography ;
e) Any other unwelcome physical, verbal or non-verbal conduct of sexual nature.
3.
It has been laid down in the judgement that it is the duty of the employer or other
responsible persons in work places or other institutions, to prevent or deter the commission of acts
of sexual harassment and to provide the procedure for the resolution, settlement or prosecution of
acts of sexual harassment by taking all necessary steps. Where such conduct amounts to a specific
offence under the Indian Penal Code or under any other Law, the concerned authorities shall
initiate appropriate action in accordance with the Law by making a complaint with the appropriate
authority. Attention in this connection is invited to schedule-II to Rule 3(j) of ONGC CDA Rules
1994, specifying the acts and omissions constituting misconduct, which provide that commission
of any act subversive of discipline or of good behaviour is a misconduct. Any act of sexual
harassment of women employees is definitely subversive of discipline and of good behaviour and
therefore amounts to a misconduct. Appropriate disciplinary action should be initiated in such
cases against the delinquent employee.
4.
Hon’ble Supreme Court has observed that if any of these acts are committed in
circumstances where the victim of such conduct has a reasonable apprehension in relation to her
employment or work then such conduct can be humiliating and may constitute a health and safety
problem . It is discriminatory, for instance, when the woman has
reasonable ground to believe that her objection would disadvantage her in connection with her
employment or work including recruitment or promotion or when it creates a hostile work
environment. Adverse consequences might be visited if the victim does not consent to the conduct
in question or raises any objection thereto. It should be ensured that victims or witnesses are not
victimised or discriminated against while dealing with complaints of sexual harassment.
5.
Appropriate work conditions should be provided in respect of work, leisure, health and
hygiene to further ensure that there is no hostile environment towards women at work places and
no women employee should have reasonable grounds to believe that she is disadvantaged in
connection with her employment.
6.
Where sexual harassment occurs as a result of an act or omission by any third party or
outsider, the employer and person in charge will take all steps necessary and reasonable to assist
the affected person in terms of support and preventive action.

7.
A Women Development Forum has been set up at each Region / Project / Work-Centre
/office to help/guide women employees to take up all cases of this nature. This forum should
report directly to the Executive Director / Head of Region / Institute.
