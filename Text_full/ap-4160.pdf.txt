ORDER POSTPONING
HEARING, SCHEDULING
PREHEARING CONFERENCE,
AND TO SHOW CAUSE

On August 30, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in their periodic
filings. A hearing is scheduled for September 26, 2016.
On September 9, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed a declaration of service
establishing that Respondents were served with the OIP by September 2, 2016, in accordance
with Rule of Practice 141(a)(2)(ii), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), and their answers were due by
September 15, 2016. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R. § 201.160(b), .220(b). To date, no Respondent has
filed an answer.
Accordingly, Respondents are ORDERED to SHOW CAUSE by September 26, 2016,
why the registrations of their securities should not be revoked by default due to their failures to
file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding. If Respondents fail to respond to this order,
they will be deemed in default and the registrations of their securities will be revoked. OIP at 3;
17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
It is FURTHER ORDERED that the hearing scheduled for September 26, 2016, is
POSTPONED and a telephonic prehearing conference will be held on October 26, 2016, at 2:00
p.m. Eastern if the proceeding has not been resolved by then.
