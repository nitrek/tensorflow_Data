SCHEDULING ORDER

On September 28, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings (OIP) against Respondents. On
December 23, 2015, I set a revised procedural schedule for this matter. Steven J. Muehler,
Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3433, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5267. On January 20, 2016,
Respondent Steven J. Muehler e-mailed a request for a schedule to file motions in limine, which
was not previously included on the revised procedural schedule.
Although an electronic courtesy copy of any motion or request for relief is encouraged,
especially in a pressing situation, such requests should be made by properly filed motions in
accordance with the Rules of Practice rather than by e-mail alone. However, I ORDER that the
parties shall have until February 8, 2016, to file any motions in limine. Oppositions to such
motions, and replies thereto, are due in accordance with Rule of Practice 154(b), 17 C.F.R.
ยง 201.154(b).
