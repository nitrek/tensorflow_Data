SCHEDULING ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings on November 9, 2015, pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Three prehearing conferences have been held in which the
Division of Enforcement and Respondent Sandip Shah, who is incarcerated at FCI Sheridan in
Oregon, participated.
The undersigned understands that the Division has made available its investigative file
pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.230, including two CDs,1 in compliance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.230 and
the Commission’s rulings in Byron S. Rainner, Exchange Act Release No. 59040, 2008 SEC LEXIS
2840, at *4-7 (Dec. 2, 2008), and José P. Zollino, Exchange Act Release No. 51632, 2005 SEC
LEXIS 987, at *7-10 (Apr. 29, 2005), and that the complete file will soon be made available to
Shah. Thus, it is appropriate to set a prehearing schedule and a hearing date in May, to allow Shah
“a reasonable amount of time to review the investigative file.” Rainner, 2008 SEC LEXIS 2840, at
*7.
The parties will exchange witness and exhibit lists by May 2, 2016, and the Division will
provide Shah with copies of its exhibits by that date. The Division will file a prehearing brief by
May 2, 2016, and Shah may file a prehearing brief, as well.
The hearing will commence on May 17, 2016, at 9:00 a.m. PDT. The hearing will be held
by video conference, and Shah will participate from FCI Sheridan. The hearing is expected to
last not more than three days.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
