ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS RULINGS
Release No. 4186/September 21, 2016
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17383

In the Matter of
ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE
DYNAMIC VENTURES CORP.
On August 12, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its
periodic filings.
On September 8, 2016, the Division of Enforcement filed an updated declaration of
service establishing that Respondent was served with the OIP by mail, in accordance with 17
C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(ii), on September 6, 2016. Respondent’s answer was therefore due by
September 19, 2016. See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). To date, Respondent has
not filed an answer.
Accordingly, I ORDER Respondent to SHOW CAUSE by October 3, 2016, why the
registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or
otherwise defend this proceeding. If Respondent fails to respond to this order, it will be deemed
in default and the registration of its securities will be revoked. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f).
