NOTICE OF PROPOSED
PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION
AND OPPORTUNITY
FOR COMMENT

Notice is hereby given, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Securities and Exchange
Commission’s (“Commission”) Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.1103, that the Division of Enforcement has submitted to the Commission a proposed
plan (“Distribution Plan”) for the distribution of monies paid in the above-captioned matter.
On September 19, 2013, the Commission issued an Order Instituting Cease-and-Desist
Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making
Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against JPMorgan Chase & Co.
(“JPMorgan”).1 The Order found that JPMorgan violated federal securities laws when it made
material misstatements in its public filings with the Commission. The Order required
JPMorgan to pay a civil money penalty in the amount of $200,000,000 to the Commission and
ordered that such penalty may be distributed pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act of 2002, as amended.
On March 5, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Establishing a Fair Fund.2 The
Fair Fund has been deposited at the United States Treasury Department’s Bureau of the Fiscal
Service (“BFS”) for investment. Other than potential interest income from the BFS
investment, the Commission does not anticipate that the Fair Fund will receive additional
funds. The assets of the Fair Fund are subject to the continuing jurisdiction and control of the
Commission.

the Distribution Plan from the Commission’s public website at

THE DISTRIBUTION PLAN
The Fair Fund is comprised of the $200,000,000 civil money penalty paid by the
Respondents to the Commission. The Distribution Plan proposes to compensate investors
harmed when JPMorgan failed to disclose accurately in public filings made with the
Commission the true amount of trading losses it suffered in the first quarter of 2012, and the
effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures. As set forth in the Distribution Plan,
beneficial owner investors who will be eligible for a distribution must have (a) purchased
Eligible Securities3 between April 13, 2012 and May 10, 2012, inclusive, and held the shares
of Eligible Securities through May 20, 2012; or (b) purchased Eligible Securities between
April 13, 2012 and May 10, 2012, inclusive, and sold their shares of Eligible Securities
between May 11, 2012 and May 20, 2012, inclusive; or (c) purchased Eligible Securities
between May 11, 2012 and May 20, 2012, inclusive, and held the shares of Eligible Securities
through May 20, 2012; and (d) met all other requirements of the Distribution Plan.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.
