UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

DEFERRED PROSECUTION AGREEMENT
1.
In connection with an investigation, the Division of Enforcement
("Division") of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission")
alleges that Yu Kai Yuan ("Respondent"), a former employee of Parametric Technology
(Shanghai) Software Company Limited and Parametric Technology (Hong Kong) Ltd.,
from at least 2006 through 2011, caused violations of Sections 13(b)(2)(A) and
13(b)(2)(B) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act"), by causing the
company to (a) fail to make and keep books, records, and accounts, which, in reasonable
detail, accurately and fairly reflected the transactions and dispositions of its assets, and
(b) fail to devise and maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to
provide reasonable assurances that transactions (i) were executed in accordance with
management's general or specific authorization and (ii) were recorded as necessary to
permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted
accounting principles or any other criteria applicable to such statements, and to maintain
accountability for assets ("Investigation"). Prior to a public enforcement action being
brought by the Commission against him, without admitting or denying these allegations,
Respondent has offered to accept full responsibility for his conduct and to not contest or
contradict the factual statements contained in Paragraph 6 in any future Commission
enforcement action in the event he breaches this Agreement. Accordingly, the
Commission and the Respondent enter into this deferred prosecution agreement
("Agreement") on the following terms and conditions:

STATEMENT OF FACTS 1
6.
If this case had gone to trial, the Commission would have presented
evidence sufficient to prove the following facts:
a.
Yuan, age 47, is a Chinese citizen and who resides in Shanghai,
China. From 1996 until 2011, Yuan was employed as a sales executive at Parametric
Technology (Hong Kong) Ltd. and Parametric Technology (Shanghai) Software Co., Ltd.
(collectively, "PTC-China"). These two entities are subsidiaries of PTC Inc., a publicly
traded Massachusetts corporation headquartered in Needham, Massachusetts.
b.
From at least 2006 into 2011, PTC-China provided, through
business partners, items of value to employees and officers of Chinese state owned
entities ("SOE employees and officers"), where the SOE's were PTC customers. These
items of value were made to obtain or retain business from the SOEs. Specifically, PTCChina provided, through business partners, non-business travel, primarily sightseeing and
tourist activities, as well as improper gifts and entertainment, to the SOE employees and Â·
officers.
c.
PTC-China provided these items of value in two primary ways: 1)
by providing payments to third party agents, disguised as commission payments or subcontracting fees, which were then used to pay for non-business related foreign travel for
SOE employees and officers; and 2) by allowing its sales staff to provide SOE employees
and officers with gifts and excessive entertainment.
d.
For sales to Chinese SOE's, PTC-China routinely hired third
parties - called "business partners" - both to find deals, for which PTC-China paid a

violations alleged by the Division in Paragraph 1 of this Agreement and are not binding in any other legal
proceeding or on any other person or entity.

commission or "success fee," as well as to provide information technology and other
services, which PTC-China subcontracted to the business partner. Business partners were
generally Chinese companies, purportedly with specific knowledge of, and relationships
with, PTC-China's customers.
e.
Certain PTC employees knew that many of PTC-China's
customers were SOEs whose employees were Chinese government officials. Certain
business partners had long standing relationships with these SOE employees and officers.
Generally, the business partners provided PTC-China with lobbying or "influence
services" (i.e., arranging seminars and meetings with officials of the SO Es) and
information technology services. Often the SOE employees and officers chose the
business partner with whom they wished to collaborate.
f.
Senior PTC-China staff had discretion in setting the fee
arrangements with business partners. PTC-China did not have a fixed success fee
arrangement with its business partners, instead negotiating the fee for each particular
deal. When PTC-China initially engaged the business partner, its sales team generally
agreed to a price range for the business partners' commission - from as low as 15% to as
high as 30% of the contract price - if the deal was successful. PTC-China's senior staff
negotiated the commission with the business partner at or about the time a deal closed.
PTC-China' s senior staff reported to a PTC employee who had authority over the
commission approval process.
g.
For information technology and other subcontracted services, PTCChina relied on sign-offs provided by the SOE's officials as evidence that the agreed
upon services had been performed. Once the business partner and/or the SOE employees
and officers confirmed that the business partner had completed the services, PTC-China
made the agreed-upon payments to the business partner.
h.
Beginning in 2005, PTC-China recorded the commission and
information technology subcontracting payments to business partners as "Complete
Outsourced Deals" or "COD" expenses. After 2008, PTC-China began paying
commissions to business partners as it received customer payment on the deals. PTCChina sales staff tracked the payments to business partners on spreadsheets that they kept
on their computers, and which were separate from PTC-China's electronic accounting
records. These spreadsheets were used to track and monitor the arrangements and their
payment status.
i.
During contract negotiations with SOEs, SOE employees and
officers, in conjunction with a business partner, often requested that PTC-China provide
them with overseas "training," which involved primarily tourist and sightseeing visits.
The three parties would settle on a travel budget and the SOE employees and officers
would typically agree to "gross up" the SO E's contract price by the amount of the
anticipated travel costs. PTC-China sales staff itemized the overseas travel costs in the
initial contract documents for approval by senior PTC-China staff. Once approved,
however, PTC-China's practice was to remove the line item for overseas travel from the

final contract documents that were signed by PTC and the SOEs. Instead, the funds
budgeted for the overseas travel were disguised by PTC-China personnel as COD
expenses related to success fees or subcontracting payments for business partners.
j.
Because PTC-China employees negotiated success fees with a
business partner on a deal by deal basis, they were able to include the costs of the
overseas travel as part of a business partner's fees without raising suspicion. In tum, the
business partner used part of its success fee to pay for the overseas sightseeing trips.
Alternatively, PTC-China employees sometimes put the overseas travel payments as a
payment purportedly for providing information technology or other subcontracted
services. The business partner (or customer) then provided PTC-China with documents
indicating that it had performed the subcontracted services, and used a part of the
subcontract fee to pay for the SOE employees' and officers' sightseeing trips. For certain
more expensive trips, PTC-China employees spread the overseas travel payments over
several contracts, each with its own COD budget. Because many deals with SOEs
involved long term contracts that took several years to complete, the actual sightseeing
trip sometimes occurred up to two to three years after the deal was negotiated.
k.
PTC-China sales staff tracked on spreadsheets kept separate from
PTC-China's regularly maintained books and records the overseas travel payments made
by business partners to or for the benefit of PTC's SOE customers. Senior PTC-China
sales staff used the spreadsheets to understand the composition of, and negotiate, the
success and other fees with the business partners.

1.
PTC-China employees and the business partners typically arranged
the overseas sightseeing trips in conjunction with a visit to a PTC facility. Most often,
PTC-China sales staff arranged for SOE employees and officers to visit PTC's corporate
headquarters in Massachusetts, for PTC to market and demonstrate the company's
products and services. The trips typically consisted of one day of business activities at
PTC's facility, followed or preceded by additional days of sightseeing visits that lacked
any business purpose, all of which were paid for by the business partners using funds
from their grossed up success fees and subcontracting payments. Some PTC employees
in the United States generally understood that SOE officials were spending additional
days in the country, including for tourist activities. And certain PTC employees based in
China were aware that PTC-China employees were accompanying SOE employees and
officers to tourist destinations.
m.
Typical travel destinations in the United States included New
York, Las Vegas, San Diego, Los Angeles, and Honolulu, and involved guided tours,
golfing, and other leisure activities. PTC-China staff usually accompanied the SOE
employees and officers on these trips. The SOE employees and officers who went on the
trips often were signatories on the purchase agreements with PTC.
