PREHEARING ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings on September 1, 2016, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Milligan, No.
2:15-cv-07308 (C.D. Cal.), in which Respondent was enjoined against violations of the antifraud
and registration provisions. A prehearing conference was held today. Zachary T. Carlyle
appeared for the Division of Enforcement, and Robert D. Milligan appeared pro se.
The Division is seeking industry and penny stock bars. Milligan, who has not filed an
Answer to the OIP,1 indicated his willingness to agree to a settlement on terms that are
satisfactory to the Division. If the settlement fails and Milligan files an Answer, the Division was
granted leave to file a motion for summary disposition, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250; if he
does not file an Answer, the Division may file a motion for default and sanctions. The Division’s
motion for summary disposition, or in the alternative, for default and sanctions, will be due on
November 18, 2016. Milligan’s opposition and the Division’s reply will be due December 2 and
9, 2016, respectively.
IT IS SO ORDERED.
