WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD PROCEEDING
File No. 2016-9
In the Matter of the Claim for Award
in connection with

Redacted

Notice of Covered Action

Redacted

(“Claimant”) submitted a timely claim for award in connection with
Notice of Covered Action Redacted relating to
Redacted
(“Covered Action”). On January 7, 2016, the
Redacted
Claims Review Staff (“CRS”) preliminarily determined to recommend that we deny the claim
(“Preliminary Determination”). Based on the record that was available at that time, the CRS
found that Claimant did not qualify for an award because the information that Claimant provided
did not lead to the successful enforcement of the Covered Action. See Section 21F(b)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”); Exchange Act Rules 21F-3(a)(3) & 21F4(c). Claimant subsequently filed a timely written response contesting the Preliminary
Determination. After receiving Claimant’s written response, the CRS also received certain
additional factual information from staff in the Division of Enforcement responsible for the
Covered Action.

Preliminary Determination and Request for Reconsideration

On January 7, 2016, the CRS preliminarily determined to recommend that we deny
Claimant’s claim on the grounds that the information Claimant provided did not lead to the
success of the Covered Action. Specifically, based on the factual record at the time, it appeared
that Claimant’s information did not cause Enforcement staff to open the investigation or to
inquire into different conduct, nor did the information appear to have significantly contributed to
the success of the Covered Action.
On February 6, 2016, Claimant submitted a timely written request for reconsideration.
Claimant argued, among other things, that Claimant’s information led to the successful
enforcement of the Covered Action because Claimant’s information “significantly contributed”
to the success of the Covered Action, and as such, satisfied Rule 21F-4(c)(2).
II.

Analysis
As relevant here, information leads to the success of a covered action if:
2

(1) pursuant to Rule 21F-4(c)(1) of the Exchange Act, the information causes the
Commission to (i) commence an examination, (ii) open or reopen an
investigation, or (iii) inquire into different conduct as part of a current
Commission examination or investigation; or
(2) pursuant to Rule 21F-4(c)(2) of the Exchange Act, the information
significantly contributes to the success of a Commission judicial or
administrative enforcement action.
Applying those standards here, we find that Claimant’s information “significantly
contributed” to the success of the Covered Action.1 In reaching that determination, we place
considerable weight on the additional record evidence that was provided by Enforcement staff
following the issuance of the Preliminary Determination. That evidence demonstrates that
Claimant’s information was meaningful and that it made a substantial and important contribution
to the successful resolution of the Covered Action. Specifically, the Claimant’s information
Redacted
when staff might otherwise not
caused Enforcement staff to focus on
have done so, and this evidentiary development strengthened the Commission’s case by
meaningfully increasing Enforcement staff’s leverage during the settlement negotiations. As
such, Claimant’s information significantly contributed to the successful enforcement of the
Covered Action within the meaning of Rule 21F-4(c)(2).

In Claimant’s response contesting the Preliminary Determination, Claimant argued that
we should find that Claimant’s information led to the success of the Covered Action under Rule
21F-4(c)(1) because Claimant caused the staff to pursue a “new line of inquiry.” According to
the Claimant, the information “led the staff to initiate new and more directed inquiries” into
certain specific misconduct that the Commission already knew about, and this new information
caused the staff to more closely focus on the particular misconduct, ultimately including the
specific misconduct
in the Commission’s final
Redacted
order resolving the Covered Action.
We disagree that Rule 21F-4(c)(1) is satisfied here. Although Claimant’s information
caused staff to focus on certain specific misconduct that the staff was already generally aware of,
and to elevate its inquiry into that misconduct, the information that Claimant provided was not
substantially different from the misconduct generally under investigation—
Redacted
In our view, the “different
Redacted
conduct” standard of Rule 21F-4(c)(1) is generally limited to those circumstances where staff has
an open investigation into one type of misconduct, and a whistleblower subsequently submits a
tip alerting staff that the entity is engaged in substantially different misconduct. Thus, Rule 21F4(c)(1) is not satisfied where, as here, a whistleblower submits information concerning
misconduct that is already under investigation. In such circumstances, we believe that the
appropriate analysis is governed by Rule 21F-4(c)(2)—i.e., whether the whistleblower’s
information significantly contributed to the success of the enforcement action.

In determining the appropriate award percentage, we carefully weighed the factors
specified in Rule 21F-6, including the significance of the information provided by Claimant, the
assistance that Claimant provided, and the law-enforcement interests at issue. We find that
Redacted
Claimant should receive an award of
of the monetary sanctions collected in
the Covered Action, which will equal payment of more than $3,500,000. As part of our
assessment of the award criteria, we have considered certain unique hardships experienced by the
Claimant as a result of the Claimant’s decision to report the wrongdoing to the Commission.
Specifically, the record demonstrates that the Claimant has been unable to find employment
since reporting the misconduct and that this is significantly due to Claimant’s whistleblowing
activities. The record also demonstrates that as a result of Claimant’s whistleblowing the

III.

Conclusion

After careful consideration of the administrative record, including Claimant’s written
response and the additional factual information provided by Enforcement staff, we find that
Claimant’s information led to successful enforcement because it significantly contributed to the
success of the Covered Action.
Accordingly, upon due consideration under Rules 21F-10(g) and (h), 17 C.F.R.
§ 240.21F-10(g) and (h), it is hereby ORDERED that the Claimant shall receive an award of
Redacted
of the monetary sanctions collected and to be collected in the Covered
Action.
By the Commission.
