1897-1960

Harold

Harold C. Patterson was serving his second term as a member of the
Securities and Exchange Commission at the time of his death on
November 29, 1960.
He brought to his high officesin the public service a broad experience
and a vast fund of knowledge of the Nation's financial community.
Able, forthright and just, he was ever devoted to the objectives for
which the Commission was created by the Congress. These qualities
made him a stalwart ad vocate of the cause of investor protection.
His trenchant analysis of the many problems confronting the Commission and the wisdom which characterized his decisions earned the
admiration and respect of its members, the staff and the public. His
counsel will be sorely missed by those who must continue, as we know
he would have desired, with the tasks that lie ahead.
To each of us who had the good fortune to know him his passing leaves
a deep personal void as well. Ever a staunch friend, he shared
generously of his time, his talents, and his experience.
We here record our profound sorrow at his passing and our deep
sympathy for the members of his bereaved family.

FOREWORD
This 26th Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission to the Congress for the fiscal year July 1959 to June 30, 1960
describes the Commission's activities during the year in discharging
its duties under the statutes which it administers. These include
supervision of the registration of securities for sale to the public by
the use of the mails and in interstate commerce, enforcement of the
anti-fraud provisions of the federal securities laws, surveillance of
the exchange and over-the-counter markets in securities, regulation
of the activities of brokers and dealers and investment advisers, and
regulation of registered public utility holding company systems and
investment companies.
In the fiscal year 1960 a record number of registration statements
under the Securities Act of 1933 became effective. There were a
total of 1,398 such statements as compared with the previous high of
1,055 in fiscal 1959. The dollar amount of issues of securities registered for public sale totalled $14.4 billion, down somewhat from the
$15.7billion in fiscal 1959.
There was further substantial increase in the volume of the Commission's regulatory activities with respect to investment companies,
as evidenced by the increase in the number of investment companies
registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. There were
570 such companies as of June 30, 1960, the largest number ever
registered and 58 more than were registered at the end of the previous
fiscal year. The aggregate market value of assets of all registered
investment companies was $23.5 billion as of the same date, a new
high and $3.5 billion more than the previous year.
During the fiscal year, following submission of recommendations
made by the Commission for amendments to the securities laws, which
are described in the Commission's 25th Annual Report, major amendments were enacted to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. In
addition, an amendment was passed to the Trust Indenture Act of
1939. While Congressional action was taken on other bills embodying
Commission recommendation, those bills were not enacted.

PART I
CURRENT PROBLEMS BEFORE THE COMMISSION
Previous annual reports have reflected the need for, and the expenditure of, considerable time and money in meeting the challenge of the
rising band of promoters and others who attempt to take unlawful
advantage of the desire of the investing public to share in the increased
prosperity and consequent rising security markets of our nation.
These efforts of the Commission, as well as the need to meet a tide of
new offerings of securities and increased activity in the trading markets, have deflected certain of the activities and energies of the Commission from other areas necessary to proper development of the securities markets and adequate protection of investors. These other
necessary areas of activity include the review and modification of the
forms, rules and procedures of the Commission to meet and deal with
new and developing patterns of securities distribution; to cope with the
problems arising from the growth of important elements in our capital
markets such as the investment companies of various types as important investment media to meet the increasing capital requirements of industry; to anticipate the development of newer forms of
investment media and channels for the accumulation of savings, such
as the variable annuity contract; to reach decisions as to the proper
role of the Federal Government in the ever growing area of enforcement; to recruit and to train new personnel to meet as promptly and
as effectively as possible these various problems; and to achieve a
proper balance as to the time, energies and funds to be allocated to
each of these necessary duties within existing budgetary limits.
Unfortunately, the pace of statutory violations of fraudulent distributions and of other malpractices in our security markets has not
slowed sufficiently to permit the Commission to divert to these other
matters the major segment of our personnel which has been devoted
to enforcement activities. Enforcement activities continue and will
continue at a high rate; the number of new issuers seeking establishment in our capital markets, and the need for capital by seasoned
issuers has not abated-all signs point rather to increased activity in
1

2

SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION

this area; the variety and increasing important new types of securities created and distributed by the undimmed genius of American
issuers continues to grow. All of these factors serve either to intensify
old problems or to bring new ones demanding the attention of the
Commission and of its staff.
Nevertheless, the Commission has attempted to budget its available
resources to continue the programs already in progress and to permit
the initiation of studies and other activities designed to meet these
newer challenges. We review below some of the more important problems with which the Commission is currently dealing.
Fraudulent

Sale of Securities

The fraudulent sale of securities remains a major problem for the
Commission and has continued to occupy the time of a large portion
of its staff. During the second half of the fiscal year, activity in the
securities market generally receded somewhat from its mid-year peak.
However, public interest in securities remained at a high level and
furnished a fertile field for fraud and manipulation in the sale of
securities. Recent publicity in regard to certain successful traders
seems to have instilled in the minds of some persons a desire to duplicate their success in the market.
There appears, however, to have been some decrease in the so-called
"boiler-room" activity which usually involves high pressure selling
of spurious issues by long distance telephone to persons with whom
the firm has had no previous contact and by high pressure methods
ordinarily accompanied by gross misrepresentations and other fraudulent devices. The decrease in these boiler-rooms is doubtless due,
in part at least, to a number of indictments and convictions of the
hard core of boiler-room operators and their salesmen which have been
handed down as the result of our own activities.
Commission pressure on boiler-rooms located in this country has
tended to shift the bases of their operations to Canada. The Commission's restricted list and foreign postal fraud orders have been only
partially effective in stopping this activity. In controlling the illegal
disposition of Canadian securities in the United States, the Commission is to a large extent still dependent upon the excellent and invaluable cooperation of the Canadian authorities.
Registration of Securities

The past fiscal year has seen a larger number of registration statements filed with us preparatory to making a public offering than any
previous year in the Commission's history. During the past year, a

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

3

total of 1628 such registration statements were filed, as against 1226
for the 1959 fiscal year. The dollar amount represented by these statements exceeded $15,800 million, which is somewhat less than the
$16,600 million covered by registration statements filed in the previous year. In considering our own situation, however, it is necessary
to keep in mind that our work is a function of the number of items and
not of the amount of money involved.
More than half of the registration statements which became effective
during the fiscal year, exclusive of statements of mutual funds filed
pursuant to Section 24(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
were filed by issuers which had not previously filed a registration statement under the Securities Act. Since there was no background of
previously examined material against which these registration statements might be checked and since they were sometimes prepared by
persons unfamiliar with the statute, it was necessary to make a careful
examination of all aspects of such statements. The examination of
these statements, therefore, required a proportionately greater share
of the staff's time than is the case with respect to issuers which have
previously gone through the registration process on one or more
occasions.
The processing of these filings has imposed a tremendous work load
upon the Commission's staff which has necessitated some lengthening
of the processing period. However, every effort continues to be made
to enable registrants to meet their financial schedules. The industry
and its representatives have appreciated the heavy work load imposed
upon the Commission and have evidenced commendable patience in
connection with its work in this field.
Supervision of Broker-Dealer Firms

The development of the securities market during recent years has
given rise to some new and troublesome distribution techniques in the
industry. The spread of branch offices,the army of part-time salesmen
and the methods employed to distribute mutual funds reflect the
growth of high-volume impersonal distribution methods. During the
period 1950-59, the number of offices of member firms of the New York
Stock Exchange increased from 1,661 to 2,936, and the number of registered representatives (i.e., salesmen) increased from 11,409 to 24,898.
Similar figures appear in statistics relating to the members of the
National Association of Securities Dealers, where the number of
branch offices increased from 1,321 to 3,836 and the number of registered representatives increased from 29,824 to 84,648.

4

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The growth in the number of branch offices intensifies the problem
of supervision over broker-dealer firms. The physical separation of
branch office personnel from the responsible supervisors in the main
office makes control by the managements of the firms more difficult.
In many cases, the manager of a branch office may not be a partner
or an officer of the firm. Registered representatives may be relatively
inexperienced. in the securities business and the task of supervision
may be aggravated by the employment of part-time registered representatives, particularly in the mutual fund field. Some registered
representatives may solicit from door to door and they may operate
not from officesbut from private residences remote from supervisory
personnel. Finally, the rising demand for experienced business producers results in a rapid turnover of registered representatives, increasing the difficulties of supervision.
Real Estate

Securities

In recent years a new investment program for obtaining capital
from public investors has developed under which investors are being
offered whole or fractional interests in mortgages or deeds of trust
with an arrangement providing various services to the investors. Because of the numerous questions presented to the Commission regarding these types of offerings, the Commission issued a release setting
forth its views as to the applicability of the federal securities laws
and its opinion that frequently such offerings constitute the sale of
"investment contracts", which are securities required to be registered
in accordance with these laws.'
In 1958 the Commission filed an action to enjoin Los Angeles Trust
Deed and Mortgage Exchange and others from violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and Securities
Exchange Act in the sale of securities of this type. The District
Court found that the defendants were offering securities required to
be registered and also appointed a receiver." At the close of the fiscal
year, the case was pending before the Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit. In view of the growing number of investment programs
similar to that offered by the defendants in this action, the District
Court's decision is of national significance and constitutes additional
judicial precedent in aid of the Commission's enforcement activities
in this area.

TWENTY-SIXTH

A1I.TNUAL REPORT

Combination Insurance and Investment Contracts

In the past few years, in certain States, there has been an increasing
number of stock life insurance companies engaged in offering forms of
life insurance by contracts which include an equity investment.
Because of the dual character of these offerings, in some instances the
contracts may be subject to the requirements of the Securities Act of
1933, the issuer subject to the Investment Company Act of 1940 and
the persons engaged in the offer and sale subject to the requirements
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Definitive information is not available to the Commission of the
many variants in the form of these contracts, although, generally
speaking, it would appear that they all involve the payment of a
"premium" in an amount sufficiently large to provide the funds for
the equity investment which is unrelated to the conventional insurance
aspects of the contracts.
In certain cases the contract guarantees the return of a large portion of the annual "premium" paid, other than in the first year, so that
it may be used to purchase shares in a registered mutual fund organized by, or closely related to, the insurance company. Because the
sales commission deducted from the total "premium" is applicable to
that portion of the "premium" designated for the purchase of these
shares, this type of contract raises serious questions of compliance
with provisions of the Investment Company Act which limit the
amount of sales load that may be charged for investment company
shares and the manner in which it may be collected.
Other forms of these contracts provide that a large part of the
"premiums" paid will, in effect, be used to purchase an undivided
interest in a portfolio of common stocks to be maintained by the company. In some cases, various forms of guarantees are also made to
repay this portion of the "premium" plus interest thereon.
The Commission intends to pursue its consideration of the problems raised by these developments.
Variable Annuity Contracts

The decision of the Supreme Court in 8.E.0. Y. Variable Annuity
Life Insurance Oompany of America, and The Equity Annuity Life
Insurance Oompany, 359 U.S. 65 (1959) determined that the "variable
annuity" contracts in question and their issuers are subject to federal
jurisdiction under the securities laws. It can now be expected that a
large segment of the insurance industry will seek to engage in this
activity under various forms of variable annuity contracts and methods of operations, many of which are novel and unique. This will
involve problems of harmonizing compliance with the Investment
Company Act and local insurance laws and regulation.
The ad-

---m-

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ministrative flexibility which is granted the Commission by the Investment Company Act has made it possible for the the defendant
companies, in cooperation with the staff of the Commission, to evolve
solutions to some of these problems, and these companies are now
actively engaged in this business. Informal discussions with other
companies are being pursued.
Resolution of the problems which variable annuities present depends in part upon the nature of state legislation and insurance and
security industry practices and regulation.
For this reason, the education and cooperation of interested persons is necessary so that all
legitimate interests are protected.
The Commission through various
means is working towards these ends.
Investment Company Size Study and Investigation

Investment companies have achieved tremendous growth since 1940
as media for the investment of their savings by many persons of relatively smaller means. Investment companies as a group have come
to represent one of the three principal elements in the securities and
capital markets of our nation. As such they may have important
effects upon cyclical changes in our markets, on their stability and generally upon the availability and sources of capital for the expansion
and growth of American industry. Inanticipation of this remarkable
growth, Section 14(b) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 authorizes the Commission to make a study and investigation of the
effects of size of investment companies on the investment policy of
such companies and on security markets, on concentration of control
of wealth and industry, and on companies in which investment companies are interested, and to report the results of its study and investigation and its recommendations to Congress. Because of the
non-recurrent nature of this overall study and to avail itself of an
independent point of view, the Commission contracted with the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce, University of Pennsylvania, to
assist it in making such a study and investigation.
In 1959 a questionnaire was distributed to all open-end and closed-end investment companies with assets of $1 million or more. The replies to the questionnaire, which included data concerning purchases and sales of certain
selected stocks, security holdings, portfolio turnover, investment policy, trading practices and marketing channels employed and control of
investment companies over portfolio companies, are being studied by
the Wharton School as a basis for the preparation of its report. Other
phases of the over all study and investigation will proceed as expeditiously as circumstances permit. When the full report has been completed and transmitted to the Commission by the Wharton School, it
is expected that the Commission will be in a position to make a deter-

mination in regard to the various problems involved and to report
more fully to Congress.
Investment Advisers

The enactment subsequent to the close of the fiscal year of substantial amendments to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 vested in the
Commission additional responsibilities which will require the devotion
of considerable time and energy by the Commission and its staff in
the development of revised forms for registration and reporting, special rules as to record-keeping by investment advisers, rules specifically designed to obviate to the extent possible fraudulent practices in
this heretofore largely unregulated field, and new procedures for the
periodic inspection of the affairs and operations of all registered
investment advisers.

PART n
LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES
Statutory Amendments Proposed by the Commission

As fully discussed in the Commission's 25th Annual Report/ its
proposals to the 86th Congress for amendment of the Federal securities laws were introduced in the Senate as S. 1178, S. 1179, S. 1180,
S. 1181, and S. 1182, and in the House of Representatives as H.R. 5001,
H.R. 2480, H.R. 5002, H.R. 2481, and H.R. 2482. The Commission's
proposals were intended to strengthen the safeguards and protections
afforded the public by tightening jurisdictional provisions, correcting
certain inadequacies revealed through administrative experience and
facilitating criminal prosecutions and other enforcement activities.
Hearings on the bills were held during the first session of the 86th
Congress before the Subcommittee on Securities of the Banking and
Currency Committee of the Senate and the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives.
On June 28, 1960, the Committee on Banking and Currency of the
Senate reported out S. 3769 (relating to the Securities Act of 1933),
S. 3770 (relating to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934), S. 3771 (relating to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939), S. 3772 (relating to the
Investment Company Act of 1940) and S. 3773 (relating to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940), which were original bills in lieu of S.
1178, S. 1179, S. 1180, S. 1181 and S. 1182 respectively," The bills
were introduced in the Senate by Senator Harrison A. Williams Jr.,
Chairman of the Subcommittee on Securities, who pointed out that
because of the modifications made to the original proposals, the Banking and Currency Committee decided to report out clean bills," On
July 2, 1960 the bills reported by the Committee were passed by the
Senate, without amendment.
On August 26, 1960, the Committee on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives reported out S. 3771, H.R. 5001
(relating to the Securities Act of 1933), H.R. 2480 (relating to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934), H.R. 2481 (relating to the Invest1At pp. 9-11.
• The bills reported out were accompanied by Senate Reports Nos. 17fj6 through 17M,
respectively.

ment Company Act of 1940), and H.R. 2482 (relating to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940).4 Of these bills, S. 3771 was reported out
as passed by the Senate, and the others embodied the Committee's
amendments to the Commission's proposals. On August 30, 1960, the
House of Representatives passed S. 3771, S. 3773 and an amended
version of S. 3772.5 S. 3771 and S. 3773 were signed by the President
on September 13 and became Public Law 86-760 and Public Law
86-750, respectively. The Senate, however, did not act on the
amended version of S. 3772.6 Thus amendments were enacted to the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.
Public Law 86-750 amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 by
expanding the bases for disqualification of a registrant because of
prior misconduct; authorizing the Commission by rule to require the
keeping of books and records and the filing of reports; permitting
periodic examination of a registrant's books and records; empowering
the Commission by rule to define and prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent practices; extending criminal liability
for a wilful violation of a rule or order of the Commission; making
it clear that aiders and abettors may be responsible in injunctive and
administrative proceedings; and modifying the definition of the term
"control" in the statute and the conditions under which an investment
adviser may call himself an "investment counsel."
Public Law 86-760 amends Section 304(c) of the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939. Under that section the Commission was required to
grant an exemption from the provisions involved if, at the time the
application for exemption is filed, securities are outstanding which
were outstanding within six months of the enactment of the Act, that
is by February 4, 1940, and if compliance would require consent of
the holders of outstanding securities, or would impose an undue burden
on the issuer, having due regard for the public interest and the interests
of investors. As amended, Section 304( c) now requires the Commission to grant the exemption in the same situation if there are securities
outstanding which were outstanding either on February 4, 1940 or on
January 1,1959.
In addition an amendment was enacted to Section 4(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. S. 1965, as amended by the Committee
on Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives
• The bllIs were accompanied by Rouse Reports Nos. 2176 through. 2180.
• One of the amendments, previously introduced as R.R. 13041, proposed an amendment to Sec. 36 of the Lnvestment Company Act to provide an investigatory power in
the board of directors of a registered investment company, or the investment adviser or
principal underwriter for such a company with respect to, among other things, securities
transactions and loans by an officer, director, employee or agent of the registered investment company or investment advisor.

provides that a commissioner, after the expiration of his term, shall
continue in officeuntil his successor is appointed and qualified, except
.that he may not continue beyond the expiration of the next session of
Congress subsequent to the expiration of his term in office,"
Other Legislative Proposals

The following bills relating to the Securities laws were introduced
during the fiscal year 1960. No hearings were held on the bills.
H.R. 12268, introduced by Representative J. Arthur Younger,
would, among other things, amend the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 to provide for the assessment and collection of increased fees to
cover the cost of operation of this Commission.
S. 3541, introduced (by request) by Senator John J. Sparkman for
himself and Senator Homer E. Capehart, and providing for the incorporation of Federal mortgage investment companies, would authorize the Commission by rule to exempt the securities of those companies
from the Securities Act of 1933 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939,
and provide a specific exemption from the debt limitations prescribed
for registered investment companies in Section 18(a) (1) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
A substantial amount of time was directed to matters pertaining
to other legislative proposals referred to the Commission for comment
and to congressional inquiries. A total of 58 legislative proposals
were analyzed. In addition, numerous congressional inquiries relating to matters other than specific legislative proposals were received
and answered.
Congressional Hearings

Proposals to Increase Registration Fees.-On June 6, 1960, Commissioner Orrick appeared before the Subcommittee on Commerce
and Finance of the House Interstate and Foreign Commerce Committee and testified on H.R. 6294, a bill to amend Section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Section 31 now provides an annual
fee for the registration of exchanges of one five-hundredth of 1 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of stock exchange sales transactions, equal to 2 cents per $1,000. The bill would increase the exchange
registration fee to 5 cents per $1,000, and would impose a similar fee
on brokers and dealers on sales transactions effected otherwise than on
a national securities exchange. Commissioner Orrick testified that
the Commission believed the bill provides an equitable means of substantially increasing the reimbursement to the Treasury for the ComPublic Law 86-619.
A correcting amendment relating to the salary of the Chairman was subsequently
embodied in H.R. 10366 and enacted into law. Public Law 86-771.

mission's cost of operation by spreading the impact of the fees over
all of the investing public for whose benefit the various statutes administered by the Commission were enacted.
Small Business Investment Act of 1958.-0n
February 23, 1960,
Chairman Gadsby and members of the staff appeared before the.
Senate Select Committee on Small Business and testified with respect
to the Commission's activities in relation to the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, and in connection with certain matters that
had been raised concerning the securities laws administered by the
Commission. A similar appearance was made on March 10, 1960
before Subcommittee No. 3 of the House Committee on Banking and
Currency.
On both occasions Chairman Gadsby addressed himself to the
matter of generally exempting small business investment companies
from the operation of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The
Commission opposed such exemption because in its opinion there was
no sound reason for depriving public investors in such companies
of the protections and benefits of the Investment Company Act.
The Commission also opposed enactment of a provision which would
allow small business investment companies subject to the Investment
Company Act to issue stock options.
Ethics, Conflicts of Interest and Administrative Practice.- Various bills were pending during the 86th Congress, 2d Session, dealing
with ethics, conflicts of interest and administrative practice.
1. S. 600 and S. 2374.-0n
November 19,1959, Chairman Gadsby
and other members of the Commission appeared before the Subcommittee on Administrative Practice and Procedure of the Senate Judiciary Committee to testify on S. 600 and S. 2374. S. 600 would create
an office of Federal Administrative Practice to study and make recommendations regarding the adequacy of procedures by which
agencies carry out their rule-making and adjudicatory functions. The
Commission expressed no opinion on the need to establish a new independent agency to perform this function, but suggested that such
an officehave no veto-power over the rule-making authority delegated
to independent agencies.
S. 2374 is designed to prohibit certain off-the-record communications
and to assure determinations on the record. The Commission has
always attempted to conduct its proceedings consistent with the proposal, and advanced various suggestions in furtherance of the bill's
objective.
2. H.R. 2156, H.R. 2157, and H.R. 7556.-The
Commission's
General Counsel, Thomas G. Meeker, appeared on February 25, 1960,
to testify before Subcommittee No. 5 of the House Committee on the

Judiciary concerning H.R. 2156, H.R. 2157, and H.R. 7556, all of
which deal, in general, with conflicts of interest of government employees. The Commission fully concurred in the objectives of these
bills, but pointed out that, as drafted, they create unnecessary hardships and pose certain other problems. Mr. Meeker made certain

3. H.R. 4800 and H.R. 6774.-Chairman
Gadsby and other members of the Commission appeared before the House Interstate and
Foreign Commerce Committee on March 30, 1960 to testify on H.R.
4800 and H.R. 6774. H.R. 6774 is similar to S. 2374, mentioned above,
and H.R. 4800 is intended to eliminate the use of improper methods
to influence the action of regulatory agencies, and to assure that parties
to an agency proceeding are informed of their adversaries' communications to the agency and that agency action will be founded
solely on the merits of each case. Chairman Gadsby informed the
Committee that the Commission has bent every effort to achieve these
purposes by its rules and general method of operation. However, the
Committee was advised that the bills as drafted raise problems which
would be detrimental to the effective functioning of government
agencies.

PART TIl
REVISION OF RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS
Changing conditions and changing methods and procedures in
the fields of business and finance make it necessary for the Commission to maintain a continuing review of its rules, regulations and
forms. Certain members of its staff are assigned to this task.
Changes are also suggested, from time to time, by other members of
the staff engaged in the examination of material filed with the Commission, and by persons outside of the Commission who are subject
to the Commission's requirements or who have occasion to work with
those requirements in a professional capacity such as underwriters,
attorneys, accountants and other representatives. With a relatively
few exceptions, provided for by the Administrative Procedure Act,
proposed changes in rules, regulations and forms are announced to
the public and interested persons are invited to submit their views
and comments thereon. These views and comments are carefully
reviewed by the staff and by the Commission and are very helpful
in revealing the manner in which proposed changes will operate.'
A number of changes were made during the 1960 fiscal year in the
rules, regulations and forms under the various statutes administered
by the Commission. Other changes which the Commission announced in preliminary form and as to which it invited public commerits were pending at the end of the fiscal year. The changes made
during the fiscal year and those pending at the end of the year are
described below.
THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
Amendment of Rule 133

Shortly after the beginning of the fiscal year the Commission
adopted certain amendments to Rule 133.2 This rule, in brief, provides that registration of the securities involved is not required for the

submission to the stockholders of a corporation of a plan for a merger,
consolidation or similar transaction does not, under the conditions
specified in the rule, involve an offer or sale of securities to such
stockholders. The general purpose of the amendments is to indicate
the circumstances under which securities distributed by persons receiving them in connection with such transactions may be required
to be registered under the Act. This matter had been under consideration for some time and has been described at various stages in
previous annual reports of the Commission,"
Adoption or Rule 136; Amendment or Rule 140

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted a new Rule 136 and
certain amendments to Rule 140.4 The new Rule 136 defines the term
"offer" and "sale" and certain related terms so as to include specifically
the levying of assessments on assessable stock. The rule also provides
that the offer or sale of assessable stock at public auction or otherwise
to realize the amount of an unpaid assessment thereon is not exempt
from registration under the Act. The rule further provides that any
person who acquires assessable stock at such a sale with a view to its
distribution is to be deemed an underwriter of the stock. The amendment to Rule 140 which defines the term underwriter for certain purposes was adopted to make it clear that it applies to the levying of
assessments, as well as to other types of offers and sales. References
to these proposed rule changes have been made in previous annual
reports,"
Proposed Rule 155

The Commission during the fiscal year published notice that it has
under consideration a proposed new rule which would be designated
Rule 155.6 The purpose of this proposed rule is to make clear that a
public offering of an immediately convertible security by persons
who purchased such security from an issuer in a "private placement",
or a public offering of the underlying security received by such persons upon conversion of the convertible security, may be subject to
the registration provisions of the Securities Act.
Consideration of the proposed rule was initiated as a result of the
assertion made in a number of situations that the holders of a convertible security, purchased in a private placement may later sell to
the public the convertible security, or the security into which it is
convertible, free of the prohibitions of Section 5 of the Act because
the proposed distribution will not involve a transaction by the issuer

or an underwriter, or because the security to be distributed is "free
stock", or because the transaction is otherwise exempt by reason
of the provisions of Section 3 (a) (9) or 4 ( 1) of the Act. These views,
if followed, would tend to deprive public investors of the information
necessary to informed investment decisions and might otherwise impair or impede the effectiveness of the Commission's over-all administration and enforcement of the Act.
The time for submitting comments on the proposed rule was twice
extended during the fiscal year/
At the close of the year the matter
was being considered in the light of the views and comments submitted
in response to the Commission's invitation.
Rescission of Regulation A-M

During the fiscal year the Commission rescinded Regulation A-M
under the Securities Act," This regulation provided an exemption
from registration under the Act for assessable stock of certain mining
corporations.
Regulation A-M was rescinded in view of the adoption by the Commission of certain rule changes relating to assessable
securities, particularly Regulation F.9 However, since Regulation F
does not provide an exemption for new issues of assessable securities,
Regulation A was amended to make that regulation available for the
offering of such new issues."
Amendment of Regulation A

Regulation A, which is a general exemption regulation under the
Securities Act for issues not in excess of $300,000, was amended during the fiscal year to make that regulation available for new issues of
assessable stock for which an exemption under Regulation A-M was
previously available," In view of the rescission of Regulation A-M it
appeared desirable to provide an exemption for small issues of assessable securities.
Previously Regulation A had expressly excluded
assessable securities from any exemption thereunder.
Regulation A was similarly amended during the fiscal year to pro.
vide an exemption for securities of the type for which Regulation
B-T was previously available. That regulation, as indicated below,
was also rescinded during the fiscal year.12

COMMISSION

Rescission of Regulation ll-T

During the fiscalyear the Commission rescinded its Regulation B- T
under the Securities Act." This regulation provided an exemption
from registration for certain interests in an oil royalty trust or similar
type of trust or unincorporated association. Although this exemption
was adopted in 1938, no offering was ever made under it and it appeared that there was no present or prospective need for the regulation. However, in order that there might be a comparable exemption
in the event that anyone should at some future date wish to offer such
securities, Regulation A, as indicated above, was amended to make the
exemption provided by that regulation available for securities of the
type for which Regulation B-T was previously provided.
Adoption of Regulation F

During the fiscal year the Commission adopted a new exemption
regulation, designated Regulation F.B The new regulation provides
a conditional exemption from registration for assessments on assessable stock and for assessable stock sold at delinquent assessment sales.
A condition to the availability of an exemption under the regulation
is the filing of a comparatively simple notification giving brief information as to the issuer, its management and its recent and proposed
assessments. Any notice or advertisement of the assessment or any
delinquent, assessment sales must include or be accompanied by a reasonably detailed statement of the purposes for which the proceeds
from the assessment or assessment sales are to be used. Any literature used in connection with the levying of the assessment or the
delinquent assessment sales must be filed with the Commission. The
exemption may be suspended under certain circumstances, such as a
finding by the Commission that fraud is involved. Reference to the
new regulation was made in the previous annual report."
Amendment to Form S-9

The Commission, during the fiscal year, adopted an amendment to
Form 8-9 which is used, where certain prescribed conditions are met,
for registration under the Securities Act of non-convertible, fixedinterest debt securities of issuers required to file reports with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.'6 One of the conditions to the use of Form 8-9 is that
the registrant shall meet certain tests as to coverage of fixed charges
by earnings. The ratio of earnings to fixed charges must also be set
forth in connection with the summary of earnings. The definition

of "fixed charges" contained in the form previously prodded that
fixed charges shall include "an appropriate portion of rentals under
long term leases".
The amendment established a definite formula \Y" jell may be i.se.l
in determining an appropriate portion of rentals re] .resenting the interest factor in rental payments in order that a prospective registrant
may determine with reasonable certainty whether it is qualified to
use the form. The amendment changes the test from "an appropriate
portion of long term rentals" to one-third of all rentals reported in
the appropriate financial schedule or such other portion as can be
demonstrated as representative of the interest factor. The limitation
of rentals to "long term leases" has been dropped because of the substantial difference of opinion as to the definition of a "long term lease"
and because the presence of the interest factor in rentals is not dependent upon the rental contract extending over any given period of
time.
Adoption of Form S-14

Shortly after the beginning of the fiscal year the Commission
adopted a new registration form under the Securities Act designated
Form S-14Y The new form is designed to provide a simplified registration procedure for securities issued in a Rule 133 transaction where
such registration is required and where the issuer has solicited proxies
under the Commission's proxy rules with respect to such transaction.
The form provides that the prospectus may consist chiefly of the information set forth in the proxy statement and may be in the form of
a proxy statement meeting the requirements of the proxy rules. The
information thus supplied must be supplemented by the necessary
underwriting and distribution data and pertinent information regarding developments in the registrant's business subsequent to the Rule
133 transaction. Reference to this form has been made in previous
ann ual reports."
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Amendment of Rules 16b-2 and 16c-2

Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act provides that any
profit realized by a beneficial owner of more than 10 percent of any
class of any equity security registered on a national securities exchange or by a director or officer of the issuer of such a security (sometimes referred to herein as "insiders") as a result of any non-exempt
short-swing transaction (purchase and sale, or sale and purchase,
within six months) may be recovered by the issuer or by any security

bolder on its behalf. Section 16(c) of the Act makes it unlawful for
the "insiders" referred to, directly or indirectly, to sell any nonexempted equity security of such issuer (1) if they do not own the
security sold, or (2) if owning it, they do not deliver it within the
period specified in the section. Rules 16b-2 and 16c-2 have provided
exemptions from the above provisions for certain distributing transactions under specified conditions including, among others, the requirement that persons other than "insiders" be participating in the
distribution to an equal extent and on terms at least as favorable as the
"insiders".
The above rules were amended during the fiscal year to make it clear
that when the conditions of the rules are met, certain other transactions which frequently occur in connection with distributions are
also exempted." These include (1) stabilizing transactions, which
may involve the purchase of outstanding securities of the same class
rather than securities of the block being distributed, or, where a convertible security is being distributed, outstanding securities of the
class subject to the conversion right; (2) transactions effected in connection with the various types of rights offerings, e.g. "lay offs" in a
Shields Plan type of distribution; and (3) transactions in connection
with so-called standby redemptions, i.e., where convertible securities
selling above their redemption price are called for redemption and at
the same time arrangements are made under which dealers undertake
to purchase any such securities tendered at a price slightly higher than
the redemption price, to convert them and to distribute the underlying
stock.
Rule 16c-2 has also been amended to delete the requirement that the
distribution be made on behalf of the issuer or a person in a control
relationship with the issuer, a requirement which is not contained
in Rule 16b-2. It is believed that where all of the other conditions
of the rule can be met the identity of the person on whose behalf the
distribution is being made is not a material consideration in determining whether the exemption should be available.
Amendment of Rule 16b-3

Rule 16b-3 provided an exemption from the provisions of Section
16(b) of the Act for shares of stock acquired pursuant to bonus, profit
sharing, retirement, thrift, savings or similar plans meeting specified
conditions. The rule also exempted the acquisition of non-transferable options and stock acquired under such options pursuant to a plan
meeting similar conditions. The exemption for stock so acquired had
been the subject of litigation. While decisions of the courts have not

been uniform, doubt had been expressed as to the validity of the rule
insofar as it related to the acquisition of shares through the exercise
of so-called "restricted" stock options.
Following a study of the rule in the light of these decisions, it was
concluded that, as a matter of policy, Rule 16b-3 should be amended
to delete the exemption for the acquisition of securities upon the exercise of non-transferable stock options and that the rule should be
amended to provide that the selection of persons participating in
bonus, profit sharing, retirement, thrift, savings, option or similar
plans be made by a board of directors, a majority of whom are disinterested, or by a disinterested committee.
Two drafts of proposed amendments to the rule were published
during the fiscal year and a number of comments and suggestions were
received as a result of such publications."
The amendments to the
rule were adopted in the latter part of the fiscal year."
Amendment of Rule 16b-8

Rule 16b--8 exempts from Section 16(b) of the Act, under certain
conditions, the receipt from an issuer of shares of stock having general voting power and registered on a national securities exchange
upon the surrender of an equal number of shares of stock of the same
issuer which do not have such voting power and are not so registered,
where the transaction is effected pursuant to the provisions of the
issuer's certificate of incorporation for the purpose of making an
immediate public sale or a gift of such shares.
One of the conditions to exemption under the rule is that no shares
of the class surrendered or any other shares of the class received are
acquired by the person effecting the transaction within six months
before or after the date of the transactions. The rule was amended
during the fiscal year to make it clear that the exemption of transactions under the rule is not affected by prior or subsequent transactions which are also exempt under the provisions of the rule."
Proposed Rule 19a2-1

Section 19(a) (2) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 authorizes
the Commission, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, by order to deny, to suspend the effective date of, to suspend for
a period not exceeding 12 months or to withdraw the registration of a
security on a National Securities Exchange if the Commission finds

mission is further authorized by Section 21 of the Act to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person
has violated or is about to violate any provision of the Act or any rule
or regulation thereunder.
From time to time the Commission has encountered difficulty in proceedings under Section 19(a) (2) in obtaining information or documents which would facilitate a determination whether an issuer has
failed to comply with the provisions of the Act or the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to disclosure. This difficulty has
stemmed from the failure or refusal of certain persons, particularly
nonresident persons, to accept service of subpoenas to testify or to
produce needed documents or from other efforts designed to obstruct
the Commission. Similar difficulties have been encountered in connection with investigations under Section 21 of the Act.
The Commission has invited public comments on a proposed Rule
19a2-1 under the Act which would provide that the failure or refusal
of an issuer or its officers, directors, employees or controlling persons
to cooperate with the Commission in proceedings under Section 19(a)
(2) or investigations under Section 21 of the Act with respect to
compliance with Section 12 or 13 of the Act shall be deemed a failure
to comply with the provisions of the Act or the rules and regulations
thereunder for the purpose of Section 19(a) (2).23 The proposed
rule would provide a basis for the issuance of an order under Section
19(a) (2) denying, suspending or withdrawing the registration of a
security in such cases.
Amendment

of Form 8-K

The Commission invited public comments on certain proposed
amendments to Form 8-K during the last fiscal year.24 These proposed amendments are designed promptly to bring to the attention
of investors information regarding material changes affecting the
company or its affairs where it appears that the changes are of such
importance that they should be reported promptly and not deferred
to the end of the fiscal year. The amendments relate to matters
such as the pledging of securities of the issuer or its affiliates, changes
in the board of directors otherwise than by stockholder action, the
acquisition or disposition of significant amounts of assets and transactions with insiders. Time for submitting such comments on the
proposed amendments was twice extended during the fiscal year and
the matter was still under consideration at the close of the year.

Amendment of Form 9-K

Form 9-K is used for semi-annual reports required to be filed by
certain issuers having securities registered on a national securities
exchange and certain issuers which have registered securities under
the Securities Act of 1933. The form was amended during the fiscal
year to reduce the number of deficiency letters sent by the Commission to registrants with respect to reports filed on the form."
Many of the semi-annual reports filed on Form 9-K have been
deficient because of a failure to follow the instructions contained in
the form. In order to give greater prominence to the instructions
and bring them to the attention of persons preparing the report, the
general instructions have been placed ahead of the form and the instructions as to particular captions have been placed under the respective captions to which they apply. In addition, certain minor
changes have been made in the form and instructions.
THE PU!JUC UTIUTY HOLDING COMPANY ACT OF 1935
Rescission of Rule 9

In 1958 the Commission rescinded Rule 9 which afforded an exemption from the Holding Company Act to holding companies and
their subsidiaries with relatively small total net utility assets or gross
utility revenues. (See page 21 of the Commission's 24th Annual
Report.)
The rescission of the rule became effective on June 30,
1959. Unless companies previously claiming an exemption from the
Holding Company Act under this rule change their status, secure an
exemption on some other basis or register as a holding company under
that Act, certain transactions, including the sale of any security,
are unlawful.
The rescission of Rule 9 is further discussed on
page 143 of this report.
Modification of Rule 28

Early in 1960 the Commission promulgated a statement of administrative policy regarding the balance sheet treatment of the credit
equivalent to the reduction in income taxes arising from deferred tax

presumed by the Commission to be misleading or inaccurate despite
disclosure contained in the certificate of the accountant or in footnotes
to the financial statements, provided the amounts involved are material. The Commission also modified Rule 28 under the Holding Company Act so as to conform the language of that rule with the policy announced in the statement of administrative policy." Rule 28 provided,
in pertinent part, that no registered holding company or subsidiary
thereof could publish financial statements inconsistent with its book
accounts. The rule as modified provides, in effect, that a registered
holding company or subsidiary thereof need not conform its published
financial statements with its book accounts where such deviation is
authorized or required by the Commission by rule, regulation, order,
statement of administrative policy or otherwise.
Interpretation

or Rule 50

During 1959 the Commission gave consideration to its existing
procedure with respect to exceptions from the competitive bidding
requirements of Rule 50 under the Holding Company Act. At that
time a registered holding company or a subsidiary thereof planning
to apply for such an exception could request, by letter, authorization to
negotiate the price and interest or dividend rate as well as other terms
of any security contemplated to be sold pursuant to that Act. Such
letters were sent prior to a formal application for exception from the
competitive bidding rule and were not public. By letter dated September 18, 1959, the Commission advised the chief executive officer of
each registered holding-company system that any request for authorization to enter into such negotiations would thereafter have to be made
by formal public application and that the Commission would issue a
notice giving interested persons an opportunity to be heard thereon
and might order a hearing on its own motion. This change in the
practice of administering Rule 50 is further discussed on page 146
of this report.
Withdrawal or Proposed Revision or Rule 70

On December 8, 1953, the Commission gave notice that it had under
consideration a proposal to revise Rule 70.28 This rule governs the
connections with financial institutions of officers and directors of
registered holding companies and subsidiary companies thereof.
Since 1953 the Commission has amended this rule three times so as to
broaden the exceptions in certain aspects and in view of such action

THE

INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

Adoption oC Rule 3c-2

Section 3 (c) (1) of the Act excepts from its operation any issuer
which is not making and does not propose to make a public offering
of its securities and whose outstanding securities are beneficially
owned by not more than one hundred persons and further provides
that beneficial owership by a company shall be deemed beneficial
ownership by one person, with the exception that if such company
owns 10 per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of
the issuer, the beneficial ownership of the issuer shall be deemed to be
that of the holders of such company's outstanding securities.
The Commission during the fiscal year adopted a rule which provides that for the purpose of section 3 (c) (1) of the Act, beneficial
ownership by a company owning 10 per centum or more of the outstanding voting securities of a small business investment company
licensed or proposed to be licensed under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 shall be deemed to be beneficial ownership by one
person notwithstanding that such company owning such securities has
more than one stockholder, if the value of all securities of small business investment companies owned by such company does not exceed
5 percent of the value of its total assets." The rule also would deem
beneficial ownership by a company to be beneficial ownership by one
person if the owner is a statewide development corporation created by
or pursuant to an act of a State legislature to promote and assist
growth and development of the economy of the State, provided that
such State development corporation itself is not, or would not become
as a result of its investment, an investment company.
Adoption of Rule 14a-l

Section .l4(a) provides that no registered investment company and
no principal underwriter for such a company, shall make a public
offering of securities of which such company is the issuer, unless it
has a net worth of not less than $100,000 or unless provision is made
in connection with and as a condition of the registration of such
securities under the Securities Act of 1933 which in the opinion of
the Commission adequately insures (A) that after the effective date
of such registration statement such company will not issue any security
or receive any proceeds of any subscription for any security until firm

agreements have been made with such company by not more than
twenty-five responsible persons to purchase from it securities to be
issued by it for an aggregate net amount which amount plus the then
net worth of the company, if any, will equal at least $100,000; (B) that
said aggregate net amount will be paid in to such company before any
subscriptions for such securities will be accepted from any persons in
excess of twenty-five; (C) that arrangements will be made whereby
any proceeds so paid in, as well as any sales load, will be refunded to
any subscriber on demand without any deduction, in the event that the
Bet proceeds so received by the company do not result in the company
having a net worth of at least $100,000 within ninety days after such
registration statement becomes effective.
The Commission adopted a rule during the fiscal year which provides that, for the purpose of Section 14(a) of the Act, notification
under Rule 604 of Regulation E under the Securities Act of 1933 is
deemed registration under that Act." Before the adoption of such
rule an investment company could comply with the provisions of this
section of the Act only in connection with registration as required
by the Securities Act of 1933. Regulation E promulgated under the
Securities Act of 1933 provides, however, that securities issued by any
small business investment company operating under the Small Business Investment Act of 1958 which is registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 shall be exempt from registration under the
Securities Act of 1933 (subject to certain exceptions and qualifications
set out in that regulation which, among other things, limits the exemption to an offering by an issuer that does not exceed $300,000). Rule
604 under this Regulation provides for filing of a Notification with
the Commission in lieu of full registration under the Securities Act of
1933.
Amendment of Rule 20a-l;

Adoption of Rules 20a-2 and 20a-3

Section 20(a) of the Investment. Company Act of 1940 makes it
unlawful to solicit any proxy, consent or authorization in respect of
any security of which any registered investment company is the issuer
in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may
prescribe. Rule 20a-1 makes applicable to such solicitations the Commission's proxy rules adopted under Section 14(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. Developments in the investment-company
field indicated that disclosures required for investment companies
by the proxy rules, particularly with reference to the investment
adviser and his relationship to, and his dealings with, the investment
company, were inadequate. In order to obtain better disclosure, the

some person other than the management of the investment company,
then the investment adviser or prospective investment adviser and its
affiliated persons must furnish to the person making the solicitation the
information necessary to enable such person to comply with the applicable requirements.
The new Ru1e 20a-2 requires that a proxy statement relating to a
registered investment company must contain certain information in
addition to that required by the proxy rules under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Where the solicitation relates to the election of
directors of the investment company, information is required in regard
to matters such as the investment advisory contract, ownership and
control of the investment adviser, interests of the management of the
investment company in the investment adviser or persons in a control
relationship with it and transactions by certain persons in securities
of the investment adviser or its parents. Except where the investment adviser is a bank, a balance sheet of the investment adviser must
also be included, unless the Commission, for good cause shown, permits
the omission of such balance sheet. Certain information is also required with respect to interests and relationships between the investment company or the investment adviser and the underwriter of the
investment company's securities. Where action is to be taken with
respect to an investment advisory contract, information must also be
included with respect to such contract and with respect to certain
collateral arrangements or understandings
made in connection
therewith.
The new Rule 20a-3 calls for the disclosure in a proxy statement
relating to an investment company of information with respect to
the material interests of officers, directors and nominees for election
as a director of the investment company in material transactions,
actual or proposed, to which the investment adviser or any of its
parents or subsidiaries was or is to be a party. However, instructions
to this requirement permit the omission of information in regard to
interests of security holders as such and affiliated persons of the in.. Investment

or operations of the investment company and to which neither the
investment company nor any of its parents or subsidiaries is a party.
The instructions further provide that the proportionate interest of a
partner in transactions with the partnership need not be disclosed.
Adoption of Annual Report Form N-5R

Small business investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 are required by Section 30 (a) of that
Act to file annual reports with the Commission. Any such company
which has securities listed and registered on a national securities
exchange or which has registered or outstanding a certain amount of
securities under the Securities Act of 1933 is required to file similar
annual reports pursuant to Section 13 or 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. During the fiscal year the Commission invited
views and comments on a proposed Form N-5R which would be used
for annual reports filed by small business investment companies pursuant to both of the above-mentioned Acts." The proposed form,
which was adopted after the close of the fiscal year,34is a combination
form which enables a small business investment company to file with
the Commission a single annual report which meets all of the above
mentioned annual reporting requirements. This form permits such
companies to meet the Commission's requirements as to financial statements by filing copies of the company's annual financial report to the
Small Business Administration pursuant to the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

The Securities Act of 1933 is primarily a disclosure statute designed
to provide investors with material facts concerning securities publicly
offered for sale by use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit or other fraudulent
practices in the sale of securities. The issuer of such securities is
required to file with the Commission a registration statement and related prospectus containing significant information about the issuer
and the offering. These documents are available for public inspection
as soon as they are filed. The registration statement must become
"effective" before the securities may be sold to the public. In addition,
the prospectus must be furnished to the purchaser at or before the
making of any written offering or before the sale or delivery of the
security. The registrant and the underwriter are responsible for the
contents of the registration statement. The Commission has no authority to control the nature or quality of a security to be offered for
public sale or to pass upon its merits or the terms of its distribution.
Its action in permitting a registration statement to become effective
does not constitute approval of the securities, and any representation
to a prospective purchaser of securities to the contrary is made unlawful by Section 23 of the Act.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Registration Statement and Prospectus

Registration of securities under the Act is effected by filing with
the Commission a registration statement on the applicable form containing the prescribed disclosure. When a registration statement relates, generally speaking, to a security issued by a corporation or other
private issuer, it must contain the information, and be accompanied by
the documents specified in Schedule A of the Act; when it relates to a
security issued by a foreign government, the material specified in
Schedule B must be supplied. Both schedules specify in considerable
detail the disclosure which should be made available to an investor
in order that he may make an informed decision whether to buy the
security. In addition, the Act provides flexibility in its administra29

30

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tion by empowering the Commission to classify issues, issuers and
prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase, or in
certain instances vary or diminish, the particular items of information
required to be disclosed in the registration statement, as the Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the protection
of investors.
In general the registration statement of an issuer other than a foreign government must describe such matters as the names of persons
who participate in the direction, management or control of the issuer's
business; their security holdings and remuneration and the options or
bonus and profit-sharing privileges alloted to them; the character
and size of the business enterprise, its capital structure, past history
and earnings and its financial statements, certified by independent accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to promoters made
within two years or intended to be made; acquisitions of property not
in the ordinary course of business, and the interest of directors, officers
and principal stockholders therein; pending or threatened legal proceedings; and the purpose to which the proceeds of the offering are to
be applied. The prospectus constitutes a part of the registration statement and presents the more important of the required disclosures.
Examination Procedure

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines each
registration statement for compliance with the standards of accurate
and full disclosure and usually notifies the registrant by an informal
letter of comment of any material respects in which the statement
appears to fail to conform to those requirements. The registrant is
thus afforded an opportunity to file a curative amendment. In addition, the Commission has power, after notice and opportunity for
hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration
statement. In certain cases, such as where a registration statement
is so deficient as to indicate a willful or negligent failure to make adequate disclosure, no letter of comment is sent and the Commission
either institutes an investigation to determine whether stop-order proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes stop-order proceedings. Information about the use of this "stop-order" power during 1960 appears below under "Stop Order Proceedings."
Time Required To Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important
to industry, the Commission completes its analysis in the shortest possible time. The Act provides that a registration statement shall become effective on the 20th day after it is filed on or the 20th day after

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

31

the filing of any amendment thereto. This waiting period is designed
to provide investors with an opportunity to become familiar with the
proposed offering. Information disclosed in the registration statement is disseminated during the waiting period through distribution
of the preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission is empowered to accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period where the facts justify such action. In exercising this
power, the Commission is required to take into account the adequacy
of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the
public, the facility with which investors can understand the nature
of and the rights conferred by the securities to be registered, and their
relationship to the capital structure of the issuer, and the public interest and the protection of investors. The note to Rule 460 under
the Act indicates, for the information of interested persons, some of
the more common situations in which the Commission feels that the
statute generally requires it to deny acceleration of the effective date
of a registration statement.
The number of calendar days which elapsed from the date of the
original filing to the effective date of registration for the median
(average) registration statement with respect to the 1,2751 registration statements that became effective during the 1960 fiscal year was
43, compared with 28 days for 925 registration statements in fiscal year
1959 and 24 days for 685 registration statements in fiscal year 1958.
The increase in the elapsed time has been due primarily to the cumulative effect of the unprecedented volume of registration statements
filed, particularly those filed by issuers that had never before filed
under the Act, and the lack of a sufficient number of examining personnel to process such a volume. The number of registration statements filed during fiscal year 1960 was 1,628, as compared with 1,226
and 913 in fiscal years 1959 and 1958,respectively,"
The following table shows by months during the 1960 fiscal year
the number of calendar days for the registration median statement
during each of the three principal stages of the registration process, the
total elapsed time and the number of registration statements effective.
1Excludes
the 157 registration statements of mutual fund companies that became
effective during fiscal year 1960 that were filed pursuant to the provisions of Section 24(e)
of the Investment Company Act of 1940. The total elapsed time on these 157 registration statements was 31 calendar days for the average registration statement.
• These figures include 159, 153 and 134 for fiscal years 1960, 1959, and 1958, respectively, registration statements filed by mutual fund companies pursuant to the provisions
of Section 24(e) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.

VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

The 1,398 statements in the amount of $14.4 billion constitute an
unprecedented number of registrations which became fully effective
under the Securities Act during fiscal year 1960. This is an increase
of one-third over the 1,055 effective registrations :for the previous
year and almost two-thirds more than the previous high of 860 registrations in fiscal year 1957. Reflecting a large increase in the registration of smaller issues, the volume of $14.4 billion for fiscal year
1960 represented an 8 percent decrease :from the $15.7 billion of securities fully effective in fiscal year 1959 and a 13 percent decrease from the
record $16.5 billion for fiscal year 1958. The chart on page 33 shows
the number and dollar amount of :fully effective registrations :from
1935to 1960.
These figures cover all registrations which became fully effective,
including new issues sold for cash by the issuer, secondary distributions and securities registered for other than cash sale, such as exchange transactions, issues reserved for conversion and issues reserved
for options.
Of the dollar amount of securities registered in 1960,75.9 percent
was for the account of issuers :for cash sale, 16.8 percent for account
of issuers for other than cash sale and 7.3 percent was for the account
of others, as shown below.

The indicated decrease in the value of securities to be sold for cash
for account of the issuer results from a decrease of $1.0 billion (20
percent) in the volume of debt securities and a decrease of almost $200
million in the volume of preferred stock. Debt securities made up
$4.2 billion of the 1960 volume, preferred stock $250 million and common stock $6.4 billion. Two thirds of the common stock was registered by investment companies.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The number of statements, total amounts registered, and a classification by type of security for issues to be sold for cash for account
of the issuing company is shown for each of the fiscal years 1935
through 1960in appendix table 1. More detailed information for 1960
is given in appendix table 2.
Securities registered by investment companies amounted to $4.4
billion, an increase of $100 million over the amount for fiscal 1959,
comprising 40 percent of the total amount registered for cash sale
for the account of issuers in fiscal 1960. Other financial and rea]
estate securities, including employee stock purchase plans, increased
to $1.4 billion, 50 percent above the previous year, while securities
of manufacturing companies amounted to only $930 million, less than
half of the amount for fiscal 1959. A classification by industry is
shown below for securities registered for cash sale for account of
issuers in each of the last three fiscal years.

STATEMENTS

FILED

Although the number of registration statements filed in the 1960
fiscal year increased over the number filed in fiscal 1959 from 1,226
to 1,628, the dollar amount decreased from $16,622,890,371 to
$15,816,563,52l.
Of the 1,628 registration statements filed in the 1960 fiscal year,
774, or 47.5 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously
filed registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933. Comparable figures for the 1959 and 1958 fiscal years were 472, or 39
percent, and 254, or 28 percent, respectively.
A cumulative total of 17,558 registration statements has been filed
under the Act by 8,171 different issuers covering proposed offerings
of securities aggregating over $183 billion from the effective date
of the Securities Act of 1933 to J nne 30, 1960.

STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS

Section 8 (d) provides that, if it appears to the Commission at any
time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or pecessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
the Commission may institute proceedings looking to the issuance of
a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.
Where such an order is issued, the offering cannot lawfully be made,
or continued if it has already begun, until the registration statement
has been amended to cure the deficiencies and the Commission has lifted the stop order.
The following table indicates the number of proceedings under
Section 8(d) of the Act pending at the beginning of the 1960 fiscal

stated that the purpose of the offering was to.obtain funds with which
to develop, manufacture and sell aircraft designed by Vincent J.
Burnelli embodying a "body lift" principle.
After the institution of proceedings pursuant to Section 8 (d) of
the Securities Act, the registrant admitted that the registration statement was materially deficient and consented to the entry of a stop
order. The Commission found that the registration statement was
materially incorrect and misleading and issued a stop order suspending its effectiveness.'
The prospectus, which is part of the registration statement, stated
that the "lifting body principle" involved in the design of registrant's
Loadmaster aircraft, wherein lift is developed by the airfoil shape of
the fuselage, was established to Burnelli's satisfaction by the construction between 1920 and 1946 of seven airplanes employing this principle. The prospectus further represented that registrant planned to
seek contracts for the development, manufacture and sale of the Loadmaster with the Armed Forces or with any other person, firm or Government agency, "although it has no assurance that it will be successful
in so doing," and that the Loadmaster offers the possibility of increased pay-load at decreased operating costs because of its design,
''the potential of which has never been fully explored by the present
aircraft industry, the military or other possible users of the aircraft."
It enumerates in some detail nine proposals for contracts with the
armed services which it states registrant intended to present.
The Commission found these and other representations in the
registration statement relating to the consideration given to the
Burnelli design by the aircraft industry and military and other users
of aircraft, and to the procurement of military contracts, to be inaccurate or misleading. In particular, it found misleading the failure
to disclose the lack of success of repeated attempts to have planes embodying the Burnelli design produced and marketed for military or
commercial use.
The description of registrant's business in the prospectus was also
found to be deficient in other respects. The statements in the prospectus with regard to the increased pay-load and decreased operating
costs of the Loadmaster were misleading in view of the lack of any
operational experience to support such statements, and the prospectus
was misleading in failing to disclose that claimed advantages of the
design of the Loadmaster are for the most part conjectural, that the
design possesses disadvantages which may have caused its rejection
by past potential users, that the Loadmaster has never been flown with

R-2800 engines and that performance characteristics set forth in the
prospectus based on specifications including such engines are speculative in this respect, that the estimates of the cost of manufacture of
the Loadmaster II are not based on any experience, and the statement
made that the plane can profitably be sold at less than $450,000 was
completely speculative.
The Commission also found the prospectus to be deficient or misleading in various other respects; for example, in its failure accurately
to describe the registrant's competitive position, to disclose adequately
the proposed use of the proceeds from the offering and to include in
the forepart of the prospectus a summarization of the speculative
factors affecting the registrant's securities. Moreover, the financial
statements included in the registration statement were not prepared
and certified according with the applicable requirements and the
registrant failed to include certain other necessary financial statements.

this corporation for the purpose of registering (a) 300,000 shares

underwriter of the 300,000-share public offering; (c) three-year purchase warrants for 200,000 shares of common stock exercisable at $1.50
per share to be delivered to the underwriter; and (d) 200,000 shares of
common stock underlying the warrants. Registration of the securities
would have permitted the underwriter and Grocoff, on their own
behalf, to acquire from the registrant and sell to the public 225,000
shares of registrant's common stock after the completion of the public
distribution on behalf of the registrant.
In addition, the underwriter
was to receive a commission of 20 percent of the gross proceeds of the
public sale of 300,000 shares and $25,000 in cash for expenses, a total
of $85,000 or more than 28 percent of the gross proceeds.
After investigation and following a hearing held pursuant to the
provisions of Section 8 (d) of the Securities Act, the Commission
found that the registration statement was materially false and misleading and issued a stop order suspending its effectiveness."
The registration statement, among other things, failed to disclose
that Grocoff played an important part in causing registrant to be
organized and in formulating its financing proposal, served as its
president until shortly before the statement was filed, kept registrant's
books and records, and received and exercised authority to co-sign all
checks drawn on registrant's bank account. In addition, the Commission found that of the 316,500 shares of registrant's stock issued and
outstanding at the filing of the registration statement, 291,500 had
• Securities Act Release No. 4159 (November 30, 1959).

been sold in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities
Act, which fact and the resulting balance sheet entries were not set
forth in the prospectus.
Central Oils Incorporated.- The registrant, an Oregon corporation, was organized in September 1956 to explore for oil and gas on
properties which were acquired from its promoters, A. R. Morris and
H. C. Evans, who with one other person constituted the entire personnel of the registrant. The properties were represented to be located
on the Hay Creek Anticline in Jefferson County, Oregon. The registrant filed a registration statement on July 30, 1958 proposing a public
offering of 1,000,000 shares of 10 cent par value common stock (increased to 3,000,000 shares by amendment dated September 2, 1958) to
be offered at the par value. The Commission instituted stop order
proceedings with respect to the registration statement in October 1958.
A stipulation of facts was entered into by counsel for the registrant
in which the registrant admitted the material deficiencies alleged in
the Statement of Matters and consented to the entry of a stop order.
Among the material deficiencies found to exist are those described
below:
The description of the properties failed to disclose known geological
data indicating the unlikelihood of oil and gas being found in commercial quantities; that the location of the proposed test well, chosen
without benefit of favorable scientific information, is hundreds of
miles from commercial production; that the area is covered with or
underlain with igneous rock formations consisting of lava flow or
basalt intrusions and that the presence of such formations is such an
unfavorable factor as to preclude surface determination of geologic
structure, and that maps provided by the registrant failed to substantiate the representation that the proposed drilling site was on the
Hay Creek Anticline formation. Although the registration statement
disclosed that five dry holes had been drilled in the area, adverse information concerning the area obtained thereby was omitted.
The prospectus included a geological report recommending exploratory drilling. The report contained a misleading favorable comparison
between the Central Oregon basin where the registrant's properties
are located and the oil fields of California in that it failed to state
that while the California formations are highly productive the Central
Oregon basin has never yielded oil in commercial quantities. The
report further stated that results obtained from a study of drilled samples which the registrant had obtained from a dry hole already drilled
in the area were very encouraging although in fact the samples afforded little basis for encouragement.

The Commission also found the registration statement to be misleading in failing to set forth concisely in the forepart of the prospectus the speculative features of the offering; that the offering price
was arbitrarily determined; that there is no assurance that the shares
would be sold; that as a result of promotional transactions the book
equity per share would be substantially less than the 10 cents offering
price and that should the registrant be liquidated the promoters by
virtue of their proportionally large holdings of stock would receive
a substantial portion of the funds paid in by the public.
Other material deficiencies included the failure to disclose that the
promoters held oil and gas leases in area contiguous to the registrant's
leases and would personally benefit without cost to themselves should
exploration of the registrant's properties prove successful; that two
Regulation A suspension orders suspending the effectiveness of two
prior proposed offerings of the registrant's securities had become permanent and that in addition to the States of Texas, Arizona, and Tllinois, the State of Washington also had issued a cease and desist order
prohibiting the registrant from selling its securities within the State.
The registration statement was filed on an incorrect form, failed to
include required copies of a certain escrow agreement and failed to
include an opinion of counsel as to the legality of the proposed issue.
.A. stop order was issued. e
Hinsdale Raceway, Inc.-The company was incorporated in the
State of New Hampshire in April 1958 for the purpose of operating a
harness racing track including restaurants and food stands to be
operated at the track in Hinsdale, New Hampshire.
In October 1958, a complaint was filed by the Commission seeking
to enjoin the registrant and certain individuals from further offers
and sales of registrant's securities in violation of the Securities Act
of 1933. The Company and its officers and directors consented to the
entry of a decree permanently enjoining them from further violations
of the Act.
Subsequently the company filed a registration statement covering a
proposed public offering of 1 million shares of Capital Trust Certificates with 1 million shares of underlying $1 par value common stock
and $1 million of 6 percent Debentures.
In April 1959, the Commission instituted a proceeding to determine
whether a stop order should issue. Prior to the commencement of the
hearing, the registrant entered into a stipulation of facts, waived a
hearing and all post-hearing procedures and admitted that the registration statement contained, untrue statements of material facts and
omitted to state material facts necessary to make the statements made

therein not misleading. Among other matters, it was stipulated that
the following facts were not disclosed in the registration statement:
that the registrant had suffered a loss of over $44,600 during prior
operations; that there was no firm commitment for the purchase of the
proposed securities j that a previous distribution of registrant's unregistered stock had been enjoined and that the registrant was contingently liable under the Securities Act for such sales; that the management intends to retain control of the registrant by placing all capital
stock in a voting trust for 10 years to be controlled by the voting
trustees who are also officers and directors of the registrant; that
none of the management had ever had any experience in race track
management; that the registrant is committed to a 20-year management contract extendable for an additional 20 years at the option of
the management group; that said contract provides a commission of
1 percent of the gross parimutuel handle (i.e. total amount bet) plus
a fee of not more than $50,000 for the management group; that substantially all risk capital was to be provided by the public; that the
promoters have been granted options to purchase 300,000 shares of
registrant's stock; that the registrant omitted under "Earnings" and
"Earned Surplus" (deficit) $22,302.00payable under the management
contract; and that the registrant failed to disclose a note payable in
the amount of $94,021.04 to Sportservice Corporation. In addition
the registrant made materially misleading statements and omissions
regarding the estimated gross handle and net earnings; the cost of
necessary facilities and the amount already expended; the interest
rates, repayment provisions, restrictions and other conditions of the
mortgages, liens and other encumbrances; the amount, use and order
of expenditures of proceeds from the sale of the proposed registration; the type of construction, capacity and the size of the track; the
number of days of proposed operation during the racing season; and
the distance from urban areas and the extent, type and location of
competition. Moreover, the financial statements were misleading in
omitting to disclose certain of the above facts.
In addition to the above, the prospectus failed to furnish adequate
information concerning the securities to be offered, the method of
distribution, the amount of securities being registered and the amount
proposed to be offered to the public. It also failed to disclose that the
debentures proposed to be offered were to mature in ten years and
that no indenture covering the debentures had been filed in compliance
with the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
Based on the facts set forth in the stipulation the Commission
issued a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration
statement/
Thereafter the registrant filed two material amendments

to conform with the order and to furnish up-to-date information and
the registration statement as amended, was declared effective.
Minerals Consolidated, Inc.-The
registration statement filed by
this Nevada corporation sought to register 1,100,000 shares of common
stock, and warrants to purchase 2 million shares of common stock at
$1 per share. The securities (except 100,000 shares of common stock)
were proposed to be offered for sale to the public in units consisting
of one share of common stock and a warrant to purchase two additional
shares at a price of $1 per unit. The remaining 100,000 shares of common stock were proposed to be offered for sale to the public without
warrants at $1 per share after completion of the unit offering. The
proceeds of the unit offering were to accrue to the corporation, but
the proceeds of the sale of the remaining 100,000 shares were to be
paid to two of the promoters individually.
After a hearing held pursuant to the provisions of Section 8 (d)
of the Securities Act, the Commission found the registration statement
to be deficient and materially misleading and issued a stop order,"
The Commission found that the prospectus included in the registration statement failed to meet the statutory standard of disclosure
requiring that material facts be presented in such a manner that their
significance is readily understandable.
Here, information relating to
a single subject matter was scattered confusingly throughout various
sections of the prospectus with the result that the ordinary investor
would have difficulty in ascertaining the essential elements of the corporation's business and the merits of the proposed offering; and the
prospectus failed to set forth in summary fashion in one place, under
an appropriate heading, an informative statement of the speculative
features of the registrant's business and property and its proposed
use of the proceeds of the offering. Among the principal facts such
a summary statement should have disclosed are that the registrant
was a recently organized company with limited operating experience,
the registrant's mining properties had no known deposits of commercially mineable ore, the aggregate amount of funds proposed to be
raised by the sale of securities to the public was far in excess of the
needs of any existing activity or program of the registrant and it had
no specific plans for the use of more than half of the net proceeds of
the offering.
The Commission also found that the prospectus failed to state
material facts concerning transactions between the registrant and its
promoters, officers and directors, including the cost to said persons
of properties sold by them to the registrant, their stock ownership
in the registrant, and the things of value received and to be received
by them from the registrant.

In addition, the Commission found that the registration statement
failed to make adequate disclosure of facts required to be stated or
otherwise failed to comply with provisions of the form for registration with respect to eleven other matters. For example, the prospectus stated that certain legal proceedings were pending, but did not
adequately identify the defendants nor describe the basis of the actions
and the possible consequences to the registrant; and no disclosure
was made of the fact that the geologist whose report was referred to
in the prospectus was an employee of the registrant at the time he
prepared his geological report.
Sports Arenas (Delaware) Inc.-Sports
Arenas (Delaware) Inc.,
a Delaware corporation was organized in September 1957 and through
wholly owned subsidiaries engaged in the operation and management
of bowling alleys. It filed a registration statement covering a proposed offering by stockholders of 461,950 shares of common stock,
1 cent par value, at the market price of the stock but not less than
$6.00 per share, and a proposed offering by registrant of $2 million
of 6 percent, 10-year convertible debentures at their face value and
250,000 shares of common stock reserved for conversion of such
debentures.
The Commission instituted proceedings under Section 8(d) of the
Securities Act to determine whether a stop order should issue suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement. The registrant
entered into a stipulation in which it admitted, for the purpose of the
proceeding, that the registration statement contained untrue and
misleading statements of material facts and omitted material facts
required to be stated therein and consented to the entry of a stop
order. In the light of the numerous material deficiencies in the
registration statement, a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
registration statement was issued."
The registration statement failed to disclose that certain prior
distributions of stock by the registrant were made in violation of the
registration requirements of Section 5 of the Act and that fact should
ha ve been disclosed in the registration statement together with the
disclosure of the registrant's contingent liabilities in connection with
such distributions. The registration statement also failed to disclose
that certain transactions purportedly made at arm'S-length with persons not connected with the registrant were in fact made with persons
who were associated with the controlling stockholder of the registrant.
The registration statement also failed to disclose the existence of
control of the registrant by certain persons and the interests of the
• Securities Act Release No. 4153 (October 23,1959).

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

management and other "insiders" in certain transactions with the
registrant.
The registration statement was also deficient in numerous other
respects including the failure to make accurate and complete disclosure with respect to the use of the proceeds from the proposed
offering, to make a statement summarizing the speculative factors
applicable to the registrant and its securities and to furnish financial
statements certified by an independent public accountant as required
by the applicable rules. In the latter connection, it was found that
the employee of the firm who was in charge of the audit of the registrant's books had purchased stock of the registrant for himself or
members of his family and could not therefore be regarded as independent.
Strategic Minerals Corporation of America.- The registrant was
organized under the laws of Delaware in 1955 for the purpose of developing and using a process, known as the Bruce Williams Process,
for the beneficiation of low-grade ores. The registrant proposed to
use such process to beneficiate low-grade manganese ores. It filed a
registration statement covering a proposed offering of $1 million principal amount of 6 percent first mortgage bonds at a price of 95 percent
of the principal amount and 1,200,000shares of common stock at $3.00
per share. After the Commission instituted proceedings pursuant to
Section 8(d) of the Act, the registrant entered into a stipulation of
facts with our Division of Corporation Finance and consented to the
entry of a stop order."
Among the deficiencies constituting the grounds for the issuance of
the Commission's stop order were: (1) representations that the registrant's proposed production facilities were planned to be located near
manganese ore deposits, and stockpiles owned by the United States
Government, in Texas, Arkansas, Arizona, and New Mexico, without
disclosing that registrant had no assurance of obtaining any ores
owned by the government for beneficiation, and that it had no assured
source of raw materials and had not examined any stockpiles, mines
or mining properties with a view to locating potential sources of raw
material for its proposed plants; (2) representations concerning costs
of constructing plant facilities and operating cost estimates, which the
registrant conceded were inadequate and misleading; (3) the failure
to disclose that the registrant had not conducted any market survey
to determine whether any user of manganese ores would be interested
in purchasing its upgraded produce; (4) the failure to disclose the
current world price of manganese ores, and that on the basis of available information and present world prices for manganese, the Bruce

Williams Process is not economically feasible; (5) the failure to disclose that there was no market justification at that time for the construction of any beneficiating plants to upgrade manganese ores; and
(6) the failure to disclose in a summary fashion in one place in the
early part of the prospectus under an appropriate heading the speculative features of the registrant's business and securities.
The
Commission also found deficiencies, among others, with respect to the
disclosures contained in the financial statements, and representations
concerning the use of proceeds, securities proposed to be offered and the
amount of securities outstanding, compensation to be paid to the
underwriter and the underwriter's relationship to the registrant and
the debt securities covered by the registration statement.
EXAMINATIONS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by Section 8 (e) of the Act to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding

EXEMPTION

AND EXCHANGE COMMLSSION

FROM REGISTRATION

OF SMALL ISSUES

Under Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, the Commission is empowered to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such
terms and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities
from registration under the Act, if it finds that the enforcement of the
registration provisions of the Act with respect to such securities is not
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by
reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of
$300,000 upon the size of the issues which may be exempted by the
Commission in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority the Commission has adopted the following exemptive regulations:
Regulation A:
General exemption for United States and Canadian issues up to $300,000.
Regulation A-R:
Special exemption for first lien notes up to $100,000.
Regulation B:
Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights up to
$100,000.
Regulation F:
Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for assessable stock
offered or sold to realize amount of assessment thereon, up to
$300,OOO.u

Under Section 3 (c) of the Securities Act, which was added by Section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the
Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting
securities issued by a company which is operating or proposes to operate as a small business investment company under the Small Business
Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this- authority, the Commission
has adopted a Regulation E which exempts upon certain terms and
conditions limited amounts of securities issued by any small business
investment company which is registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This regulation is substantially similar to the one
provided by Regulation A adopted under Section 3 (b) of the Act.
Exemption from registration under Section 3 (b) or 3 (c) of the
Act does not carry any exemption from the civil liabilities for false
and misleading statements imposed upon any person by Section 12(2)
or from the criminal liabilities for fraud imposed upon any person
by Section 17 of the Act.
Exempt Offerings under Regulation A

public, securities not in excess of $300,000 in anyone year without
registration, if the company complies with the regulation. Upon complying with the regulation a company is exempt from the registration
provisions of the Act. A Regulation A filing consists of a notification
supplying basic information about the company, certain exhibits and
an offering circular which is required to be used in offering the securities. However, in the case of a company with an earnings history
which is making an offering not in excess of $50,000, an offering circular need not be used. A notification is filed with the regional office of
the Commission for the region in which the company has its principal
place of business.
During the 1960 fiscal year, 1049 notifications were filed under
Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $224,913,982, compared
with 854 notifications covering proposed offerings of $170,241,400 in
the 1959 fiscal year. Included in the 1960 total were 38 notifications
covering stock offerings of $9,412,523 with respect to companies engaged in the exploratory oil and gas business and 37 notifications
covering offerings of $7,428,391 by mining companies.

Most of the offerings which were underwritten were made by commercial underwriters, who participated in 398 offerings in 1960, 251
offerings in 1959, and 185 offerings in 1958. The remaining cases
where commissions were paid were handled by officers, directors, or
other persons not regularly engaged in the securities business.
Suspension of Exemption

Regulation A provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, the exemption is sought for securities for

which the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is
not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation
or in accordance with prescribed disclosure standards. Following the
issuance of a temporary suspension order by the Commission, the
respondents may request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension should be vacated or made permanent. If no hearing is requested within 30 days after the entry of the temporary
suspension order and none is ordered by the Commission on its own
motion, the temporary suspension order becomespermanent.
During the 1960 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders were
issued in 75 cases as compared with 87 cases in the 1959 fiscal year.
Of the 75 orders, five were later vacated. Requests for hearing were
made in 15 cases. In six of such cases the requests were later withdrawn; in one such case the suspension order was vacated; and as of
June 30, 1960, the proceedings in the remaining eight cases were still
pending.
Fifteen cases were pending as of June 30,1959, in which a hearing
was requested after a temporary suspension order had been issued.
Subsequently, in one of such cases the issuer withdrew its hearing
request and consented to the entry of permanent suspension order;
in five cases permanent suspension orders were entered by the Commission after hearings; and in one case the Commission vacated the
suspension order. The remaining eight cases were still pending on
June 30, 1960,making a total of 16 cases pending as of that date as to
which hearings have been requested.
Certain of the above cases are summarized below to illustrate the
misrepresentations and other noncompliance with the regulation
which led to the issuance of suspension orders.
American Reserve Life Insurance Company.-This
company
mailed to prospective investors a four-page brochure entitled
"Through Investments in Good Life Insurance Stock Your Money
Can Earn Money For You." The brochure was not filed with the
Commission. The Commission found that it constituted sales material used in connection with the offering which was required by
Regulation A to be filed with the Commission prior to its use. In
addition, the brochure failed to state material facts necessary in order
to make the statements made therein not misleading, particularly
statements concerning the profits and investment return of stocks of
other insurance companies and their relationship to the profits and
investment return of the stock of American Reserve. The Commission
found that under the circumstances the offer of American Reserve
stock was, and its continued offering would be, in violation of Section
17 of the Act. The Commission also found that American Reserve

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

49

offered its stock in Idaho and Maryland which were not listed in its
notification among the jurisdictions in which the stock was to be
offered. Regulation A provides that the offering shan not be made in
any jurisdiction not so listed until the Commission has been notified
of the issuer's intention to offer the securities in the additional jurisdiction or jurisdictions.
The Commission concluded that a permanent suspension order
should be entered."
Arizona Aviation and Missile Corporation.-The
issuer is an Arizona corporation formed in 1957 for the purpose of developing and
manufacturing safety and electronic components for aircrafts and
missiles. At the time of the issuer's offering under Regulation A, it
had engaged in manufacturing only three items: a curtain rod, a machine for soldering electrical circuits and an electrical display lighting
device.
The issuer delivered to the underwriter for use in the offering copies
of a reprint from a technical magazine, the use of which implied that
the issuer was active in the field of aviation safety design. This
reprint was not filed with the Commission as required by Regulation
A. In addition, the issuer sponsored, and its president participated
in, two television programs designed to further the sale of the issuer's
stock. The issuer also failed to file copies of the scripts of these
programs with the Commission as required by Regulation A.
In order to publicize and further the offering and sale of its stock
the issuer caused to be published in a newspaper an article purporting
to describe the issuer's business. This article contained misleading
statements and included a photograph which was misleading in that
it purported to show the operations of the issuer but in fact showed
those of another company.
In view of the issuer's failure to comply with the terms and conditions of the regulation the Commission entered an order permanently
suspending the exemption."
Condor Petroleum Co., Inc.-This
corporation, a Delaware corporation, was organized in July 1957 for the purpose of exploring,
developing and drilling for oil on certain properties located primarily
in California. In its notification filed under Regulation A, the issuer
named as an underwriter a firm which was not qualified to so act because it had been enjoined in a suit brought by the Commission for
violation of the Commission's net capital rule. When this fact was
brought to the issuer's attention, the underwriting contract was cancelled and another underwriting contract was entered into with an'. Securities Act Release No. 4200, (March 29, 1960).

other firm. This latter firm then entered into a sales contract with the
first named underwriter under which it was agreed that that firm
would be allowed certain commissions on all shares that it might sell
and a substantial share of the expense money which the issuer agreed
to pay in connection with the offering. No amendment to the notification or offering circular was filed to disclose this agreement.
In the suspension proceedings under Regulation A the Commission
found that the terms and conditions of the regulation had not been
met for the reason that the first underwriter named was not qualified
to act as such, the second underwriter named was not the real underwriter and the real underwriter being subject to an injunction was
not qualified to act.
The Commission found that the statements in the notification and
offering circular with respect to the identity of the underwriter were
false and misleading. The Commission also found, upon the basis
of evidence produced in the proceedings, that the underwriter had
failed to deliver a copy of the offering circular to purchasers of the
securities as required by Regulation A.
In view of the foregoing, the Commission entered an order permanently suspending the exemption under Regulation A.14
Gold Crown Mining Corporation.- This corporation was a Nevada
corporation organized in 1949 for the purpose of exploring, developing and operating certain gold mining properties located in California.
The subject proceeding was held to determine whether a temporary
suspension order entered in June 1958 should be vacated or made
permanent.
Gold Crown's offering circular stated that the offering price of the
stock is $5.00 per share. However, during 1957 Gold Crown sold 2,500
shares at a price of $1 per share to five persons including four officers
and directors and sold 590 shares to public investors at the stated offering price of $5 per share. The offering circular was not amended to
reflect the sale of 2,500 shares at the reduced price of $1 per share or
that 2,000 of such shares were sold to officers and directors. The Commission found that the offering circular was materially false and misleading in failing to disclose these significant facts and thereby would
operate as a fraud and deceit on subsequent purchasers. The Commission concluded that the assertion by Gold Crown that the sale of securities at $1 per share was an emergency measure to raise funds to meet
current operating expenses could not excuse the failure to disclose such
sales in the offering circular.
The secretary-treasurer of the company was its controlling stockholder and a director. Her two sons acted as underwriters in connec:u

tion with the offering. In June 1958, following pleas of guilty, all
three of th~ persons were convicted by a California court of violating
the California Corporate Securities Law. Those convictions were
based on sales of Gold Crown stock made in California. Rule 223 of
Regulation A, as then in effect, provided that the conviction of an issuer or any of its directors, officers or affiliates or any principal underwriter furnishes ground upon which the Commission may suspend the
exemption if the conviction was one involving the purchase or sale of a
security. The Commission concluded that under all of the circumstances the issuance of an order permanently suspending the exemption under Regulation A was required."
issuer and the
The Haratine Gas and on Company, Inc.-The
underwriter for the offering requested a hearing on the question of
vacating a prior temporary suspension order but subsequently stipulated to certain facts, waived a hearing and further procedures, and
consented to the entry of an order permanently suspending the exemption. On the basis of the record the Commission made the following
findings :
Sales material was used in connection with the offering which had
not been filed with the Commission prior to such use as required by
Regulation A. Certain of this sales material contained untrue statements of material facts or omitted to state material facts necessary
in order to make the statements made not misleading, particularly
with respect to statements that the stock being offered had a current
market price of $1.50 per share, that Haratine had "substantial holdings near the largest oil strike in the last 40 years east of the Mississippi," that it had sizeable holdings in the vicinity of "the greatest gas
well" in a certain area, and that a new well alleged to be in the same
area had original rock pressure over ten times greater than a previous
big well and "promises a potential production of fabulous statistics."
In view of the nature of the false and misleading statements in the
sales material and the failure to file such material in accordance with
Regulation A, the Commission concluded that an order permanently
suspending the exemption should be entered."
Hart on Corporation.- This corporation was organized in the
State of Washington in 1957 for the purpose of acquiring and developing oil and gas leases. It issued 921,850 shares of its stock to
its president and its counsel in the amounts of 631,850 shares and
290,000 shares respectively. It was stated that these shares were issued
for the assignment of certain leases and for legal services.
The offering circular did not reveal the cost of the leases to the
company's promoters or that such leases had been acquired by the

company for stock. The total cash cost of the leases to the promoters
was about $8,500 whereas the stock received by the tw.o individuals
would have had a total value of $231,185 at the public offering price.
If all of the shares in the proposed offering had been sold a.t the public
offering price the public would have owned approximately 52 percent
of the outstanding stock at a cost of $250,000 and the promoters
would have owned 48 percent of the stock for a cash outlay of approximately $9,000. The Commission found that the failure to disclose these facts in the offering circular was a material omission.
The offering circular was also materially deficient in failing to disclose the existence of landowners' royalty interests in two of the
leases and that minority working interests in such leases had been
sold to about 17 other persons. Furthermore, one of the leases had
expired prior to the filing under Regulation A and there was an
undisclosed forfeiture provision in another lease which caused the
company to lose the lease by the time of the hearing because of
failure to fulfill its drilling commitment.
The offering circular was also false and misleading with respect
to the information set forth regarding the production from, and
the productivity of, the leases and the quality of the oil obtained
therefrom. In addition, the balance sheet filed with the notification
was not prepared in accordance with the requirements of Regulation
A and no statement of cash receipts and disbursements was furnished
as required by the regulation.
The Commission entered an order permanently suspending the
exemption under Regulation A.17
IDowata Oil Company.-In
a previous findings and opinion in
proceedings to determine whether a temporary suspension should
be vacated or made permanent, the Commission held that the company's notification and offering circular, among other things, contained a materially misleading statement respecting the prospect of
oil recovery from a 200-acre oil and gas lease on which the company
had an option, but decided to consider a revised offering circular
submitted by the company during the proceedings."
It was noted that although the expiration date of the company's
option on the lease, which was the company's sole asset, had passed,
the revised offering circular did not indicate whether the option had
been or could be extended. The issuer, despite the fact that it knew
it did not have and probably could not obtain a renewal of the option,
failed to disclose such fact to the Commission in oral argument in
the proceedings and thereafter stated that the final offering circular
would refer to a subsisting option. The Commission was of the

opinion that the company had not demonstrated such good faith
and other mitigating circumstances in connection with the non-disclosure as to warrant vacating the temporary suspension order, and
it concluded that the suspension should be made permanent."
Texas-Augello Petroleum Exploration Co.-The issuer was an
Alaska corporation organized in 1957 for the primary purpose of
acquiring and exploring certain oil and gas leaseholds in Texas. According to the offering circular, the proceeds of the proposed offering
were to be used primarily for drilling a well on a specified lease. The
Commission found that the offering circular was misleading in including detailed data for drilling to a certain formation on that lease and
in failing to disclose that there was only a remote chance of producing
from that formation. In this connection, it found that the offering
circular should have disclosed that a dry well previously drilled on
the lease was not a wildcat well but had been drilled after completion
of two producing wells on nearby properties with the benefit of completion records and other information relating to those wells, and
could be considered an adequate test for that formation on the issuer's
lease.
The Commission also held that the offering circular was misleading
in stating that except as disclosed therein the issuer's officers, directors
and promoters had no direct or indirect interest in its properties, when
in fact the mother of the issuer's principal promoter was the lessor
of its primary lease. The Commission further found that the offering
circular was misleading in failing to make it clear that there was only
a remote chance of obtaining a profitable recovery from one of the
company's other leases.
An order denying the issuer's request for withdrawal of its notification and permanently suspending the exemption was entered."
Wey-Do Manufacturing Co., Inc.-The company was a New York
corporation incorporated in 1955 for the purpose of merchandising a
preparation claimed to be able to control dandruff and excessive hair
loss. The notification stated that the securities would be offered for
sale only in the State of New York whereas the offering was made
in several other states as well. The notification also stated that no
offering circular would be used in connection with the offering, although the use of an offering circular was required and one was filed
as an exhibit to the notification.
Wey-Do admitted, and the Commission found, that the offering
circular was deficient in that it failed to disclose the amount of expenses of the issuer in connection with the offering, the method by

directors and officers, the percentage of outstanding securities to be

the entire issue were sold or the issuer's contingent liability for sales
of unregistered stock during the previous year. The offering circular
also failed to include an adequate statement of the purposes for which
the proceeds of the offering would be used or to contain the required
financial statements.
In view of the extensive and serious deficiencies the Commission
refused to permit the withdrawal of the notification as requested by
the issuer and entered an order permanently
suspending the
exemption."
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended June 30,1960,328 offering sheets were

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

On July 30, 1959 the Commission adopted Regulation F, which
provides an exemption from registration under the Securities Act
for assessments and delinquent assessment sales in amounts not exceeding $300,000 in anyone year and requires the filing of a simple notification giving brief information with respect to the issuer, its management, principal security holders, recent and proposed assessments
and other security issues. The only information which a company
is required to send to its stockholders, or otherwise publish, is a statement of the purposes for which the proceeds from the assessment are
proposed to be used. This information may be included in the notice
of assessment given by mail or otherwise published as required by
State law. If the issuer should employ any other sales literature in
connection with the assessment, copies of such literature must be filed
with the Commission.
During the 1960 :fiscal year, 44 notifications were filed under Regulation F, covering assessments of $1,234,000. Regulation F notifications were filed in three of the nine regional offices of the Commission;
i.e., the Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle regional offices. Underwriters were not employed in any of the Regulation F assessments and
in no case did the assessment exceed $135,000.

conditions of the regulation, or in accordance with prescribed disclosure standards.
Two Regulation F filings were temporarily suspended in fiscal
1960 for alleged false and misleading statements in the sales material
used. Requests for hearings were made with respect to both of these
suspensions shortly after the end of the fiscal year.
LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

The Commission is authorized by the Securities Act to seek injunctions in cases where continued or threatened violations of the Act
are indicated, including violations of the registration and anti-fraud
provisions of the Act. Some of the more significant cases are described herein. Additional actions in which violations of the Securities Act are present and which also involve violations of other
statutes are described under the other statutes.
Three very important decisions involving attempts to evade the
registration provisions of the Act were rendered by Courts of Appeals
during the fiscal year. In S.E.O. v, Culpepper, et al.22 the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the issuance of an injunction
by the district court restricting sales of unregistered stock of MicroMoisture Controls, Inc. This company had exchanged a block of its
unregistered stock for the assets of a Canadian company which purportedly distributed the stock to its 31 stockholders, virtually all of
whom immediately gave a power of attorney to the same person to
sell their stock, and he commenced selling the stock through brokerdealers in the United States, The court held that such brokers were
underwriters within the meaning of the Act and not exempt from the
registration requirements, notwithstanding that there was no conventional or contractual privity with the issuer, and that one of the
brokers was selling for two members of the control group owning only
1112 percent of the stock. The court also reaffirmed the holding in its
1941 decision in S.E.O. v. Chinese Consolidated Benevolent Assn./3
that, even where an individual himself does not come within the definition of an underwriter, his transactions are not exempt if he engages
in steps necessary to a distribution by an issuer. The court also made
it clear that cessation of illegal activities prior to the institution of an
action is no bar to the issuance of an injunction, even in the case of one
of the brokers who had gone out of business prior to the trial. The
brokers had argued that the granting of the injunction could be used
as the basis of revocation of their registrations, but the court held that
the possible effect of the injunction in future revocation proceedings
was not germane to the court's determination.

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

In B.E.C. v. Guild Films, et ai.,24 the Court of Appeals for the
Second Circuit affirmed the District Court's order of preliminary injunction restraining two banks from selling to the public unregistered
stock which had been "pledged" with them in connection with a loan
on which there had been a default. The district court held that in this
case there had not been any "pledge" at all; that it had been the
intention of both the "pledgor" and "pledgee" that the stock was to be
sold to the public. On appeal, in response to the contention by the
banks that they were bona fide pledgees and had accepted the stock
in "good faith," the Court of Appeals reasserted the principles set
forth in its Culpepper and Chinese decisions, and stated:
"The 'good faith' of the banks is irrelevant to this purpose. It would be of
little solace to purchasers of worthless stock to learn that the sellers had
acted 'in good faith.'
Regardless of good faith, the banks engaged in steps
necessary to this public sale, and cannot be exempted."

In HillsborO'ltghInvestment Corporation et al. v. BE.C., the corportation and its General Manager, Roger Mara, had been preliminarily enjoined with respect to certain securities which they had sold
assertedly in reliance on the intrastate exemption of the Securities Act.
The exemption, however, was unavailable because of out-of-State
sales. After the entry of the preliminary injunction, Hillsborough
nndertook to create "new" securities, which were to be exchanged with
its existing shareholders who were residents of Xew Hampshire, the
balance to be offered to residents of that State. The District Court
found this to be "an open and calculated attempt to avoid the preliminary enjoining order" and issued a permanent injunction extending
to "any of the securities of the Hillsborough Investment Corporation."
The Court of Appeals for the First Circuit afflrmed," stating that
the sale of these substitute securities would be, in effect, merely a continuation of the sale of the no longer exempt securities, and consequently a violation of the Act. The Court pointed out:
"An issuer that has lost the exemption as to one issue of securities by a
non-resident sale, does not have the opportunity to regain the legal use of
interstate facilities or the mails by halting the non-resident sales and confining itself to sales to residents.
But this is just what appellants seek by
means of the substitute capitalization plan."

An important question as to whether or not a particular transaction involved a "security" arose in B.E.C. v. Los Angeles Trust Deed &:
Mortgage EWMnge.26 The District Court, following a 37-day trial,
permanently enjoined the corporate defendants and certain of their
managing officers from violating the registration and antifraud pro.. May 19, 1960, Docket No. 26039 •

visions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in the
sale of securities issued in connection with an investment plan and
appointed a receiver to carry out the orderly liquidation of the corporate defendants. The investment plan, designated as the Secured
10 Percent Earnings Program, was based upon the sale to the public
of discounted real estate trust deeds and mortgages.
The District Court found that the instruments sold by defendants
were securities in at least three aspects: (1) a note, secured by a deed
of trust and delivered to an investor, was an "evidence of indebtedness"; (2) certain recipts, issued to evidence an investor's deposit of
funds pending selection for the investor of a note and deed of trust,
were securities; and (3) the instruments issued in connection with the
plan and which are accompanied by defendant's services of collection, screening, processing, repurchasing or reselling, were "investment contracts."
The District Court found that to facilitate the sale of these securities the defendants made material misleading statements. While certain of the statements contained in the defendant's sales literature
had been characterized by the Court of Appeals as mere "puffing"
when the action was before that court on review of the preliminary
injunction," the District Court concluded that on the basis of the
more extensive proof of fraud and deceit available at the trial, the
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act and Securities Exchange
Act were violated in the sale of these securities.
After the defendants filed notices of appeal, their motion for a
stay of the District Court's decree pending appeal was granted in
certain respects. The Court of Appeals did not stay, however, the
appointment of the receiver who took possession of the assets of the
corporate defendants to maintain, conserve and preserve them. At
the close of the fiscal year, the case was pending before the Court of
Appeals and the receiver was having an audit conducted of the
corporate defendants.
The Commission instituted litigation against two Maryland corporations called "savings and loan associations": First OapitolSavings &1
Loan Assoc., Inc. and Americasi Seal Savings &: Loan Assoc., Inc.
These companies were originally operated from New Jersey by one
James G. Sorce, Jr. Upon receipt of information indicating that
First Capitol was soliciting deposits by fraudulent representations,
the Commission filed a complaint against it and Sorce." To avoid

consented to an injunction restraining violations of the antifraud and
registration provisions of the Act. Almost immediately thereafter,
however, it was discovered that identical advertising was being placed
on behalf of American Seal, also operated by Sorce.
A second injunctive action alleging violation of the antifraud provisions 29 was filed and a motion made to examine the books and
records of American Seal. The motion was granted but the difficulties encountered in obtaining the records raised questions concerning the soundness of the company's financial condition. Although
defendants again offered to consent to an injunction (which would
have terminated the litigation), the Commission amended its complaint to allege that the funds of American Seal and First Capitol
were being intermingled; that their assets were being wasted and
dissipated by defendant Sorce; that their officers and directors had
abandoned their responsibilities and that, for the protection of public
investors, it was necessary that a receiver be appointed to audit the
affairs of both companies. Defendants moved to dismiss the amended
complaint on the ground that the Commission had no authority to
seek the appointment of a receiver. The Court, relying on prior
decisions and the ruling of the Court in the L08 Angele8 Trust Deed
case," denied the motion. Thereafter, at the opening of the hearing
of the Commission's motion for a receiver, defendants consented to
the appointment of a conservator with powers similar to those of a
receiver pendente lite and such conservator was directed to have
an audit made of the affairs of the two companies. This audit is now
in progress.
Leurisohsi Oopper Corp. v. S.E.O.31 was a petition for review of an
order of the Commission dated March 18, 1958, which had suspended
a Regulation A exemption, had suspended the effectiveness of a registration statement, and had denied leave to withdraw the registration
statement. The petition for review was dismissed for lack of
prosecution.
In S.E.O. v. American Dryer Corporation; et al.32 the Commission

whose specialty was the sale of IPI stock to United States servicemen overseas. The Commission charged that the sales were made in
violation of the registration provision of Section 5 and the antifraud
provision of Section 17 of the Securities Act. IPI agents sold the
stock to service men in Weisbaden, Germany, and at other large concentrations of United States Service personnel. The misrepresentations and misleading statements used to boost the sale of IPI stock
caused Air Force officials in Germany to bar IPI solicitations on its
installations.
The Commission obtained service on several defendants in the District of Columbia, but failed to reach Robert C. Buffkin, its president,
who has remained in Europe with the firm's books. The case is still
pending.
In S.E.O. v, Seourity Oredit (Iorporation; et al.s4 the defendants
were charged with violations of the registration requirements and
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act. The Commission's com.
plaint alleged that the defendants-Security
Credit Corporation, a
Nevada corporation, Dow & Company, a Utah corporation, and Eldon
C. Harris were making misleading representations with regard to:
the declaration of dividends; the consummation of firm underwriting
agreements; the maintenance of a primary market for the purchase
and sale of securities; the advertising of fictitious bids; representation
as a registered broker-dealer and implying registration as a brokerdealer with the Commission; and the maintenance of "mail drops"
which are representated as legitimate principal or branch offices.
In S.E.O. v. Fall River Exploration and Mining Oompany, et al.s5
the Commission filed a complaint seeking to enjoin defendants from
violating Sections 5 (b) and 10(a) of the Securities Act in the delivery
of the stock of Fall River. Section 10 requires that where a prospectus is used more than nine months after the effective date of the registration statement, the information therein must be as of a date not
more than 16 months prior to the date of its use. The complaint alleged that a registration statement relating to the stock of Fall River
which became effective on August 13, 1958, contained financial information no more recent than May 31, 1958, and that such a prospectus
used after October 1, 1959 did not meet the requirements of Section
10(a) of the Act. The Court entered an order preliminarily enjoining defendants from using a prospectus which does not meet the
requirements of Section 10, and from delivering stock of Fall River
unless preceded or accompanied by a prospectus which meets the
requirements of Section 10.

A number of actions involved fraud in the sale of securities of oil,
gas and mining companies. In B.E.O. v, Mon-O-Oo Corporation 86
the Commission brought suit to enjoin the corporation, Ben Haugner
and Frank LeCocq from further violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act. The Commission's complaint
charges that the defendants have been selling certificates of interest
and fractional undivided interests in oil, gas and other mineral rights
in the development and operations of oil and gas wells located in the
Fertile Prairie Oil Field situated in Montana, and that the defendants' selling activities included the making of false representations
and omissions of material facts, namely: the background, experience
and success of Mon-O-Co Oil Corporation, Ben Haugner and Frank
LeCocq in the oil and gas business; previous administrative proceedings taken by the Commission in connection with proposed offering of
Mon-O-Co's stock because of false and misleading statements and
omissions concerning its properties in the Fertile Prairie Field; the
rights and obligations of those who purchase interests in the development of a certain oil and gas well; and costs of development of said
well; and production to be expected therefrom."
the Commission's complaint in
In B.E.O. v. A. R. Rhine, et
seeking injunctive relief and the appointment of a receiver, alleged
that the defendants were engaged in a fraudulent device in the sale
of fractional undivided interests in oil wells to investors by which defendants obtained in excess of $5 million; that in selling these fractional interests they employed what is known as a Ponzi scheme
whereby the defendants paid back to purchasers sums which they
represented to be returns from the sale of oil from such wells when,
in truth, the payments were actually made from the :funds which the
investors had advanced for the purchase of their interests in the oil
wells. By order of the Court, filed November 30, 1959, the defendants were preliminarily enjoined by consent and a receiver was appointed. Following a report of the receiver, a final judgment was
entered by consent enjoining the defendants, A. R. Rhine, doing business as Rhine Petroleum Industries, Majestic Petroleum Company,
and James M. Paddock from further violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. Thereafter, the case was transferred to the Bankruptcy Division of the Court.

corporation in the Commission's investigation into the activities of
Certified Credit Corporation, Houston Financial Corporation, Daniel
E. Armel, Claude L. Alden, J 1'., Joseph S. Maniscalco, Richard Lee,
Standard Securities Service Corporation and Albert Schrader for
possible violation of the registration and anti. fraud provisions of
the Securities Act. The matter was dismissed on motion by the Commission after the defendants appeared before an officerof the Commission and produced the requested records.
In 8.E.0. v, John A. N oonan/" the Commission applied for an
order requiring defendant to appear, produce and identify certain
books and records previously subpoenaed. The Court ordered defendant to obey the subpoena.
SliTS AGAINST TIIE COMMISSION

On January 9, 1960 William Leighton filed a petition for rehearing
of a petition for review which had been dismissed by the Court in
February 1955 in William Leighton v. 8.E.O.61 The petition for
review had sought review of a Commission determination that it was
without jurisdiction to institute an action to compel the American
Express Company to register its "travelers checks" under the Securities Act. The Court had held that the determination sought to
be reviewed was a matter committed to the Commission's discretion
by Section 20 of the Securities Act, and was not reviewable under
Section 9 (a) of the Act or Section 10 of the Administrative Procedure
Act.68 Certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court.09 In the petition for rehearing petitioner alleged that J. Sinclair Armstrong, who
had been a member of the Commission when the above determination
was made in 1954, was biased at the time because he was employed
about five years later by the United States Trust Company, a corporation which, petitioner alleged, has a director in common with the
American Express Company and another director in a law firm representing the American Express Company. On March 14, 1960 the
Court denied the petition.

ants from violating the registration provisions of the Securities Act
in the sale of the stock of Farm and Home. Defendants later filed
a motion to vacate that decree and a motion seeking to enjoin the
Commission from investigating, prosecuting, or presenting any eyidence to a grand jury pertaining to the alleged violations of the Securities Act involved in the consent decree. The District Court denied
both motions. The defendants appealed, arguing that the McCarranFerguson Act of 194:5 exempted the securities of insurance companies from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and
that, therefore, the prior judgment was void for lack of jurisdiction.
The Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit affirmed the denial of
defendant's motions," and the Supreme Court denied certiorari."
In Oaliahan. (Ionsolidated Mines, Inc.; et al. v, S.E.O/3 the plaintiffs filed a complaint seeking a judgment declaring Rule 136, an
amendment to Rule 140 and Regulation F adopted. by the Commission under the 1933 Act to be void and enjoining the Commission
from enforcing the same. The action was dismissed by stipulation
of the parties.
Gearhart &: Otis, Inc. v. S.E.O.74 involved an appeal from an order
of the District Court denying the motion of Gearhart & Otis to reinstate and enforce certain subpoenas it was attempting to serve upon a
member of the Commission and members of its staff in connection
with an administrative proceeding under Section 15 of the Securities
Exchange Act. On September 8, 1959 the Court of Appeals dismissed the appeal on the motion of the Commission for failure of the
appellant to comply with the rules of the Court.

PART V
ADMIMSTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF
1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides for the registration
and regulation of securities exchanges, and the registration
of
securities listed on such exchanges and it establishes, for issuers of
securities so registered, financial and other reporting requirements,
regulation of proxy solicitations and requirements with respect to
trading by directors, officers and principal security holders. The Act
also provides for the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers
doing business in the over-the-counter market, contains provisions
designed to prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and
practices on the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and
authorizes the Federal Reserve Board to regulate the use of credit in
securities transactions.
The purpose of these statutory requirements
is to ensure the maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

seven exchanges reported 38 cases of such disciplinary action, including imposition of fines aggregating $42,800 in 26 cases; the suspension
of two individuals and the expulsion of another individual from allied
membership; the suspension of another individual and his firm from
membership; the revocation of a specialist registration in one case;
and the censure of a number of individuals and firms.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

It is unlawful for a member of a national securities exchange or a.
broker or dealer to effect any transaction in a security on such exchange
unless the security is registered on that exchange under the Securities
Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration.
In general, the
Act exempts from registration obligations issued or guaranteed by a
State or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and regulations exempting such other securities as the Commission may find
necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. Under this authority the Commission has
exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by
property or leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a temporary
basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or in addition to
listed securities.
Section 12 of the Exchange Act provides that an issuer may register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application which discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. Such an application requires the
furnishing of information in regard to the issuer's business, capital
structure, the terms of its securities, the persons who manage or control
its affairs, the remuneration paid to its officers and directors, the allotment of options, bonuses and profit-sharing plans and financial statements certified by independent accountants.
Form 10 is the form used for registration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit
and securities of foreign governments.
Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration.
These periodic reports
include annual reports, semi-annual reports, and current reports. The
principal annual report form is Form 10-K which is designed to
keep up-to-date the information furnished in Form 10. Semi-annual
reports required to be furnished on Form 9-K are devoted chiefly to
furnishing mid-year financial data. Current reports on Form 8-K

TWENTY-SIXTH

67

ANNUAL REPORT

are required to be filed for each month in which any of certain specified events have occurred. A report on this form deals with matters
such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions
or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of important
legal proceedings and important changes in the issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
Statistics Relating to Registration of Securities on Exchanges

As of June 30, 1960, a total of 2,307 issuers had 3,894 classes of
securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges, of
which 2,705 were classified as stocks and 1,189 as bonds. Of these
totals, 1,317 issuers had 1,531 stock issues and 1,137 bond issues listed
and registered on the New York Stock Exchange.
Thus, 57 percent
of the issuers, 56 percent of the stock issues and 96 percent of the bond
issues were on the New York Stock Exchange.
During the 1960 fiscal year, 165 issuers listed and registered securities on a national securities exchange for the first time, while the
registration of all securities of 94 issuers was terminated.
The total
number of applications for registration of classes of securities on
exchanges filed during the 1960 fiscal year was 255.
The following table shows the number of annual, semiannual and
current reports filed during the fiscal year by issuers having securities
listed and registered on national securities exchanges. The table also
shows the number of such reports filed under section 15 (d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuers obligated to file reports by
reason of having publicly offered securities effectively registered under
the Securities Act of 1933. The securities of such issuers are traded
generally in the over-the-counter markets. As of June 30,1960, there
were 1,818 such issuers, including 275 that were also registered as investment companies under the Investment Company Act of 1940.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

$1.3 billion represented other foreign stocks. The market values of
the entire Canadian stock issues were included in these aggregates.
Most of the other foreign stocks were represented by American Depositary Receipts or American shares, only the outstanding amounts
of which were used in determining market values.
Comparative Exchange Statistics

There have been over 100 stock exchanges in the United States, in-cluding many short-lived ventures. More than 30 exchanges existed
in 1929. Much of the reduction to the present 17 has occurred through
mergers of exchanges. The Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange,
Midwest Stock Exchange, and Pacific Coast Stock Exchange together
represent 11 former exchanges.
In recent years, the number of stocks on the New York Stock Ex-change has increased. The number on the American Stock Exchange
has increased after a decline ending with 1951. The number exclusively on other exchanges has consistently declined.

The decline in the number of stocks traded exclusively on the other
exchanges is to a substantial extent attributable to the listing of some
of such stocks on the New York exchanges, and the mergers of certain
issuers into companies whose stocks are listed on the New York ex-changes. For example, in calendar 1959, the regional exchanges
gained only three local listings of common stock with less than $10
million aggregate market value and lost 16 common stocks aggregating over $320 million from exclusively local status through listings or
mergers as described above.

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

The regional exchanges have countered the flow to New York to
some extent by acquiring unlisted trading privileges in leading New
York listings. Their proportion of total share volume on the exchanges has nevertheless tended to decline, although their proportion
of total dollar volume of shares traded on the exchanges has held
steadily in the vicinity of 7 percent for a considerable number of
years.

At the close of 1934, the total market value of all stocks on the
exchanges was estimated at about $54 billion, of which 63 percent
was on the New York Stock Exchange. This Exchange's percentage
rose to about 82 percent of the $81.9 billion at the close of 1948, and
further to about 91 percent of the $338.4 billion at the close of 1959.
Similarly, the New York Stock Exchange had about 49 percent of the
2.7 billion shares estimated to be on stock exchanges in 1934, about 61
percent of the 3.3 billion shares in 1948, and about 74 percent of the
7.9 billion shares at the close of 1959. Many New York listings are
also listed or traded on an unlisted basis on various regional exchanges.
Comparative Over-the-Counter

Statistics

Aggregate domestic over-the-counter share values as computed in
the Commission's Annual Reports 1 increased from $59 billion to $66
billion during the calendar year 1959. Aggregate bank stock values
rose from $15 billion to $17.5 billion, insurance stocks from $11.5 billion to $11.8 billion, and other stocks (industrial, utility, etc.) from
$32.5 billion to $36.7 billion.
About $24.2 billion stocks were of companies reporting pursuant to
Section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act. Another $3.3 billion

was of companies reporting because they had other securities listed on
registered exchanges. Thus $27.5 billion of the $48.5 billion domestic
over-the-counter values excluding bank stocks was of companies reporting to the Commission. Banks, of course, report to their appropriate regula.tory bodies.
Companies reporting pursuant to Section 15(d) had, in addition to
the $24.2 billion domestic over-the-counter stocks mentioned above,
some $5.1 billion foreign stocks (mostly Canadian) and unlisted
stocks on exchanges, bringing the total to about $29.3 billion, an
increase o:f about $3 billion during 1959. The $29.3 billion does not
include values for 250 investment companies reporting pursuant to
both Section 15(d) and the Investment Company Act, nor values for
partnerships, voting trusts duplicative of listed shares, stock purchase
plans, bonds and non-quoted shares of issuers required to report
pursuant to Section 15(d).
A comprehensive view of the number of over-the-counter securities
quoted at anyone time and over the years is afforded by the :following

The issues include a considerable number which are on stock exchanges here and in Canada. The number of issues is more than the
number of issuers, since some companies have more than one quoted
issue. The count of issues may be affected by growth in number of
subscribers and the Bureau's rules as to entries in the service.
DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES

Applications may be made to the Commission by exchanges to
strike any securities or by issuers to withdraw their securities from
listing and registration on exchanges pursuant to Rule 12d2-1(b)
under Section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1960, the Commission granted
applications by exchanges and issuers to remove 37 stock issues and

TWENTY-SIXTH

4 bond issues from listing and registration pursuant to Rule 12d21(b). There were 44 removals, since 3 stocks delisted by the New

The applications by the exchanges were based upon the ground
that the issues were no longer suitable for exchange trading by reason
of reduced public holdings and holders, inconsequential trading
volumes on the exchanges, prospective dissolution or merger, or a
combination of these factors.
The five applications by issuers were for removal of stocks from
various regional exchanges. In three instances the stocks remained
listed on other registered exchanges. In one case, the stock had come
to have only 56 holders. In the remaining case, the application alleged
that the California Commissioner of Corporations conditioned the
granting of a permit authorizing sale of additional shares upon withdrawal of the outstanding shares from listing.
Action taken this year by the San Francisco Mining Exchange
brings to 7, or a majority of the 13 registered exchanges, the number
of these exchanges whose rules provide that an issuer intending to
delist may be required to notify its stockholders or obtain their vote
before filing an application with the Commission." The other exchanges having such rules include American, Cincinnati, Midwest,
New York, Philadelphia-Baltimore and Salt Lake. The requirements
for notification or voting have rarely been resorted to. No issuer has
applied to the Commission for delisting from the New York Stock
Exchange since 1940. Only a few instances of stockholder voting
with respect to delisting from other exchanges are on record." The

principal benefit of the rule appears to be the notice afforded an.
exchange of an issuer's intent prior to the filing with the Commission.
Opportunity is accordingly afforded an exchange to dissuade an.
issuer from delisting. If the circumstances are appropriate, an exchange may waive its rule and allow the issuer to proceed with the
filing. Insuch cases the exchange will have had opportunity to discuss
the language of the application with the issuer. When the issuers'
reasons for delisting are persuasive, the exchanges generally preferto file the delisting applications as a matter of good public relations,
and because they then dictate the language of the applications. During the past two years, there were 75 delistings upon exchange application and only 10 upon issuer application, and eight of the 10 delistings upon issuer application were merely for the purpose of reducing
multiple listings, leaving the issues listed on the exchanges where
their principal activity occurred.
Delisting Proceedings under Section 19(a)

Section 19(a) (2) authorizes the Commission to suspend for a period
not exceeding twelve months, or to withdraw, the registration of a
security on a national securities exchange if, in its opinion, such action
is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and, after
notice and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that the
issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the
Act or the rules and regulations thereunder. The following table
indicates the number of such proceedings with which the Commission
was concerned during the 1960 fiscal year.

pending proceedings to use its authority summarily to suspend trading in securities registered on a national securities exchange. Only
two of these suspensions remained in effect at the end of the fiscal year.
The four cases in which orders were issued under Section 19(a) (2)
during the fiscal year withdrawing securities from registration on a
national securities exchange are described below.
Ambrosia Minerals Inc.-The
registrant, a Nevada corporation
organized in 1926 under another name, registered its common stock
on the San Francisco Mining Exchange, a national securities exchange, in 1956.
In its application for registration and in a current report filed
subsequently the registrant stated that it had no "parents" as defined
in the Commission's Rule 12b-2. The record shows, however, that
George A. Mellen, a director, owned beneficially and of record more
than 78 percent of the then outstanding shares of the registrant and
that his percentage of ownership subsequently increased to more than
87 percent as a result of a reduction in the number of shares outstanding. Inview of these :facts the Commission found that Mellen clearly
was a parent of the registrant and that the application for registration and the current report were false and misleading in failing to so
state.
The registration application and certain current reports reported
various sales by the registrant of its stock and stated that such sales
were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933 as a private offering within the meaning of Section 4(1)
thereof. The Commission found, however, that some of the persons,
among whom were included brokers and directors to whom the stock
was sold initially, acquired the stock with a view to its distribution
to other persons and did, in fact, subsequently resell to other persons.
It appeared therefore that these persons were underwriters within
the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities Act and that the
claimed exemption was not available for the stock sold. The Commission accordingly concluded that the registration application and
reports were false in stating that these sales of stock were exempt from
registration under the Securities Act.
The registrant's income statement filed as a part of its annual
report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1957, included as income
profits resulting from the sale of certain properties to insiders. The
Commission found that under the circumstances the profits realized
constituted a capital contribution rather than income. The income
statement also failed to include the registrant's cost of rendering certain services to another company as a deduction against the amount
purported to have been paid for such services. After taking the

76

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

above items into consideration it was found that the income statement would show a substantial deficit instead of a small earned surplus
as reported by the registrant.
During the fiscal year to which the financial statements relate registrant paid dividends without disclosing that such dividends were in
the nature of liquidating dividends payable out of paid-in capital,
since the registrant had no earned surplus :from which such dividends
could be paid. The Commission found that the financial statements
were false and misleading in that the overstated income and earned
surplus had misrepresented the financial conditions and operating
results of the company. The Commission also found that the financial
statements were not certified by independent accountants as required
by its rules and regulations since the accountant had a managerial
interest in the registrant.
Under all of the circumstances, the Commission concluded that the
protection of investors required that the registration of the registrant's
common stock on the exchange be withdrawn and issued an order to
that effect.'
Consolidated Virginia Mining Company.-The
registrant is a
Nevada corporation whose common stock, $1 par value, became registered on the San Francisco Mining Exchange in 1936. In 1955, the
par value of registrant's stock was reduced to 10 cents per share and
the authorized capital was increased :from 5,000,000to 7,500,000shares.
The registrant filed with the Commission and sent to its stockholders a proxy statement containing a proposal to increase the registrant's authorized common stock :from 7,500,000 to 30,000,000 shares
in order to make available unissued shares which might be used for the
purpose of acquiring additional mining properties or companies. The
proxy statement represented that no particular transactions of such
character were pending. The record disclosed, however, that the registrant, through its management, had been actively negotiating for
the acquisition of another company prior to the time the proxy statement was filed with the Commission and sent to stockholders and that
definitive action on the proposed acquisition was merely deferred
until after the meeting of stockholders. The acquisition transaction
was carried through to completion shortly after the stockholders meeting. The proxy statement also failed to disclose the interest of certain
insiders in the transaction.
After completion of the transaction the registrant further failed to
file the necessary reports to disclose the issuance of its shares in exchange for those of the company acquired.

Registrant urged that the registration of its stock on the exchange
not be withdrawn, contending that it had made prompt efforts to
bring the public record up to date through the filing of all required
reports since the institution of the proceeding. It appeared, however,
that the registrant had not filed all the required reports particularly
with respect to certain litigation which resulted in a subsequent judgment against the registrant.
In view of the registrant's failure to
comply with its obligations under the Securities Exchange Act and
the indications that it had continued to be derelict in its responsibilities, the Commission concluded that it was necessary and appropriate
for the protection of investors that the registration of the stock of the
registrant on the exchange be withdrawn and an order to that effect
was issued. 5
Operator Consolidated Mines Company.-The
registrant, a Nevada corporation, was incorporated in 1924 and its stock was registered on the San Francisco Mining Exchange in 1935. During the
period from May through November 1956 the registrant was required
to file current reports with respect to the levying of an assessment
on its common stock, the sale of stock which was in default for failure
to pay this assessment, the execution of an agreement between the
registrant and another company, the issuance to the latter of 1,360,000
shares of its stock, the increase in the number of shares of authorized
stock and the change of such stock :from assessable to non-assessable
shares. These reports were required to be filed within 10 days after
the close of the month in which each event occurred.
The registrant was required, among other things, to include in such
reports (1) a statement that the 1,360,000shares issued to the company
referred to were not registered under the Securities Act, a statement
of any exemption from registration claimed therefor and II> statement
of the facts relied upon to make the exemption available, (2) disclosure that the issuance of such shares effected a change in the control
of registrant in that such control was thereby transferred to the other
company and indirectly to the controlling stockholders of such company, (3) information regarding the relationship between the other
company and registrant and (4) disclosure of the fact that properties proposed to be transferred to the registrant by the other
company had been acquired the same day by the other company from
certain insiders who had acquired the properties for a nominal consideration. The registrant failed to file the required reports and
make the required disclosures.

SECURITIES ANI} EXCHANGE COMMISSION

A current report for the month of December 1956 :filedby the registrant contained a number of statements which were false or misleading.
In April 1957, after the institution of these proceedings, the registrant :filedits annual report for 1956 which contained the statement
that it was designed not only to supply all information required in
an annual report but also to supersede the current report previously
filed for December 1956 and to provide all of the information required
to have been submitted in current reports with respect to transactions
occurring during 1956 and 1957 to date. While this annual report
made disclosures with respect to the events referred to above, the
Commission found that it was inadequate and misleading in a number
of material respects.
On the basis of the foregoing, the Commission concluded that the
registrant had not fully complied with the reporting requirements of
the Act and that its stock should be withdrawn from registration on
the San Francisco Mining Exchange. Accordingly, an order to that
effect was issued."
Silver Shield Mining and Milling Company.-Registrant,
a Utah
corporation organized in 1899, registered its common stock on the
Salt Lake Stock Exchange in 1935. On December 20, 1956, a new
board of directors of registrant was elected by a majority of the existing board pursuant to a plan under which a certain oil property was
to be transferred to registrant and the stock in registrant held by the
existing board was to be sold by them to a new group. The new board
was selected and was controlled by one D. E. Kivett who, registrant
concedes, continued in control of registrant's board until January 7,
1958,when a different board was elected.
Registrant failed to file a current report :for December 1956 to disclose that Kivett had secured control and thus become a parent of registrant during that month, and its annual reports for the fiscal years
ended December 31, 1956and 1957falsely stated that it had no parents.
Moreover, registrant's current report for January 1958 failed to disclose that Kivett had ceased to be a parent of registrant during that
month and to describe the transactions by which his parent relationship was terminated, as required by the current report form.
Registrant's current reports for certain months in 1956, 1957 and
1958 stated that various dispositions made by registrant of its stock
were exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities Act
of 1933 because the stock was registered on the Exchange. Such
registration provided no exemption for the stock and there appeared
to be no other basis for such an exemption. The Commission con• Securities Exchange Act Release No. 6129 (December 9,1959).

eluded, therefore, that the statement that the stock was so exempt was
false and misleading.
The current report for March 1957 stated that registrant's stock was
non-assessable, when in fact the stock was assessable, and was so reported in an amendment to that report filed in August 1957.
Under all the circumstances, the Commission was of the opinion
that the protection of investors required that the registration of
registrant's common stock on the Exchange be withdrawn and an
order to that effect was issued.'
UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES

Stocks with only unlisted trading privileges on the exchanges continued to decline in number, falling from 248 on June 30, 1959 to
232 on June 30, 1960. Their aggregate market value on December
31, 1959 was $14.5 billion, a sharp reduction from the $21.4 billion
reported a year previously.
Removal by the American Stock Exchange of Humble Oil and Refining Company common stock, by reason of the company's merger, accounted for $5 billion of the $6.9
billion reduction.
Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) held $4.1
billion of the $14.5 billion aggregate, in stocks of Creole Petroleum
Corporation, Imperial Oil Limited, and International
Petroleum
Company Limited.
An additional $3.6 billion was of 57 stocks of
issuers reporting as fully as though they were listed, by reason of
registrations under the Securities Act, the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, the Investment Company Act, or because the issuers
in some cases had other securities listed on registered exchanges. The
residue in public hands of such unlisted stocks accordingly amounted
to only about $6.8 billion, and of this amount, about $4.4 billion was
of 64 Canadian and other foreign stocks and American Depositary
Receipts for foreign shares. The reported volume of trading on the
exchanges in stocks admitted to unlisted trading only, for the calendar
year 1959, was about 40.6 million shares or about 2.5 percent of the
total share volume on all the exchanges. About 89 percent of this
40.6 million share volume was on the American Stock Exchange, 10
percent was on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, and six other
regional exchanges contributed the remaining 1 percent.
Unlisted trading privileges on some exchanges in stocks listed
on other exchanges continued to increase in number, rising from 1,494
on June 30, 1959 to 1,538 on June 30, 1960. These unlisted trading
privileges, in stocks listed for the most part on the New York Stock
Exchange, provide the regional exchanges with their principal source
of new trading material. The reported volume of unlisted trading on

COMMISSION

the exchanges in these stocks listed elsewhere, for the calendar year
1959, was close to 47 million shares. About 20 percent of the volume
was on the American Stock Exchange in stocks listed on regional exchanges and about 80 percent was on regional exchanges in stocks
listed on the New York or American Stock Exchange. The number
of unlisted trading privileges is considerably greater than the number
of stocks involved, since leading N ew York listings are traded unlisted
on as many as seven regional exchanges. 'Vhile the 47 million shares
amounted to somewhat less than 3 percent of the total share volume
on all the exchanges in 1959, it constituted substantial portions of the
share volumes on the leading regional exchanges where it occurred,
reaching 76.5 percent at Boston, 72 percent at Philadelphia-Baltimore,
62.7 percent at Cincinnati, 43.3 percent at Pittsburgh, 40.3 percent at
Detroit, 33.1 percent at Midwest, and 21.8 percent at Pacific Coast
stock exchanges. Roughly, the percentages were less as distances from
New York were greater, but they were also affected by other factors
including high share volumes in local low-price listed shares on some
of the regional exchanges, particularly on the West Coast.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, made pursuant to Rule 12f-1 under Section
12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the Commission during the fiscal year ended June 30,1960, as follows:

of the Securities Exchange Act for continuance of unlisted trading in

of substantial equivalence to the former Class A and Class B stocks
which previously had unlisted trading privileges on that Exchange.

BWCK DISTRIBUTIONS REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

Rule 10b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in substance prohibits any person participating or otherwise financially
interested in the primary or secondary distribution of a security from
paying any other person for soliciting a third person to buy any
security of the same issuer on a national securities exchange. This
rule is an anti-manipulative rule adopted under Section lO(b) of the
Act which makes it unlawful for any person to use any manipulative
or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of Commission
rules prescribed in the public interest or for the protection of investors. Paragraph (d) of Rule 1Ob-2 exempts transactions where
compensation is paid pursuant to the terms of a plan, filed by a national securities exchange and declared effective by the Commission,
authorizing the payment of such compensation in connection with
the distribution. The Commission in its declaration may impose such
terms and conditions upon such plan as it deems necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
At the present time two types of plans are in effect to permit a block
of securities to be distributed through the facilities of a national securities exchange when it has been determined by the exchange that
the regular market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb the
particular block within a reasonable time and at a reasonable price
or prices. These plans have been designated the "Special Offering
Plan," essentially a fixed price offering based on the market price,
and the "Exchange Distribution Plan," which is a distribution "at the
market." Both plans contemplate that orders will be solicited off the
floor but executed on the floor. Each plan contains certain antimanipulative controls and requires specified disclosures concerning
the distribution to be made to prospective purchasers.
In addition to these two methods of distributing large blocks of
securities on national securities exchanges, blocks of listed securities
may be distributed to the public by a "Secondary Distribution" on
the over-the-counter market, after the close of exchange trading.
The exchanges generally require members to obtain the approval of
the exchange before participating in such secondary distributions.
The following table shows the number and volume of special offerings and exchange distributions reported by the exchanges having
such plans in effect, as well as similar figures for secondary distributions which exchanges have approved for member participation
and reported to the Commission:

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on a national securities exchange. The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched
orders effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of trading activity in, or with respect to the market for, any
such security; a series of transactions in which the price of such security is raised or depressed, or in which actual or apparent active trading is created for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales of such
security by others; circulation by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer, or
by a person who receives consideration from a broker, dealer, seller or
buyer, of information concerning market operations conducted for a
rise or a decline in the price of such security; and the making of any
false and misleading statement of material information by a broker,
dealer, seller, or buyer regarding such security for the purpose of
inducing purchases or sales. The Act also empowers the Commission
to adopt rules and regulations to define and prohibit the use of these
and other forms of manipulative activity in any security registered
on an exchange or traded over the counter.
The Commission's market surveillance staff in its Division of Trading and Exchanges in WashiIlooton and in its New York Regional
Office and other field officesobserves the tickertape quotations of securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on the American
Stock Exchange, the sales and quotation sheets of the various regional
exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published by the National
Daily Quotation Service for about 6,000 unlisted securities to discover
any unusual or unexplained price variations or market activity. The
financial news ticker, leading newspapers, and various financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed.

TWENTY-SIXTH

83

ANNUAL REPORT

When unusual or unexplained market activity in a security is observed, all known information regarding the security is examined and
a decision made as to the necessity for an investigation. Most investigations are not made public so that no unfair reflection will be cast
on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not be upset.
These investigations, which are conducted by the Commission's regional offices,take two forms. A preliminary investigation or "quiz"
is designed to discover rapidly, evidence of unlawful activity. If no
violations are found, the preliminary investigation is closed. If it appears that more intensive investigation is necessary, a formal order
of investigation, which carries with it the right to issue subpenas and
to take testimony under oath, is issued by the Commission. If violations by a broker-dealer are discovered, the Commission may institute
administrative proceedings to determine whether or not to revoke his
registration or to suspend or expel him from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, .Inc., or from a national securities exchange. The Commission may also seek an injunction against
any person violating the Act and it may refer information obtained
in its investigation to the Department of Justice recommending that
persons violating the Act be criminally prosecuted. In some cases,
where state action seems likely to bring quick results in preventing
fraud or where Federal jurisdiction may be doubtful, the information
obtained may be referred to state agencies for state injunction or
criminal prosecution.
The following table shows the number of quizzes and formal investigations pending at the beginning of fiscal 1960, the number initiated
in fiscal 1960, the number closed or completed during the same period,
and the number pending at the end of the fiscal year:

When securities are to be offered to the public, their markets are
watched. very closely to make sure that the price is not unlawfully
raised prior to or during the distribution.
Registered offerings numbering 1,398, having a value of over $14 billion, and 1,049 offerings

84

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

exempt under Section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, having a value of
about $215 million, were so observed during the fiscal year. Other
offerings numbering 324, such as secondary distributions and distributions of securities under special plans filed by the exchanges, having
a total value of $360 million, were also kept under surveillance.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution. It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the restrictions provided by the Commission's Rules 10b-6, 7, and 8. These
rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for
the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to prevent unlawful manipulation.
During 1960 stabilizing was effected in connection with stock offerings aggregating 52,794,825shares having an aggregate public offering
price of $1,169,737,429and bond offerings having a total offering price
of $181,060,000. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions resulted
in the purchase of 1,301,132shares of stock at a cost of $28,938,359and
bonds at a cost of $4,123,773. In connection with these stabilizing
transactions, 9,213 stabilizing reports showing purchases and sales of
securities effected by persons conducting the distribution were received
and examined during the fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY HOLDINGS AND TRANSACTIONS

Section 16 of the Act is designed to prevent the unfair use of information by directors, officers and principal stockholders by giving publicity to their security holdings and transactions and by removing the
profit incentive in short term trading by them in securities of their
company. Such persons by virtue of their position may have information as to the company's condition and prospects which is unavailable to the general public and may be able to use such information
to their personal advantage in transactions in the company's securities. Provisions similar to those contained in Section 16 of the Act
are also contained in Section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and Section 30 of the Investment Company Act
of 1940.
Ownership Reports

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires every person who is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10
percent of any class of equity securities (other than exempted securities) which is registered on a national securities exchange, or who

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

85

is a director or officer of the issuer of such securities, to file reports
with the Commission and the exchange disclosing his ownership of
the issuer's equity securities. This information must be kept current by filing subsequent reports for any month in which a change
in his ownership occurs. Similar reports are required by Section
17(a) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of officers and
directors of public utility holding companies and by Section 30(f)
of the Investment Company Act of officers, directors, principal security holders, members of advisory boards and investment advisers or
affiliated persons of investment advisers of registered closed-end
investment companies.
All ownership reports are available for public inspection as soon
as they are filed at the Commission's officein Washington and reports
filed pursuant to Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act may
also be inspected at the exchanges where copies of such reports are
filed. In addition, for the purpose of making the reported information available to interested persons who may not be able to inspect the
reports in person, the Commission summarizes and publishes such
information in a monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions
and Holdings," which is distributed by the Government Printing
Officeon a subscription basis. Increasing interest in this publication
is evidenced by the increase in the total circulation from a rate of
about 8,000 at the end of the 1959 fiscal year to more than 10,000at the
end of the 1960fiscal year.
During the fiscal year, 38,821 ownership reports were filed. This
represents a slight decrease from the 39,275 reports filed during the
1959 fiscal year but is still substantially greater than the yearly average of 23,472 reports filed during the first 25 years of the reporting
requirements. The following table shows details concerning reports

Recovery of Short Swing Trading Profits by Issuer

In order to prevent insiders :from making unfair use of information
which may have been obtained by reason of their relationship with a
company, Section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, Section 17(b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and Section 30(f) of the
Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of
the issuer of any profit realized by insiders :from certain purchases
and sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within
any period of less than six months. The Commission has certain
exemptive powers with respect to transactions not comprehended
within the purpose of these provisions, but is not charged with the
enforcement of the civil remedies created thereby.
REGlJLATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under Sections 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12(e) of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20(a) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, the Commission has adopted
Regulation 14 requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents and authorizations in respect of securities of companies subject
to those statutes. The regulation includes provisions that when the
management is soliciting proxies, any security holder desiring to
communicate with other security holders for a proper purpose may
require the management to furnish him with a list of all security
holders or to mail his communication to security holders for him. A
security holder may also, subject to reasonable prescribed limitations,
require the management to include in its proxy material any appropriate proposal which such security holder desires to submit to a vote
• Form U-17-1 Is used for Initial reports and Form U-17-2 for reports of changes of
ownership.
• Form N-30F-1 Is used for Inltlal reports and Form N-30F-2 for reports of changes

of security holders. Any security holder or group of security holders
may at any time make an independent proxy solicitation upon compliance with the proxy rules, whether or not the management is
making a solicitation.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed
solicitation. Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed
disclosure standards, the management or other group responsible for
its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to
avoid such defects in the preparation of the proxy material in the
definitive form in which it is furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1960 fiscal year, 2,089 proxy statements in definitive
form were filed under the Commission's Regulation 14 for the solicitation of proxies of security holders; 2,071 of these were filed by management and 18 by nonmanagement groups or individual stockholders.
These 2,089 solicitations related to 1,876companies, some 200 of which
had more than one solicitation during the year, generally for a special
meeting not involving the election of directors.
There were 1,864 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors,
207 for special meetings not involving the election of directors, and
18 for assents and authorizations for action not involving a meeting of
security holders or the election of directors.
In addition to the election of directors, the decisions of security
holders were sought through the solicitation in the 1960 fiscal year
of their proxies, consents and authorizations with respect to the
following types of matters:
Mergers, consolidations,
acquisltdons

purchases

Stockholders' Proposals

During the 1960 fiscal year, 42 stockholders submitted a total of 130
proposals which were included in the 94 proxy statements of 94
companies under Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14.

88

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security
holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or by-laws
to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors, limitations on the granting of stock options and their exercise by key employees and management groups, the sending of a post-meeting report
to all stockholders, changing the place of the annual meeting of
stockholders, and the approval by stockholders of management's
selection of independent auditors.
The managements of 22 companies omitted from their proxy statements under the Commission's Rule 14a-8 a total of 48 additional proposals submitted by 32 individual stockholders. The principal reasons
for such omissions and the numbers of times each such reason was involved (counting only one reason for omission for each proposal even
though it may have been omitted under more than one provision of
Rule 14a-8) were as follows:
(a) 11 proposals related to the ordinary conduct of the company's
business;
(b) 11 proposals were not a proper subject matter under State
law;
(c) 9 proposals concerned a personal grievance against the company;
(d) 5 proposals were resubmitted after not having received sufficient affirmative votes at a previous meeting;
(e) 1 proposal was not timely submitted;
(f) 4 proposals and reasons therefor were deemed misleading;
(g) 1 proposal involved the election of directors; and
(h) 6 proposals were withdrawn by the stockholders.
Ratio of Soliciting to Non-Soliciting Companies

Of the 2,307 issuers that had securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges as of June 30, 1960,2,030 had voting securities so listed and registered.
Of these 2,030 issuers, 46 listed and
registered voting securities after their annual stockholders' meeting
in fiscal 1960; thus, of the remaining 1,984 issuers with voting securities, 1,607, or 81 percent, solicited proxies under the Commission's
proxy rules during the 1960 fiscal year for the election of directors.
Proxy Contests

During the 1960 fiscal year, 25 companies were involved in proxy
contests when nonrnanagement persons :filed detailed statements as
participants, or proposed participants, under the requirements of Rule
14a-ll when proxies are to be solicited from stockholders for the election of directors. A total of 382 persons, including both management
and nonrnanagement, filed such statements in 16 cases for control of the
board of directors and 9 cases for representation on the board.
Management retained control in 12 of 16 contests, 1 was settled by
negotiation, and 3 were pending as of June 30, 1960. Of the 9 cases

TWENTY -SIXTH

where representation on the board was involved, management retained
all places on the board in 7 and in the other 2 cases nonmanagement
persons were elected to the board.
REGULATION OF BROKER-DEALERS AND OVER-mE-COUNTER
MARKETS
Registration

Section 15(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires the registration of all brokers and dealers who use the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect or induce transactions in securities
in the over-the-counter market. Exemptions from registration are
afforded to those brokers and dealers that conduct an exclusively intrastate business or deal only in exempt securities, commercial paper,
commercial bills or bankers' acceptances.

Proceedings

The power of the Commission to deny or revoke the registration of
a broker-dealer is provided by Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act. An order of denial or revocation will issue if the Commission finds that such a sanction is in the public interest and that the
applicant or registrant, or any partner, officer,director or other person
directly or indirectly controlling or contolled by such applicant or
broker-dealer is subject to a specific statutory disqualiflcation.
These
disqualifications, in general, are:
(1) willful false or misleading statements in the application or
documents supplemental thereto;

90

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(2) conviction within 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of securities or any conduct
arising out of business as a broker-dealer;
(3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction against engaging in any practices in connection with the purchase or
sale of securities;
(4) willful violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934:or any of the Commission's rules
and regulations thereunder.
Revocation or denial must be preceded by appropriate notice to the
named broker-dealer and an opportunity for a hearing before the
Commission.
Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act empowers the Commission to suspend or expel a broker or dealer from membership in a
registered securities association 8 upon a finding of violation of the
federal securities laws or the regulations thereunder. Section 19(a)
(3) gives similar powers with respect to membership in national
securities exchanges.
Registration may not be denied without a finding of the misconduct
specified by the Act. Therefore, bad reputation or character, or lack
of experience in the securities business cannot of itself be a basis upon
which a denial or revocation of registration can be ordered. Similarly, a previous conviction for the commission of a felony unrelated
to securities transactions does not meet the statutory standards for
denial or revocation of registration.
Pursuant to the provisions of 15A (b) (4) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, in the absence of Commission approval or direction, no
broker or dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership in
a registered securities association if the broker or dealer or any partner, officer,director or controlling or controlled person of such broker
or dealer was a cause of any order of revocation or suspension or
expulsion from membership which is in effect. An individual named
a cause often is subject to one or more statutory disqualifications under
Section 15(b) and his employment by any other broker-dealer thus
could also become a basis for broker-dealer revocation proceedings
against the new employer.
Set forth below are statistics dealing with administrative proceedings instituted to deny and revoke registration and to suspend and
expel from membership in the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. or an exchange.
• The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Is the only securities association
registered with the Commission.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Action was taken this past year in the following administrative
proceedings under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act:
REVOCATION PROCEEDINGS

Hannibal Associates, Inc.-The Commission revoked. the brokerdealer registration of Hannibal Associates, Inc. and named. Donald
M. Boris as a cause of the revocation. The Commission found that
registrant willfully violated the registration and anti-fraud provisions
of the securities laws in connection with the offer and sale of the common stock of Alaska-Dakota Development Company. Registrant
made false and misleading statements concerning registrant's business
standing, Alaska's assets and business prospects as well as the ownership of Alaska's stock,"
Stratford Securities Co., Inc.-The broker-dealer registration of
Stratford Securities Co., Inc. was revoked by the Commission on findings that registrant sold approximately 32,000 shares of the unregistered stock of General Oil and Industries Co., Inc. in violation of the
registration provisions of the Securities Act and in connection therewith made false and misleading statements concerning General's
assets and prospects, and possible appreciation in the market price
of General's stock, and that the United States District Court for the
Southern District of New York had issued a preliminary injunction
restraining registrant and its officers from further violations of the
registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act in the
sale of General's stock."
Rock Frederick Houle, doing business as DeNurf & Co.-The Commission decided that it was necessary and appropriate in the public
interest to revoke registrant's broker-dealer registration and to deny
his request for withdrawal. Registrant's brother, Louis R. Houle,
had acquired unregistered stock of International Copper Development Corporation from a controlling stockholder for the purpose
of resale to the public. Registrant participated in this undertaking
by selling part of the shares. Houle and his brother were found to be
underwriters within the meaning of Section 2(11) of the Securities
Act. The Commission found that the sale of the unregistered shares
of International was in violation of Section 5 of the Securities Act and
also found that in connection with these sales registrant made false
and misleading statements concerning, among other things, International's properties, earnings, and possible dividends, and the prospective value of the stock. In addition, Houle was found to have filed a
false financial statement with his registration application, to have

failed to file his initial report of financial condition, and to have failed
to make his books and records available for inspection."
Ned J. Bowman Company.-Registrant
sold shares of unregistered stock of Lavender Uranium Corporation in violation of Section
5 of the Securities Act, and as a result the United States District
Court for the District of Utah permanently enjoined it from further
violations of Section 5 in connection with the sale of that stock. In
rejecting registrant's claim that the offering was exempt from registration as an intrastate offering, the Commission held that an exemption under Section 3(a) (11) of the Securities Act would not be established merely by showing that the initial purchasers were residents of
one state. Securities cannot be considered sold exclusively to residents
within the meaning of Section 3(a) (11) if the purchasers distribute
the securities to persons in other states. Thus, if any person purchasing the securities for resale rather than for investment sells them to a
non-resident, the exemption is defeated as to the entire issue. Moreover, the Commission found that registrant did not take any effective
steps to restrict the offering to residents of Utah purchasing for investment and in fact a number of shares were resold to public investors in other states. In addition, registrant willfully failed to consummate security transactions promptly in violation of the anti-fraud
provisions of the securities laws. Based upon the foregoing, the registration as a broker-dealer of Ned J. Bowman Company was revoked
and K. Ralph Bowman and Ramon N. Bowman were each named as
a cause of the order of revocation."
Security Investment Corporation.The broker-dealer registration
of Security Investment Corporation was revoked by the Commission
and Charles R. Hixon and Wilmer J. Landry were found to be causes
of the order of revocation. The Commission found that registrant in
the sale of its own securities made false and misleading statements
concerning the safety of the investment, the amount invested by its
officers, the distribution of the stock, and expansion of its operations.
Because the bank in which registrant deposited the checks granted the
registrant "immediate solvent credit", registrant contended that the
depository bank acted as principal and therefore registrant could not
be charged with the use of the mails by the bank in connection with
registrant's sale of the securities involved. The Commission stated
that even if the depository bank had acted as principal in these transactions registrant would have been chargeable with knowledge that
the mails would be used to effect collection, and, under the anti-fraud
provision herein involved, any use of the mails related to a fraudulent selling scheme would satisfy the jurisdictional requirements of

the securities laws. Registrant also filed a false and misleading financial statement with its application for registration and failed to file reports of financial condition for the years 1956through 1958Y
Ronald I. Gershen, doing business as R. I. Gershen Co., and
R. I. Gershen & Co., Inc.-The Commission found that Ronald I.
Gershen while employed by another broker-dealer offered and sold the
common stock of Belmont Oil Corporation by means of false and misleading statements concerning, among other things, the return of the
purchase price, future increases in price, issuance to stockholders of
warrants to acquire shares at less than market price, and the value of
Belmont's oil reserves. The Commission revoked Gershen's brokerdealer registration and also denied the applicrution for registration of
R. 1. Gershen & Co., Inc., naming Gershen as a cause of the order of
denial.>
Earl L. Robbins, doing business as Robbins & Company.-Robbins sold stock of Delta Oil Company of Utah (Delta) to 80 public
investors and to a number of broker-dealers in various parts of the
United States in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Also, the registrant had fraudulently engaged in
the securities business without disclosing that he was insolvent, extended credit in violation of Regulation T, failed to comply with the
net capital requirements and did not keep required books and records.
Based upon the foregoing, the broker-dealer registration of Earl L.
Robbins was revoked by the Commission."
Frederic R. Mayo, doing business as The Bristol Securities Company.-The Commission revoked the registration as a broker-dealer
of Frederic R. Mayo and found John P. Hanley, a salesman and office
manager for registrant, to be a cause of the revocation. Registrant
offered and sold bonds of National Finance Company by means of
false and misleading representations that they would be redeemed by
National at any time at full face value, while omitting to state that
the bonds, which matured in ten years, would have to be held to maturity and that there was no obligation on the part of National to
redeem said bonds at any time prior to maturity. Registrant also
failed to file reports of financial condition for the years 1956 through
1958.'6
H. Carroll & Co.-The Commission revoked the broker-dealer registration of H. Carroll & Co., naming Howard P. Carroll as a cause
of the revocation. Registrant sold to customers 300,000unregistered
shares of Comstock Limited stock which it had acquired from controlling persons. The purported reliance upon advice of counsel was

not sufficient to preclude a finding by the Commission of a willful
violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. A finding of willfulness does not requires that the Commission find an intent
to violate; it is sufficient that there was an intent to do the act which
constitutes the violation. In connection with the sales, registrant
made false and misleading statements concerning, among other things,
Comstock's properties, dividends, and prospects, and increases in the
price of Comstock stock."
Robert W. Wilson.-The
Commission found that Wilson violated
the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the securities laws in that
he sold unregistered stock of Wyoming Oil Company at prices not
reasonably related to the then prevailing market price and falsely
represented to customers that it was a good investment at the selling
price. In addition, pursuant to a complaint filed by the Commission,
the United States District Court for the District of Colorado permanently enjoined Wilson from making false or misleading statements
in the offer or sale of Wyoming stock. As a result, his broker-dealer
registration was revoked by the Commission."
W. T. Anderson Company, Inc.-Louis Payne and W. T. Anderson
were named by the Commission as causes of the order of revocation of
the broker-dealer registration of W. T. Anderson Company, Inc.
Registrant, in connection with the purchase and sale of stock in five
mining companies, made false and misleading statements and engaged in a course of business which operated as a fraud and deceit
upon customers in willful violation of anti-fraud provisions of the
securities laws. Registrant followed the practice of making purchases from one group of customers and contemporaneously selling
shares of the same stock to other customers at substantial mark-Ups.
usually 100 percent over the prices registrant was paying. Payne
registrant's salesman, gave inconsistent advice to different customers.
urging one customer to sell shares to registrant at half the price he was
simultaneously urging another customer to pay for the same shares.
In these transactions Payne did not disclose to either customer that the
advice being given was inconsistent with the advice contemporaneously being given to others, or that the prices paid and received had
no reasonable relation to registrant's contemporaneous costs or resale
prices and generally represented mark-ups or mark-downs of 100
percent. The Commission was not precluded by the alleged dissolution of the registrant from finding that the public interest required
that the registration be revoked and making findings with respect to
registrant and associated persons."

to show changes in its business address, resignation of certain officers

Eugene D. Eyre, registrant's president was not served with a notice

broker-dealer registration."

Registrant was found to have failed to disclose to investors that it
established the market price of Mio Dio stock in a noncompetitive
market which it dominated and controlled.
The Commission held, "It
is well established that a dealer, in quoting prices to customers and
selling at such prices, impliedly represents that the sales price bears
some relation to the price prevailing in a free and open market.
Such
representation is false where, as here, the dealer dominates and controls the market and fixes the prices of the stock." The Commission
found that Feinberg and Sterling, then president and secretary-treasurer, respectively, of the registrant were responsible for the failure to
disclose. In addition, registrant was found to have failed to disclose in its application for registration the identity of a beneficial
owner of more than 10 percent of its stock and to amend such application to disclose a change in the beneficial ownership of its stock. The
Commission also decided that the public interest required revocation
of the broker-dealer registrations of Marc Sterling & CO.23and Columbia Securities Company, Inc. of Wyoming, which were controlled respectively by Sterling and Feinberg. Sterling was named a cause of
the revocation of Marc Sterling & Co. and Feinberg a cause of the
revocation of Columbia."

denied the petition of Feinberg and Columbia for rehearing."

Fred T. Garner, doing business as Fred T. Gamer Investments.In connection with the offer and sale of the common stock of Rangely
Oil & Gas Company, registrant sent through the mail letters to customers and prospective customers in which he made false and misleading
statements as to purchases of Rangely stock by Rangely's president, the president's expectations as to possible dividend payments
and increases in the market value of the stock. By reason of the above,
registrant was found to have engaged in a course of conduct which
operated as a fraud upon customers. Garner also failed to keep proper
books and records and to make them available for examination and did
not file a certified report for the year 1958. His broker-dealer registration was revoked on the basis of these violations."
George Wales Allen, doing business as G. W. Allen & Company.The registration of George Wales Allen was revoked by the Commission upon findings that registrant failed to keep accurate books and
records, did not file amendments correcting his registration application, sold securities at excessively high mark-ups and failed to furnish
customers with proper confirmations of transactions. The fact that
the dollar amount of profit to the registrant was not large did not
negate the finding that he violated the standard of fair dealing to
which the Commission holds broker-dealers, since the fraud lay not
in the amount of profit realized but in the inherent misrepresentation
as to the current value of the securities."
Albert & Company, Inc. (a New York corporation), Albert & Company, Inc. (a New Jersey corporation).-These
broker-dealer registrations were revoked by the Commission and Eli D. Albert, officer and
controlling stockholder of both companies, was named as a cause of

injunction has been issued by the Supreme Court of the State of New
York, New York County, barring the New York registrant from
engaging in the securities business in the State of New York. A complaint filed in the State action alleged that the registrant sold a million shares of the common stock of Mohawk Business Machines for
approximately a million dollars by means of fraudulent representations. Pursuant to a complaint filed by the Commission, the United

the registrant had made false and misleading statements in the offer
and sale of the securities of Asco, Inc. and Continental Underwriters,
Inc. and had misappropriated customers' checks and various things of
value including appliances, automobiles, real estate, and shares of
stock in other companies, which were given in payment for such securities. In connection with the sales of Continental stock and the disposition of other securities received in settlement of such sales, registrant
failed to send customers confirmations of the transactions involved.

its application for registration and violated the Commission's net

Best Securities, Inc.-The
Commission revoked the broker-dealer
registration of Best Securities, Inc. and expelled it from membership
in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. Morton Livenston, Ludwig J. Kabian, and Judah Cohen, also known as Judd Cohen,

of the common stock of North Carolina Telephone Company to nearly
300 investors in various parts of the United States, by means of false
and misleading statements concerning the future market price of the
stock, dividend payments and possibilities of merger with other telephone companies.
Registrant's
activities violated the anti-fraud
provisions of the securities laws which also contemplate that recommendations of a security to a prospective purchaser shall have a reasonable basis and be accompanied by disclosure of known or easily
ascertainable facts bearing upon the justification of the recommendations. The sales methods of registrant were classified by the Commission as of a type customarily used to place a customer in a position
where he is asked to make a hasty decision to buy securities of a speculative nature on the basis of oral and undocumented representations
promising quick profits by an unseen and unknown person skilled in
high-pressure selling teclmiques and inaccessible to complaints. Registrant also failed to amend its registration application to disclose
an injunction against one of its salesmen."

as a cause of denial upon findings that registrant failed to list in the
application, as required, an owner of 10% of its securities, and grossly
overstated its assets in a financial statement filed as a supplement
thereto. The statement showed as of December 15, 1958, total assets of
$17,500, no liabilities, and a net worth of $17,500. The Commission
found, however, that as of that date applicant's assets totaled only
$1,000.69
Chester Richard Koza, doing business as Chester R. Koza & Co.Koza, who had an Indiana license to engage in the securities business,
had also effected interstate securities transactions without being registered with the Commission. The Commission found that during the
period from January 1958 until May 1959 the books which applicant
kept for his broker-dealer business reflected securities sales totaling
$21,000, all of which were intrastate transactions.
However, during
the same period of time, applicant had also entered into additional
securities transactions totaling over $237,000, some of which were
interstate transactions.
These transactions were entered on the books
of a food brokerage business, also a sole proprietorship, from which
applicant derived most of his income. The Commission rejected
applicant's contention that the interstate transactions could be considered "individual" rather than as part of his securities business,
reaffirming the rule that in the case of a sole proprietorship there is
no valid basis for making such distinction.
In denying this application, the Commission also found that Koza is permanently enjoined by
the United States District Court for the Southern District of Indiana,
Indianapolis Division, from further violations of the registration
provisions of the Securities Act in connection with sale of securities of

receive, and commissions paid in connection with the sales,"

the past fiscal year the Commission suspended the registrations of
several broker-dealers after hearings at which evidence was produced
that serious misconduct was currently being engaged in by the respondents. To prevent further harm to investors the Commission
determined that it was in the public interest to suspend those registrations pending a full hearing on the question of revocation. The
entry of an order of suspension is not determinative of the ultimate
questions of whether willful violations have been committed and an
order of revocation should be entered which are resolved only after a
further hearing at which additional evidence may be presented by all
parties to the proceeding.
International Investments, Inc.-Registrant
consented to suspension of its broker-dealer registration. The Commission found
suspension was appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of investors. The Commission determined that John K. Gibbs,
president, director, and controlling stockholder of the registrant, was
permanently enjoined on June 11, 1959 by the United States District
Court for the District of Columbia from further violations of the
registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933
in connection with the offer and sale of the common stock of International Corporation, a non-existent corporation. Prompt action prevented any substantial fraud on the public. At the close of the fiscal
year, revocation proceedings were pending against registrant."
Phoenix Securities Corp.-Registrant
admitted for the purposes
of the hearing on the question of suspension of registration that it
offered and sold the unregistered common stock of General Oil Industries Co., Inc., and in connection therewith made materially false
and misleading statements concerning, among other things, the issuer's
assets, stock, and prospects. The violations and record so far made
were deemed a sufficient showing to require suspension of this registration, which order was entered by consent. At the end of the
fiscal year, revocation proceedings were pending,"
Peerless-New York, Incorporated.- The Commission found that
registrant is subject to two preliminary injunctions entered by the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York on
December 11, 1959,enjoining it from further violations of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in
connection with the offer and sale of the stock of Belmont Oil Corporation. On February 3, 1958, the same court had issued an injunction
temporarily restraining registrant from further violations of the Commission's net capital rule. The Commission deemed the injunctions

Milton R. Aronson, doing business as Aronson & Co.-The Commission found, on the basis of stipulation and a consent to suspension
entered into by Aronson, that he is permanently enjoined by a decree
of the United States District Court for the Southern District of California, Central Division, from engaging in securities transactions in
violation of the anti-fraud, net capital, bookkeeping, and reporting
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and that he violated
the net capital rule and record-keeping provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act, made false entries in his books and records, and failed
to file a report of financial condition for 1958. The Commission
entered an order suspending his broker-dealer registration 75 and subsequently revoked his registration. 76
George H. Hildebrand, doing business as Hildebrand & Co., Atlas
Securities, Inc.-Atlas
Securities, Inc., succeeded to the business of
George H. Hildebrand & Co. on October 1, 1958. The registrants
consented to suspension of their broker-dealer registrations and admitted for purposes of this proceeding that Atlas had engaged in
securities transactions while msolvent and in violation of the Commission's net capital rule. The Commission concluded that suspension was appropriate in the public interest and for the protection of
investors. Revocation proceedings against the registrants were pending at the end of the fiscal year,"
Other Sanctions

Reynolds & Co., Reynolds & Company, Incorporated.-The
Commission suspended Reynolds & Co. from membership in the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. upon findings that willful
violations of the securities laws occurred in Reynolds' branch offices
in Carmel, Berkeley and San Francisco, California, and Chicago,
Illinois, and that Reynolds and certain of its partners and supervisory
personnel failed to exercise proper supervision over branch office
employees.
The Commission analyzed transactions of Patrick H. Coleman, Jr., a
salesman in the Carmel Office, in four discretionary investment accounts of customers and concluded that all four accounts were grossly
overtraded in light of the character of the accounts. In one account, an
average investment of $57,310 was turned over 29 times in a 46-month
period, with purchases totalling $1,664,572 and sales totalling $1,651,907. Of 318 "in-and-out" transactions in this account, about 158 were
completed within 30 days, with 22 being completed on the same day

or the following day. William R. Rice, the managing partner of Reynolds' West Coast branch offices, and Wilfred C. Aldous, the manager
of the Carmel Office, were found to have failed to exercise proper supervision over Coleman's activities although they were aware of the
large volume of trading in the accounts and his confidential relationship to the customers.
The violations in the Chicago Branch Office involved unauthorized
transactions in customers' accounts and forgery of a customer's name
by an employee of that office. In one case as many as 18 unauthorized
transactions were effected in a period of less than four months. In another case, securities which were purchased without authorization in
one customer's account were, after complaints by the customer, transferred to the account of another customer pursuant to his purported
authorization which was forged by the salesman. The price charged
to the second customer was some $1,800 more than the market price at
the time of the transaction. Elmer J. Stefany, head cashier and office
manager of the Chicago Office, Robert B. Whittaker, the resident manager, and John G. White, the resident partner, approved this transfer
of securities. The Commission characterized their conduct as "a
reckless failure to inquire into the high1y questionable circumstances
as well as active participation in an improper transfer of a loss to
another customer." Despite discovery of these facts by the firm, the
salesman was permitted to continue his activity without restriction.
The record further showed 40 violations of Regulation T in the handling of 14 accounts by the salesman. The Commission found that
Reynolds had, in fad, exercised no control or supervision with respect
to compliance with Regulation T in the Chicago Office and that the
three supervisors involved failed also to perform their responsibilities
in this respect.
The violations which occurred in the San Francisco and Berkeley
Offices involved false and misleading statements made by Wesley S.
Roland, assistant manager of the Berkeley Office, and other employees
of registrant to induce the purchase by customers of stock in six mining
companies whose principal assets were six million shares of U & I
Uranium Inc. stock. Roland told customers, among other things, that
the stock was the "hottest thing" he had ever seen or handled, that it
was "going up tomorrow" and that "the sky was the limit." The
U & I claims were falsely represented to customers to be worth from
50 to 100 million dollars. Roland did not disclose to customers to
whom he was recommending the purchase of these securities that at
the same time he was selling his own shares of such securities (a total
of 377,500 shares were sold by him for his own account at a profit of
$100,000) .
The execution of customers' buy orders was deliberately withheld
until the market price of the stocks had increased as a result of the

TWENTY -SIXTH

111

inclusion, on request of Reynolds' employees, of increasingly higher
bids in the over-the-counter quotations then published by members of
the Spokane Stock Exchange. Such orders were then funneled into
the Spokane :Market despite the fact that at least some of the shares
could have been obtained at lower prices from securities dealers in
New York. The employees also participated in a publicity campaign
which resulted in the publication of newspaper articles which were
materially false and misleading. Registrant and its supervisory personnel knew that Roland and other employees were recommending
the shares of mining company stocks to their customers despite registrant's stated policy discouraging customer investment in low-price
speculative securities and were aware of the large volume involved.
Under the circumstances, the Commission felt that registrant and its
supervisory personnel failed to make an investigation regarding these
securities and the information disseminated, including reprints of
news articles, used by its employees. In fact, even after being put on
notice in November 1954 that the Commission was investigating Roland's activities, so far as appears from the record, the registrant
failed to make an effort to determine the facts or the reasons for such
investigation. The Commission determined that Rice and Wilson :M.
Dodd, manager of the Berkeley Office, had failed to exercise their
duties of supervision over these activities.
The Commission further noted that from September 1955 to December 1956 a salesman in Reynolds' Minneapolis officesold shares of a
non-existent company on his own account, without any recording
thereof on Reynolds' books, to the firm's customers and others. The
salesman had the firm's cashier issue and give to him ten checks payable to various customers amounting to over $9,900 which he appropriated for his own use after forging the endorsements of the customers. The Commission observed that the practices engaged in by this
salesman would not have been possible under an effective system of
internal control and supervision.
The Commission concluded that the aforesaid activities in the registrant's branch offices demonstrated serious and extensive misconduct
by employees in those offices and grave deficiencies in the supervision
and internal control exercised by registrant over such employees. It
reiterated the doctrine that brokers and dealers are under a duty to
supervise the actions of employees and that in large organizations it
is imperative that the system of internal control be adequate and effective and that those in authority exercise the utmost vigilance whenever even a remote indication of irregularity reaches their attention.
The Commission felt that the circumstances of this case illustrate
vividly the necessity for this doctrine and called for further consideration of its implications, particularly under the present conditions
of active markets, increased interest in securities buying, inexperienced
/568987-60-9

112

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

customers and the rapid growth and broadened operations of certain
large securities firms of which registrant, Reynolds, is one. The Commission held that all of these conditions increase the importance of
maintaining and enforcing adequate standards of supervision, and
that where failure of a securities firm and its responsible personnel to
maintain and diligently enforce a proper system of supervision and
internal controls results in the perpetration of fraud upon customers
or in other misconduct and willful violation of the Securities Act, for
the purposes of applying the sanctions provided under the securities
laws, such failure constitutes participation in such conduct and willful
violations are committed not only by the person who performed the
misconduct but also by those who did not properly perform their
duty to prevent it.
The Commission found certain mitigating circumstances, including
the action taken by Reynolds against all of the individuals involved,
the payment of nearly $300,000 in settlement of claims, the representations by Reynolds that it had settled and will continue to endeavor in
good faith to settle on an equitable basis all claims of customers in
addition to adjusting all unauthorized transactions, and the establishment by Reynolds of additional procedures for supervision and internal control in order to prevent the repetition of the aforesaid
activities. In addition, Reynolds asserted that as a result of the adverse publicity it has suffered substantial losses. The Commission
concluded that, under all the circumstances, an appropriate sanction
was to suspend Reynolds and Reynolds & Company, Incorporated, the
stock of which is wholly owned by Reynolds and several of its partners, from membership in the National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. for a period of 30 days. Rice, White, Whittaker, Dodd,
Aldous, Roland, Stefany, and Coleman were each named as a cause of
the suspension with respect to Reynolds."
Perkins & Company, Inc.-The
Commission found that the registrant willfully violated the record-keeping provisions of the Securities Exchange Act and is enjoined by the United States District Court
for the District of Massachusetts from further similar violations of
the Act. After considering all of the circumstances of the case, however, including the agreement of Ralph Leroy Perkins, registrant's
controlling stockholders, that the stipulated facts as to the violation
and injunction may be used in any future broker-dealer denial proceedings involving him, and his intention to limit future activities in
the securities business to employment as a salesman, the Commission
concluded that withdrawal of the registration was consistent with in
the public interest and the protection of investors,"

Net Capital Rule

The basic purpose of Rule 15c3-1 promulgated by the Commission
under Section 15 (c) (3) of the Securities Exchange Act is to safeguard
funds and securities held in the accounts of customers by registered
broker-dealers. This rule, commonly known as the net capital rule,
limits the quantum of indebtedness which may be incurred by a brokerdealer in relation to its capital. It provides that the "aggregate
indebtedness" of a broker-dealer may not exceed 20 times the amount
of its "net capital" as computed in accordance with the provisions of
the rule.
When it appears from an examination of reports filed by a registered broker-dealer with the Commission, or through inspection of his
books and records, that the permitted ratio is exceeded, the Commission generally notifies the offending broker-dealer of its deficiency and
affords an opportunity for compliance. Unless the capital situation
is promptly remedied, injunctive action may be taken by the Commission, and, in addition, proceedings may be instituted to determine
whether the broker-dealer registration should be revoked. During the
past fiscal year, violations of the net capital rule were charged in injunctive actions filed against 28 broker-dealers and in revocation proceedings instituted against 31 broker-dealers.
A registered broker-dealer who participates in "firm commitment"
underwritings must maintain sufficient capital to permit participation
provided by the underwriting contract without impairing the allowable capital-debt ratio prescribed by the rule. For the protection of
issuers and customers of the broker-dealer, the staff of the Commission carefully scrutinizes the latest available information concerning
the capital position of the participants to determine whether they
will comply with the net capital rule. Acceleration of the effective
date of registration statements filed under the Securities Act will be
denied where underwriting commitments may engender violations of
the net capital rule by any participating underwriter.
Once a participant is determined to be undercapitalized, he is
notified and given an opportunity to adjust his financial position so
as to meet the requirements of the rule without reducing his commitments. If he is unable to meet the rule, he must decrease his "firm
commitment" until compliance with the rule is reached. If necessary, he may have to withdraw from the underwriting or participate
on a "best efforts" basis only.
Financial Statements

Rule 17a-5, promulgated under Section 17(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act, requires registered broker-dealers to file reports of
financial condition with the Commission. These reports must be filed
annually, except that successive reports cannot be as of dates within

114

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

four months of each other. Upon the initial registration of a brokerdealer, the registrant's first financial report must be as of a date
during the period between the expiration of the first and fifth months
following the effective date of the registration. In all cases, reports
must be filed within 45 days after the date as of which the report
speaks.
The rule requires financial reports to be certified by a certified public
accountant or by a public accountant who is in fact independent. The
certification requirement does not apply where it does not appear
necessary for the protection of private investors. Pursuant to this
policy, the rule states specific conditions by which members of national securities exchanges are exempt from the necessity of certification. An exemption is also afforded a broker-dealer, who, since his
last previous report, has confined his securities transactions to the
solicitation of subscriptions as an agent for issuers, has transmitted
funds and securities promptly, and has not otherwise held funds or
securities for or owed monies or securities to customers. Certification
is not required if since the previous report, a broker-dealer has bought
and sold only evidences of indebtedness secured by liens on real estate,
and has not carried margin accounts, credit balances, or securities for
any customers.
These reports furnish one means by which the Commission and the
public can periodically evaluate the financial liquidity and responsibility of broker-dealers. The reports further provide the staff of
the Commission with information to determine compliance with the
net capital rule.
Should a broker-dealer fail to file a required report of financial
condition, the Commission will notify him of this fact and usually give
him an opportunity to file the report immediately. If immediate
compliance is not forthcoming, the Commission may institute revocation proceedings.
During the fiscal year, 4,569 reports of financial condition were
filed. This compares to the 1959total of 4,560.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

The Commission continued to place great emphasis on its program
of broker-dealer inspections. The authority for the program is contained in Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act which requires
the making and keeping of appropriate books and records and provides for regular and periodic inspection of such records. Inspections
have developed into one of the principal means for the protection of
investors for they go a long way to assure compliance with the securities laws and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Experience has shown that they not only serve to expose violations which
have already occurred, but, in addition, they often detect conditions
which if not corrected may result in harm to customers.

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

115

The process of inspection generally includes: (1) a determination
of the broker-dealer's financial condition; (2) a thorough review of
his pricing practices; (3) a careful evaluation of the safeguards employed in his handling of customers' funds and securities; and (4) a
determination of the adequacy and accuracy of disclosures made to
customers relating to their transactions.
Inspections afford protection to the public by determining whether
broker-dealer activities conform with the standards of federal securities statutes. They reveal failures to keep proper books and records.
Violations of the margin and credit provisions of Regulation T, prescribed under the Securities Exchange Act by the Federal Reserve
Board, may be uncovered. Inspectors examine individual trading accounts to inquire if there is evidence of excessive trading or switching.
Inspections have disclosed the use of improper and fraudulent sales
techniques, and the sales of unregistered securities. The inspection
program has also assisted the Commission in its administration of
the short sale and stabilization rules.
During the fiscal year, the number of completed inspections totalled
1,499. It is anticipated that with the steady increase in broker-dealer
registrations and the benefits derived from the inspection program,
the Commission will continue its policy of increasing the number of
inspections in the future.
Violations uncovered by an inspection do not necessarily provoke
Commission action. In determining whether to institute proceedings
against a broker-dealer, the Commission gives consideration to a great
number of factors. It considers the seriousness of the violation and
whether loss has been or is likely to be sustained by the public. It
looks at the history of the broker-dealer with respect to prior infractions. It seeks to determine whether the broker-dealer is aware of his
misconduct and, if so, whether it has taken steps to abate it. Generally, if these issues are resolved in the broker-dealer's favor, he is
given an opportunity to achieve compliance. If it appears that the
violations were willful, and that the protection of investors and the
public interest can best be served by disciplinary proceedings, the
Commission promptly institutes such proceedings.

AND EX!CHANGE COMMISSION

The principal stock exchanges, the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and some of the States have inspection programs
that are somewhat similar to but not identical with that of the CommISSIon. Each agency conducts its inspections, examinations or
audits in accordance with its own procedures and with particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction. Inspections by other
ag-enciescannot be adequate substitutes for Commission inspections
since they are not primarily concerned with the detection and prevention of violations of the Federal securities laws and the Commission's regulations thereunder. However, the inspection programs of
these other agencies do afford added protection to the public. For
this reason, the Commission and certain other inspecting agencies
maintain a program of coordinating inspection activities to obtain the
widest possible coverage of 'brokers and dealers and to avoid unnecessary duplication of inspections. Under this program, each inspecting agency advises the other agencies that it has started a particular
inspection, but does not report its findings to them. Information discovered in the course of such inspections or examinations indicating
serious violations of regulations administered by another agency may,
however, be called to the attention of such other agency. The program does not prevent the Commission from inspecting any firm recently inspected. by another agency and such inspections are made
whenever good cause exists.
The stock exchanges now participating in this coordination program include the American Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock
Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange, the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange, and the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 ("the Maloney
Act") provides for registration with the Commission of national securities associations. The statute requires that the rules of such associations must be designed, among other things, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices, and to perfect the mechanism of a free and open
market. Such associations serve as a medium for the cooperative sel£regulation of over-the-counter brokers and dealers. They operate under the general supervision of this Commission which is authorized to
review disciplinary actions and decisions which affect the membership
of members or applicants for membership and to consider all changes
in the rules of associations. The National Association of Securities
Dealers, Inc. (NASD) is the only association registered with the Commission under the ~\.ct.

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

117

In the Maloney Act Congress provided an incentive to membership
by permitting such associations to adopt, and the NASD has adopted,
rules which preclude a member from dealing with a non-member, except on the same terms and conditions as the member affords the
general public. As a consequence, membership is necessary to the
profitable participation in underwritings and over-the-counter trading in general, and price concessions, discounts and similar allowances
may properly be granted by members only to other members. Loss
or denial of membership due to expulsion or suspension, or other
ineligibility due to a statutory disqualification or the failure to meet
the standards of qualification established in NASD rules, thus imposes
a severe economic sanction.
Membership in the NASD reached an all-time high of 4,372 at June
30, 1960. During the year membership increased by 354, as a result of
680 admissions to, and 326 terminations of, membership.
At the same
time, there were registered with the NASD as registered representatives 90,180 individuals, including generally all partners, officers,
traders, salesmen and other persons employed by or affiliated with
member firms in capacities which involved their doing business directly with the public. The number of registered representatives increased by 12,263 during the year as a result of 22,949 initial registrations, 10,972 re-registrations, and 21,658 terminations of registrations.
At May 31, 1960, registered representatives totalled 90,536, an all-time
high figure.
NASD Disciplinary

Actions

During the fiscal year the Commission received from the NASD reports of final disciplinary decisions in 249 formal complaints cases
against members."
There is often more than a single decision in a
particular case as all decisions of District Business Conduct Committees are appealable to, or reviewable on its own motion, by the Board
of Governors.
On review, the Board may affirm, modify or reverse
such decisions or remand them for further consideration.
At times,
two or more complaints against a single member are consolidated and
disposed of in a single decision.
Each formal complaint must be based on allegations that a member
has violated specified provisions of the NASD's Rules of Fair Practice, although registered representatives of members, or persons controlling or controlled by members, may also be cited for violations or
with having been a cause of violation.
Of the 249 final decisions so
reported, 177 were based on complaints solely against member firms
and 72 others on allegations that both members and registered repre.. In addition to the 249 final decisions, the Commission received reports of 66 other
decisions that were preliminary in nature in that final decisions were subsequently
rpcelved or the matters were awaiting final action by the Board of Governors at the end
of the fiscal year.

sentatives had violated applicable rules. Of the 177 complaints directed solely against members, 28 were dismissed on findings that the
allegations had not been sustained, and in the remaining 149 cases
findings of one or more violations resulted. Of the 72 complaints
against both members and registered representatives, eight were dismissed as to all parties; ten were dismissed as to members but not representatives; and two were dismissed as to the representatives but not
the members. Findings of violations by one or more of the respondents resulted in the remaining cases brought against members and representatives.
These cases involved complaints against 130 registered
representatives, 119 of whom were found to have committed violations.
1Vhere violations were found, one or more sanctions were imposed.
The available sanctions include expulsion or suspension of the member, or revocation or suspension of registration of the registered representative, fine and censure. In some instances an individual was
found a cause of an expulsion, revocation or suspension. In many
cases, more than a single penalty was imposed, expulsion, revocation
or suspension being accompanied by a fine, and a fine being usually accompanied by censure.
During the fiscal year, 27 members were expelled; twelve were suspended for periods ranging from 15 days to two years; the registration
of 34 registered representatives was revoked and of 12 such representatives were suspended for periods ranging from 30 days to one
year; and 27 individuals were found a cause of an expulsion or revocation of registration.
Moreover, fines ranging from $20 to $25,000
were imposed on 120 members, two of whom were also expelled. Only
the minimum penalty of censure was imposed on 18 members. Fines
ranging from $25 to $25,000 were imposed on 68 representatives, including 13 whose registrations were also revoked and two whose registrations were suspended. Three representatives were sanctioned only
to the extent of censure. In a substantial majority of the cases, some
or all of the costs of the proceedings were assessed against the parties
found to have been in violation. Fines or costs imposed on an expelled
member or a revoked registered representative are rarely paid but in
the fiscal year the NASD collected total fines of $86,811.43, and costs
of $15,766.28.
During the year the NASD also reported to the Commission the
disposition of 12 cases by Minor Violation Procedure, a procedure
used exclusively where the facts are not in dispute and where the
matter involves only minor or technical violations of the rules with no
significant damage to customers or others. Under this procedure, a
member may waive a hearing, admit the allegations of violations and
accept a penalty which cannot exceed a fine of $100. The member's
right of appeal or to formal complaint treatment, and the right of

Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary

Action

Section 15A(g) of the Act provides that disciplinary actions by the
NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion or
on the timely application of any aggrieved person. This section also
provides that the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the NASD
is automatically stayed pending such review. Section 15A(h) of
the Act defines the scope of the Commission's review in proceedings to
review disciplinary action of the NASD. If the Commission finds
that the disciplined person engaged in such acts or practices, or has
omitted such acts as found by the NASD, and that such acts, practices,
or omissions to act are in violation of such rules of the Association
as have been designated in the determination, and that such conduct
was inconsistent with just and equitable principal of trade, the Commission must dismiss such review proceedings. However, if the Commission finds that the penalties imposed are excessive or oppressive,
having due regard to the public interest, it must cancel or reduce such
penalties. At the beginning of the fiscal year seven review proceedings
were pending before the Commission. During the year seven additional applications for review were filed, five were disposed of, and one
was rejected as untimely.v leaving eight review proceedings pending
at the close of the fiscal year."
The Commission dismissed an application filed by Raymond G.
Chalikian for review of an order of the NASD revoking his registration as a registered representative of Reynolds & CO.53 The Commission's opinion sustained the finding of the NASD that Chalikian had
deceived a customer as to the status of his account and had forged
the customer's signature to a margin account, and that by such conduct
Chalikian had violated specified NASD rules of fair practice. The
Commission also held that the penalty of revocation was not oppressive or excessive.
The Commission also ruled on an application by A. J. Grayson
and Co., Inc. for a Commission review of an Association order which
expelled it from membership and revoked the registration of Albert
81 The Commission rejected
as untimely an application for review filed on behalf of
A. L. Pennock Smith some 20 days after the expiration of the period within which appeal
Is a matter of right. An opportunity to explain why a timely application could not have
been filed was Ignored. Smith's registration as a registered representative was revoked
for unsuitable recommendations to a customer which constituted conduct Inconsistent
with just and equitable prfnelpafs of trade. File 16-1.A96.

J. Grayson, its president and sole stockholder, as a registered representative upon findings that the member had transacted business while
unable to meet its current liabilities and while in violation of the
Commission's net capital rule." In an independent action, described
elsewhere in this report, the Commission revoked the broker-dealer
registration of A. J. Grayson and Co., Inc., expelled it from NASD
membership, and found Grayson a cause of such action." In view of
this direct Commission action, the review proceeding was dismissed as
moot.
A review petition filed on behalf of L. C. Fisher Company raised
a novel question." The NASD found that the firm violated applicable
rules by effecting transactions in mutual :fund shares which were not
suitable for the customers involved. The NASD suspended the firm
from membership :for 90 days, censured it, fined it $500 and assessed
costs. Following an appeal to the Commission, the firm produced and
sought to introduce newly discovered evidence consisting of correspondence in which the firm advised particular customers that, because
of the sales charge involved, they should not engage in "switching"
between mutual funds, and in which it refused to sell the customers out
of one fund and reinvest the proceeds in another fund. The NASD
and the firm joined in a request that the Commission remand the matter
to the NASD for further consideration. This request was granted.
This decision was consistent with Commission policy as expressed in
its Rule 15ag-l (d) that a person aggrieved by any NASD disciplinary
action is not entitled to adduce additional evidence on review before
the Commission, except up on a showing that such additional evidence
is material and that there were reasonable grounds for failure to
adduce it before the NASD. Upon reconsideration, the Board of
Governors dismissed the complaint against the firm, which in effect
nullified the findings of violations by the firm and expunged the
penalties.
The question of the introduction of additional evidence on Commission review of NASD disciplinary action also arose in connection with
applications for review filed by Gerald M. Greenberg and Robert
Leopold, registered representatives formerly associated with H. Carroll & Co. The NASD held that the member, Howard Carroll, its
president, Greenberg, its treasurer, and Leopold, its vice president,
had violated NASD rules of fair practice. The violations found included the sale of securities to customers at unfair prices, unsuitable
recommendations to customers, failure to register a branch office and
individuals required to be registered as registered representatives, and
failure to comply with the prompt-payment provisions of Regulation

T. The member was expelled from membership and the registrations
of the three individuals as registered representatives were revoked.
Greenberg and Leopold, who held about ten percent and thirty percent, respectively, of the member's outstanding stock filed a motion to
present evidence before the Commission as to their lack of control over
the member, a move opposed by the NASD on grounds that there had
been no showing of reasonable grounds for failure to produce such
evidence before it. The Commission denied the motion on the ground
that movants had stipulated before the NASD as to their responsibilities for violations by the member and had been given repeated opportunities to present additional evidence, but had not done SO.81
In considering the merits of the applications for review, the Commission sustained NASD findings that its rules had been violated in
the respects indicated; held that Greenberg and Leopold must share
in the responsibility therefor; concluded that the penalties imposed
were not excessive or oppressive; and dismissed the appeal."
The Commission dismissed another application for review filed by
Franz Bachmann who had been expelled from membership by the
NASD on admitted violations of N.A.SD rules by conversion of customer's funds, failure to record the details of such transaction in his
books and the destruction of documents descriptive of the transaction.
The Commission held that, notwithstanding unfortunate circumstances confronting Bachmann at the time of the conversion, and the
fact that restitution was subsequently made, the penalty of expulsion
was not excessive or oppressive. 59
Commission Review of NASD Action on Membership

Section 15A(b) of the Act and the by-laws of the NASD provide
that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate in the public
interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker or dealer may
be admitted to or continued in membership if he, or any controlling or
controlled person, is under any of the several disabilities specified in
the statute or the bylaws. By these provisions Commission approval
is a condition to the continuance in Association membership of any
broker-dealer who, among other things, controls a person whose registration as a broker-dealer has been revoked, who has been expelled
from Association membership, who was found to have been a cause
of such an effective order or whose registration as a registered representative has been revoked by the NASD.

orally entered only after the matter has been submitted initially to
the Association by the member or applicant for membership. Where,
after consideration, the Association is fa vorably inclined, it ordinarily
files with the Commission an application on behalf of the petitioner.
A broker-dealer refused Association sponsorship, however, may file
an application directly with the Commission. The Commission reviews the record and documents filed in support of the application
and, where appropriate, obtains additional relevant and pertinent
evidence. At the beginning of the fiscal year, four such petitions were
pending before the Commission; during the year, five petitions were
filed, five were ruled on by the Commission, and one was withdrawn by
the petitioner prior to determination. Three such applications were
pending at the year end.
The Commission found it appropriate in the public interest to
approve five applications sponsored by the NASD for the continuance
of firms in Association membership while employing disqualified
persons. The disqualified persons so approved were:
(1) Charles J. Thornton, formerly president and only active
stockholder of Thornton and Co., to be employed by L. H. Rothchild
and CO.90 The Commission had in 1948 revoked the broker-dealer
registration of Thornton and CO.91for various manipulative activities, and the Commission's approval for Thornton's employment was
granted on representations that he would be closely supervised and
would not engage in trading with public customers.
(2) Paul T. Phiambolis, to be employed by Taussig, Day and Co.,
Inc.92 In 1955 the NASD had revoked Phiambolis' registration as
a registered representative for inducing excessive trading and for
selling securities at prices not reasonably related to the market. The
Commission, in giving approval, considered the time which had
elapsed since the events on which the disqualification was based, the
fact that the misconduct had been effected with the approval of the
prior employer and representations that responsible officers of the
proposed employer would closely supervise Phiambolis' activities.
(3) Giles E. MacQueen, Jr., who had been expelled from membership by the NASD in 1953 on findings that he had improperly used
customers' funds and securities and had failed to maintain required
books and records. The application which was filed on behalf of
Carlson and Co., the proposed employer, referred to the fact that
after the disqualification was established another NASD member
firm had been approved for continuance in membership while employing MacQueen on representations that all securities had been
returned to customers and on the understanding that MacQueen

would have limited duties and would operate under close supervision."
Ownership of this previous employer having changed, approval of
the new employment was required and was granted by the Commission, consideration being given to the prior approval, the continued
supervision and the limitation of his activities."
(4) Daniel N. Silverman, Jr., formerly president and controlling
stockholder of D. N. Silverman Co., Inc. which had been expelled from
membership by the NASD in 1958 upon findings that it had engaged
in business while insolvent and had failed to maintain required books
and records. During the fiscal year, the Commission approved two
different applications permitting Silverman's employment by NASD
member firms. The first application approved the continuance in
membership of T. J. Feibleman and CO.,95and the second, of Dorsey
and Co., Inc. 96 The first approval was granted because Silverman
owed no money or securities to any broker or dealer and he stated that
he would make continued efforts to reimburse his company's stockholders and that his activities as a supervised registered representative
would be of a different character than those which caused the disqualifying violations. After this approval was issued, T. J. Feibleman
and Co. withdrew its broker-dealer registration, resigned from the
NASD, and Feibleman became associated with Dorsey and Co., Inc.,
as a principal stockholder and vice president. The circumstances
surrounding the initial approval having changed, re-approval was
necessary and was granted by the Commission in view of the earlier
approval, Silverman's employment record with Feibleman and Co.
and the supervision under which he was to operate in the future.
(5) Emanuel Bisgeier, who had been one of several principals in
Churchill Securities Corp., to be employed by Jacwin and Costa, Inc.
The Commission revoked the broker-dealer registration of Churchill
Securities Corp. on February 10, 1959, and found Bisgeier a cause
of that order of revocation." The application was withdrawn prior
to a Commission determination."
LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

For the protection of the public, the Commission is authorized to
institute actions when violations of the Securities Exchange Act are
present or threatened. A large proportion of such actions involve unlawful activities by broker-dealers. During the past year such illegal
activities consisted primarily of violations of the anti-fraud sections
and of the provisions concerning financial responsibility and the main..

tenance of net capital and bookkeeping requirements.
Frequently the
firms involved have violated two or more of the protective provisions
of the Act. Generally, also violations of the anti-fraud provisions involve violations of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of the
Securities Act of 1933. In several of the cases, it developed that the
broker-dealer was insolvent, and on motion of the Commission, receivers were appointed by the court.
In S.E.O. v. William DO'Il{Jla8Bradford, the United States District
Court for the Southern District of California had entered an order
permanently enjoining Bradford from conducting his brokerage business in interstate commerce or by use of the mails without complying
with Commission rules which require the making and keeping current
of books and records and the filing of reports of current financial
condition. Bradford's books and records consisted merely of two suitcases containing loose and unassembled papers without intelligible
organization.
The Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed
on May 5, 1960.99
In S.E.O. v. Jack R. Dick 100 the defendant was charged with placing
orders with brokers under an assumed name when he had neither the
means nor the intention to cover such orders, and when he knew that
if he gave his correct name to the brokers they would have declined
to execute them without satisfactory arrangements
for payment.
A permanent injunction was issued.
In S.E.O. v. Gibbs &: 00.101 on June 7, 1960, a permanent injunction
was entered enjoining violations of the margin restrictions, the antifraud section, the net capital requirements and the bookkeeping requirements.
In S.E.O. v. Scott Taylor &: 00., bW.,102 the Commission brought an
action to enjoin the broker-dealer and others from violating the antifraud provisions in connection with the sale of stock of Anaconda
Lead & Silver Company. The court entered a preliminary injunction
on the basis of findings that customers of the defendant broker-dealer
were told false and untrue statements concerning the financial worth
of the company. The assertion by the defendants that they had ceased
selling the securities and did not intend to continue selling them did
not preclude the court from finding that a preliminary injunction was
necessary. The court also rejected as not germane the argument that
the injunction might result in revocation of the defendant's brokerdealer registration.
One aspect of the Commission's action involved
the question as to what information obtained by the Commission
through its investigatory process was subject to disclosure under the

of questionnaires it received but refused their production, except as to
those of any witnesses it would call at the time of trial. The court
sustained the Commission's objection that the questionnaires sought by
the defendant were irrelevant and would lead to the discovery of no
admissable evidence, and that no good cause was shown to require
production.
S.E.O. v. Arkansas Business Development Oorp.103was an action for
violation of the anti-fraud provisions. Itwas charged that defendants
falsely stated to investors that the entire proceeds of the sale would
go to the treasury of the company. Other fraudulent statements concerned the safety and prospects of the investment, and the financial
condition of the company. A temporary restraining order was obtained and is still in force pending final disposition by the court.
In S.E.O. v, Sherburn J. Dodge 104 and S.E.O. v. Smith Holly 00.,105
the Commission charged defendant brokerage firms with accepting
customers' orders and deposits of money and securities upon the representation that they were ready and able to meet all obligations, when
in fact they were insolvent. Injunctions were entered and, in the Dodge
case, a receiver was appointed to take charge of the remaining assets.

In S.E.O. v. Monte Oristo Uranium Oorp.147and S.E.O. v. Flo Mia:
Fertilizers Oorporation HS the Commission obtained final orders directing the companies to file delinquent annual reports as required by
the Act.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

As noted in previous annual reports, the Commission had filed briefs
amioue curiae in support of the validity of Rule X-16B-3, insofar as
it exempts the exercise of certain stock options from the provisions of
Section 16(b) allowing recovery by the issuer of profits realized by
officers, directors and 10 percent stockholders in transactions in the
securities of the issuer. In Van Aalten v. Hurley H9 the trial judge
held that it was unnecessary to decide the validity of the rule and
declined to express an opinion. In Oosden Petroleum Corporation v.
llf. M. Miller 150 and Oosden Petroleum Corporation v. R. L. Tollett 151
the district court granted summary judgment for the defendants
upholding the rule and stated that said rule exempts the defendants
from liability under Section 16(b). The judge specifically approved
the Commission's position in Oontinental Oil 00. v. Perlite, 176 F.
Supp. 219 and stated his agreement with the position taken by Circuit
Judge Lumbard in Greene v. Dietz.
In Standard Fruit and Steamship 001npany v. Midwest Stock Exchange 152 the Commission filed a brief amicus curiae in support of the
Midwest Stock Exchange which was defendant in a suit brought by
Standard Fruit to enjoin Midwest from trading its stock on an
unlisted basis under Section 12(a) of the Securities Exchange Act.
Midwest claimed to have succeeded to the unlisted trading rights of
Standard's stock by virtue of the absorption by Midwest of the New
Orleans Stock Exchange, where Standard had previously had unlisted
trading privileges. Standard objected to the transfer of unlisted trading in its stock from the New Orleans to the Midwest exchange on the
ground that such trading would be unauthorized under Section
12 (f) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act.
The Commission argued that Rule X-12-f-6 supported the continuance of unlisted trading in that Mid west had absorbed the New Orleans
exchange. However, the court indicated that if the rule was construed to cover this transaction it might exceed the authority conferred under Section 12(f) (1) of the Securities Exchange Act and
granted a preliminary injunction.
The Commission filed a brief amicus curiae in Hooper v, Mountain
States Securities Oorp, which involved an appeal by a trustee in bank1<7

ruptcy from the district court's dismissal of his action under Section
10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The trustee had brought suit on behalf of a corporation that
had been allegedly fraudulently induced to issue its own unissued securities in exchange for worthless assets. The Court of Appeals reversed and remanded/53 holding that a private action may be based
upon a violation of Rule 10b-5 and that a corporation which is injured
thereby is within the class entitled to seek redress for injury resulting
from a violation of the rule. The Court also held that venue for such
a suit was proper in the district where representatives of the corporation received an interstate telephone call from the architect of the
fraudulent scheme in furtherance thereof.
In Dann, et al. v. Studebaker-Paokard
Oorp., et al.154 the plaintiffs
appealed from an order dismissing a complaint which sought to set
aside past action and enjoin future action pursuant to certain contractual arrangements between the defendant and other corporations.
The complaint alleged that defendants had violated the Commission's
proxy rules in soliciting the vote of shareholders to approve those
arrangements, and sought relief under Section 14(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act, and under State law. The Commission filed a brief
amicus curiae. The brief took no position on questions of State law
raised by the appeal, but argued that (1) a private right of action may
flow from a violation of Section 14 of the Securities Exchange Act and
the Commission's proxy rules thereunder, and (2) in a "spurious"
class action for violation of the federal securities laws, the test of
"adequate representation" should be liberally applied. The case was
pending at the close of the fiscal year.

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
Under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 the Commission is charged with the regulation of interstate public-utility
holding company systems engaged in the electric utility business or
in the retail distribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction
extends to natural gas pipeline companies and other non-utility companies which are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. Although the matters dealt with embrace a variety of intricate and
complex questions of law and fact, there are three principal areas
of regulation.
The first of such areas covers those provisions of the
Act, contained principally in Section 11 (b), which require the physical integration of public-utility companies and functionally related
properties of holding company systems and the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of holding company
systems. The second area of regulation covers the financing operations
of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the acquisition
and disposition of securities and properties, and certain accounting
practices, servicing arrangements
and intercompany transactions.
The third area of regulation includes the exemptive provisions of the
Act, the provisions covering the status under the Act of persons and
companies, and those regulating the right of a person affiliated with
a public-utility company to acquire securities resulting in a second
such affiliation. Matters embraced within this area of regulation
require periodic examination by the Commission and its staff. Many
such examinations do not result in formal proceedings and others are
reflected in such proceedings only in an indirect manner when they
are related to issues principally under one or the other areas of
regulation.
The staff functions under the Act are performed primarily in the
Branch of Public Utility Regulation of the Division of Corporate
In performing its functions, the Commission's staff obRegulation.
serves and examines problems which arise in connection with transactions which are or may be subject to regulation under the Act and
discusses such problems with interested persons and companies and
advises them as to the applicable Sections of the Act, its Rules and
the Commission policy with respect thereto.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

OF REGISTERED BOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMSSUMMARY OF CHANGES

On June 30, 1960, there were 26 registered holding company systems
subject to regulation under the Act. For convenience, 18 of these 26
will be referred to in this report as "active registered systems."
Three of the remaining 8 systems, namely (1) Cities Service Company, (2) Electric Bond and Share Company, and (3) Standard Gas
and Electric Company, do not own as much as 10 percent of the voting
securities of any public-utility company operating within the United
States. These 3 systems include 4 registered holding companies since
the Standard Gas and Electric holding company system has 2 registered holding companies. As of February 29, 1960, the Commission rescinded Rule 9 under the Act which exempted certain holding companies by reason of their small size. Subsequent thereto, certain
companies sought exemption on other bases and five registered under
the AcU This subject is further discussed at page 143 of this report.
The 18 active registered systems include 19 registered holding companies since, as shown in the tabulation below, the West Penn Electric
Company holding company system has 2 registered holding companies.
Of these 19 companies, 13 function solely as holding companies and 6
function as operating companies as well as holding companies. In
these 18 active registered systems, there are 99 electric and/or gas
utility subsidiaries, 42 non-utility subsidiaries, and 12 inactive companies, totalling 172 system companies.
The following tabulation shows the number of holding companies,
electric and/or gas utility companies and non-utility companies in
each of the 18 active registered systems as at June 30, 1960, and
their aggregate assets, less valuation reserves, as of December 31. 1959:

During the fiscal year, in the General Public Utilities Corporation
system, Escudero Electric Company was merged with Manila Electric
Company, both being public-utility subsidiaries in the Philippines.
In addition, this system organized the Saxton Nuclear Experimental
Corporation, a non-utility subsidiary which will be located in Penn-

sylvania and which will construct an experimental nuclear reactor.
New England Electric System organized the Lynn Gas Company, a
public-utility, in order to separate the gas from the electric operations
of Lynn Gas and Electric Company (now Lynn Electric Company).
National Fuel Gas Company dissolved Iroquois Building Corporation, a non-utility subsidiary.
The maximum number of companies subject to the Act as components of registered holding company systems at anyone point of time
was 1,620 in 1938. Since that time additional systems have registered
and certain systems have organized or acquired additional subsidiaries,
with the result that 2,412 companies have been subject to the Act as
registered holding companies or subsidiaries thereof during the period
from June 15, 1938, to June 30, 1960. Included in this total were
223 holding companies (holding companies and operating-holding
companies), 1,037 electric and/or gas utility companies and 1,152 nonutility enterprises. From June 15, 1938, to June 30, 1960, 2,070
of these companies have been released from the regulatory jurisdiction of the Act or have ceased. to exist as separate corporate entities.
Of the remaining 342 companies, 172 are members of the 18 active
systems listed in the table on page 131 and 170 are members of the
additional 8 systems named above at page 130 which are also subject
to regulation under the Act.
Of the above-mentioned 2,070 companies, 924 with assets aggregating approximately $13 billion at their respective dates of divestment
have been divested by their respective parents and are no longer
subject to the Act as components of registered systems. The balance
of 1,146 companies includes 783 which were released from the regulatory jurisdiction of the Act as a result of dissolutions, mergers and
consolidations and 363 companies ceased to be subject to the Act as
components of registered systems as a result of exemptions granted
under Sections 2 and 3 of the Act or the grant of orders pursuant to
Section 5 (d) of the Act finding such companies had ceased to be
holding companies.
While a great many of the problems under Section 11 of the Act
existing at the time of its passage have been resolved, there remain
a considerable number of Section 11 and other significant problems
with respect to which progress is being made in the face of a variety
of difficulties which have prevented their final determination.
Certain Section 11 cases, which have required a substantial amount of time
and effort by the Commission and its staff over a long period, progressed to or near completion during the fiscal year. Examples of
such cases are the Section 11 cases involving Cities Service Company
and Standard Gas and Electric Company. Among other remaining
Section 11 and other problems are issues concerning the retainability

by The Columbia Gas System, Inc. of the properties of 10 companies
(subsequently reduced to 6) which are involved in a pending proceeding before the Commission; questions concerning the retainability of
non-utility pipeline properties by Consolidated Natural Gas Company,
issues with respect to whether Delaware Power & Light Company
may retain both its gas and electric facilities; problems in the Middle
South Utilities, Inc. system with respect to the retain ability of certain gas and transportation properties and the elimination of a minority interest in a subsidiary; issues respecting the retainability by the
National Fuel Gas Company system of oil and gas transmission businesses and respecting a minority interest in one of the subsidiaries
in the system; and problems under Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act regarding the retainability by Utah Power & Light Company of its subsidiary, The Western Colorado Power Company.
'
During the fiscal year, the Commission had under consideration
step 1 (subsequently approved) of a new plan filed by Eastern Utilities Associates and designed to accomplish the disposition of the gas
properties of its subsidiary, Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Company, which the Commission had previously ordered divested, an
application filed by Electric Bond and Share Company for an exemption pursuant to Section 3 (a) (5) of the Act and a declaration by Middle South Utilities, Inc. seeking authorization to adopt a restricted
stock option plan. Progress was also made during the fiscal year with
respect to the problems involved in proceedings pending before the
Commission under Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act to determine whether
the gas properties of New England Electric System are retainable together with its electric properties,- At present there remains only one
subsidiary of New England Electric System engaged solely in the
electric business which has a minority interest in its common stock
and as a result of discussions which took place during the fiscal year
a plan to eliminate this minority interest was subsequently filed.
DEVEWPMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL REGISTERED SYSTEMS

There is discussed below each of the active registered systems and
the other systems in which there occurred during the fiscal year 1960
significant developments other than financing transactions, which will
be discussed separately.
American Electric Power Company, Inc.

At December 31, 1959, this system had consolidated assets, less
valuation reserves, of some $1,457,811,000, and consolidated operating
revenues for the calendar year ended that date amounted to about
$323,606,000. The system sold 25.87 billion kilowatt-hours of electric

energy during the calendar year 1959, and is the largest electric holding company system subject to the Act.
During the year 1959 there was substantial growth in all phases
of the system's business, and system expenditures for new power plants,
lines, substations and other facilities totaled $116 million.
Plans were completed during the fiscal year for the start of the
Smith Mountain hydroelectric generating plant on the Roanoke River
in Virginia, a project which is unique for this system in that it involves
the building of two dams, combining conventional hydroelectric power
with pump-back storage-a system of pumping back water from the
lower to the upper reservoir during off-peak periods for reuse <luring
peak periods. When fully developed the station is expected to have a
capacity of 440,000Kw.
Ohio Power Company, a subsidiary company of American Electric
acquired during the fiscal year the electric-utility system serving
Minerva, Ohio, a community in close proximity to communities served
by Ohio Power Company,"
American Electric owns 37.8 percent of the voting securities of
Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, which, with its wholly-owned subsidiary, Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation, furnishes electric
power to an installation of the Atomic Energy Commission near Portsmouth, Ohio. There was pending before the Commission at the close
of the fiscal year the issue of whether the acquisition of such stock by
American Electric and other sponsoring companies (Ohio Edison
Co. and The West Penn Electric Company) meets the standards of
Section 10 of the Act. This issue and the organization and financing
of Ohio Valley Electric Corporation and Indiana-Kentucky Electric
Corporation, are discussed on pages 126-129 of the Commission's 23d
Annual Report.
Cities Service Company

On September 20, 1957, the Commission issued an order pursuant
to Section 11(b) (2) of the Act requiring Cities to eliminate the 48.5
percent minority stock interest in Arkansas Fuel Oil Corporation or to
dispose of its holdings of 51.5 percent.' Cities, Arkansas, and a stockholder of Arkansas petitioned the United States Court of Appeals for
the Third Circuit for review of the order. On July 22, 1958, the
Court affirmed the order of the Commission," On September 18,1958,
Cities filed a plan pursuant to Section 11(e) of the Act for the purpose of eliminating the minority interest in Arkansas. The plan provided for a division of assets of Arkansas into 2 new companies, 1 to be
owned by Cities and the other by the minority interest. Subsequently,
Cities withdrew that plan and filed a new plan providing for the exHolding Company Act Release No 14180 (March

change of 1 share of Cities common stock for each 2.4 shares of
Arkansas common stock held by the public. Hearings on the new plan
were commenced on March 31, 1959.
During the course of the hearing, certain participating stockholders
of Arkansas filed a plan under Section 11(d) of the Act for the
liquidation of the company and the sale of its assets on a basis which
would net all the stockholders of Arkansas-i.e., both Cities and the
public stockholders-$40 per share in cash. The plan gave Cities
the option to purchase certain or all of the assets of Arkansas on the
same basis. Cities stated that it would elect to exercise the option if
certain modifications which it suggested were made therein.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the Commission disapproved Cities' exchange-of-stock plan and adopted and approved the
Section 11(d) plan as modified in accordance with the suggestions
of Cities," Under the latter plan, the approximately 20,000 public
holders of 1,843,346 shares of the common stock of Arkansas would
receive a cash payment of $41 per share, or a total of $75,577,186.
The cash payment of $41 per share represented a value of $40 per
share for all of Arkansas' assets, less liabilities, plus an additional
$1 per share on the basis of a settlement with respect to certain alleged
causes of action for mismanagement asserted on behalf of the public
holders of the common stock of Arkansas against Cities and certain
of its other subsidiaries. As compared with the amount of $17.40 in
market value of the Cities stock, based on the closing market price
thereof at June 30, 1960, which would have been distributed in respect of each share of publicly-held stock of Arkansas under the
exchange-of-stock plan, the difference in the value of the distribution
to the public stockholders of Arkansas as of June 30, 1960, was approximately $43,500,000.
On September 2, 1960,the Section 11(d) plan was approved and ordered enforced by a United States District Court,"
Eastern Utilities Associates

This registered holding company and its subsidiary companies had
consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $110,260,000 at December 31, 1959. For the calendar year 1959, the system's consolidated revenues amounted to about $36,349,000.
On April 4, 1950,the Commission issued an order directing Eastern
Utilities Associates to sever its relationship with the gas properties
of its subsidiary, Blackstone Valley Gas and Electric Company," In
1956Valley Gas Company was incorporated for the purpose of acquiring and operating such gas properties. A 1957 proposal to effectuate

compliance with the order is discussed at pages 126-127 of the 25th
Annual Report. In February 1959, Eastern Utilities Associates filed
a plan, pursuant to Section 11 (e) of the Act, designed to accomplish
the disposition of the Blackstone gas properties.
The plan was in 2
steps. Step 1 provides for the transfer of the gas property and related
facilities to Valley, in exchange for the common stock, first mortgage
bonds, and 15-year unsecured promissory notes of Valley, and the
contemporaneous negotiated sale of the bonds and notes. Step 2 provides for the subsequent disposition of the common stock.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year the Commission approved
Step 1 of the plan."
The Columbia Gas System, Inc.

This registered holding company and its subsidiaries had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of about $1,195,715,000 at December 31, 1959, and consolidated gross revenues of approximately
$465,071,000 for the calendar year 1959.
As indicated at page 126 of the Commission's 25th Annual Report
there are before the Commission certain integration proceedings regarding the ultimate status of certain of the subsidiaries in the Columbia system. The matter was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
During the fiscal year 1960 Atlantic Seaboard Corporation, a
wholly-owned non-utility natural gas pipeline subsidiary of Columbia
obtained the requisite authorizations to acquire certain rights, facilities, and properties from an affiliate and from a nonaffiliate, and to
construct and operate facilities for the activation of an underground
storage pool for natural gas located in the Terra Alta field in the
Portland and Union Districts of Preston County, West Virginia.
The
initial activation of the storage pool is scheduled for the calendar
years 1960-61, but the development of its estimated maximum capacity
of 45,800,000 Mcf of natural gas is scheduled to extend over a period
of 4 years and involve aggregate expenditures of $25,000,000.10
Electric Bond and Share Company

Electric Bond and Share Company, which no longer holds as much
as 5 percent of the outstanding voting securities of any domestic
public-utility company, has pending before the Commission an application, filed pursuant to Section 3 (a) (5) of the Act, for exemption
as a holding company from provisions of the Act. In the event such
exemption is granted, it is the intention of the company to convert its
status to that of an investment company and register under the In"Vestment Company Act of 1940. The proceeding on the exemption
application involves a number of very difficult and complex issues,
among which are the questions as to whether Bond and Share may

whether, through its wholly-owned engineering and consulting service
company subsidiary, Ebasco Services Incorporated, it exercises controlling influence over, or is affiliated with, certain public-utility and
holding company clients of Ebasco which formerly were controlled
by Bond and Share. Hearings were held and the matter was under
active consideration at the end of the fiscal year.
General Public Utilities Corporation

This registered holding company and its subsidiaries, at December
31, 1959, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of about
$936,004,000. The consolidated gross operating revenues for the
calendar year 1959 were approximately $230,715,000.
During the fiscal year four of the system subsidiaries acquired all
of the capital stock of Saxton Nuclear Experimental Corporation, a
nonprofit stock corporation organized to construct, operate, and maintain a small experimental nuclear reactor. This research and developmental project will be a cooperative effort involving Saxton, the 4
stockholder companies, Westinghouse Electric Corporation, and Gilbert Associates, Inc. Saxton's corporate life is limited by charter
provision to 10 years. The contemplated reactor will be a small
(5,000 Kw electrical) developmental, pressurized water type nuclear
reactor which upon construction and operation will produce steam
to be sold to and utilized by one of General Public Utilities' subsidiaries in operating an existing standby electrical turbo-generator. Saxton has outstanding 20,000 shares of common stock held by the four
General Public Utilities subsidiaries which, from time to time, will
make cash payments to Saxton aggregating not in excess of $8,500,000.
Middle South Utilities, Inc.

This registered holding company and its subsidiary companies had
consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $754,638,000at December 31, 1959. For the calendar year 1959, the system's
consolidated revenue amounted to about $198,497,000.
Its four public-utility subsidiaries, together with 46 other utility
companies, are sponsoring the construction of an advanced type of
helium-cooled atomic power plant.
In 1953, the Commission ordered Louisiana Power & Light Company, a system subsidiary, to dispose of its non-electric properties."
In November, 1957, the Commission approved a plan filed under Section 11(e) of the Act for the transfer of such property 12 to Louisiana

joined by Middle South and Louisiana Gas, filed amendments to the
plan, providing for the sale to the stockholders of Middle South,
through subscription rights, of the common stock of Louisiana Gas.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year the Commission approved
the amended plan,>
In March 1959, Middle South filed a declaration seeking permission
to adopt a restricted stock option plan and to issue to key officers and
employees of the company and its subsidiary companies restricted
stock options as defined in Section 421 of the Internal Revenue Code.
This is the first formal proceeding dealing with the issuance of such
stock options by registered holding companies. Ohio Edison Company and the Southern Company requested and were granted leave to
file statements of position and briefs in support of the issuance of
such options by companies subject to the Act. Hearings were completed during the fiscal year and briefs were filed and oral argument
heard thereafter. The matter is pending before the Commission for
determination.
New England Electric System

As at December 31, 1959, this registered holding company and its
subsidiaries had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $612,543,000; and, for the year ended on that date. it had
consolidated operating revenues of approximately $172,424,000.
Under a proceeding instituted by the Commission in 1957 15 in respect of New England Electric System ("NEES") and its subsidiaries
to determine the extent to which the electric, gas and other business
operations of the NEES system satisfied the integration standards of
Section 11 (b) (1) of the Act, the Commission, on February 20, 1958,
issued its findings and opinion and order in which it held that the electric properties of the NEES system constituted an integrated publicutility system in satisfaction of the integration standards of the Act; 16
and at the close of fiscal year 1960 there remained pending for further
hearing and determination the question of whether any or all of the
gas properties owned and operated by the NEES system are retainable. The hearing in these proceedings was reconvened pursuant to
Commission Order 11 on May 18, 1960, to take evidence on the retainability of the NEES system's gas properties,"

the NEES system's direct presentation of its case the hearing was adjourned subject to call of the hearing officer, and the matter was pending at the close of fiscal year 1960.
On December 23, 1959, the Commission issued an order approving a
proposal by Lynn Gas and Electric Company, a public-utility subsidiary of NEES, to transfer Lynn's gas properties to a newly organized company in the NEES system, Lynn Gas Company."
Pursuant to authority granted by an order of the Commission dated
December 28, 1959, another NEES utility subsidiary, The Narragansett Electric Company, disposed of its gas properties, located in
the State of Rhode Jsland." As a result of these two transactions
none of the NEES system companies now operates a combination
electric and gas business, and all of the present NEES system gas properties are located in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts.
On December 30, 1959, the Commission issued an order under Section 13 of the Act conditionally approving a proposal by NEES to
transfer to the payroll of its subsidiary service company , New England
Power Service Company ("NEPSCO"),
the salaries of all officers and
employees of NEES who are also officers and employees of NEPSCO.21
The salaries and related expenses of the officers and employees so
transferred,
estimated to aggregate approximately
$600,000 per
annum, would then be reallocated to the operating companies of the
NEES system and to NEES on a cost basis in accordance with services
rendered by NEPSCO to the operating subsidiaries and to the parent
company. Of the $600,000, it was estimated that between $350,000
and $425,000 would be chargeable to the operating subsidiaries and
the balance to NEES. It was represented that the amounts so chargeable to the operating subsidiaries would be equivalent to 1A of 1percent
of the consolidated annual gross operating revenues of the NEES
system, and that the proposed charges would not of themselves be
the basis for seeking rate increases to consumers. In connection with
the proposed transactions, NEPSCO undertook to submit quarterly
reports to the Commission during a trial period of 18 months showing
the distribution of charges under the new arrangement.
Inasmuch
as the proposed transactions would alter in certain important respects
the intra-system servicing arrangements and the basis of charges
theretofore approved by the Commission in respect of the NEES
system," the Commission's order authorizing the proposed transactions
will, by its terms, expire at the end of such 18 month trial period unless
at or prior thereto the Commission shall have acted to continue the
authorization.

subsidiary, Pennsylvania Power Company, had consolidated assets,
less valuation reserves, of approximately $641,514,000 at December
31, 1959, and their consolidated operating revenues for the calendar
year 1959 amounted to about $150,798,000. Ohio Edison has a 16.5
percent interest in the common stock of Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, which together with a wholly-owned subsidiary, IndianaKentucky Electric Corporation, supply the power requirements of a
gaseous diffusion plant of the Atomic Energy Commission located
near Portsmouth, Ohio. Further details with respect to Ohio Valley
Electric Corporation are set forth at pages 126-129 of the 23rd
Annual Report.
During the first half of the calendar year 1960 Ohio Edison effectuated (1) a recapitalization of its common stock in the nature of a
two-for-one stock split and delivered to its common stockholders an
aggregate of 6,386,749 additional shares of common stock, (2) an
amendment to its Articles of Incorporation relating to the pre-emptive
rights of the holders of its common stock, and (3) an amendment of
its Code of Regulations so as to increase the authorized fee to be paid
certain directors for attendance at Board Meetings."
Standard Gas and Electric Company

This company is a registered holding company and owns 45.6 percent of Philadelphia Company, also a registered holding company.

Union Electric Company

Union Electric Company is a registered holding company and an
operating electric utility company. As at December 31,1959, the consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of Union Electric and its
subsidiaries amounted to approximately $589,562,000, and their consolidated operating revenues for 1959 totaled about $146,630,000.
The company has announced plans, subject to regulatory approval,
to construct a pumped-storage plant at the confluence of Taum Sank
Creek and the East Fork of the Black River in the Missouri Ozarks,
about 100 miles southwest of St. Louis. This project is designed for
pumping water into a high elevation reservoir at off-peak periods,
when efficient steam generating capacity would otherwise be idle, and
releasing the water to generate electricity when it is needed for peakload requirements. It will provide 350,000 Kw of peaking capacity
for about 8 hours when it goes into operation in 1963. The plant and
related transmission and other facilities are expected to cost about
$50,000,000.
Union Electric has filed with the Commission an application for
exemption from the provisions of the Holding Company Act pursuant
to Section 3 (a) (2) thereof. Hearings on the application were held in
Washington, D.C. and in St. Louis, Missouri. A stockholder of Union
Electric was granted leave to be heard, briefs have been filed by Union
Electric and the stockholder, and the brief of the staff of the Division
of Corporate Regulation was filed after the close of the fiscal year.
In the fiscal year, there were 5 cases before the courts arising out
of objections by J. Raymond Dyer, a stockholder of Union Electric,
to solicitation of proxies by the company's management and out of
the proxy solicitation by Dyer. As set forth in the 25th Annual Report
at page 131, the Supreme Court of the United States granted Dyer's
petition for certiorari to review the dismissal on grounds of mootness
by the Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit of Dyer's petition for
review of the Commission's orders relating to Union Electric's 1957
meeting. The Supreme Court thereafter vacated the judgment and
remanded the case to the Eighth Circuit for further consideration."
This case was reargued before the Court of Appeals on the merits
and was awaiting decision by that Court at the end of the fiscal year.
On October 12, 1959, the Supreme Court of the United States denied
Dyer's petition for a writ of certiorari 25 to review the Eighth Circuit's
decision affirming the Commission's orders permitting management to
solicit proxies for the 1958 stockholders meeting." Argument on
Dyer's petition to review the Commission's orders in connection with
the 1959 solicitation of proxies for Union Electric's meeting was also

heard by the Eighth Circuit and this matter was also pending decision
by the Court at the close of the fiscal year. The Court of Appeals
for the Eighth Circuit also heard argument and took under advisement the Commission's motion to dismiss a petition filed by Dyer
for review of alleged orders of the Commission denying Dyer's request that the Commission process Union Electric's proxy material
for its 1960 annual meeting pursuant to Rule 62 under the Act and
for review of the Commission's non-action with respect to the subsequent proxy solicitation material sent out by Union Electric to its
stockholders. As reported in the 25th Annual Report at page 132, a
related injunctive action was decided in favor of the Commission on
November 16, 1959, and Dyer was enjoined :from any further violation
of the Commission's proxy rules." Subsequently, Dyer filed a motion
to vacate the injunction, and on March 8, 1960, the court denied the
motion. This case is now pending on appeal by Dyer to the Court of
Appeals for the Eighth Circuit. In addition to the pending litigation
arising out of Union Electric's solicitation of proxies for its annual
stockholders meetings, the Commission's order of September 3, 1959,
permitting a declaration filed by Union Electric under Section 'I
of the Act to become effective, thereby authorizing Union Electric
to offer its common stock to stockholders and to offer the unsubscribed
shares to its employees, is also before the Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit. Dyer filed a petition for review, and argument on
the merits was heard by the Court on January 25, 1960. This case is
also pending decision by that Court.
Utah Power & Light Company

Utah had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $238,878,000at December 31, 1959, and consolidated operating
revenues of about $49,656,000for the calendar year 1959.
During the fiscal year, Utah amended its Certificate of Organization
and By-Laws so as to (1) increase the authorized capital and create
2,000,000 shares of cumulative preferred stock, par value of $25 per
share, (2) fix the preferences, privileges, voting and other rights and

subject to the Commission's jurisdiction thereunder.
At the beginning of the fiscal year the only matter remaining under the Holding
Company Act with respect to IHES was the fees and expenses to be
awarded in connection with the reorganization.
On October 26, 1959,
the Commission issued its Finding and Opinion and Order 29 setting
forth the fees and expenses to be allowed. The United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, in overruling the Commission with respect to certain claimants, gave controlling weight to
the amounts agreed upon between the company and the claimants and
allowed the full amounts which the company was willing to pay and
the claimants had agreed to accept. 30
Also pending at the beginning of the fiscal year were applications
for fees and expenses in connection with a plan filed by The United
Corporation under Section 11 (e) of the Act for its conversion into an
investment company. The Commission issued its Findings and Opinion and Order relating to certain claimants,"
The United States
District Court for the District of Delaware overruled the Commission with respect to certain claimants, finding that they had participated in extensive litigation and were entitled to compensation for
such participation."
As stated in the 24th Annual Report, at page 21, the Commission
on February 5, 1958 announced the rescission of Rule 9 of the General
Rules and Regulations under the Holding Company Act. This rule
permitted a holding company to claim exemption from the Act for
itself and its subsidiaries if the holding company system. was of relatively small size, measured by the aggregate amount of its utility
assets or of the annual revenues derived from public-utility operations.
In February 1958, 21 holding companies were claiming exemption
under this rule. The effective date of rescission was initially fixed
for September 30, 1958, but was several times postponed by the Commission at the request of the companies concerned to afford them
additional time to take action, where feasible, which would make them
eligible for exemption on some basis other than Rule 9 or would render
them no longer holding companies. Rule 9 finally ceased to be in
effect on February 29, 1960.
When the rescission of Rule 9 became effective, there were 9 holding companies claiming exemption thereunder.

4 filed statements claiming exemption under Rule 2, which permits
holding companies to claim exemption where their systems are essentially "intrastate" or where the holding company is "predominantly
a public-utility company." Three of the remaining holding companies had previously registered under the Act; the other 2 holding
companies filed registration statements during the fiscal year," On
August 11, 1960,pursuant to Section 5 (d) of the Act, the Commission
declared one of these 2 latter companies not to be a holding company
and thereupon its registration ceased to be in effect.54
During the fiscal year the Commission adopted a "Statement of
Administrative Policy Regarding Balance Sheet Treatment of Credit
Equivalent to Reduction in Income Taxes"." This matter is discussed
in detail in Part XI under the title, "Activities of the Commission in
Accounting and Auditing".
This statement of policy generally prohibits the filing of financial statements with the Commission which
designate as earned surplus or in any manner as part of equity capital
the accumulated credit equivalent to the reduction in income taxes
arising from the deduction of costs for income tax purposes at a more
rapid rate than for financial statement purposes.
On November 24, 1959, the Commission adopted a new regulation
governing the preservation and destruction of the records of those
registered holding companies which do not also operate utility assets
or other physical properties."
The purpose of the new regulation is
to permit such holding companies to destroy voluminous records, the
retention of which is no longer necessary or appropriate in the public
interest or for the protection of investors and consumers. The regulation also authorizes the microfilming of many other records which
no longer need be retained in their original form. It is estimated
that holding companies affected by the new regulation will realize
substantial savings in the cost of storing and handling their records.
The new regulation is entitled "Regulation to Govern The Preservation and Destruction of Books of Account and Other Records of Companies Which Are Subject to the Uniform System of Accounts for
Public Utility Holding Companies Under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935" and it is in the nature of a revision of the Commission's Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utility Holding

developing the history of or facts regarding any transaction of the
company recorded in its accounts, without first having obtained the
consent and approval of the Commission. Prior to the revision, the
Commission had granted the requests of a number of registered holding companies for authorization to destroy records pursuant to this
proVISIOn.
The revision of the Uniform System of Accounts, which was
adopted by the Commission on November 24, 1959, deleted from General Instruction 3C the prohibition against the destruction of records
formerly contained therein and added an Appendix containing the
new regulation. The regulation prescribes various retention periods
and microfilming privileges for all classes of records of registered

Corporation issued and sold 1,097,048 shares of its $2.50 par value
common stock for $24 million. This issue was a nonunderwritten
rights offering to stockholders and employees but the company utilized
the services of securities dealers to solicit subscriptions to the new
stock by original warrant holders and for the purpose of selling the
unsubscribed shares. By order dated December 28, 1959, the Commission granted the company an exception from the competitive bidding

at competitive bidding involved an agreement by 10 insurance companies to purchase from Yankee Atomic Electric Company, a subsidiary of New England Electric System, up to $20,000,000 principal
amount of First Mortgage 5 percent bonds due 1982 in installments
as funds are required by Yankee for construction not later than J anuary 1, 1962. By order dated June 12, 1959, the Commission granted
Yankee an exception from the competitive bidding requirements of
Rule 50, pursuant to paragraph (a) (5) thereof, with respect to this
issue for the reasons, among others, that the project to be financed
was of an unusual nature, that several large institutional investors
had shown no interest in the issue, and that bond market conditions at
the time were uncertain."
During the fiscal year the Commission announced a change in its
procedure under Rule 50. Formerly companies could request authorization to negotiate with prospective purchasers regarding the terms
of securities proposed to be sold pursuant to the Act. The Commission would grant or deny such informal request, usually by letter.
The revised procedure does not permit such informal negotiations and
formal applications are required for any exception from the rule and
such applications are given public notice.
During the period from May 7, 1941, the effective date of Rule 50,
to June 30, 1960, a total of 795 issues of securities with aggregate sales
value of $11,468 million were sold at competitive bidding under the

Protective Provisions of First Mortgage Bonds and Preferred Stocks of PublicUtility Companies

The Commission examines the mortgage indentures and charters of
public-utility companies issuing first mortgage bonds and preferred
stocks under the Act to determine whether or not there is substantial
compliance with the applicable Statements of Policy which were
adopted by the Commission in 1956.43 These Statements of Policy
represent essentially a codification of the principles and policies
which the Commission had been administering over a long period of
years on a case-by-case basis, and which the Commission had found
necessary and desirable for the protection of investors in first mortgage bonds and preferred stocks of public-utility companies. The
Commission has required conformity with the Statements of Policy
except where the circumstances of a particular case clearly warrant
deviation therefrom."
During fiscal year 1960, applications or declarations were filed by
public-utility companies under the Act with respect to 16 first mortgage bond issues involving an aggregate principal amount of
$216,500,00045 and 3 preferred stock issues with a total par value of
$18,000,000.
One of the provisions of the Statement of Policy with respect to
bonds requires a restriction on the distribution of earned surplus to
common stockholders under certain circumstances. In 8 of the 16
bond issues of public-utility companies as to which filings were
made with the Commission during the fiscal year, existing indenture
provisions adequately conformed to this requirement of the Statement
of Policy. In the other 8 bond issues, additional restrictions were required and were either proposed by the issuer or were evolved in
informal discussions between the Commission's staff and representatives of the issuer. To avoid unnecessary rigidity, the Commission has
permitted the inclusion in the mortgage indenture of a provision which
would permit relaxation of the dividend restriction in appropriate
cases with the approval of the Commission.
Another provision contained in the bond Statement of Policy concerns the renewal and replacement of depreciable utility property.
This provision requires, in substance, that the issuer construct property additions, or alternatively, deposit bonds or cash with the inden.. Holding Company Act Release No. 13105 (February 16, 1!l56) as to first mortgage

.. The application of the Statements of Policy to filings from the effectlvc date of the
Statements of Policy to .Tune 30, 1959, is dIscussed In the 23d, 24th, and 25th Annual
Reports at pages 141-43, 128-31, and 137-41, respectIvely .

ture trustee, in an amount which, on a cumulative basis, will provide
adequately for the replacement in cash or property of the dollar
equivalent of the cost of the depreciable mortgaged property during
its estimated useful life. The Statement of Policy requires that the
renewal and replacement provision in the mortgage indenture be
expressed as a percent of the book cost of depreciable property, except
that if the existing indenture provision is expressed on a different
basis, as, for example, in terms of a percent of operating revenues,
no change will be required if the issuer can satisfactorily demonstrate
to the Commission that the existing provision furnishes substantially
the same degree of protection to the bondholders as that based on a percent of the book cost of depreciable property. As in the case of the
earned surplus restriction, the Commission, in the interest of flexibility, has allowed the issuer to insert a provision under which the issuer,
upon application to, and approval by, the Commission may modify the
percent of depreciable property requirement.
Of the 16 bond issues sold during the fiscal year, the indentures as
to 12 expressed the renewal and replacement fund requirement as a
percent of depreciable property and were deemed adequate by the
Commission; and the indentures as to 4 expressed the requirement as
a percent of revenues which the Commission found acceptable since
they appeared to afford no less protection to the bondholders than
would be afforded under an appropriate percent-of-property basis.
During fiscal year 1960, the Commission has continued to require
conformity with the provision contained in both the bond and the
preferred stock Statements of Policy that the securities be freely
refundable at the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and
payment of a reasonable redemption premium, if any.46 Continuing
studies made by the Commission's staff with respect to electric and
gas utility bond issues sold at competitive bidding, whether or not
subject to the Act, indicate that the presence or absence of a restriction
on free refundability has not affected the number of bids received by
an issuer at competitive bidding or the ability of the winning bidder
to market the bonds. This was discussed in the 25th Annual Report,
at pages 140-41, which summarized the results of an examination of
all electric and gas utility bond issues (including debentures) sold at
competitive bidding between May 14, 1957, and June 30, 1959, by
companies subject to the Act as well as those not so subject. This
study has been continued for fiscal year 1960.
During the period from May 14, 1957, to June 30, 1960, a total of
240 electric and gas utility bond issues, aggregating $5,045.6 million
principal amount, were offered at competitive bidding. The refund.. The significance of the refunding privilege, both as a matter of conformity with the
standards of the Act and as a matter of practical finance, was discussed at some length

able issues numbered 187 and accounted for a total of $3,443.6 million,
while the nonrefundable issues-all except one being nonrefundable for
a period of 5 years, and one being nonrefundable for a period of 7
years-numbered
53 and totaled $1,602 million principal amount.
The number of refundable issues thus represented 77.0 percent of the
total number of issues, while, in terms of principal amount, the refundable issues accounted for 68.2 percent."
The weighted average number of bids received on the refundable
issues for the same period was 4.56, while on the nonrefundable issues
it was 4.26. The median number of bids was 5 on the refundable
and 4 on the nonrefundable issues," With respect to the success of the
marketing of the bond issues, an issue was considered to be successfully marketed if at least 95 percent of the issue was sold at
the syndicate price up to the date of termination of the syndicate.
On
this basis, 73.3 percent of the refundable issues were successful while
69.8 percent of the nonrefundable ones were sucoessful.v In terms
of principal amount, 69.5 percent of the refundable issues were successful, while 69.6 percent of the nonrefundable ones were successful. GO
Extension of the comparison to include the aggregate principal
amounts of all issues which were sold at the applicable syndicate prices
up to the termination of the respective syndicates, regardless of
whether a particular issue met the definition of a successful marketing,
indicates that 87.4 percent of the combined principal amount of all
the refundable issues were so sold, as compared with 85.3 percent for
the nonrefundable issues." These statistics developed in respect of
the two groups of bond issues support the Commission's policy of requiring free refundability of utility bond issues subject to the Act.
In the 25th Annual Report, at page 141, reference was made to a
comprehensive study of redemption provisions of corporate bonds
being conducted at the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce
of the University of Pennsylvania.
It was stated that a preliminary
draft report on the study had been completed shortly after the close
of fiscal year 1959. It was subsequently determined by those making
the study to extend its life to cover additional bond issues through at
'1 During fiscal year 1960, a total of 62 bond issues were olfered aggregating $1,282.6
million principal amount, consisting of 50 refundable issues totaling $936.6 million and
12 nonrefundable issues totaling $346 mUlion. The number of refundable issues represented 80.6 percent of all the Issues, while in terms of principal amount the refundable
issues accounted for 73.0 percent.
.. During fiscal year 1960, the weighted average number of bids was 4.54 on the refundabIes and 4.25 on the nonrefundables, while the median number of bids was 6 on the

PART VII
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE REOR.
GAMZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY
ACT, AS AMENDED
The role of the Commission under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy
Act, which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in
the United States District Courts, differs from that under the various
other statutes which it administers in that the Commission does not
initiate Chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings. It has no
authority to determine any of the issues in these proceedings. However, at the request of the judge or on the Commission's own motion,
if approved by the judge, the Commission may participate in such
proceedings in order to provide independent, expert assistance to the
court, the participants, and investors on matters arising in such proceedings and, where the Conunission considers such action appropriate, it may file advisory reports on reorganization plans. Thus,
the facilities of the Commission's technical staff and its disinterested recommendations are placed at the service of the judge and the
parties, affording them the views of impartial experts in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. The Commission pays
special attention to the interests of public security holders, who may
not otherwise be effectively represented.
In any case where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation does not exceed $3 million, the judge under Section 172 of Chapter X may, before approving any plan of reorganization, submit it to
the Commission for its examination and report. If the indebtedness
exceeds $3 million, the judge must submit the plan to the Commission before he may approve it. Where the Commission files a report,
copies of it, or a summary thereof, must be sent to all security holders
and creditors when they are asked to vote on the plan. The Commission has no authority to veto or require the adoption of a plan of reorganization and is not obligated to file a formal advisory report on
a plan.
The Commission's advisory reports on plans of reorganization are
usually widely distributed and serve an important function. However, they represent only one aspect of the Commission's activities in
cases in which it participates. The Commission, as a party to a
Chapter X proceeding, is actively interested in the solution of every
152

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

153

major issue arising therein, and the adequate performance of its
duties requires that it undertake in most cases intensive legal and
financial studies. Even in cases where the plans are not submitted
to the Commission and no report is filed, the Commission must consider various reorganization proposals of interested parties while
plans are being formulated, and be prepared to comment fully upon
all plans that are the subject of hearings for approval or confirmation.
In the exercise of its functions under Chapter X, the Commission
has endeavored to assist the courts in achieving equitable, financially
sound, expeditious and economical readjustments of the affairs of
corporations in financial distress. To aid in attaining these objectives
the Commission has lawyers, accountants and financial analysts in
its New York, Chicago, and San Francisco regional offices who keep
in close touch with all Chapter X hearings and issues. Supervision
and review of the regional offices'Chapter X work is the responsibility
of the Division of Corporate Regulation of the Commission, which
also handles the actual trial work in cases arising in the Atlanta and
Washington, D.C. regional areas.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission actively participated in 52 reorganization proceedings involving 80 companies (52 principal debtor corporations and
28 subsidiaries of those debtors) during the past fiscal year.' The
stated assets of these 80 companies totaled approximately $567,094,000
and their indebtedness totaled approximately $532,120,000. The proceedings were scattered among District Courts in 23 States, as follows:
ten proceedings in New York; five each in Illinois and Kentucky;
three each in Maryland and Pennsylvania; two each in Nevada, California, North Carolina, Florida, Oklahoma, Utnh, and Texas; one
each in Virginia, Michigan, Kansas, Iowa, Washington, New Jersey,
North Dakota, Louisiana, Wyoming, Colorado, and Arizona. During
the year, the Commission entered its appearance in nine new proceedings under Chapter X involving companies with aggregate stated
assets of approximately $25,703,000 and aggregate indebtedness of
approximately $27,850,000. They involved the rehabilitation of corporations engaged in the operation of such varied businesses as a
supermarket food chain, a race track, investment and mortgage loans,
securities brokerage, shipbuilding, and home improvements and real
estate, Proceedings involving seven principal debtor corporations
were closed during the year. At the end of the year, the Commission
was actively participaing in 45 reorganization proceedings involving
7,1companies.

proceedings In which

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate
that it participate in every Chapter X case. Apart from consideration
of the excessive administrative burden of participating in every one
of the 83 cases initiated during the fiscal year, many of the cases. involve
only trade or bank creditors and few stockholders. The Commission
has sought to participate principally in those proceedings in which
a substantial public investor interest is involved. This is not the only
criterion, however, and in some cases involving only limited public
investor interest, the Commission has participated because an unfair
plan had been or was about to be proposed, the public security holders
were not adequately represented, the reorganization proceedings were
being conducted in violation of important provisions of the Act, the
facts indicated that the Commission could perform a useful service,
or the judge requested the Commission to participate,"
MATfERS RELATED TO THE PROCEEDINGS

When a party in Chapter X proceedings, the Commission has urged
upon the court the procedural safeguards to which all parties are
entitled. The Commission also has attempted in its interpretations
of the statutory requirements to encourage uniformity in the construction of Chapter X and the procedures thereunder.
In the Shawano Development Oorporation case," the Commission
petitioned the court to remove the trustee on the ground that he was
not disinterested as defined in section 158 of Chapter X. The Commission presented evidence that the trustee had acted as attorney for
the debtor within two years of the date of the filing of the Chapter X
petition.
The trustee resigned while the court had the matter under
consideration.
In the case of Ooffeyville Loan & Investment Oompany, Inc:' the
Commission moved the court to remove the trustee on the ground that
his law firm had represented the debtor shortly before the institution
of the Chapter X proceedings, recovered a judgment in its favor, and
filed an attorney's lien for its fee. The judge denied the Commission's
"In In the Matter Of Southern Enterprise Oorporation (S. D. Texas, Houston Dlv., No.
2548), the judge stated his reasons for requesting the Commission to participate as
follows:
... • • (1) the complexity of the corporate structure of Southern Enterprise Corporation
and its several subsidiaries and the complexity of this reorganization proceeding, (2) the
necessity for protection of the public investor interest of more than 885 stockholders,
holding more than 211,300 shares at a cost of more than $83B.900.00 of the common capital
stock of the debtor, (B) the necessity for the interests of creditors holding asserted claims
against the debtor In excess of $295,700.00, (4) and the desire of this Court and of the
Trustee in this proceeding for the expert assistance in technical matters offered by the
Securities and Exchange Commission."

motion because, in his view, the particular disqualifying factor was
not substantial enough to warrant removal of the trustee. However,
the court stated in its opinion:
It must be conceded that ...
[the trustee] ...
by the letter of fi 158 falls
within the class disquali1led from appointment as trustee.

Also, in this case, a committee was organized purporting to represent both stockholders and creditors. The Commission objected to
the formation of this committee on the grounds that the classes which
the committee sought to represent had conflicting interests. Although
the court overruled the Commission's objections to the committee,
counsel for the committee on its behalf disclaimed representation
of the stockholders and the committee is now acting solely on behalf
of creditors.
In the case of TNT Trailer Ferry, Inc.,IJ the Commission objected to
the approval and confirmation of a plan of reorganization because
there was no adequate record on the insolvency of the debtor and because of the failure of the trustee to make the detailed investigation
contemplated by Section 167 of Chapter X. The Commission petitioned for a complete investigation of the affairs of the debtor when the
trustees sought to consummate the plan. The Commission provided
the court and the trustee with information tending to show that irregularities had occurred which required full examination and that
control of the reorganized company would be lodged in individuals
who had been closely associated with the former management of the
company, and who had made large profits trading in the debtor's
securities. Based upon the Commission's evidence, the trustee withdrew his petition to consummate the plan and the court ordered an
investigation.
In the Inland Gas 00. case," the Commission supported the appeal
of three debenture holders from an order of the District court dismissing their petition to modify and amend the plan of reorganization
after confirmation. The Court of Appeals, one judge dissenting,
affirmed the District Court,' and the bondholders' petition to the
Supreme Court for a writ of certiorari was denied," The Court of
Appeals based its decision primarily on the ground that the debtors
had been in reorganization for over 20 years and that the proposed
modifications to the plan, which the court felt constituted, in effect,
a new plan of reorganization, would open the door to further hearings
and litigation. The Court of Appeals concluded that the district
judge did not abuse his discretion in denying the bondholders' petition. The dissenting opinion by Judge Miller pointed out that the

majority gave little or no consideration to the fact that the proposed
amendments made a substantial increase in the amount of cash available for payment of the claims of certain creditors.
In the Texas Portland Oemeni Oompany case," the Commission's
personnel worked closely with the trustees throughout the section 167
investigation. Many witnesses were examined and as a result of the
investigation the trustees on June 27, 1960, filed suit for damages
against fifteen defendants. The amount of the recovery sought by the
trustees is $1,695,000. Another result of the trustees' investigation,
which was aided by the Commission and the Attorney General's Office
for the State of Texas, was a final judgment in an action brought by
the state cancelling 121,356 shares of stock improperly issued.
In the case of Swan Finch Oil Oorpomtionr the trustees of the
debtor recovered all of the outstanding common stock of Keta Gas &
Oil Company, a corporation which was seeking an arrangement of its
unsecured indebtedness, under chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act,
in the Western District of Pennsylvania.'? The trustees of Swan
Finch later filed a chapter X petition for the reorganization of Keta
as a subsidiary of Swan Finch in the Southern District of New York,
where the Swan Finch proceeding was pending. The court-appointed
receiver of Keta in the Chapter XI proceeding opposed the trustee's
petition and alleged inter alia that the District Court for the Southern
District of New York did not have jurisdiction to entertain the
Chapter X petition because of the pending Chapter XI proceeding
in the Western District of Pennsylvania. The Commission supported
the trustees, and the court approved the trustees' petition. The
Chapter XI receiver appealed; the appeal was argued but no decision
had been rendered by the Court of Appeals at the close of the fiscal
year.
In the case of U.S. Duro» Corporation. of Oolorador' the Commission petitioned the court for an order to restrain certain attorneys,
who were also creditors of the debtors and whose claims as creditors
has been subordinated to general creditors' claims under the trustees'
plan of reorganization, from representing other general creditors
whose claims were not subordinated. Since a conflict of interests existed between the subordinated creditors and other creditors, the
referee, as special master, recommended to the judge that the Commission's petition should be approved and that an order be issued
restraining the attorneys. The matter was before the judge at the
close of the fiscal year.

Prior to the formulation of a plan in the case of Food Town, Irw./3
several supermarket chains submitted bids to purchase the debtor's
grocery chain in the metropolitan Washington, D.C., area. Bidders
eventually dropped. out until only Kroger Co. and Greenbelt Consumer
Services, Inc., remained. 'While Greenbelt's bid appeared to be better than that of its competitor, counsel for the trustee and for the
Commission agreed that additional competition could be generated
if a plan embodying both offers was submitted to the court. At the
hearing on the plan, the two chains engaged in further bidding with
Kroger Co. making the highest offer. As a result the estate was benefitted by an additional $120,000.
PROBLEMS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADMINISTRATION
OF ESTATES

The trustee of The Kentucky Jockey Olrub,Inc.,!'>faced with a desperate financial situation, negotiated a four-year lease of the debtor's
track. Chapter X requires that security holders be given an opportunity to prepare plans of reorganization and to vote on any plan
before it can be carried out. The Commission contended that negotiating such a lease, without an option on the part of the trustee to
terminate it in the event of a sale or internal reorganization, was
tantamount to effecting a plan without a vote of security holders. The
Commission, in conjunction with a bondholders' committee, prevailed
upon the lessee to modify the proposed lease. The modifications, all
beneficial to the debtor, included the right of termination of the lease
by the trustee and excluded a proposed option to the lessee to meet
any purchase offer.
In Magnolia Park, Irw.,15 the trustee's plan of reorganization
provided for a sublease of the debtor's race track to Jefferson Downs,
Inc. to operate the track and pay a percentage of the pari-mutuel pool
as rental. Prior to confirmation the Louisiana state legislature
amended its pari-mutuel tax laws, the effect of which was to increase
the anticipated income of Jefferson Downs, The judge indicated that
a part of this increment in earnings should inure to Magnolia. Representatives of Jefferson Downs consulted with the staff and urged
the Commission to intercede in order to resolve the problem. Commission counsel conferred with the judge, and after extensive negotiations with all the interested parties an agreement was reached which
materially benefitted the estate. The plan of reorganization was subsequently confirmed.

CONrnn~ON

TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATIONS

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the old management is a requisite under the Bankruptcy Act and
Chapter X. One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a
thorough study of the debtor to assure the discovery and collection of
all assets of the estate, including claims against officers, directors, or
controlling persons who may have mismanaged the company's affairs,
diverted its funds to their own use or benefit or been guilty of other
misconduct. The staff of the Commission participates in the trustee's
investigation so that it may be fully informed as to all details of the
financial history and business practice of the debtor. The Commission
views its duty under Chapter X as requiring it to call the attention
of the trustee, or the court if necessary, to any matters which should
be acted upon.
In the case of TNT Trailer Fer-ry,bW.,l6 the Commission petitioned
the court to direct a complete investigation of the debtor's affairs,"
Commission counsel was authorized to advise the court that the Commission's staff would work closely with the trustee and his counsel and
advise them with respect to the witnesses to be called and the areas of
investigation to be covered. The court ordered the investigation.
During a period of four months the depositions of 33 witnesses were
taken, a total of 2,200 pages of testimony was transcribed, and over
60 exhibits were made a part of the record. Thereafter, the Commission assisted the trustee and his counsel in evaluating the evidence and
in preparing the trustee's report which was filed just after the close
of the fiscal year.
In the Food Town case," the trustee filed a very brief report of his
cursory investigation in which he reported that nothing had come to
his attention to indicate significant irregularities, misconduct or mismanagement. The Commission objected to this inadequate report, and
suggested various matters that demanded investigation. An investigation by the Commission's staff disclosed that within four months of
the filing of the petition, Food Town's secured creditor had received
from the debtor $300,000 of secured debentures in place of a pre-existing unsecured debt for the same amount. This t.ransaction appeared
to constitute a voidable preference. Thereafter, the trustee, through
his successor counsel, submitted a plan of sale which stated that the
trustee's investigation was not completed and that the distribution of
the proceeds of sale would be deferred pending its completion and the
determination of the status of the various claims, including the
$300,000 claims,"

INTERVENTION IN CHAPTER XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by which
debtors can arrange their unsecured debts under court supervision.
Where the proceeding should have been brought under Chapter X,
Section 328 of the Bankruptcy Act authorizes the Commission to make
application to the court to dismiss a Chapter XI proceeding, unless
the petition that initiated the proceeding is amended to comply with
the requirements of Chapter X.
The importance of the Commission's role in Chapter XI proceedings
was demonstrated in the attempted Pickman Trust Deed Oorporation
arrangement," The debtor, a second trust deed dealer and broker in
the San Francisco area, engaged in questionable activities which culminated in the commencement of an administrative proceeding on
March 29, 1960, by the California State Real Estate Commissioner for
the revocation of the company's license, and the licenses of its president and secretary.
It appeared that the debtor was short some
$700,000 of customers' funds which were either deposited with it for
investment or were earnings on investments left with it "in trust" for
accumulation and reinvestment.
On April 21, 1960, Pickman filed a
petition for an arrangement pursuant to Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act. Believing that an arrangement would not accomplish
the thorough-going reorganization needed to protect the interests of
the more than 1,300 public investors, the Commission petitioned the
Court to dismiss the arrangement
proceeding unless the debtor
amended its petition to comply with the provisions of Chapter X.
The debtor filed an amended petition, which was approved by the
Court on June 13, 1960.
In the Lea Fabrics, Inc. case," the Commission moved to dismiss
the Chapter XI proceeding unless the petition were amended to comply with Chapter X on the ground that after the Chapter XI arrangement a thorough-going reorganization would be effected outside the
jurisdiction of the court. This motion was denied by the District
Court, and the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit affirmed," Before the time for filing a petition for a writ of certiorari expired, the
debtor was adjudicated a bankrupt.
The Commission then moved the
Court of Appeals to vacate its judgment and remand the case to the
District Court with directions to vacate as moot its order refusing to
dismiss the debtor's petition under Chapter XI. This motion was
denied without opinion by the Court of Appeals. A petition for a
writ of certiorari was filed by the Commission. The Supreme Court,
in a per curiam opinion, granted the petition, vacated the judgment

of the Court of Appeals, and remanded the case to the District Court
with instructions to dismiss the petition under Chapter XI as moot."
Kirchofer & A1'1Wld, Inc.24 involved a corporation engaged in the
investment and financing businesses which had filed a Chapter XI
petition but had taken no steps to propose an arrangement.
The
Commission's staff indicated to the management of the debtor and
a creditors' committee that the Chapter XI petition was improper
and that a Chapter X reorganization would better serve the interests
of all parties to the proceeding. The debtor's petition was voluntarily
amended to comply with the requirements of Chapter X.
ACTIVITIES

WITH

REGARD

TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid out of the
debtor's estate to the various parties for services rendered and for
expenses incurred in the proceeding. The Commission, which under
Section 24:2 of the Bankruptcy Act may not receive any allowance
from the estate for the services it renders, has sought to assist the
courts in protecting debtor estates from excessive charges and at the
same tune equitably allocating compensation on the basis of a claimant's contribution to the administration of an estate and the formulation of a plan.
In the case of I'MI' Trailer Ferry, bW.,25 the District Court granted
interim allowances to attorneys representing general unsecured creditors. The Commission objected on the ground that interim allowances should not be granted except to the trustee and his counsel and
that the notice required by the statute was not given. The Commission also objected to the applications for interim allowances by the
trustee and his counsel on the ground that the required notice of
the hearing on their applications was not given. Although the
interim allowances were granted, the procedure recommended for
complying with the notice provisions was appoved by the Court for
all subsequent interim allowances to the trustee and his counsel.
In the Eirchofer ill Arnold case,26the Commission filed a memorandum with the Court setting forth objections to the applications
for allowances hy attorneys for the debtor in the prior Chapter XI
proceeding on the grounds that such allowances were premature in
light of the status of the reorganization proceeding and that the
notice provisions had not been complied with. The Court thereupon
withheld ruling on the applications .

In the Empire Warehouses case 21 the parties to the reorganization
had requested a total of $276,846 in fees. The Commission recommended an allowance of slightly more than $170,000. The Court allowed a total of $185,582, following the Commission's recommendations, with respect to all but 2 of the applicants, and commended the
Commission for its assistance, stating:
Sixteen applications for allowances and expenses were filed and each was
carefully and analytically examined by the S.E.C., as is evidenced by the excellent comprehensive report which it filed. The court is grateful to the S.E.C.
not only for its very helpful advisory report on the matter of the applications
for allowances and expenses, but also for its invaluable assistance throughout
this entire proceeding which was extended over three years. Many troublesome and complicated matters arose in this reorganization and the S.E.C.
contributed much toward their solution.

In the F. L. Jacobs Oompany case/8 receivers were appointed in
New York prior to the approval of the Chapter X petition in Michigan. The receivers and their counsel requested a total of $50,000 in
fees. The Commission recommended a total of $20,000 and the Court
granted that amount."
In the case of Adolph Gobel, Inc.,sO the parties to the reorganization
filed applications for supplemental allowances for work performed
subsequent to the granting by the Court of final allowances. The applications totaled $32,250, the Commission recommended allowances of
$13,850, and the Court allowed $16,250.S1
In the case of General Stores Oorporation,S2 applications for allowances of $492,150 for compensation and $41,696 for expenses were filed
by the parties to the reorganization.
The Commission recommended
allowances of $208,000 for compensation and $7,004 for expenses, and
the Court awarded $268,500 and $16,743, respectively.

allowed the exact amounts recommended by the Commission in 6 out

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

CO~SSION

The Commission urged that the proponent of the plan, who was both
a creditor and a stockholder, was not entitled to compensation for his
services as stockholder, because the proponent's activities were primarily directed to his own self-interest and not to the benefit of the
estate. The Court agreed with the Commission's recommendation but
for the reason that the estate should not be subjected to two separate
fees since as a creditor the proponent was separately represented by
counsel who were also claiming compensation. The Commission also
recommended that the proponent's joint counsel were not entitled to
compensation, and that one of such counsel was also barred from
compensation under Section 249. The Court agreed with the Commission on the application of Section 249, but granted an allowance to
the proponent's other counsel for services deemed to be of benefit to
the estate.
The Court agreed with the Commission's recommendation as to the
Collateral Trustee, but disagreed with the Commission's recomendation in granting additional compensation to his counsel. The Collateral Trustee filed a notice of appeal, and also filed a motion for leave
to appeal which was denied by the Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit. A subsequent motion by the Chapter X trustee to dismiss the
Collateral Trustee's appeal as of right, supported by the Commission,
was granted by the Court of Appeals." The Court agreed with the
Commission's view that Section 250 was applicable.
ADVISORY REPORTS ON PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

During the fiscal year, the Commission issued one advisory report
and two supplemental advisory reports. Generally speaking, an advisory report is prepared only in a case involving a substantial public
investor interest and raising significant problems. On occasion, because of the exigencies of time or for other reasons, no written report is
filed but, instead, Commission counsel makes a detailed oral presentation of the Commission's views and the reasons therefor.
In the case of Hudson &: Manhattan Railroad 00.,34 the Commission submitted an advisory report during fiscal year 1959 85 which
found that a proposed plan was fair and equitable and feasible but
recommended that it should incorporate an appropriate provision for
the selection of the initial directors after reorganization. The trustee
filed an amendment in accordance with the Commission's views. The
plan, as thus amended, was approved by the Court in its order of
May 1, 1959, and was accepted by the requisite majorities of the
holders of senior bonds (i.e., first mortgage bonds and refunding

bonds) and general unsecured claims of the debtor, but not by the
holders of the junior bonds (i.e., adjustment income bonds).
The trustee petitioned the Court to confirm the plan and to appraise and pay in cash the value of the junior bondholders' claims in
lieu of the distributions provided for them under the plan. A hearing commenced on February 15, 1960, but prior to its completion another amendment was submitted by the trustee.
Following this
modification, a Supplemental Report dated April 8, 1960 was filed by
the Commission finding the modified plan to be fair and equitable and
feasible." The Court approved the modified plan on April 21, 1960.
A summary of the Commission's reports was filed on April 29, 1960.31
The trustee's modified plan is predicated upon the assumption that
the debtor is insolvent. Publicly held first mortgage bonds are treated
on a parity with the refunding bonds. The modified plan permits
only the senior bondholders to share in the value of the mortgaged
assets, but recognizes the claims of the junior bondholders against
certain assets allegedly not subject to the mortgage liens ("free assets"); it also provides a contingent interest for the junior bondholders in the proceeds of a sale of the debtor's railroad, if such a sale
realizes more than is required to meet the balance of the claims of the
senior bondholders.
Under the modified plan, the debtor will continue its corporate existence as a real estate company and a new railroad company will be
organized as a wholly-owned subsidiary.
The debtor will transfer
to the new railroad company substantially all of its railroad properties
together with necessary working capital and will retain all its other
assets, consisting principally of two office buildings. The real estate
company will distribute to the senior bondholders a new issue of
$10,038,100 principal amount of first mortgage bonds and 590,476
shares of a new Class A common stock, representing about 91 percent
of the equity; and to the junior bondholders 58,849 shares of a new
Class B common stock, representing about 9 percent of the equity.
The real estate company will be empowered, for a period of two years
following the date of consummation of the modified plan, to issue up
to $2,500,000 principal amount of new prior lien obligations, or to
borrow from banks, to finance modernization of the Hudson Terminal
Buildings.
Several common stockholders appealed from the order of the District Court approving the trustee's plan and finding that the debtor
was insolvent and that the stockholders have no interest in its assets."

cision." In the summary of its reports," the Commission had stated
with respect to the stockholders' interest in the debtor:
Aggregate claims exceeding $70,000,000 would be required to be satisfied in full
before any participation could be accorded holders of preferred and common stock.
Clearly, there is no basis or present valuation for any participation by these security holders. It has been urged, however, that some contingent interest security be issued to recognize the possibility that a sale of the railroad properties
would realize enough to satisfy all creditors' claims and leave a balance distributable to stockholders.
In our view, such a possibility is so remote as to be
of no cognizable value. Moreover, to distribute securities in the nature of
warrants or contingent interest certificates to stockholders in these circumstances
would in our view create a highly deceptive and speculative security which would
be injurious to the public interest and the interest of investors and would render
the modified plan unfeasible.

The Commission filed an advisory report with respect to a plan of
reorganization for Parker Petroleum 00., Inc;" which is engaged in
the business of exploration, development and operation of oil and natural gas properties in Kansas, Oklahoma and Texas. The trustee's
plan of reorganization provided that Occidental Petroleum Corporation and certain individuals would purchase 750,000 shares of the new
common stock of the reorganized company for $1 per share; the old
common stockholders would be offered up to 250,000 shares at the same
price; and additional monies would be borrowed on a first mortgage.
Two separate series of debentures in the aggregate amount of $1,400,000 would be issued to creditors with varying amounts of cash. The
old preferred and common would receive new common.
The Commission in its Advisory Report concluded that the plan was
not fair since it did not accord the preferred stockholders and one of
the secured creditors the equitable equivalent of their rights as required
by law." The Commission also stated that the plan was not feasible
since the proposal of Occidental and certain individuals to contribute
new equity capital was not a firm commitment.
The plan was subsequently amended. In its Supplemental Advisory Report, the Commission concluded that, while the amendments
met its prior objections in three respects, they failed to correct most
of the basic deficiencies, and, in part, added additional elements of
unfairness." The Commission reiterated that the amended plan was
unfeasible because Occidental had not made a firm commitment to
invest new equity capital.
The plan was further amended in minor respects and, over the
Commission's objections, was approved by the Court. After acceptance by the requisite numbers of each class of creditors and security

holders, the plan was confirmed by the Court. Within a month after
the plan had been confirmed, Occidental notified the trustee that it
would not perform its agreement because of an alleged material change
in the debtor's status resulting from a reappraisal of its gas reserves.
The judge has refused to vacate the order of confirmation, having
determined that there had been no material change, and ordered Occidental to perform.
In the case of El-Tronics, Inc.44 which manufactures electrical and
electronic equipment at plants in Pennsylvania and California, the
trustees submitted a plan which provided for the continuation of operations and for the acquisition of the assets of six corporations controlled by the proponent of the plan. In return, the reorganized com.
pany would issue to the proponent $2,000,000 principal amount of 5
percent subordinated convertible debentures. In addition, the proponent would purchase $500,000 principal amount of such debentures,
and 1,300,000shares of common stock for $1,700,000. As a result of the
Commission's analysis, as presented at the hearing on the plan, it
was modified in several respects to provide for the issuance of additional debentures to the proponent, in lieu of a cash payment for
inventory, and for an unconditional commitment by him.
In the U.S. DU1'OX Oorporation. caset'the Commission filed a memorandum in support of the Trustee's plan of reorganization.
The
plan provided, inter alia, for the sale of the debtor's assets and for the
. distribution of the proceeds to public creditors and stockholders. The
plan subordinates claims and stock of insiders to publicly held stock
to the extent of the offering price of that stock. The Referee to whom
the plan was referred for hearing has filed a well-reasoned report recommending approval of the plan. The plan was under consideration

PART VIII
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE Acr OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, deben-

tures and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which meets
the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the
Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified include
specified provisions which provide means by which the rights of holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected and
enforced. These provisions relate to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee to provide reasonable
financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The
Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all
liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on the trustee, after
default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill "in the
exercise of the rights and powers invested in it by the indenture" as
a prudent man would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter
Act, and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture
must be contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and
securities issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper
authority which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements
of the Trust Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for
the qualification of the indenture, including a statement of the required
information concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF
1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies engaged primarily in the business of
investing, reinvesting, holding and trading in securities. The Act
requires, among other things, disclosure of the finances and investment
policies of these companies, prohibits such companies from changing
the nature of their business or certain of their investment policies
without the approval of their stockholders, regulates the means of
custody of the companies' securities, prohibits underwriters, investment bankers and brokers from constituting more than a minority of
the directors of such companies, requires new management contracts
to be submitted to security holders for their approval, prohibits transactions between such companies and their officers, directors and affiliates except with the approval of the Commission and regulates
the issuance of senior securities. The Act requires face-amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their certificates.
The securities of investment companies which are offered to the
public are also required to be registered under the Securities Act, and
the companies must file periodic reports. Such companies are also
subject to the Commission's "proxy rules" and closed-end companies
are subject to "insider" trading rules. The Division of Corporation
Finance and the Division of Corporate Regulation both assist the
Commission in the administration of the statute, the former being
concerned with the disclosure provisions and the latter with the
regulatory provisions.
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 1960 there were 570 investment companies registered
under the Act and the estimated aggregate market value of their
assets on that date was $23.5 billion. These figures represent an overall increase of 58 registered companies and an increase of roughly $3.5
billion in the market value of assets over the corresponding totals at
June 30, 1959. These companies were classified as follows:

INSPECTION

PROGRAM

Pursuant to its statutory authority under Section 31 of the Investment Company Act the Commission initiated a regular program for
the periodic inspection of investment companies in 1957. Up to the
fiscal year 1960, 30 companies had been inspected pursuant to this program. As in prior years a number of inspections were undertaken by
staff teams consisting of an attorney or analyst from the Division of
Corporate Regulation and a securities investigator from the appropriate field officein order to combine the specialized training and knowledge of the Washington staff concerning the regulatory requirements
of the Investment Company Act with the field experience and investigative expertness of field officepersonnel. However, the Commission's
program contemplates placing the principal responsibility for making
inspections in the regional offices as personnel in such officesbecome
sufficiently experienced in the statutory requirements applicable to
investment companies. In line with this program the staff of the
Division of Corporate Regulation during the 1960 fiscal year conducted a training course on inspections under the Investment Company Act for certain staff members of the Boston, New York, Chicago
and Washington regional offices. With knowledge obtained at this
course and experience gained in previous inspections accompanied by
Division personnel, staff members of regional officesexclusively made
inspections of six investment companies during fiscal 1960. The
Washington officestaff will continue to review the field office inspection reports, evaluate problems of regulatory compliance raised by
such reports and obtain necessary corrective action on the part of the
investment companies concerned.
These inspections, although involving only a fraction of the total
number of registered investment companies, have revealed the need
for continuous field supervision. Inspections made during the term
of the program indicated, in some instances, noncompliance with regulatory provisions of the Investment Company Act. For example:
(1) improper selling practices by salesmen who promoted the sale of
mutual fund shares just prior to dividend payment dates without
explaining that the amount of dividend to be paid was included in
the purchase price of the shares on which a sales-load was paid and
that receipt of the dividend would represent a return of capital on
which the shareholder would be liable for income taxes; (2) deviations from fundamental policy without approval of stockholders;
(3) improper composition of boards of directors because of the affiliation of directors; (4) acquisition of securities during an underwriting where an affiliated relationship existed between underwriter and
company; (5) sale of securities to a company by an affiliated person
acting as a principal; (6) noncompliance with the requirements for

TWENTY-8IXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

171

the custody of the portfolio securities of a company under Section
17 of the Act; and (7) failure to obtain approval of stockholders or
the Board of Directors for an investment advisory contract.
There were also instances where books and records of the companies were inadequate or lacking. For example: (1) failure to
record the date and time of requests for redemption, thus making it
impossible to determine whether the investors received their correct
net asset value; (2) failure to maintain purchase and sales journals;
failure to maintain ledger accounts for broker-dealers used by the
company for its portfolio security transactions; and (3) failure to
keep proper vouchers for out-of-pocket expenses. In addition, the
staff noted instances where the custodian did not adhere to the terms
of the custodianship agreement, or the Commission's regulations on
the safekeeping of portfolio securities of the company. In some instances, there was a considerable delay in the transmission to the
investment companies of funds received by dealers selling mutual
:fund shares.
In cases where deficiencies are noted, unless other action is indicated, they are brought to the attention of the investment companies
involved so that corrective steps may be taken.
STUDY OF SIZE OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

On behalf of the Commission, the Securities Research Unit of the
Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of Pennsylvania has been conducting a factfinding survey in connection with So
study of the problems created by the growth in size of investment companies. This inquiry is being made pursuant to the direction contained
in Section 14(b) of the Investment Company Act. The Wharton
School gathered information by use of a questionnaire sent to registered investment companies during the fiscal year 1959. The Wharton
School is presently engaged in processing and analyzing the information obtained through use of the questionnaire.
Preliminary reports on three phases of the study were received by
the staff during the fiscal year. These phases are: (1) Origin and
Scope of the Study and Summary of Principal Findings, (2) the Organization and Control of Open-End Investment Companies and (3)
Growth of Funds in the Investment Company Industry, 1952-1958.
A further preliminary report covering three more phases of the study
is planned in the next fiscal year. These phases are (4) Formulation of
Investment Decisions by Management and Trading Procedures, (5)
Control of Portfolio Companies by Investment Companies, and (6)
Costs in the Investment Company Industry. A phase dealing with
the impact of size of investment companies on the securities markets is also in preparation.

172

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

When the full report on the size study survey is received from the
Wharton School, it is expected that the Commission will be in a position to determine whether the increased size of investment companies
has created any problems which require specific remedial legislative
recommendations by the Commission to the Congress.
CURRENT INFORMATION

The Commission's rules promulgated under the Act require that the
basic information contained in notifications of registration and in
registration statements of investment companies be kept up-to-date,
through periodic and other reports, except in cases of certain inactive
unit trusts and face-amount companies. The following current reports
and documents were filed during the 1960 fiscal year:
Annual reports-______________________________________________________
Quarterly reports____________________________________________________
Periodic reports to stockholders (containing financial statements)
Copies of sales literature

364
207
1,075
2, 548

The foregoing statistics do not reflect the numerous filings of revised
prospectuses by open-end mutual funds and unit investment trusts
making a continuous offering of their securities. These prospectuses,
which must be checked for compliance with the Act, are required to
show material changes which have occurred in the operations of the
companies since the effective date of the prospectuses on file. In this
respect the registration of the securities of such companies is essentially
different from the registration of the usual corporate securities.
During the past year 15 Small Business Investment Companies
have registered under the Investment Company Act. These registrations are 22.4 percent of the total registrations under the Investment
Company Act during the fiscal year. Pursuant to an arrangement
with the Small Business Administration, the staff of the Commission
examines a copy of each Proposal to Operate as a Small Business Investment Company, filed on SBA Form 414, to determine the status
of the Proposed Operator under the Investment Company Act and
the other statutes administered by this Commission. Both the Proposed Operator and the SBA are notified as to the staff's conclusion
in each case.
As described more fully hereafter a number of rules designed to
simplify the operations of Small Business Investment Companies
under the statutes administered by the Commission were adopted in
fiscal 1960.
APPLICATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

Since certain types of transactions are prohibited by the Investment Company Act in the absence of an exemptive order by the Commission issued upon a determination that specified statutory standards

TWENTY-SIXTH

173

ANNUAL REPORT

have been met, one of the principal activities of the Commission in
its regulation of investment companies is the processing of applications for such exemptive orders. Under Section 6(c) the Commission, by rules and regulations, upon its own motion or by order upon
application, may exempt any person, security or transaction from any
provision of the Act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy
and provisions of the Act. Other Sections, such as 6( d), 9(b), 10(f),
17(b) and 23(c) contain specific provisions and standards pursuant
to which the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of the Act or may approve certain types of transactions. Also,
under certain provisions of Sections 2, 3, and 8 the Commission may
determine the status of persons and companies under the Act.
There were 184 applications under various sections of the Investment Company Act before the Commission during the fiscal year 1960.
The various sections of the Act with which these applications were
concerned and their disposition during the fiscal year are shown in the
following table:

Usually the applications for exemptions under the Act are processed
without holding formal hearings; however, hearings are held when
the impact of the proposal upon investor or the public interest are
substantial or matters of fact or of law are in dispute.
In the past fiscal year, the following matters upon which hearings
had been held were determined:

174

SECURITIES

AND EXCHA..l\l"GE COMMISSION

In Great Amerioaai Life Underwriters, Inc» the Commission, in
view of the discontinuance of the company's sale of face amount certificates 2 and its further conclusion that applicant was and is primarily engaged in the insurance business through controlled subsidiaries, ruled that applicant should be granted an exemption from the
Investment Company Act on the ground that it is not the type of
company intended to be regulated thereunder. Among the other considerations leading to this conclusion were the facts that applicant has
a very substantial part of its income from its holdings of stock in its
insurance subsidiary and that applicant's officers and directors have
been active in the management and operation of the insurance subsidiary.
In determining that the exemption might be made retroactive, the
Commission pointed out that the company would have been entitled
to the exemption at any time, that it failed earlier to file an application for exemption because of the good faith through mistaken belief
that it was not registered under the Act, that it is clearly not now an
investment company and was at all times primarily engaged in the
insurance business, and its outstanding face-amount certificates were
at all times protected by reserves on deposit with a state agency and
have been reduced to the point where they are insignificant in comparison to applicant's assets.
In Atlas Oorporation 3 the Commission held that the proposed merger transactions between affiliates were exempted from Section 17(a)
of the Act since the terms of the merger were reasonable and fair and
did not involve overreaching, and in addition were consistent with the
stated policies of Atlas, the investment company, and the general purposes of the Investment Company Act.
In Oivil and Military Investors Mutual Fund, Inc." the Commission
denied a petition for modification of a 1958 decision and order of the
Commission which held that the company's name, and specifically the
words "Civil and Military Investors" therein, are deceptive and misleading and thus violative of the Investment Company Act.
In Investors Diversified Services, Inc.G the Commission denied the
company's application for an exemption which would have allowed
the company to sell shares at a reduced load to members of certain
associations. The Commission concluded that a showing had not been
made by applicants which would entitle them to a special exemption
from the provisions of Section 22 (d) which prohibits a registered

except at a current public offering price described in its prospectus.
In Eurofwnd, Inc. 6 the Commission granted an exemption from
Section 17(f) (1) of the Act to permit the deposit of certain securities
of foreign issuers owned by the company with foreign banks, as agents
of the company's domestic custodian bank. These foreign banks also
service such securities and their use as custodian permits substantial
economies. The Investment Company Act and the rules thereunder
require that each registered management company shall maintain
its securities either in the custody or the safekeeping of a bank. The
definition of the word "bank" in the Investment Company Act does
not include a foreign bank.
Two additional cases in which decisions were rendered after hearings are discussed hereafter under "Variable Annuities."
At the close of the fiscal year decision was pending in three cases in
which hearings had been held. Seourities Corporation: General:" involved a request for revocation of a prior exemptive order upon the
ground that the board of directors of the company was not elected
in accordance with the requirements of Section 16(a) of the Act
Oentury Isniestors Ino., et al.6 involved the merger of two closed-end
investment companies into a third company, and the exemption of the
surviving company from all provisions of the Act. The merger
would effect corporate simplification and eliminate pyramiding in
violation of Section 12(d) (1) of the Act. Madison Fund, Ino.,
International Mining Oorporation 9 involved an exemption application under Section 17(b) for a proposed sale of assets through a
merger of a controlled company of a registered investment company
with an affiliated company."
VARIABLE ANNUITIES

Following a Supreme Court decision 11 which made them subject
to registration under the Investment Company Act, Variable Annuity
Life Insurance Oompany of America 12 and Equity Annuity Life
Insurance Oompany registered under the Investment Company Act
and filed application for exemptions from certain of its provisions.
The Commission issued its decision on the application during the
fiscal year.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The variable annuity contracts which each of these companies issue
provide that the purchasers' payments will be invested by the issuing
company in a securities portfolio. Prior to the time "annuity payments" commence the contract may be redeemed at its current value,
which will depend upon the investment performance and then current
value of the underlying stock portfolio.
At the end of the pay-in period the contract provides for variable
monthly payments by the company to the holder for the remainder
of his life or other elected pay-out period. These payments will be
made on the basis of a fixed number of so-called units which will vary
in value in accordance with the value of the underlying portfolio;
and the number of such units will depend upon the amount accumulated during the pay-in period and various other factors such as the
age and sex of the contract holders and the type of pay-out elected.
The Commission's decision exempts these companies from the prohibitions of the Investment Company Act against the issuance of senior
securities. Since these variable annuity contracts are senior securities
in relation to the companies' capital stock, an exemption was necessary
to permit their issuance. The decision points out that the variable
annuity contracts are designed to place on the contract holders the
investment risks ordinarily associated with the common stock of an
investment company, as distinguished from the usual type of fixedobligation senior security. The exemption is based on this characteristic of the contracts as well as various protections for investors which
are present in the insurance laws to which the companies are subject,
and various undertakings by the companies and conditions imposed by
the Commission's order.
Exemption was also granted the companies to permit them to collect the sales charges on their variable annuity contracts over an
assumed pay-in period of 12 years in the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company case and 10 years in the Equity Annuity Life Insurance Company case. The Investment Company Act requires that
where, as here, an investment company's securities are sold on a
periodic payment plan basis with a larger sales charge imposed in the
first year than in later years, the sales charges must be spread over
the life of the plan so as to average not in excess of 9 percent of all
the payments. In the case of Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, the sales charge on monthly payment contracts is 50 percent of
the first year's payments and 5 percent of the payments for the next 11
years for a 12 year average of 8.75 percent; and in the case of Equity
Annuity Life Insurance Company 40 percent of the first year's payments and 5 percent of the payments for the next 9 years for a 10 year
average of 8.9 percent.
Since the larger first year's sales charges are, in effect, prepayment
for future purchases and services, the Investment Company Act re-,

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

177

quires that the net proceeds of these periodic payment plans be placed
in a separate trust with a bank, thus ensuring fullfillment of the plan
in the event the sponsor should abandon it. The Commission exempted the applicants from this separate trust requirement in view of the
protections provided by the insurance laws to which they are subject;
but this exemption does not relieve them from the Investment Company Act's requirement that the charges to be made by the companies
for administering the contracts shall be in such reasonable amount as
the Commission shall prescribe, and jurisdiction was reserved for this
purpose. Charges which the companies propose to deduct are, in the
case of Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company, 5 percent of the
payments in the first year, 9 percent in each of the next 11 years and
11 percent thereafter; and in the case of Equity Annuity Life Insurance Company, 10 percent in the first year, 7 percent in each of the next
9 years and 8 percent thereafter.
Variable Annuity Life Insurance
Company also proposes to deduct from the value of the contract
holder's interests an annual charge of 1.8 percent of such value, and
Equity Annuity Life Insurance Company proposes to deduct 1 percent
of such value annually with the right to increase the deduction to 1.8
percent. The foregoing charges include amounts to defray the companies' administrative expenses and other expenses including taxes, investment advice, and contingent mortality reserves as well as to
provide a margin for profits.
A request for exemption from prohibitions of the Investment Company Act against transactions with affiliates to permit the companies
to make advances or bonus payments in unlimited amounts to affiliated persons was denied by the Commission in view of the possible
adverse effect of these "insider" transactions on the companies' common stockholders. The Commission indicated it would consider any
modified request which appropriately limits the amounts of such advances or bonuses. The Commission refused to relieve the companies
from the prohibitions of the Investment Company Act against postponing, for more than seven days after a request for redemption is
made, the payment of the redemption value of the variable annuity
contracts.
In the Equity Annuity Life Insurance Company case, an exemption
was denied from the Investment Company Act's requirement of a
uniform public sales price for redeemable securities. Equity Annuity Life Insurance Company sought this exemption to enable it to
sell its variable annuity contracts to individuals who combine their
separate purchases to obtain the more favorable group contract prices.
In both the Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company and Equity
Annuity Life Insurance Company cases an exemption was granted,
consistent with the Commission's exemptive Rule 22d-l(e), to permit

178

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

a lower public sales price on group contracts sold to pension or profitsharing plans qualified under the Internal Revenue Code.
The decision recognizes that, apart from the corporations themselves, the variable annuity arrangement involves separate investment
companies either as a "fund" or "trust", comprised of the variable
annuity contract holders and the proceeds of their payments. The
Commission exempted these separate investment companies from
registration under the Investment Company Act since Variable Annuity Life Insurance Company and Equity Annuity Life Insurance
Company are both registered under the Investment Company Act and
the contract holders thus receive its protections.
LITIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT

-,

On April 21, 1960 the Commission instituted an action against The
Equity Corporation; Equity General Oorporation, and Development
Oorporation of America 13 to enjoin these companies from violations
of the anti-pyramiding provisions of the Investment Company Act of
1940 and to compel Equity General Corporation to comply with the
registration provisions of the Act. The complaint alleged that on
April 16, 1959, the Commission had granted an application of the defendants to permit Equity and Equity General to acquire all of the
common stock of DCA. This was permitted on the condition, as the
defendants had agreed, that if by December 16, 1959, DCA was still
an investment company, Equity and Equity General would dispose of
the DCA common stock. This date was later extended to March 16,
1960,on Defendant's request. A further request for extension to September 16, 1960, was refused. The complaint charged inter alia that
Equity and Equity General had not complied with the condition in
the Commission's order and had not been diligent in eliminating the
investment company pyramid that was created and also alleged that
Equity General was an investment company which had not registered
under the Act and that Equity's ownership of Equity General contravened the anti-pyramiding prohibition of the Act.
The defendants consented to the entry of a judgment enjoining the
defendants from such violations. The order of the court also provided
that compliance with the injunction should be effected in accordance
with specific directions detailing the steps to be taken and the times
within which the several actions should be performed which would
result in the liquidation or merger into The Equity Corporation of
Equity General Corporation and Development Corporation of America, and provided for the redemption of the preferred stock of Develonment Corporation.

" In 8.E.O. v. M cPhail,14 the Commission brought suit under Sections
36 and 44 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 for an injunction,
the appointment of a receiver and other relief charging that the individual defendants, who were offlcers and directors of the defendant
McPhail Candy Corporation, committed acts involving gross misconduct and gross abuse of trust in respect of that corporation. See the
24th Annual Report, pages 157-158, and the 25th Annual Report,
pages 165-166, for prior discussions of this case. As stated in the
25th Annual Report, the plan of settlement of this action was approved
by the court under the conditions set forth therein. During this fiscaJ
year, the defendant corporation repurchased or redeemed all of its
preferred stock and most of its common stock pursuant to a condition
of the settlement. By virtue of these purchases, the corporation's
outstanding securities were beneficially owned by less than 100 shareholders and, upon application, the Commission declared that the company no longer was an investment company subject to the registration
provisions of the Investment Company Act .
.Although the case was disposed of by a court-approved settlement,
the ruling by the court on the defendants' motion to dismiss portions
of the Commission's complaint has significance. The Commission had
charged the individuaJ defendants with acts committed prior to the
company's registration with it as an investment company but which
were committed at a time when the corporation was nevertheless an
investment company within the meaning of the act and should have
been registered. The court rejected the defendants' contention that
these acts were beyond the scope of an action by the Commission
under- Section 36.
j On November 25, 1959, the Securities and Exchange Commission
filed an action in the United States District Court for the Eastern
District of Missouri against Hilton H. Slayton, Hovey E. Slayton
and Slayton Associates, lne.,16 under Section 36 of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, charging gross misconduct and gross abuse of
trust in respect of Managed Funds, Ine., a registered investment company. In addition, the complaint charges the 3 named defendants
with entering into and performing an investment advisory contract
in violation of Section 15 of the Investment Company Act of 1940,and
further charges that Hilton H. Slayton and Hovey E. Slayton violated
Section 34(b) of that Act by making false and misleading statements
in reports and other documents required to be filed with the Commission. The action seeks an injunction permanently enjoining the defendants £rom serving or acting as officers,directors, investment advisers or principal underwriters in respect of any registered investment

company. An injunction is also sought to prevent further violations
of Sections 15 and 34 (b).
The complaint charges that Hilton and Hovey Slayton effectively
controlled the fund and operated it for their private gain, that in 1952
the Slay tons, acting through Slayton Associates, Inc., entered into an
agreement with Managed Funds whereby Slayton Associates, Inc.,
was retained as an investment adviser of the Fund and was to furnish
the fund with required advisory, research and statistical services for
which it would receive a fee at an annual rate equal to one-half of one
percent of the value of the Fund's total assets and that, pursuant to
this contract, Slayton Associates, Inc. received total fees in excess of
$1,000,000 for the five years ended November 30, 1958. It is further
charged that the Slay tons, acting through Slayton Associates, Inc.,
entered into a contract with Stephen M. Jaquith, then a registered
representative in the employee of Model, Roland and Stone, a member
firm of the New York Stock Exchange, whereby Slayton Associates,
Inc. retained Jaquith as an investment counsel and manager of the
securities portfolio held by the Fund. The contract provided that
for a five year period, beginning December 1, 1953, a total amount of
brokerage commission business of not less than $250,000, and for a
succeeding 5 year period a total amount of brokerage commission of
not less than $175,000, would be the compensation paid to Jaquith or
his designee. The complaint also charges that Hilton and Hovey
Slayton directed Jaquith to make the necessary arrangements to have
Harold W. Smith and James S. Stubbs become registered representatives of the Model firm and directed that Smith and Stubbs be credited
annually with gross brokerage commissions of between $50,000 and
$60,000. Harold W. Smith is Hovey Slayton's brother-in-law, and
James S. Stubbs was formerly the Slayton's attorney and business
associate, and a former director of the Fund. During the life of the
contract with Jaquith, his designee, Model, Roland and Stone, received
$1,940,806.72 in gross brokerage commissions. Smith received gross
commissions in the amount of $240,831 and Stubbs was credited with
gross commissions in the amount of $459,096. In return for these
commissions Smith and Stubbs performed no services for the Fund,
nor for Jaquith, nor for Model, Roland and Stone.
The complaint also charges that Hilton and Hovey Slayton consistently concealed from other members of the Board of Directors material
facts which the Board should have known and which were necessary
and important to the intelligent functioning of the Board, including
the contract between Slayton Associates, Inc. and Stephen M. Jaquith
and that the defendants engaged in an improper practice of selling
portfolio securities for the Fund primarily for the purpose of realizing a uniform and pre-determined amount to be distributed quarterly
to shareholders of the Fund as capital gains, giving no consideration

TWENTY-SIXTH

whatsoever to whether or not the growth potential of a given investment had been fully achieved as set forth in the stated investment
policy of the Fund. This was done, according to the complaint, to
increase sales commissions and management fees, and promote further
sales to existing shareholders. All of these profits flowed into companies, the voting stock of which was wholly owned by Hilton and
Hovey Slayton. The case is now awaiting trial.
CURRENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE INVESTMENT COMPANY FIELD

Following the decision of the Court of Appeals in SEC v.Tnsuranoe
Securities, Inc.,is a number of sales of interests in companies serving
as investment advisers and principal underwriters to registered investment companies at prices which permitted the sellers to realize
substantial profits occurred, and this trend has continued during the
past fiscal year. These sales, in some instances, have been privately
arranged and have involved a change in control. More commonly, the
controlling persons have made public offerings of common stock in the
adviser or underwriter which generally had no voting power but represented a substantial equity in the earnings of the company.
Also, during the past year, a number of stockholder suits have been
instituted alleging that the management or advisory fees paid by investment companies are excessive. These suits have referred to the
profits realized from the sale of interests in the advisory company
and have alleged, in part, that the fees collected are excessive because
the advisory fee is fixed at a flat percentage (usually an annual rate
of % of 1 percent) of the value of the investment company's assets
even though the cost of investment management does not increase
in proportion to the increase in the value of the investment company's assets. Some of the suits have been based on allegations
that the investment companies are being managed in the interests of
the investment advisers and affiliated directors rather than in the interest of the investment company's stockholders and that the payment
of excessive fees under the contracts constitutes a "gross abuse of
trust" by directors or investment advisers, within the purview of Section 36 of the Investment Company Act.
The Act does not specifically provide for any regulation by the
Commission of the amount of fees paid to investment advisers by investment companies. As provided by the Act, the advisory contracts
in question have been approved by shareholders and directors and the
terms thereof are disclosed in the prospectus through which the shares
of the investment companies are offered to the public.
The Commisson has had under consideration the various questions
raised by the nature of the management arrangements for investment
18 254 F. 2d 642 (C.A. 9, 1958).

companies, the sale of interests in the fees to be earned through providing such management and the amount of such fees. Its study of
these matters will be continued..

PART X
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACI' OF
1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
persons who are engaged for compensation in the business of advising
others with respect to securities. There are, however, certain limited
exemptions from the requirement of registration.
One type of exemption applies to persons in certain occupations
when their advice regarding securities is merely an incidental part
of the performance of their normal business or profession.
These
include broker-dealers when they are not separately compensated for
the investment advisory aspects of their work, lawyers, accountants,
engineers and teachers. Magazines and financial publications of general and regular circulation are similarly exempt.
Certain of the exemptions contained in the Act depend for their applicability on the type of clientele of the adviser. One who advises
only investment or insurance companies need not register. An exemption is also afforded the adviser who in the last 12 months had fewer
than 15 clients and does not hold himself out generally to the public
as an investment adviser.
Furthermore, the registration requirement does not apply to one
whose investment advice extends only to persons resident in the state
in which the adviser maintains his principal place of business as long
as the advice proffered does not concern securities listed on a national
securities exchange or admitted to unlisted trading privileges on such
an exchange.
The Act makes it unlawful for registered investment advisers to
engage in practices which constitute fraud or deceit upon clients. If
an adviser is also a broker or dealer, he must disclose his interest
in any transaction in which he acts as an investment adviser. The Act
also prohibits an investment adviser from basing his compensation
upon a share of the capital gains realized or the capital appreciation
of his client's funds. Furthermore, a client's consent is required before an assignment of his investment advisory contract can be effected.
The Act does not grant the Commission power to inspect the books
and records of a registered investment adviser, but proceedings by
the Commission to revoke or deny the registration of an investment
adviser may be instituted under specific circumstances.
The filing
183

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

184

of a false application for registration constitutes sufficient grounds
for administrative proceedings on the question of whether registration should be denied or revoked. Other than this, action by the
Commission must be preceded by either an injunction against the
adviser by a court of competent jurisdiction from activities in connection with his conduct as an investment adviser or certain other
activities or the conviction of the adviser within the previous ten years
of a crime involving securities, the securities business, or certain related activities.'
During the past fiscal year, the number of registered investment
advisers reached a total of 1867. The following table contains statistics concerning the registration and applications for registrations
during fiscal year 1960.

In 8.E.0. v. Financial Forecaster, Inc.2 the Commission charged
the company and its president, Walter Rosenbush, with violations of
the registration and the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act. The Commission's complaint charged that the company
had been operating as an investment adviser since July 1959 and that
it had not registered with the Commission pursuant to the requirements of Section 203 of the Investment Advisers Act. A final injunction was entered by consent.

as an investment adviser without registering as required by Section
203 of the Investment Advisers Act. The defendant consented to a
permanent injunction restraining him from further violations of
Section 203.
In S.E.O. v. Oambridge Eeeearoh, and Investment Corporation:"
the Commission's complaint charged violations of Section 206, which
is the antifraud section of the Investment Advisers Act. The defendant's sale of subscriptions to a weekly publication known as the
Investment Chronicle was alleged to be in violation of that section.
As in Miohael8 the defendant consented to a final injunction which
was entered on January 29, 1960.
Security Forecaster 00., Inc. v, S.E.0.5 was a petition for review of
an order of the Commission, which revoked petitioner's registration
as an investment adviser. A stay of the Commission's order was denied. The Commission's motion to dismiss the petition for review for
lack of prosecution was granted by the court on June 20,1960. The
complaint against the defendant, James M. Barnes, a Canadian resident who was not served in the action, was dismissed on February 29,
1960.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION

COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the fiscal year 1960 there were pending in the
courts 56 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices
in the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 90 additional
proceedings were instituted and 63 cases were disposed of, leaving 83
such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 4 proceedings in the
district courts under Section l1(e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act; and in 16 miscellaneous actions. The Commission also
participated in 61 civil appeals in the United States Courts of Appeals. Of these, 17 came before the courts on petition for review of
an administrative order, 16 arose out of corporate reorganizations in
which the Commission had taken an active part, 22 were appeals in
actions brought by or against the Commission, 1 was an appeal from
an order entered pursuant to Section 11(e) of the Public Utility
Holding Company Act, and 5 were appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as amicus curiae. The Commission also participated
in 13 appeals or petitions for certiorari before the United States Supreme Court resulting from these or similar actions.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae,
during the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the
year, are contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during the
year are discussed in the sections of this report relating to the statutes under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General, who may
institute criminal proceedings. The regional offices,and at times, the
main officeof the Commission prepare detailed reports in cases where
the facts appear to warrant criminal prosecution. After careful review by the General Counsel's Office, these reports are considered by
186

TWENTY -SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

187

the Commission, and if it believes criminal prosecution is appropriate, they are forwarded to the Attorney General. Commission employees familiar with the case generally assist the United States attorneys in the presentation to the grand jury, the conduct of the trial,
and the preparation of briefs on appeal. The Commission also submits parole reports prepared by its investigators relating to convicted
offenders.
During the past fiscal year 53 cases. were referred to the Department
of Justice for prosecution.
This is the highest number of referrals
in the past 18 years and the second highest in the Commission's history and is in line with the continuing increase in the number of referrals during the past several years. As a result of these and prior
referrals, 43 indictments were returned against 289 defendants during
the fiscal year. This, in keeping with recent trends, represents the
largest number of defendants indicted since 1lJ86. There also were 66
convictions in 30 cases, the largest number of convictions since the
early 1940's. The conviction in one case was affirmed on appeal and
appeals were pending in '7 other criminal cases at the close of the
period.' There was an acquittal in one criminal contempt case and 4
others were pending at the end of the year. I
From 1934, when the Commission was established, until June 30,
1960,2,777 defendants have been indicted in the United States District
Courts in 645 cases developed by the Commission, and 1,385 convictions
obtained in 585 cases. The record of convictions obtained and upheld
in completed. cases is over 85 percent for the 26-year life of the Commission,"
Among the criminal cases successfully concluded during the fiscal
year 1960 was the first prosecution for failure to file reports required
to be made pursuant to the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and similar charges are now pending in another case. Violations involving the
filing of false statements or reports under that Act, as well as the
Securities .Act of 1933, were involved in a number of other prosecutions. Convictions also were obtained for failure to comply with the
registration disclosure provisions of the latter Act in the public offering of securities. Similar registration violations also were charged
in a number of the fraud and manipulation cases developed or prosecuted during the year. The fraud cases, as in prior years, covered a
wide variety of fraudulent practices.
They included high-pressure
long distance telephone "boiler room" frauds and other fraudulent

conduct on the part of securities broker-dealers and their representatives; frauds by investment advisers; frauds in the sale of securities
of established, as well as new, businesses; fraudulent securities sales
relating to the promotion of insurance companies and finance companies oil and gas and mining ventures, alleged inventions and other
spurio~ investment schemes, and the sale of forged securities. Because of the large volume of cases it is impossible to report in detail all
of the criminal matters, but some of the more important and endless
variety of fraudulent devices and techniques are described in the specific cases discussed below.'
After a 7-week trial the defendants in United States v. Aleeamder L.
Guterma, et al. (F. L. Jacobs Co.) (S.D. N.Y.) were convicted of
violating and conspiring to violate the reporting provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and for conspiring to defraud the
United States by obstructing the lawful functions of the Commission
in its protection of the investing public. This landmark case represents the first criminal prosecution of corporate insiders for their failure to file stock ownership reports under the Securities Exchange Act
and for their obstruction of the making and filing of an annual report
required to be filed under that Act by companies having securities
listed on a national securities exchange, in this instance the New York
Stock Exchange," The vital importance of these provisions is
cogently demonstrated by this case where the evidence adduced at the
trial showed that the motive for the defendants' failure to file the
required reports was to conceal their manipulative and other transactions in the securities of the company and their simultaneous wholesale looting of the assets of the company for their personal benefit.
Guterma received a sentence of 4 years and 11 months and a fine of
$160,000,and his co-defendant Eveleigh was sentenced to 2 years and
11 months and a $10,000 fine. Maximum fines were imposed on
two corporate defendants controlled and dominated by these defendants. Bail was denied pending their appeals, and they were remanded
to jail. Shortly after the close of the fiscal year the convictions were
unanimously affirmed by the Court of Appeals. 6
Guterma also is a defendant in United States v. Aleeamder L.

Chemical Corporation, in which the indictment is pending. This indictment charges Guterma and others with violating and conspiring

to violate the reporting provisions as well as the proxy rules of the
Securities Exchange Act, and with conspiring to defraud the United
States by impeding the functions of the Commission in its protection
of investors. The indictment charges that Guterma, together with
other defendants, delayed and obstructed the making and filing of
annual and current reports of the United Dye and Chemical Corporation required to be filed with the New York Stock Exchange and the
Commission, and solicited proxies by means of a false and misleading
statement concerning Guterma's activities with respect to this company. The indictment further charges that Guterma and other defendants employed a scheme to defraud purchasers of United Dye
and Chemical Corporation stock and, as part of such scheme, acquired
control of the corporation, obstructed and delayed the disclosure of
material transactions by Lowell M. Birrell, a co-defendant, while he
was Chairman of the Board and a director of the United Dye and
Chemical Corporation, and made false and misleading statements to
aid in the distribution of shares of United Dye and Chemical Corporation stock to the investing public. It is further charged that the
defendants purchased stock of the United Dye and Chemical Corporation on the New York Stock Exchange in order artificially to maintain
its price on that exchange.
The use of false and misleading proxy soliciting material also is
involved in the pending indictment in United States v, Maurice Olen,
et al, (S.D. N.Y.) where the defendants are charged also with using
false financial statements in an offering of the common stock of the
Olen Co. to the public. The defendants are charged with concealing
the true financial condition of the Olen Co. by substantially understating the company's liabilities and by misstating other figures.
False financial statements are alleged to have been included in the
prospectus issued by the Olen Co. when it offered its common stock
to the public, as well as in the solicitation of proxies in connection
with the merger of the Olen Co. with H. L. Green Co., Inc.
False financial statements in a registration statement were involved
in United States v, Harold W. Danser, Jr. and Ultrasonic Oorporation (D. Mass.) where both defendants were convicted of violating
the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. A 2-year
suspended sentence and a $15,000 fine were imposed upon Danser."
The corporation was fined $25,000. The indictment charged that the
defendants sold securities of Ultrasonic Corporation by means of
false financial statements which represented that the corporation was
operating at a profit when, in fact, it had suffered substantial losses
and its assets were substantially less than those stated. In addition,
it was charged that defendants concealed large operating losses in7

Affirmed, C.A. 1, September 7, 1960.

curred by the corporation subsequent to the period covered by the
financial statements furnished to investors.
Violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 were charged in United States v, Pkilip O. Meade, et al. (S.D.
Ind.), where the defendants sold stock under an alleged intrastate
exemption which, among other things, requires sales to be restricted
to a single state. In fact, the defendants sold stock both within and
without the State of Indiana and, by the use of dummies and nominees,
endeavored to conceal the true identity of the out-of-state purchasers
of such securities and to create the appearance of sales to residents of
Indiana alone.
Evasion of the registration provisions is alleged, among other
things, in United States v, Benjamin W. Sibver, et al; (D. Nev.) in
connection with the sale of stock in the promotion of a new hotel and
a gambling casino in Las Vegas. The indictment charges that the
defendants flied a registration statement covering the proposed offering of preferred and common stock with the Commission, but that
the registration statement never became effective and was withdrawn
by the defendants,
Nevertheless, the indictment alleges, the defendants, in an attempt to evade the registration requirements, caused the
company to issue this stock to its then dominating officer in consideration of his unsecured promissory note and then sold the stock to the
public purportedly for the benefit of the corporation.
Violations of the registration provisions, coupled with violations
of the mail fraud statute, resulted in sentences ranging from two to five
years and $10,000 fines in United States v, Francis Peter 01'osoy, et al,
(S.D.N. Y.) . This case, in which the Commission collaborated with
the Post Office Department in the investigation, involved the fraudulent sale of about 9,000,000 shares of stock in Texas-Adams Oil, Inc.
to about 400,000 residents of the United States who were defrauded
of approximately $4,000,000. The Postal authorities consider this to
be one of the largest stock promotion schemes to defraud the public in
the entire history of the Postal Service. The stock also was distributed in violation of the Securities Act registration requirements.
As usual, a large number of the fraud cases prosecuted during the
year involved the sale of securities relating to purported oil, gas and
mining ventures. Convictions were obtained in seven such cases;
United States v. Anderson, et 01. (N.D. Calif.) (copper and silver);
United States v, Oafarelli, et a. (D. Utah) (tungsten); United Staiee
v. William J. Uonrad. (N.D. Ill.) (uranium); United States v. OarlO.

provIsions of the Securities Act of 1933 and was fined $5,000. Roe was found guilty of

and a $5,000 fine. His appeal Is pending.

Fraudulent practices by securities broker-dealers and their representatives resulted in convictions in United States v, Samuel Parker

(S.D. Texas) ; United States v. Bryan H. Kyger, Jr. (S.D. Texas);
United States v. Floyd E. Duzan (D. Minn.) ; and United States v,
Robert Bernard Sills, et al, (S.D. Fla.). In the Pandolfo case, after
a lengthy trial, guilty verdicts were rendered against all eight defendants.l" The defendants were charged with violating the antifraud
and registration provisions of the Securities Act, as well as the brokerdealer registration requirements of the Securities Exchange Act, in
the operation of a securities business. The indictment also charged
that the defendant Samuel Parker Pandolfo acquired for himself and
his close associates large blocks of securities of Great Northern Investment Company, Inc. and thereafter formed Universal Securities,
Inc. to engage generally in the business of a broker-dealer, but particularly to make, maintain and support a market for the Class "A"
stock of Great Northern Investment Company, Inc. The indictment
further charged that the defendants engaged in a scheme to sell securities through Universal Securities, Inc. by falsely representing to investors that the prices at which the securities were sold were determined by an actual bona fide demand for such securities and that a
further rise in the prices of the securities could be immediately
expected.
The conversion of customers' funds or securities was alleged as part
of the fraud charges in the Oampbell, Kyger and Duzan cases. A
similar charge is included in the pending indictment in United State«
v. Robert B. La:rkin (W. D. La.) in which the defendant is a fugitive,"

Leaseholds, Inc.) (S.D. N.Y.), and United States v, Daniel Price,
et al. (Jean R. Veditz Co., Inc.) (E.D. Va.).13 In each of these cases
the defendants are charged with the sale of unregistered securities by
means of misrepresentations made over the long distance telephone
and otherwise to investors residing in various states throughout the
country. Over 130 defendants are named in these indictments and
some of these individuals are charged as defendants in a number of
these cases.
In the Kimball case the defendants are charged with selling unregistered stock of Perry Oil Company to approximately 800 persons
residing throughout the United States for over $700,000 by means of
various fraudulent devices including the usual "boiler room" type of
misrepresentations. It is alleged that the defendants falsely represented, among other things, that the shares of Perry Oil Company
would substantially increase in price in the near future; that the
shares were being sold below the market price; that the shares would
soon be listed on a national securities exchange at increased prices;
and that a merger was imminent which would result in an increase
in the price of the stock. In addition, the indictment alleges that
the defendants assured investors that they were protected from
"boiler room" operations because the Kimball firm had been cleared
by the Commission and that the United States Government had established Kimball Securities Inc. to stabilize the securities market
and as a check on all securities dealers.
In the Younger (James O. Graye 00.) case the indictment charges
Stanley Ira Younger and the other defendants with employing and
conspiring to employ a scheme to defraud investors in the sale of
Atlas Gypsum Corporation, Ltd. stock. It is alleged that the defendants acquired a large block of Atlas Gypsum stock at approximately
20 cents per share and subsequently offered and sold these shares to
numerous persons residing in some 40 States by means of arbitrary
mark-ups at prices ranging from $1.20 to $3.75 per share. It is
charged that for the purpose of executing this scheme the defendants
financed, controlled and managed the broker-dealer firm of J. C.
Graye Co. through which they offered and sold Atlas Gypsum stock
~y m~ans o~ the mails and extensive long distance telephone solicitat~ons in w~lCh they employed the usual "boiler room" misrepresentations, It IS further charged that the defendants engaged in numerous purported over-the-counter transactions in Atlas Gypsum with

no change in beneficial ownership of this stock, thereby creating the
appearance of an active and rising market in such stock.
Similar charges are included in the indictments in the Younqer
(Lincoln Securities Oorp. and Philip Newman Associates, Inc.) cases
where Stanley Ira Younger and a number of his associates are again
named as defendants and charged, along with others, with violating
and conspiring to violate the registration and anti-fraud provisions
of the Securities Act of 1933 in the sale of shares of stock of Shoreland Mines, Ltd. and Monarch Asbestos Co., Ltd., respectively.
In the Van Allen case the indictment, which contains 160 counts,
charges violations of the registration and anti-fraud provisions of
the Securities Act in connection with the sale of 750,000 unregistered
common shares of Gulf Coast Leaseholds, Inc. Among other things,
the indictment alleges that the defendants manipulated and controlled
the market price of the stock; disseminated various publications and
other literature containing false and misleading statements concerning Gulf Coast Leaseholds, Inc. ; and made false and misleading statements in the course of an intensive long distance telephone campaign
to sell the stock.
In the Price case, the defendants are charged, inter alia, with selling by means of long distance telephone the unregistered common
stock of National Electro Process Corporation by fraudulently concealing the true financial condition of the corporation from investors
and at the same time disseminating to them false information concerning the company and its operations.
A conviction for violation of the antimanipulative provisions of
the Securities Exchange Act was obtained in United States v, John A.
Latimer (S.D.N.Y.) where the defendant pleaded guilty to an indictment charging him with employing "wash sales" and "matched
orders" for the purpose of manipulating the market in the stock of
American Tractor Company on the American Stock Exchange.
Violations of the antimanipulative provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act also are included among the pending charges in United
States v, Sydney L. Albert, et al. (S.D.N.Y.) and United States v,
Edward Talenfeld, et al. (W.D. Pa.). In the Albert case the indictment also charges violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act in connection with transactions in the
common stock of Bellanca Corporation. It is alleged that the defendants used nominees to effect purchases of Bellanca common stock
on the American Stock Exchange, effected a series of transactions in
order to raise the price of the Bellanca stock and, after fraudulently
inflating its price, offered and sold the stock of Bellanca for assets and
securities of other corporations.
In the Talenfeld case the indictment charges the defendants with
effecting a series of transactions in the common stock of Cornucopia

194

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Gold Mines and with creating actual and apparent active trading in
this security and raising its price for the purpose of inducing the purchase and sale of the security by others. The defendants also are
charged with conspiring to file and causing to be filed with the Commission false proxy solicitation material and false affidavits concerning transactions in the stock of Cornucopia Gold Mines.
Manipulative transactions also were alleged as part of the fraud
in the sale of stock of Nev-Tah Oil and Mining Company in United
States v. Arthue: L. Damon (D. Nev.). The defendant was sentenced
to a prison term of a year and a day upon his plea of guilty to charg-es
that he acquired control of the company; that he caused the market
price of its stock on the Salt Lake Stock Exchange to rise above 45
cents per share through the use of flamboyant and misleading reports,
letters and oral statements; that he caused the company to issue stock
into a series of escrows for release at prices ranging from 9 cents to 45
cents per share; and that he offered and sold the escrowed stock to
California residents at prices in excess of the escrowed prices, and near
the artificial exchange price. The indictment further charged that
Damon made fraudulent representations to investors concerning the
financial status of the company, the potential ore reserves of certain
mining properties owned or leased by the company and the company's
earnings and ability to pay dividends.
The fraudulent sale of corporate notes and debentures of Alabama
Acceptance Corporation led to the conviction of all defendants in
United States v, Kolman Greenhill, et al. (N.D. Ala.). Two defendants were found guilty after trial 14 and three others were convicted
on nolo contendere pleas of employing a scheme to defraud investors
by means of false representations, pretenses and promises. Among
the false representations alleged to have been used by defendants in
the sale of notes aud debentures of the corporation were the following: that Alabama Acceptance Corporation was in a sound financial
condition, was realizing profits from its operations, and that investments in its notes and debentures were safe, sound and profitable; that
the corporation was realizing a 12 percent to 16 percent return on its
loans and investments and could well afford to pay 8 percent interest
because its income taxes were 52 percent and the government absorbed
more than one-half of such interest; and that it was purchasing
established companies with a long record of earnings, and was receiving income from ito; investments therein. It is further alleged that
the defendants withdrew large sums of money and other assets from
the corporation and its so-called subsidiaries, but made no accounting
therefor.
Another case involving the sale of stock in a supposedly successful
finance company is United States v. Edward L. GiJJbons, et d. (D.

pending.

Idaho), which is pending. The indictment charges, inter alia, that
the defendants falsely represented that the American National Investment Company was a going and profitable concern with a million
dollars in assets and two active loan officeswhich were earning up to
a 42 percent profit on their turnover of money. It further charges
that the defendants omitted to state that 621;2percent of the proceeds
from the sale of stock was being paid to one defendant and that the
company not only did not have a small loan company license, but had
been refused one by the State of Idaho.
The fraudulent sale of notes is charged in United States v. Thomas
A. M01"1'i8,
et al. (E.D. Pa.) ; United States v. Kirchofer, et al. (E.D.
N.C.) and United States v. Robert M. Denner, et al. (S.D. Fla.),
where the indictments are pending. In the M orris case, involving
the offer and sale of debenture bonds and promissory notes of Evergreen Memorial Park Association, a cemetery promotion, the indictment charges the defendants with falsely representing the entire
financial structure of the association. In both the Kirchofer and
Denner cases the defendants are charged with employing the "Ponzi"
fraud technique, whereby monies are paid back by the promoters to
investors out of the investors' own funds and falsely represented to
be profits or interest on their investments. In the Kirchofer case the
defendants also are charged with selling participations in fictitious,
spurious and nonexistent mortgages and notes.
Fraud charges in the promotion of spurious investment schemes
are included in the indictments pending in United States v. Peter
Sahadi, et al. (D. Conn.), U'ltited States v, Arthur J. Raible (S.D.
Ohio), and United States v. Lloyd B. Fenderson (D. N.H.).
In the Sahadi case, the indictment charges that as a part of the
scheme and artifice to defraud, the defendants took over Texas Building Company, a dormant corporation, increased its capitalization to
1,000,000 shares of common stock, and thereafter entered orders with
various securities brokers in Los Angeles, New York, and Boston to
purchase the stock at $12 to $17 a share and caused purchase quotations to be published in the National Daily Quotation Service. It is
further charged that defendants caused spurious stock certificates to
be printed and circulated to various cities throughout the United
States and thereafter attempted to sell this spurious stock through
brokers and to borrow substantial sums of money from banks, finance
companies and other lending institutions, using the Texas stock as
collateral, knowing that the quotations referred to were false and
without foundation, and that the certificates were without value. In
the Raible case, the defendant is charged with selling investment
contracts and other securities involving purported options granted
by the Briggs Manufacturing Company for the purchase of its common stock. The indictment charges that, as part of the scheme to

196

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

defraud, the defendant falsely represented that such options had been
granted to him and other officersof the company and that they could
be exercised to obtain the stock at prices substantially below the
market value.
In the Fenderson case the defendant is charged with employing a
scheme to defraud by falsely representing that monies obtained would
be invested in prime investment securities when, in fact, the funds
were misappropriated by the defendant. Similar charges led to a
conviction in United States v. Benjamin F. Kaufman (D. N.H.)
where the defendant also misappropriated the funds which were
obtained on the false representation that they would be invested in
safe, sound and conservative securities for the investor's benefit.
An indictment was returned in United States v. Ben Jack Oage,
et al. (N.D. Tex.) charging the defendants with fraud in the sale of
purported revenue bonds of the City of West Buechel, Kentucky.
The indictment charges that the defendants caused the City of West
Buechel to pass an ordinance authorizing and providing for the
issuance of $2,000,000 face amount of water works, sewer drainage
and street revenue bonds, purportedly to finance the construction of
such improvements for the city. In effect, the defendants are charged
with causing a sale of these bonds to a company controlled by Ben
Jack Cage on terms which provided for payment for the bonds of
$275,000in cash and a promissory note for $1,125,000payable in seven
annual installments, with installments other than the first payable
by the return of revenue bonds. In addition, the defendants are
charged with having sold these bonds to various insurance companies
and others in Texas and Alabama with the bonds being recorded by
the insurance companies as assets.
Two cases involving charges of fraudulent stock sales, where the
investors were principally school teachers, were United States v. Lee
A. Ourtie, Jr. et al, (N.D. Ga.) and United States v. Robert Lee
Proffer, et al, (N.D. Tex.), In the (Iurti« case the indictment alleges
that the defendants, operating through Greater Georgia Investment
Corporation, defrauded investors by falsely and fraudulently representing, inter alia, that the funds of Greater Georgia Investment
Corporation would be used in an investment program of 50 percent
for teacher loans, 25 percent for short-term gain investments, and
25 percent for blue-chip investments; that loans would be made exclusively to people in the educational field and would be secured by
good collateral; that State Superintendents of Schools and other
leading educators had purchased stock of Greater Georgia Investment
Corporation; and that investments in its securities were safe. It is
further alleged that defendants caused Greater Georgia Investment
Corporation to maintain false books and records and that they caused

TWENTY-SIXTH

AJ.'lNUAL REPORT

197

to be prepared false financial statements which they used in the sale
of its securities.
In the Proffer case four defendants pleaded guilty and 2 defendants
were convicted after trial."
The indictment charged that the defendants falsely represented that the Teachers Professional Investment Company in which they were selling stock owned 16,212 shares
in a life insurance company valued at $108,160.72, and that it had an
earned surplus of $14,278.30; and that money received from the sale
of company stock would be used primarily to finance loans on automobiles for school teachers in the State of Texas. The indictment
further charged that these defendants omitted to state that they were
making uncollateralized loans to themselves from the proceeds of the
stock sales.
Charges of fraud in connection with the sale of securities of insurance companies were included in the following cases: United States v.
Oharle8 F. Newell, et al. (D. Neb.) ; United States v, Clarence Hauw,
et al. (E.D. Wash.) ; United States v, James Lamar McMichael (D.
Ala.); United States v, Leon A. Oohen, et al, (W.D. Ga.) ; and United
States v, Thomas E. Hand., Jr., et al. (S.D. Tex.).
After a jury trial all defendants were convicted in the Newell case,
where the indictment charged them with misrepresenting in the sale of
stock of the Unity Insurance Company that purchasers could get their
money back at any time with 5 percent interest; that the money raised
from the sale of stock would be placed in escrow until the franchise
was issued to the Unity Insurance Company by the State of Nebraska;
that the stock was going to rise in price; and that the company had
money to qualify for and get its insurance license. The defendants
also were charged with investing the funds derived from the sale of
stock in business ventures unrelated to the organization of an insurance company and with concealing from the investors that the principal organizers, officers, and directors of the Unity Insurance Company did not invest any of their own money in the company, that the
stock which they were selling was stock already optioned to themselves and that the greater portion of the purchase price would be
retained by them for their own use.
Likewise, the Haue case resulted in convictions of all 3 defendants.
The defendants were charged with acquiring shares of the outstanding
stock of the American Founders Life Insurance Company at a goingmarket price of $2 a share and reselling such shares to investors, many
of whom were their personal clients in the life insurance business, at
prices ranging from $7 to $20 a share by falsely representing that the
company had paid substantial dividends; that defendants were acting
on behalf of the insurance company which would receive the proceeds of the sales; that the stock could be resold at any time for as
15

Appeal Is pendIng and one defendant Is awaIting trIal.

198

SECURITIES A.L~DEXCHANGE COMMISSION

much or more than the prices paid; and that such prices represented
the current market price. It was also charged that the defendants
omitted to disclose that large blocks of this stock were available for
$2 per share; that the insurance company suffered substantial losses
and had been the subject of a recent fraud injunction and that the
proceeds of these stock sales were to be kept for their own personal
use.

In the McMichael case the defendant was convicted of fraudulently
selling preorganization subscriptions and certificates for stock in
United Security Inc., a holding company proposed to be organized by
him purportedly for the purpose of acquiring and consolidating a
number of insurance companies. The defendant was further charged
with falsely representing that money paid in by investors would be
deposited in escrow with the South Carolina National Bank, and, if
the corporation did not obtain its charter before a specified date, that
the funds of these investors would be returned to them.
The indictments in the Hand and Oohen cases are pending. In
these cases the defendants are charged, inter alia, with fraudulently
representing that the companies involved would benefit from the sale
of stock which in fact was personally owned, and that each company
was in excellent financial condition, when in fact all had suffered
recent financial reversals.
The sale of securities in connection with the promotion of alleged
valuable inventions is involved in the indictments in United States
v, Francis A. Moulton (D. Mass.) ; United States v. John Milton Addison, et a. (N.D. Tex.); and United States v. Olark L. Fry (W.D.
Wisc.). Moulton was convicted and sentenced to a 2-year prison term
for selling unregistered stock of the Francis Distributing Company,
Inc. and other securities by falsely representing, among other things,
that the company owned the patent rights to a "wheel chock," that
a contract for the purchase of a substantial number of these chocks
by the Ford Company was ready for execution, and that the State
of Massachusetts had contracted for the installation of the wheel
chocks on all of its trucks.
In the Addison case, which is awaiting trial, the defendants are
charged with violating the registration and anti-fraud provisions of
the Securities Act in the sale of unregistered notes, evidences of indebtedness, investment contracts, and a variety of other securities in
connection with the promotion of a "Benson Upgrader" which they
represented could upgrade low grade unmarketable uranium ore to
produce a marketable commercial uranium ore; that one such machine
would net $86,000per day; and that the defendants would make many
millions of dollars in the operation of that machine. It is further
charged that the defendants falsely represented that a large securities
firm had offered $18,000,000for a 49 percent interest in the defendant

Addison's business 'ventures, and that the investors would participate
in these tremendous profits to an extent resting solely within the discretion of Addison based on the gratitude which he felt for the loyalty,
trust and confidence which the investors reposed in him.
In the Fry case the pending indictment charges similar violations in
the sale of notes, investment contracts and evidences of indebtedness
relating to the purported development and promotion by the defendant of various inventions and devices, including a machine for generating energy, a protective paint application, a non-slip locknut and
a water-retaining fertilizer.
Joseph L. Gruber pleaded guilty in the District of Massachusetts
to an indictment charging him with violating the registration and
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act in the sale of unregistered
stock of the Eagle Oil and Supply Company, Inc. The defendant
falsely represented that the company was averaging sales of $40,000
to $50,000 per month and was doing a half-million dollar business
annually; that its operations were the "next most profitable to bootlegging," except that its business was legitimate; that the stock would
be split ten for one and then offered to the general public at a much
higher price; and that the Cadillac Division of General Motors was
using Eagle's products and that the Ford Motor Company was going
to use Eagle's products instead of the usual break-in lubricants used
on new cars.
In United States v. F. Payson Todd (D. Mass.) the defendant is
charged with violating the antitouting provisions of the Securities
Act and the antifraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 in connection with the common stock of Canadian Javelin, Limited. The indictment, among other things, charges that the defendant,
while doing business as The New England Counsellor and registered
with the Commission as an investment adviser, employed a scheme to
defraud in that he recommended to his clients the purchase at the
market of the stock of Canadian Javelin without disclosing that he
had received compensation from the issuer, underwriters and dealers
therefor. It is further charged that the defendant failed to disclose
to clients that his recommendations to purchase at the market were for
the purpose of facilitating a distribution of the stock by creating a
demand therefor, and to raise its market price.
M aye'!' Algranati was indicted for perjury in the Southern District
of New York for falsely testifying before the Commission in connection with the Commission's investigation into violations of the
Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act by the New York
broker-dealer firm of Kimball Securities, Inc. in connection with the
offer and sale of common stock of Perry Oil Company. John. Van
Allen and Roy B. Kelly were indicted in the same district for violating the false-statement provisions of the United States Criminal Code.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

These defendants are charged with submitting false, fictitious and
fraudulent statements and a false document to the New York Regional
Office of the Commission in matters relating to the purchase and sale
of securities of Gulf Coast Leaseholds, Inc. These indictments are
companion cases to earlier indictments in the Kimball Securities, Inc.
and Gulf (Ioast Leaseholds, Inc. cases, both of which were previously
discussed.
In the sole appellate decision in a criminal case during the fiscal
year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit unanimously affirmed the conviction of A1"1WldE. Vandersee who was sentenced to an 8-year prison term and $5,000 fine for violating the
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in connection with
the sale of stock of the Vandersee Corporation in the promotion of a
purported invention characterized as a "Metalizing Gun."
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the Acts administered by the Commission specifically authorize investigations to determine whether violations of law have
occurred.
The Commission's policy of conducting such investigations privately
is necessary for effective law enforcement and in the interest of fairness to persons against whom unfounded charges may be presented.
Private investigations prevent suspected violators from being warned
and afforded an opportunity to frustrate the Commission's efforts in
obtaining evidence to establish violations. A similar policy is followed by most law enforcement agencies. Many situations which are
investigated ultimately develop facts which establish that no violation
has occurred. To conduct such investigations publicly would ordinarily result in hardship or embarrassment to innocent persons and
might affect the market for the securities in question, resulting in
injury to public investors. Many persons have a tendency to be reluctant to furnish information concerning suspected violations if they
think their personal affairs might be publicized. The Commission's
policy is designed to protect both those who furnish information relating to securities transactions and the subjects of investigation against
whom no violation ultimately is established. Accordingly, the Commission does not generally divulge the existence of or the results of
any investigation until the facts are made a matter of public record
through proceedings before the Commission or in the courts.
Investigations are conducted primarily by the Commission's regional or branch offices. In addition, the Special Investigations Unit
of the Division of Trading and Exchanges conducts investigations
dealing with matters of particular public interest or urgency either
independently or by assisting the staff of the regional offices. Much of
the work of the Special Investigations Unit in the past year has been

TWENTY-SIXTH ANNUAL REPORT

201

devoted to investigation and prosecution of persons engaged in "boilerroom" operations in the New York area. The Division of Trading
and Exchanges in the principal office exercises general supervision
over and coordination of the investigative and enforcement activities
of the regional office. It examines and analyzes the results of investigations and makes appropriate recommendations to the Commission
with respect to what enforcement action should be taken. Serious consideration is given to the recommendations of the regional offices in
each instance.
One of the principal sources of information upon which investigations are based is complaints from members of the public concerning
the activities of persons involved in the offer and sale of securities.
Information of this type is carefully studied and if it appears that violations of Federal securities laws may be involved an investigation is
commenced. Other sources of information which may be of great
help to the Commission in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities
are national securities exchanges, brokerage firms, State and Canadian securities authorities, Better Business Bureaus, Chambers of
Commerce, and the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
Information from these sources has been very helpful, for it comes
from persons who are often familiar with the operation and applicability of Federal securities laws. Many investigations also result
from processing of filings which are required to be made with the
Commission. Many preliminary investigations disclose no violation
of law or a violation due to misunderstanding or ignorance of the law.
Where no harm to the public has resulted, it is a policy of the Commission to inform the offender of the violation and afford an opportunity to take steps to assure future compliance. Appropriate action is
taken where such an offender fails to come promptly into compliance.
If the necessary evidence to determine whether a violation has occurred is not readily developed by a limited investigation of this
nature, a case is docketed and a full investigation made. In order to
obtain all of the necessary evidence, it is frequently necessary that a
formal order of investigaton be adopted by the Commission appointing members of the staff as officers with power to issue subpoenas for
the production of documentary evidence, the appearance of witnesses
and the taking of testimony under oath. This step is taken only
when the investigations cannot be otherwise successfully completed,
such as when principals and others involved in the investigation are
uncooperative and the evidence can be adduced only through the use
of the subpoena power. During the past year 117 formal orders of
investigation were issued in connection with investigations handled
through the Division of Trading and Exchanges.
The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance also conducts investigations where necessary to assist in processing filings made with

202

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

that Division under either the Securities Act or the Securities
Exchange Act.
When an investigation has been completed and action appears warranted, the Commission may proceed in one of several ways. When
required in the public interest the case, with all evidence and exhibits,
may be referred to the Department of Justice with a recommendation
for criminal prosecution. Members of the staff who are familiar with
the evidence assist the Department of Justice and the United. States
Attorney in the presentation of the case to the Grand Jury and in the
trial if an indictment is returned. In appropriate cases, the Commission may authorize the staff to institute civil action in its name for
injunctive relief. The complaint in such a case is filed in the appropriate United States district court and the trial conducted by memhers of the Commission's staff. The Commission may also institute
administrative proceedings when the investigation indicates such
action appropriate which may result in the issuance of a stop-order as
to a registration statement or the suspension or revocation of the registration of a broker-dealer or an investment adviser.

activities of the Commission during fiscal 1960:

ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPECT TO CANADIAN SECURITIES

The unlawful offering and sale of securities by Canadian issuers
and broker-dealers continues to be a serious problem. In such enforcement activities the Commission is severely handicapped in that ordinarily both the violator and essential evidence are in Canada , where
persons, books and records are beyond our investigative and supoena
powers. It is therefore difficult, and in most instances impossible, to
obtain admissible evidence with respect to such violations. Even
when evidence is obtainable, sanctions, such as civil or criminal prosecutions, cannot be utilized unless personal jurisdiction over defendants
can be secured.
However, the Commission, acting within its jurisdictional limitations, has made aggressive efforts to deal with the problem. Hundreds of investigations have been made, injunctions have been secured

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

203

whenever jurisdiction over violators could be obtained, and a substantial number of criminal indictments have been returned.
Enforcement difficulties were highlighted in a test case under the
Supplementary Extradition Convention consummated in July 1952,
the details of which were furnished in our 22d Annual Report.
Canadian courts denied extradition of a person who had been indicted
in the United States for fraudulent sales of securities to residents of
the United States by means of the mails and long-distance telephone.
Through appropriate diplomatic channels, negotiations are being
continued in an effort to remedy this situation. Currently the Commission is almost wholly dependent upon voluntary cooperation of
Canadian provincial regulatory authorities.
When evidence is obtainable that securities are being offered and
sold by means of fraudulent representations, the Commission collects
such evidence and refers it to the Post OfficeDepartment with an application for the issuance of a foreign fraud order. Such order prohibits the dispatch of mail from the United States addressed to the
person or persons named in the order. The order, however, does not
prohibit mailings in Canada and the delivery of such mailings to residents of the United States. During the past fiscal year, upon
evidence furnished by the Commission, six foreign fraud orders have
been issued. Also six "extensions" to such orders have been issued to
cover changes of address by persons who sought by such changes to
avoid the consequences of original orders directed to them. As of
June 30, 1960, eleven additional cases in which the Commission furnished evidence were pending in the Post Office Department.
Canada does not have federal securities legislation nor a federal
regulatory body. The public offering and sale of securities are regulated on a provincial basis similar to the administration of state blue
sky laws in this country. Excellent cooperation in the enforcement
work of the Commission has been obtained from most provinces. In
particular, the arrangement with the Saskatchewan Securities Commission, described in the 25th Annual Report, has been of material
assistance and a source of encouragement for further progress in this
field.
Details concerning actions involving Canadian securities are described elsewhere in the section relating to litigation under the Securities Act of 1933 and the section relating to Criminal Proceedings.
The Commission continues to maintain its Canadian Restricted
List. This is a list of Canadian companies whose securities the Commission has reason to believe currently are being, or recently have
been, distributed in the United States in violation of the registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Failure to comply with
the registration requirements deprives investors of material information and facilitates false claims as to the work of securities. Thus

204

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

investors are denied the essential protections provided by the Securities Act.
The list and supplements thereto are issued to and published by the
press and copies are mailed to all registered broker-dealers and are
available to the public. The list serves as a warning to the public and
alerts broker-dealers to the fact that transactions in the securities of
the companies named therein may be unlawful. Most United States
broker-dealers refuse to execute transactions in such securities.
During the fiscal year 1960, 26 supplements to the list were issued
in which 82 names were added and 9 deleted upon compliance with
established procedures. On June 27, 1960, the list was revised and
consolidated, resulting in the deletion of 54 names in instances where
the Commission had no evidence of an unlawful public offering or
sale of securities in the United States during the past three years,
where the companies were no longer in existence due to mergers,
charter surrenders, etc., and where there has been a change of name.
In the latter case the new name is included on the current list. The
number of names on the list as of June 30, 1960, was 210.
The current list, reflecting additions and deletions to September 30,
1960,follows:

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

A Section of Securities Violations is maintained by the Commission as a part of its enforcement program to provide a further means
of detecting and preventing fraud in securities transactions. The
Section maintains files providing a clearinghouse for other enforcement agencies for information concerning persons who have been
charged with violations of various Federal and State securities
statutes. Considerable information is also available concerning violators resident in the provinces of Canada. The specialized information in these files is kept current through the cooperation of the United
States Post Office Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation,
parole and probation officials, State securities authorities, Federal
and State prosecuting attorneys, police officers,better business bureaus,
chambers of commerce and other agencies. .At the end of the fiscal
year these records contained information concerning 71,748 persons
against whom Federal or State action had been taken in connection
with securities violations. In keeping these records current, there
were added during the fiscal year items of information concerning
9,097 persons, including 2,735 persons not previously identified in
these records.
The Section issues and distributes quarterly a Securities Violations
Bulletin containing information received during the period concern-

TWENTY-SIXTH

ANNUAL REPORT

207

ing violators and showing new charges and developments in pending
cases. The Bulletin includes a "Wanted" section listing the names
and references to bulletins containing descriptive information as to
persons wanted on securities violations charges. The Bulletin is distributed to a limited number of officials of cooperating law enforcement and other agencies in the United States and Canada.
Extensive use is made of the information available in these records
by regulatory and law enforcing officials. Numerous requests are received each year for special reports on individuals in addition to the
information supplied by regular distribution of the quarterly bulletin.
All available information is supplied in response to inquiries from law
enforcement agencies. During the fiscal year the Commission received 3,373 "securities violations" letters or reports and dispatched
1,157 communications to cooperating agencies.
APPLICATIONS

FOR NONDISCLOSURE

OF CERTAIN

INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various Acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes.
Thus,
under paragraph (30) of Schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933,
disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value
of the contract and is not necessary for the protection of the investors.
Under Section 24(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade
secrets or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with
the Commission, and under Section 24(b) of that Act written objection to public disclosure of information contained in any such material
may be made by the Commission which is then authorized to make
public disclosure of such information only if in its judgment such disclosure is in the public interest. Similar provisions are contained in
Section 22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and
in Section 45 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These statutory provisions have been implemented by rules specifying the procedure to be followed by persons who apply to the Commission for a
determination that public disclosure is not necessary in a particular

case.

ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Successive reports of the Commission have called attention to the
fact that the detailed provisions of the several Acts administered by
the Commission recognize the importance of dependable informative
financial statements which disclose the financial status and earnings
history of a corporation or other commercial entity. These statements,
whether filed in compliance with the statutes administered by the
Commission or included in other material available to stockholders or
prospective investors, are indispensable to investors as a basis for
investment decisions.
The Congress recognized the importance of these statements and
that they lend themselves readily to misleading inferences or even
deception, whether or not intended. It accordingly dealt extensively
in the several statutes administered by the Commission with financial
statement presentation and the disclosure requirements necessary to
set forth fairly the financial condition of the company. Thus, for
example, the Securities Act requires the inclusion in the prospectus of
balance sheets and profit and loss statements "in such form as the
Commission shall prescribe" 16 and authorizes the Commission to prescribe the "items or details to be shown in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods to be followed in the preparation of
accounts * * *." 17 Similar authority is contained in the Securities
Exchange Act,I8 and even more comprehensive power is embodied
in the Investment Company Act 19 and the Public Utility Holding
Company Act.20
The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commis,. Sections 7 and 10(a),
17 Section 19 (a).
18 Section 13 (b) .

sion shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 21 The other three statutes permit the Commission to require
that such statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent
public accountant." and the Commission's rules require, with minor
exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by
qualified accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some
individual accountants, was for the first time authoritatively and
explicitly introduced into law in 1933. Out of this initial provision
in the Securities Act and the rules promulgated by the Commission, 23
and the action taken by the Commission in certain cases," have grown
concepts of accountant-client relationships that have strengthened the
protection given to investors.
As shown above, the statutes administered by the Commission give it
broad rule-making power with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements. Pursuant to authority contained in the
statutes, the Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts
for companies subject to the Holding Company Act; 25 has adopted
rules under the Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and
auditing of securities brokers and dealers; 26 and has promulgated
rules contained in a single, comprehensive regulation, identified as
Regulation S-X,27 which govern the form and content of financial
statements filed in compliance with the several Acts. This regulation
is implemented by the Commission's Accounting Series Releases, of
which 86 have so far been issued. These releases were inaugurated
in 1937 and were designed as a program for making public, from
time to time, opinions on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in
major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for the uniform systems of accounts which are regulatory reports, prescribe accounting principles to be followed only
in certain basic respects. In the large area of financial reporting
not covered by such rules, the Commission's principal reliance for the
protection of investors is on the certifying accountants' determination

and application of accounting principles and auditing standards which
are recognized as sound and which have attained general acceptance.
This procedure, which is in accordance with the provisions of the
various Acts, places great reliance and responsibility on the accounting
profession. The Commission, therefore, is ever vigilant in its efforts
to assure itself that the audits which it requires are performed by accountants who are not connected with the registrant or its management
and that appropriate auditing and accounting practices and standards
have been followed. This endeavor often involves delicate decisions
between the public interest and the interests of the accountants, particularly with respect to companies which have not previously had a
public interest and consequently less need for a clear-cut status of
independence of their accountants. It is common in such circumstances for accountants to have various relationships with the company or its management, such as being an officer, director, voting
trustee, promoter, or stockholder, which are incompatible with their
status as independent accountants and which are prohibited by our
rules.
Since changes and new developments in financial and economic conditions affect the operations and financial status of the several thousand commercial and industrial companies required to file statements
with the Commission, accounting and auditing procedures cannot
remain static and continue to serve well a dynamic economy. It is
necessary for the Commission to be informed of the changes and new
developments in these fields and to make certain that the effects thereof
are properly reported to investors. The Commission's accounting
staff, therefore, engages in studies of the changes and new developments for the purpose of establishing and maintaining appropriate
accounting and auditing policies, procedures and practices for the protection of investors. The primary responsibility for this program rests
with the Chief Accountant of the Commission, who has general supervision with respect to accounting and auditing policies and their
application.
Prog-ress in these activities requires continuing contact and consultation between the staff and accountants both individually and
through such representative groups as, among others, the American
Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Controllers Institute of America, the National Association of Railroad and Utilities
Commissioners and the National Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies, as well as other government agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation in the formulation of accounting principles
and practices, adequate disclosure and auditing procedures which will
best serve the interests of investors, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Controllers Institute of America and the

TWENTY-SIXTH

211

National Federation of Financial Analysts Societies appoint committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's staff. The
Commission on its part has authorized its Chief Accountant to serve
as a member of an Advisory Committee to the newly created Accounting Principles Board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants and to serve as a member of the Accounting Theory
Committee of the American Accounting Association.
These committees, the other members of which are leaders of the
accounting profession in public and private practice and in teaching,
were appointed to study the results of research programs undertaken
for the purpose of determining appropriate practice and to narrow
areas of difference and inconsistency in practice.
The many daily decisions of the Commission require the almost
constant attention of some of the Chief Accountant's staff. These
include questions raised by each of the operating divisions of the Commission, the regional offices and the Commission. This day-to-day
activity of the Commission and the need to keep abreast of current
accounting problems cause the Chief Accountant's staff to spend much
time in the examination and re-examination of sound and generally
accepted accounting and auditing principles and practices. From
time to time members of the staff are called upon to assist in field investigations, to participate in hearings and to review opinions inso:far as they pertain to accounting matters.
Pre-filing and other conferences, in person or by telephone, with
officials of corporations, practicing accountants and others occupy a
considerable amount of the available time of the staff. This procedure, which has proven to be one of the most important functions of
the Office of the Chief Accountant and of the Chief Accountant of the
Division of Corporation Finance and his staff, saves registrants and
their representatives both time and expense.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems arise as a result
of the examination of financial statements required to be filed with
the Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and regulations of the Commission have not been complied with or that
applicable generally accepted accounting principles have not been
adhered to, the examining division usually notifies the registrant by
an informal letter of comment. These letters of comment and the
correspondence or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff. Where particularly difficult or novel questions arise which
cannot be settled by the accounting staff of the divisions and by the
Chief Accountant, they are referred to the Commission for consideration and decision. By these administrative procedures the Commission deals with many accounting questions.

212

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During the year the Commission concluded its consideration of the
matter of accounting for deferred taxes, on which there had been a
difference of opinion among certifying accountants at the time the
matter was taken under advisement. A statement of administrative
policy regarding balance sheet treatment of the credit equivalent to
reduction of income taxes 28 was issued substantially in the form
proposed as submitted for formal public review on December 30,
1958.29 This statement said in pertinent part "any financial statement
filed with this Commission which designates as earned surplus (or
its equivalent) or in any manner as a part of equity capital (even
though accompanied by words of limitation such as 'restricted' or
'appropriated') the accumulated credit arising from accounting for
reductions in income taxes resulting from deducting costs for income
tax purposes at a more rapid rate than for financial statement purposes
will be presumed by the Commission to be misleading or inaccurate
despite disclosure contained in the certificate of the accountant or in
footnotes to the statements, provided the amounts involved are
material."
Questions were raised by various parties in the proceedings as to
whether the Commission has authority to issue such a statement of
policy or to establish a uniform method of accounting under the 1933
Act or the 1934 Act and whether the Commission has authority to
reconstitute accounting practices of electric utilities which have been
prescribed by other agencies having jurisdiction. In reply to these
questions the Commission made the following statement in the release :
"Fnder various statutes administered by it, the Commission has the
authority and the corresponding responsibility to require that the
financial statements filed with it be prepared in a manner which
provides adequate and fair disclosure. This statement of policy is
designed to advise all interested persons of the Commission's views
as to the presentation in financial statements filed with the Commission of the credit arising when deferred tax accounting is employed.
It pertains to the propriety of designating as earned surplus (or its
equivalent) or in any manner as a part of equity capital, in financial
statements filed with this Commission, the accumulated credit arising
from accounting for reductions in income taxes for various items, including those under Section 167 (liberalized depreciation) and Section 168 (accelerated amortization of emergency facilities) of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1954. It is not intended to direct or establish any system of accounts or to specify the manner in which a particular item shall be recorded on the books of the reporting companies,
nor is it intended in any way to affect the requirements of any other

governmental agency, federal or state, with respect to the manner
in which such books of account shall be kept." 30
A number of persons requested clarification of the position of the
Commission with respect to whether provisions for deferred taxes
should be made under a variety of circumstances. The Commission
therefore indicated that in its view recognition of tax deferment
should be made, if material in amount, in all cases in which there is
a tax reduction resulting from deducting costs for tax purposes at
faster rates than for financial statement purposes in order to give
adequate and fair disclosure in financial statements.
1Ve indicated that we understood that these views were also in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that the
Committee on Accounting Procedure of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants agree with the opinion expressed.
The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants questioned
whether the statement of policy had not covered the matter too
broadly, indicating that there are some situations, notably intangible
drilling costs, on which quite a few members of the Committee on
Accounting Procedure of the Institute did not think it had yet spoken
although there were those who interpret this statement on the principles involved as being all inclusive.
As indicated in the release, the Commission has the responsibility
to require that financial statements filed with it be prepared in a
manner which provides adequate and fair disclosure of all matters as
to which an average prudent investor ought reasonably to be informed
before buying or selling the security registered. It has, however,
insofar as possible, confined its rules and regulations to the form and
content of financial statements and left to the profession the development of accounting principles and practices.
The Commission therefore authorized its Chief Accountant to address a letter to the Director of Research of the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants to advise him that the Commission
did not intend to make mandatory any view in the disputed areas of
deferred tax accounting other than in respect of the treatment of the
accumulated credit where deferred tax accounting is employed. This
.. Representatives ot companies subject to the jurisdiction ot the Commission under the
Public Utlllty Holding Company Act ot 1935 as registered holding companies or subsidiary
companies thereot have contended that this Commission has no power to prescribe the
manner in which the accumulated credit arising from deferred tax accounting should be
clasBi1ied in the accounts ot the company. In support ot this contention, reference was
made to Section 20(b) ot that Act. That section provides that "in the case ot the
accounts ot any company whose methods ot accounting are prescribed under the provisions
ot any law ot the Uulted States or ot any State, the rules and regulations or orders ot the
Commission In respect of accounts shall not be inconsistent with the requirements imposed
by such law or any rule or regulation thereunder; • • ... [Emphasis supplied.]
For
reasollll stated above, this contention misconceives the nature ot the action taken herein.

214

AND

COMMISSION

letter was published 31 in order to extend to the accounting profession
and to industry the benefit of the clarification.
During the year the Commission also issued two other Accounting
Series Releases, one of which amended the minimum audit requirements prescribed in Form X-17A-5 under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 to eliminate grounds for an interpretation that duplicate
written confirmation was required of certain customers' accounts,"
and the other revised those parts of the Uniform System of Accounts for Public Utility Holding Companies under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 governing the preservation and destruction of books of account and other records of registered holding
companies."
Other problems arise in connection with initial filings made by new
corporate entities and by corporations whose securities had been closely held or traded over-the-counter.
Currently there are many such
filings being made by companies whose business is closely associated
with rapidly growing technological and scientific developments.
Some of the problems frequently causing difficulty arise because
audits made in prior years did not measure up to generally accepted
standards, particularly in that they often omitted accepted audit procedures with respect to inventories and receivables. These procedures
require observation of inventories and confirmation of receivables
where either of these assets represents a significant proportion of the
current assets or of the total assets of a concern. Failure to apply
them where they are practicable and reasonable generally precludes expression of an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements taken
as a whole because the income, earned surplus, and the current position may be materially affected. If the auditor finds himself faced
with such a situation, he must satisfy himself as to inventories for
prior years by appropriate methods. In some instances, this is very
difficult and may preclude certification because the client may not
have taken an inventory at any prior year end or because inventory
records for such years are incomplete or because such records may
have been destroyed.
Other difficulties often arise in connection with the initial filings of
such companies because accountants and other advisers serving them
have not had any prior dealing with the Commission. In some cases
these persons have not familiarized themselves with the rules and
regulations of the Commission-e-particularly
the instructions as to
financial statements required by the forms, the rules relating to independence of the certifying accountant, and those relating to the
form and content of financial statements set forth in Regulation S-X.

During the year members of the staff in this office,together with
staff members from other divisions of the Commission, conferred with
representatives of the Small Business Administration for the purpose
of developing rules and regulations and forms for the guidance of
small business investment companies when registering with and reporting to that agency and to this Commission, with the hope that
their cooperative efforts would result in the promulgation of rules
and a single basic annual report form which would permit such companies to prepare copies of such annual report for filing under both
the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Small Business Investment Act of 1958.
Early in 1960 Financial Report SBA Form 468 was declared effective after appropriate notice by the Small Business Administration.
Thereafter the Commission circulated for comment a proposed annual
report form for small business investment companies which would
enable such companies to file with the Commission a single annual
report which would meet the annual reporting requirements under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 34 and the Investment Company
Act of 1940.35
The instructions as to financial statements in such form require
such companies to file copies of their financial reports on SBA Form
468 supplemented by certain additional financial information for the
fiscal year covered by the report on the proposed form."
INTERNATIONAL

BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND DEVEWPMENT

Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended, exempts from registration under both the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued or guaranteed
as to both principal and interest by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is required to :filewith the
Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such securities as the Commission shall determine to be appropriate in view of
the special character of the Bank and its operations and necessary in
the public interest or for the protection of investors. The Commission has, pursuant to the above authority, adopted rules requiring the
Bank to the :filequarterly reports and also to file copies of each annual
report of the Bank to its board of governors. The Bank is also required to file reports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in the United States of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting in consultation with the National Advisory Council
on International Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to

suspend the exemption at any time as to any or all securities issued
or guaranteed by the Bank during the period of such suspension.
During the year the Bank made 31 loans totaling the equivalent of
$658.7 million, compared with a total of $703 million last year. This
brought the gross total of loan commitments at June 30, to $5,181 million. This year's loans were made in Algeria and Sahara, Austria,
Belgian Congo, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Honduras, India, Iran,
Italy, Japan, Kenya, Mauritania, Nicaragua, Norway, Pakistan, Peru,
Rhodesia and Nyasaland,
Sudan, United Arab Republic, and
Uruguay.
During the year the bank sold or agreed to sell $242.6 million principal amount of loans, all without its guarantee. On June 30 the total
sales of loans amounted to $811 million, of which $69 million was
with the bank's guarantee.
On June 30, 1960 the outstanding funded debt of the Bank was
$2,073 million, reflecting a net increase of $168 million during the
fiscal year. The Bank's borrowing operations during the year, including new public bond issues and private placements of bank obligations, totaled $374.5 million. There were three public issues; a United
States dollar issue in the amount of $125 million (of which $27.6 million is subject to delayed delivery) ; a Swiss franc issue equivalent to
$14 million; and a pound sterling issue equivalent to $28 million.
There were six private placements of obligations totaling the equivalent of $207.5 million; this included $47.6 million in Deutsche Marks
of which $23.8 million still remained to be drawn down by the Bank
on June 30. Outstanding debt was also increased by $19.2 million as a
result of delivery of bonds which had been subject to delayed delivery
arrangements
and by a further $12.7 million under a Deutsche
Mark borrowing arranged in July 1958. Funded debt maturing
amounted to $165.8 million, and sinking and purchase fund transactions amounted to $21.3 million.
Pursuant to the increase in the Bank's authorized capital from $10
billion to $21 billion on September 15, 1959, 55 members had doubled
their subscriptions and 20 members had subscribed to $1,140.6 million
in addition to their 100 percent increases. As a result, the subscribed
capital of the Bank had been increased by $9,751.4 million to $19,307.9
million at June 30, 1960.
INTER-AMERICAN DEVEWPMENT

The Inter-American
Development Bank Act, which authorizes
United States participation in the new Inter-American Development
Bank, provides a similar exemption for certain securities which may

lations of the character presently in effect with respect to the International Bank. It is expected that such rules and regulations will be
adopted in the near future.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Opinions are issued by the Commission in contested and other cases
arising under the statutes administered by it and under the Commission's ru1es of practice, where the nature of the matter to be decided,
whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance to warrant a formal expression of views. These opinions include detailed
findings of fact and conclusions of law based on evidentiary records
taken before a hearing examiner who serves independently of the
operating divisions, or, in an occasional case, before a single Commissioner or the entire Commission. In some cases, formal hearings are
waived by the parties and the findings and conclusions are based on
stipu1ated facts or admissions.
The Commission is assisted in the preparation of findings and opinions by its Office of Opinion Writing, a staff office completely inde.pendent of the operating divisions of the Commission and directly
responsible to the Commission itself. The independence of the staff
members of this office reflects the principle, embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act, of a separation between staff members performing investigatory or prosecutory functions and those performing
investigatory or prosecutory functions and those performing quasijudicial functions. In some cases, with the consent of all parties, the
interested operating division assists in the drafting of opinions.
The Commission's opinions are publicly released and distributed to
representatives of the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, the opinions are printed and published by the
Government Printing Officein bound volumes entitled "Securities and
Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
During the fiscal year 1959, the Commission issued 166 opinions and
other rulings of an adjudicatory nature.
STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

During the past fiscal year the Branch of Economic Research continued its regular work in connection with the statistical activities of
the Commission and the overall Government statistical program
under the direction of the Office of Statistical Standards, Bureau of
the Budget.
The statistical series described below are published in the Commission's Statistical Bu1letin and in addition, except for data on registered issues, current figures and analyses of the data are published
in quarterly press releases. The Commission's stock price index is

218

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

released weekly, together with the data on round-lot and odd-lot
trading on the two New York stock exchanges.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly and quarterly statistics are compiled on the number and
volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type of
security, and use of proceeds. Summary statistics for the years
1935-60 are given in appendix table 1 and detailed statistics for the
fiscal year 1960 appear in appendix table 2.
'
New Securities Oft'erings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues
privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration
under the Securities Act such as intrastate offerings and railroad
securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually
offered for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers.
Annual statistics on new offerings for recent years as well as monthly
figures from January 1959 through June 1960 are given in appendix
tables 3, 4, and 5.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount
of estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale
of securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations
to investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements
and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Stock Market Data

Statistics are regularly compiled on the market value and volume
of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges, round-lot
stock transactions of the New York exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock transactions on the -New York
exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions. Indexes of
stock market prices are compiled, based upon the weekly closing
market prices of 265 common stocks listed on the New York Stock
Exchange. The indexes are composed of 'l major industry groups,
29 subordinated groups, and a composite group.
Individuals' Saving

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represent net increases in individuals' financial assets less net increases in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of saving
and the form in which the saving occurred, such as investment in
securities, expansion of bank deposits, increase in insurance and pen-

sion reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates
with the personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce,
derived in connection with its national income series, is published
annually by the Department of Commerce as well as in the Securities
and Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Corporate Pension Funds

An annual survey is made of pension plans of all United States
corporations where funds are administered by corporations themselves, or through trustees. The survey shows the flow of money into
these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested and
the principal items of income and expenditures.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks, insurance companies and savings and loan associations, shows the principal components of current assets and liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources and
uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report of all United States manufacturing
concerns. This report gives complete balance sheet data and an
abbreviated income account, data being classified by industry and
size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all United States business, exclusive
of agriculture. Shortly after the close of each quarter, data are
released on actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated
expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made
at the beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion during that year.
DISSEMINATION OF INFORMATION

Widespread public dissemination of the financial and other data
filed with the Commission concerning securities offered for public sale
and those traded on exchanges is essential if public investors generally
are to benefit by the disclosure requirements of the Federal securities
laws and be enabled to evaluate securities being sold in the market.
This is accomplished in part by distribution of the prospectus or
offering circular on new' offerings, and by the filing of annual and
other periodic reports with exchanges and the Commission by listed
companies, all of which are available for public inspection. Much
of the data also is reprinted and receives general circulation through

220

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

published securities manuals, investment advisory services and statistical services, which are reference material for securities analysts.
To facilitate public dissemination of the financial and other proposals filed with and actions taken by the Commission, a daily News
Digest is issued by the Commission which contains a resume of these
filings and actions. This digest is distributed daily to the press and
on a semiweekly basis to a mailing list comprising about 9,500 names
of persons, firms and companies who have requested to be kept currently informed of such developments. Digests issued during the
year under review contained a resume of the proposals for public
offering of $15.8 billion of securities contained in the 1,628 registration statements filed during the year, as well as a discussion of 858
orders, decisions, rules and related announcements issued by the
Commission. Much of the information is published in the daily press
and in financial and other periodicals. The texts of the Commission's
orders, decisions and rules, announcements of civil and criminal enforcement actions, and the Commission's economic and statistical
studies are also released to the press and others.
Members of the Commission and its staff frequently deliver
addresses before professional, business and other groups and participate in press conferences and radio and television discussions in order
to explain the nature and scope of the Commission's functions and
activities and to expound upon particular problems of administration
and the basic policies being pursued.
Information

Available for Public Inspection

The many thousands of registration statements, applications, declarations, and annual and other periodic reports filed each year are
available for public inspection at the Commission's principal officein
Washington, D.C. In addition, copies of recent reports filed by companies having securities listed on exchanges other than the New York
Stock Exchange and the American Stock Exchange, and copies of
current reports of many non-listed companies which have registered
securities for public offering under the Securities Act, may be examined in the Commission's New York Regional Office; and recent
reports filed by companies whose securities are listed on the New
York and American stock exchanges may be examined in the Commission's Chicago Regional Office. Moreover, there are available for
examination in all regional offices copies of prospectuses relating to
recent public offerings of securities registered under the Securities
Act and all regional offices have copies of broker-dealer and investment adviser registration applications, broker-dealer annual financial
reports and Regulation A letters of notification filed in their respec-

tive regions. Reports of companies listed on the New York, American and Midwest stock exchanges may be seen at the respective
exchange offices.
Photocopies of reports or portions thereof and other material in
the public files of the Commission may be obtained upon request
directed to the Commission's public reference room in Washington.
The charge per page for photocopies varies from 20 cents to 60 cents
depending upon the size of the page being copied. A minimum
charge of $1 is made for less than 5 pages (legal size). The charge
for each certification by the Commission is $2.
Each year many thousands of requests for photocopies and information from the public files of the Commission are received by the
public reference room in Washington, D.C. During the year 5,207
persons examined material on file in the Washington office, and several
thousand others examined files in the New York and Chicago regional
offices. About 137,870 photocopy pages were sold pursuant to 2,489
individual orders, and about 14,859 individual orders for 538,906
copies of Commission releases and other publications were filled
during the year.
ORGANIZATION

The Commission's staff consists of attorneys, security analysts and
examiners, accountants, engineers and administrative and clerical employees. An organization
chart of the Commission appears on
page 222.
In accordance with the Commission's program of continuing review
of its functions and organization, the following changes were made
during the 1960 fiscal year:

In August 1959, the position of Adviser to the Commission was
established. The incumbent of that position is responsible for assisting the Commission in its re-examination and re-evaluation of policies,
interpretations and procedures to keep abreast of the continuing expansion and constantly changing conditions in the securities industry,
particularly with respect to problems arising from the development of
new techniques of securities flotation and placement and the growing
significance of international financing in the American capital
markets.
In September 1959, an additional Assistant Director position was
established in the Division of Corporation Finance, and twelve
Branches of Corporate Analysis and Examination were created in lieu
of the twelve sections which formerly had performed that function.
The Division is responsible for the examination of an enormous volume of registration statements, preliminary proxy statements, annual
reports and other documents for compliance with the disclosure requirements of the securities laws. The realignment was designed to
promote efficiency of operation and more timely completion of the
examination process.
In October 1959, a second Branch of Investment Company Regulation was established in the Division of Corporate Regulation. Responsibility for enforcing the regulatory aspects of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 was transferred to the Division of Corporate
Regulation in May 1953. At that time there were 369 registered
companies with total assets of $7 billion. By June 1959, there were
512 registered companies with assets of more than $20 billion. The
Small Business Investment Act of 1958 further increased the Division's workload by creating an additional category of investment companies which must register under the Act-small business investment
companies. The second Branch of Investment Company Regulation
will enable the Division to cope more effectively with its regulatory
functions in this rapidly expanding area of responsibility.
In March 1960 the functions of the former Branch of Exchange
Regulation and Economic Research in the Division of Trading and
Exchanges were assigned to 2 new Branches-the Branch of Exchange
Regulation and the Branch of Economic Research. The Branch of
Exchange Regulation is now responsible for the Division's regulatory
functions with respect to exchange activities and market surveillance
and stabilization. The Branch of Economic Research is responsible
for the Commission's statistical programs. This realignment places
each of these two important Commission programs under the supervision of an Assistant Director of the Division of Trading and
Exchanges.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

PERSONNEL, BUDGET AND FINANCE

During fiscal 1960 the Commission continued to recruit outstanding
college and law school graduates with the specialized courses of study
required for its work activities. A number of well qualified business
administration graduates were appointed through the Federal Service
Entrance Examination conducted by the U.S. Civil Service Commission. As a result of close contact with the placement officesof various
law schools and on-campus interviews, the Commissien was able
to hire a number of recent law graduates for its starting level
attorney jobs.
Considerable emphasis was placed on the Commission's training
activities in fiscal 1960. Supervisory officials were enrolled in a special training course for middle and top management officials. Training courses also were conducted for professional employees in the
New York Regional Office. The Division of Corporate Regulation
held a training course for employees to be assigned work in connection with regular inspections of investment companies. Members of
the staff were enrolled in training courses for IBM machine operation and automatic data processing. Correspondence workshops sponsored by the General Services Administration were conducted for
employees in the Headquarters Office. Orientation classes were held
by the Branch of Personnel to explain health plans available as a
result of the passage of the Government Employees Health Benefits
Act of 1960.
In its Fifth Annual Service and Merit Awards Ceremony held in
October 1959, the Commission observed its Silver Anniversary by
presenting 36 career employees with silver anniversary placques in
recognition of 25 years of service with the Commission. An additional 80 employees received 10- and 20-year service pins and certificates in recognition of long service with the Commission. Cash
awards totaling $6,825 and certificates of merit were presented to 56
employees, and 8 employees received a total of $530 for adopted
meritorious suggestions.
The outstanding achievements of members of the Commission's
staff continued to receive public recognition in the form of special
awards. In March 1960, Mr. Andrew Barr, Chief Accountant of the
Commission, was one of five Federal employees to receive the President's Award for Distinguished Federal Civilian Service. The citation signed by President Eisenhower read as follows :
His exceptional contributions to the development of Accounting principles
and meaningful accounting presentations of corporate financial affairs to investors have materially aided the process of capital formation in the United
States and advanced the cause of investor protection.

ANNUAL REPORT

The confidence of investors in the integrity of the capital markets of the
Nation has been enhanced by his outstanding leadership and notable achievements.

In February 1960, Paul Windels, Jr., New York Regional Administrator, received an Arthur S. Flemming Award of the Junior
Chamber of Commerce of Washington, D.C. as one of ten outstanding
young men in the Federal Service. Mr. John J. Enright, an attorney
on the staff of the Commission's Chicago Regional Office, was awarded
a Certificate of Merit by the William A. Jump Foundation in May
1960. In its first annual awards presentation, the Federal Government
Accountants Association awarded Mr. Frank J. Donaty, Budget and
Finance Officer, an outstanding achievement award for contributions
to the improvement of financial management in the Federal Service.
The Commission is justifiably proud of these distinctions earned by
its employees whose devoted and conscientious service has contributed
so much to carrying out the statutory objectives for which the Commission was created.
The following comparative table shows the personnel strength of
the Commission as of June 30, 1959 and 1960:
