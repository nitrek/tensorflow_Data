In the Matter of
STEVEN J. MUEHLER,
ALTERNATIVE SECURITIES MARKETS
GROUP CORP., AND
BLUE COAST SECURITIES CORP., DBA

COAST BANC

ORDER

On January 5, 2016, I ordered Respondent Steven J. Muehler to respond to an email from the
Division of Enforcement to indicate whether he could access certain electronic documents with a
password that the Division appears to have initially sent him on October 16, 2015, and again on
January 4, 2016. Steven J. Muehler, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3469, 2016 SEC LEXIS 25.
On January 5, Muehler submitted a motion to compel the Division to provide him access to the
electronic documents. Muehler states in his motion and in a subsequent email exchange with the
Division (on which this office was copied) that he remains unable to access the documents using the
password. His motion requests extensions of his deadlines to submit exhibit and witness lists, as well
as the hearing date.
I ORDER that Muehler and the Division (along with its Information Technology staff, if
necessary) confer to provide Muehler access to the electronic documents by January 8, 2016. If
Muehler represents to the Division that he is still unable to access the documents by that date, then the
Division shall deliver to him copies of the documents in unencrypted (and non-password-protected)
electronic form—or if that is not possible, in paper form—by January 12.1 I FURTHER ORDER that,
to eliminate any prejudice to Muehler, he will be permitted to designate and object to exhibits until the
close of the hearing. In all other respects, Muehler’s motion to compel is DENIED.

If the Division provides copies of the documents in paper form, it shall continue conferring with
Muehler to provide him access to electronic versions if Muehler wishes to obtain them.
