NATHANIAL D. PONN,
Defendant,

COMPLAINT
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission("the Commission")alleges the following
against defendant Nathanial D. Ponn (hereinafter "Ponn" or "defendant"):
PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
This case involves a fraudulent scheme to fund the trading of securities by
inducing broker firms to credit brokerage accounts based upon purported, but bogus, bank
transfers and thereafter using the fraudulently obtained funds to purchase securities. During the
period 2007 through April 2015, Ponn opened several hundred brokerage accounts at various
broker-dealers. Upon opening these accounts, Ponn purported to fund them with bank transfers,
mostly Automated Clearing House("ACH")transfers, from bank accounts that Ponn knew, and
the broker firms soon discovered, were substantially underfunded or fictitious. Before the broker
firms discovered the fraud, however, many of them credited Ponn's brokerage accounts,
allowing him to purchase securities and attempt to withdraw money. Once the broker firms
discovered the bogus nature of the bank transfers, they locked Ponn's accounts, sold off the
accounts' holdings, and ultimately closed the fraudulently opened accounts.

2.

Over the course ofthe scheme,Ponn opened approximately 600 brokerage

accounts and purported to fund them with bogus bank transfers totaling approximately $8.7
million. Ofthis amount, broker firms credited Ponn's accounts in the approximate amount of
$6.3 million, which Ponn then used to purchase approximately $2.9 million's worth of securities.
He also attempted to withdraw at least $271,000 from these accounts. Although the internal
control procedures of most firms prevented Ponn from making cash withdrawals before the bank
transfers were confirmed, he was able to withdraw $300 during the scheme. Moreover, Ponn's
fraudulent securities purchases of approximately $2.9 million caused the broker firms to suffer
net trading losses of approximately $26,000, and put them at risk for much more.
By engaging in this scheme to defraud and as alleged further herein, defendant
Ponn has engaged in fraudulent or deceptive conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of
securities, in violation of Section 10(b) ofthe Exchange Act of 1934("Exchange Act")and Rule
lOb-5 thereunder.
4.

Based upon the defendant's violations, the Commission seeks: (a) a permanent

injunction (i) prohibiting the defendant from further violations of Section 10(b) of the Exchange
Act and (ii) enjoining defendant from opening an account with any brokerage firm without first
providing the broker a copy ofthe complaint filed in this case as well as a copy ofthe final
judgment entered;(b) disgorgement ofthe defendant's ill-gotten gains, plus prejudgment
interest; and (c)imposition of a civil penalty due to the repeated and egregious nature of the
defendant's violations.

DEFENDANT
9.

Nathanial D.Ponn, age 27, is a resident of Boston, Massachusetts. Ponn has

never worked in the securities business or been registered with the Commission in any capacity.
STATEMENT OF FACTS
10.

Beginning in early 2007 and continuing through at least April 2015, Ponn

engaged in a scheme to defraud broker firms in order to trade securities risk-free by fraudulently
inducing firms to credit him money and then using that fraudulently obtained money to purchase
securities.
11.

Ponn fraudulently induced broker firms to credit him money by opening

accounts with purported money transfers from bank accounts that were either underfunded or
completely fake.

Case 1:16-cv-10624 Document 1 Filed 03/31/16 Page 4 of 7

12.

Broker firms generally credit their customers' brokerage accounts once the

customer authorizes the firm to debit their bank account, but before the firm has verified the
existence ofthe bank account and the sufficiency offunds held in the account.
13.

The verification process generally takes 2 to 3 days.

14.

During the 2 to 3 days of the verification process, the typical brokerage account

holder has the ability to buy and sell securities within the account.
15.

Ponn's scheme exploited this two to three day delay in the verification process.

He knowingly gave the broker firms purported bank account fund transfers from fake or
underfunded bank accounts in order to obtain credited funds from the broker firms. Ponn then
used the fraudulently obtained funds to purchase securities during the 2 to 3 day window before
the firms discovered the bank accounts did not have the money he said they did.
16.

Over the course of the scheme, Ponn opened approximately 600 brokerage

accounts at 17 broker firms. Ponn established the vast majority of these accounts in his own
name or in the name of members of his family.
17.

Ponn purported to make over $8.7 million in bank account transfers to these

brokerage accounts. All ofthese money transfers were from bank accounts that were
underfunded or fake.
18.

Although Ponn started the scheme to defraud in early 2007, the frequency and

scale of his fraudulent activities took off in 2014. Of the $8.7 million in bogus bank transfers,
Ponn made $7.4 million in 2014 and $1.2 million in 2015.
19.

During the course of the entire scheme, Ponn knew that the $8.7 million in

purported bank account transfers were from accounts that were underfunded or fake.

Case 1:16-cv-10624 Document 1 Filed 03/31/16 Page 5 of 7

20.

Some of the brokerages receiving Ponn's account opening and fund transfer

documents did not credit some or all ofPonn's purported funds transfer before first verifying
existence ofthe bank account and the sufficiency offunds within the account. Many firms,
however, did.
21.

Ofthe $8.7 million in bogus bank transfers, brokerages credited Ponn's brokerage

accounts in the approximate amount of $6.3 million.
22.

Ofthe $6.3 million credited to Ponn's brokerage accounts, Ponn used

approximately $2.9 million to purchase securities. He used $1.12 million to purchase shares in
mutual funds or exchange traded funds. He used the remaining $1.74 million to acquire equity
securities of over 75 different issuers.
23.

Once the broker firms discovered that Ponn's initial deposit was fraudulent, they

locked the associated brokerage account and sold the securities held within the account, resulting
in a realized gain or loss in the account.
24.

As a result of Ponn's fraudulently funded securities purchases, the broker firms

suffered net losses of approximately $26,000.
25.

In addition to purchasing securities in these brokerage accounts, Ponn also

attempted to withdraw or to transfer the fraudulently obtained money and securities. Over the
course of the scheme, Ponn attempted to withdraw at least $271,000. These withdrawal attempts
were largely unsuccessful. Ponn was able to withdraw only $300. During the course ofthe
scheme, Ponn also attempted to transfer securities from one brokerage to another. All of these
transfers were, however, rejected by the transferor firms.
