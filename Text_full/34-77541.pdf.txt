ORDER INSTITUTING ADMINISTRATIVE
PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO SECTION
15(b) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE
ACT OF 1934 AND NOTICE OF HEARING

In the Matter of
LEVI D. LINDEMANN,
Respondent.

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate and in the
public interest that public administrative proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to
Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”) against Levi D.
Lindemann (“Respondent” or “Lindemann”).
II.
After an investigation, the Division of Enforcement alleges that:
A.

RESPONDENT

1.
From March 2000 through March 2012, Lindemann was a registered
representative associated with broker-dealers registered with the Commission. Lindemann, 40
years old, is a resident of St. Paul, Minnesota.
B.

ENTRY OF THE INJUNCTION

2.
On March 3, 2016, a judgment was entered by consent against Lindemann,
permanently enjoining him from future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933
(“Securities Act”), Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act and Rule 10b-5 thereunder, in the civil
action entitled Securities and Exchange Commission v. Lindemann, Civil Action Number 14-cv4834, in the United States District Court for the District of Minnesota.

3.
The Commission’s complaint alleged, among other things, that Lindemann
operated a fraudulent scheme through his private company, Gershwin Financial, Inc. and his sole
proprietorship, Alternative Wealth Solutions. The SEC’s complaint alleged that from at least
September 2009 to August 2013, Lindemann raised approximately $976,000 from six investors
located in Wisconsin, including elderly individuals and a member of his own family. The
complaint further alleged that Lindemann told these investors that their money would be used to
purchase a variety of purported investments including various notes and interests in a unit
investment trust. The complaint alleged that in reality, none of these investments were ever made.

III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement, the Commission deems it
necessary and appropriate in the public interest that public administrative proceedings be instituted
to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations;
B.
What, if any, remedial action is appropriate in the public interest against Respondent
pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act; and

IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the questions
set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and before an
Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110 of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by Rule 220
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being duly
notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined against
him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true as
provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f) and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f) and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the Commission’s
Rules of Practice.

2

IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial
decision no later than 210 days from the date of service of this Order, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2) of
the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission engaged
in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually related
proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except as witness
or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule making” within
the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not deemed subject to the
provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final Commission action.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Brent J. Fields
Secretary
