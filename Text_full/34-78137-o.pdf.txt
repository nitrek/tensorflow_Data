Corporation (“CIOC1”) (CIK No. 816958), a void Delaware corporation located in Houston,
Texas with a class of securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 ("Exchange Act") Section 12(g) because it is delinquent in its periodic filings with
the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for the period
ended September 30, 2008. On April 12, 2011, the Commission’s Division of Corporation
Finance (“Corporation Finance”) sent a delinquency letter to CIOC requesting compliance with
its periodic filing requirements but CIOC did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure
to maintain a valid address on file with the Commission as required by Commission rules (Rule
301 of Regulation S-T, 17 C.F.R. Section 232.301 and Section 5.4 of EDGAR Filer Manual)
(“Commission Issuer Address Rules”). As of June 16, 2016, the common stock of CIOC was
quoted on OTC Link operated by OTC Markets Group Inc. (formerly “Pink Sheets”) (“OTC

filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form 10-Q for
the period ended February 29, 2012. On January 28, 2016, Corporation Finance sent a
delinquency letter to ELEV requesting compliance with its periodic filing requirements but
ELEV did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file
with the Commission as required by Commission Issuer Address Rules. As of June 16, 2016, the

the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).

FRWL did not receive the delinquency letter due to its failure to maintain a valid address on file
with the Commission as required by Commission Issuer Address Rules. As of June 16, 2016, the
common stock of FRWL was quoted on OTC Link, had four market makers, and was eligible for
the “piggyback” exception of Exchange Act Rule 15c2-11(f)(3).

the period ended June 30, 2012. On February 22, 2016, Corporation Finance sent a delinquency
letter to GNBA requesting compliance with its periodic filing requirements but GNBA did not
