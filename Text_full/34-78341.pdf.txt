ORDER INSTITUTING CEASE-ANDDESIST PROCEEDINGS PURSUANT TO
SECTION 21C OF THE SECURITIES
EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, MAKING
FINDINGS, AND IMPOSING A CEASEAND-DESIST ORDER AND PENALTIES

I.
The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) deems it appropriate that
cease-and-desist proceedings be, and hereby are, instituted pursuant to Section 21C of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), against The Phoenix Companies, Inc.
(“Phoenix” or “Respondent”).
II.
In anticipation of the institution of these proceedings, Respondent has submitted an Offer
of Settlement (the “Offer”) which the Commission has determined to accept. Solely for the
purpose of these proceedings and any other proceedings brought by or on behalf of the
Commission, or to which the Commission is a party, and without admitting or denying the
findings herein, except as to the Commission’s jurisdiction over it and the subject matter of
these proceedings, which are admitted, Respondent consents to the entry of this Order Instituting
Cease-and-Desist Proceedings Pursuant to Section 21C of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
Making Findings, and Imposing a Cease-and-Desist Order and Penalties (“Order”), as set forth
below.

III.
On the basis of this Order and Respondent’s Offer, the Commission finds1 that:
Summary
1.
On November 8, 2012, Phoenix, a public company with shares traded on the New
York Stock Exchange, announced that its previously issued audited financial statements included
in Forms 10-K for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010, and 2009 could no longer be relied
upon and would be restated, along with the unaudited financial statements for quarterly periods
included in Forms 10-Q going back to March 31, 2011. Phoenix also warned that “[m]anagement
will likely conclude that there are one or more material weaknesses” in its disclosure controls and
procedures and internal controls over financial reporting.
2.
As Phoenix worked through the restatement process of reviewing its previous
filings and trying to correct its financials, it discovered, in consultation with its auditors, dozens of
additional errors, including basic errors in its calculations, assumptions, and application of
accounting guidance to complex insurance products. Some of the errors were due to improper
accounting determinations, while others reflected carelessness in the implementation of Phoenix’s
accounting systems.2
3.
On April 1, 2014, Phoenix filed its Form 10-K for the year ended December 31,
2012 (the “Restatement 10-K”), and in this filing Phoenix restated and amended its consolidated
financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010. There were several
categories of identified errors in the Restatement 10-K, including: 1) Accounting for Certain
Universal Life Type Products; 2) Loss Recognition; 3) Fixed Indexed Annuities; and 4) Derivative
Valuation. Additionally, Phoenix identified several material weaknesses in internal controls over
financial reporting.

The findings herein are made pursuant to Respondent’s Offer of Settlement and are not
binding on any other person or entity in this or any other proceeding.
1

These errors caused further delay in Phoenix’s filing of its restated numbers, additional Forms
10-K, and additional Forms 10-Q. On March 21, 2014, the Commission instituted settled cease
and desist proceedings which imposed penalties and undertakings for Phoenix to become current
in its delinquent periodic filings by November 2014. See The Phoenix Companies, Inc. and PHL
Variable Insurance Company, Exchange Act Release No. 71768 (Mar. 21, 2014). After Phoenix
was unable to meet certain of the deadlines imposed in the undertakings, the Commission
amended its March 21, 2014 order by extending the undertakings deadlines to December 2014
and imposing additional penalties, including increasing penalties should Phoenix further delay its
filings. See The Phoenix Companies, Inc. and PHL Variable Insurance Company, Exchange Act
Release No. 72738 (Aug. 1, 2014). Pursuant to the original and amended orders, Phoenix paid
$1.1 million in civil penalties to the Commission.

The Phoenix Companies, Inc. (“Phoenix”) is a Delaware corporation located in
Hartford, Connecticut. Phoenix is a holding company with three insurance company subsidiaries,
Phoenix Life Insurance Company, Phoenix Life and Annuity Company, and PHL Variable, which
sell life insurance and annuity products. On June 20, 2016, Phoenix merged with a subsidiary of
Nassau Reinsurance Group Holdings, L.P. (“Nassau Re”) and became a privately held company
and a wholly owned subsidiary of Nassau Re. Before the merger, Phoenix common stock had
traded on the New York Stock Exchange (symbol “PNX”) and Phoenix bonds had traded on the
New York Stock Exchange (symbol “PFX”).

In the Restatement 10-K, Phoenix identified several categories of restated figures,
including: 1) Accounting for Certain Universal Life Type Products; 2) Loss Recognition; 3) Fixed
Indexed Annuities; and 4) Derivative Valuation.
B. Errors in Phoenix’s Accounting for Universal Life Insurance Products
8.
Certain errors discovered during the restatement process related to accounting for
Phoenix’s universal life insurance products. These errors were caused by Phoenix’s improper
application of the accounting guidance which was designed to take into account potential future
losses on certain insurance products, resulting in a material decrease in net income for fiscal years
2010 and 2011.
9.
Phoenix’s universal life products are a form of life insurance with a savings account
component. Policyholders pay flexible premiums into the savings account, and the account is
credited interest at a predetermined rate. Upon death of the policyholder, the beneficiary receives
the face value of the policy or the account value, whichever is greater. Over the life of the policy,
Phoenix collects fees from the account for administrative expenses and the “cost of the life
insurance” (“COI”). One of Phoenix’s standard universal life products was the Phoenix
Accumulator Universal Life (“PAUL”) policy. A PAUL policy was designed as a traditional
universal life policy, but would generate higher COI fees in the early years, and lower COI fees in
the later years.
10.
Starting around 2004, Phoenix began offering a universal life insurance product
with a “secondary guarantee” (“SGUL”). Typically, if a universal life policyholder’s account
value falls to $0, the policy lapses, because there are no more funds to pay the administrative fees
and the COI fees. The secondary guarantee effectively provided a no-lapse guarantee, as long as
certain criteria were met by the policyholder. Should the account value fall to $0, Phoenix would
keep the policy in force while receiving no additional fees. In addition, Phoenix offered certain
riders, or add-ons, for its SGUL and PAUL policies, including an extended life rider (“Extended
Life Rider”), which charged no premium once a policyholder reached age 100. This again meant
that Phoenix would offer life insurance and collect no fees for it, should the policyholder live past
100.
11.
Phoenix determined that, by design, the COI feature of the PAUL policies, the
secondary guarantees of the SGUL policies, and the Extended Life Rider all were expected to
result in profits in earlier years and subsequent losses in later years. In this scenario, the relevant
accounting guidance, ASC 944-605-25-8, requires a liability to be established to account for the
future losses. ASC 944-40-35-9 through 11 requires this liability to be adjusted using current
estimates at each balance sheet date. During the restatement, Phoenix determined that the
accounting guidance required that this liability be established with regard to the product’s
insurance “benefit features”—not with regard to the product generally, as had previously been
done. Phoenix also determined that the higher COI fees in early years and lower COI fees in the
later years for the PAUL contracts did not qualify as a “benefit feature,” and therefore a liability
should not have been established for this aspect of the contract. In its restatement, Phoenix stated
4

that it did not properly evaluate certain benefit features and, therefore, did not establish the
required reserves.
12.
Phoenix was also required to perform a separate premium deficiency analysis under
ASC 944-60. In this analysis, Phoenix was required to determine whether the premiums would
cover the costs of the contracts. Phoenix tested the premium deficiency for each Phoenix
subsidiary and on a consolidated basis. Phoenix determined that no premium deficiency existed.
ASC 944-60 also requires a profits followed by losses analysis for each Phoenix line of business
and on a consolidated basis. Phoenix did not historically perform the profits followed by losses
analysis prescribed by ASC 944-60.
13.
A Phoenix actuary analyzing the cash flows in the fall of 2013 as part of the
restatement review noticed that a pattern of profits followed by losses existed in Phoenix’s
universal life business, and determined that the profits followed by losses analysis should have
historically been performed.
14.
In its pre-restatement application of ASC 944-605-25-8, Phoenix analyzed profits
followed by losses over a 30 year period. Phoenix had set this length of time to match the 30 years
over which its policies’ deferred acquisition costs were amortized. As part of the restatement,
Phoenix revisited the assumption, and determined it was appropriate to extend the period of
analysis, capturing additional losses in the later years.
15.
The universal life products’ benefit feature liability decreased when the restated
numbers were calculated, but this decrease was more than offset by the increase in the premium
deficiency liability. For the 2011 fiscal year, these errors increased liabilities by $179.4 million
and decreased stockholder’s equity by $122.1 million. The errors also decreased net income by
$34.0 million for the 2011 fiscal year (135% of reported income from continuing operations before
income taxes). For the 2010 fiscal year, these errors decreased net income by $46.7 million (106%
of reported income from continuing operations before income taxes). By far, the largest impact on
Phoenix’s 2010 and 2011 financials were the “Accounting for Certain Universal Life Type
Products” errors.
C. Errors in Phoenix’s Fixed Indexed Annuity Valuation
16.
In addition to the universal life products discussed above, Phoenix sold a separate
account product called a fixed indexed annuity (“Annuity”). Annuities are insurance products
which offer an income stream to the purchaser, typically for life. At the inception of the contract,
Annuity purchasers fund an account, often through a lump sum premium payment, which is then
credited with interest based on a reference index (e.g., LIBOR) sometimes subject to a cap and
floor, over the life of the Annuity. Phoenix sold optional riders for an additional fee, including a
guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider. This rider would assure the annuitant a minimal
periodic income even if the Annuity account value were to fall to $0.
17.
In the third quarter of 2011, Phoenix set up an internal valuation system to value its
Annuity contracts. When Phoenix made the transition to this system, it erroneously included the
fees it earned from purchases of the guaranteed minimum withdrawal benefit rider, while
5

excluding the rider’s costs, when estimating its Annuities’ gross profits, which caused a $2.9
million overstatement of earnings for the 2011 fiscal year. Phoenix determined that the inclusion
of the rider’s fees and exclusion of rider’s costs was not in accordance with GAAP,4 and Phoenix
ultimately concluded that it did not have in place properly designed internal accounting controls,
which should have caught this discrepancy.
18.
As part of the restatement process, Phoenix scrutinized the internal valuation
system’s modelling capabilities and determined that the system lacked the functionality to
accurately value the Annuities, ultimately finding at least 30 errors within the valuation system
relating to a variety of Annuities calculations.
19.
These errors included incorrect assumptions regarding policyholder behavior, such
as assuming static lapse rates, which were not adjusted based on account value, and assuming
withdrawals when it would be disadvantageous for the policyholder to do so. The valuation
system also only projected out the Annuities 30 years for valuation purposes, even though certain
policyholders’ expected lifetimes were longer.
20.
Once restated, the identified fixed indexed annuity errors cumulatively caused a
$4.2 million decrease in net income before taxes for fiscal year-end 2011 (13% of reported income
from continuing operations before income taxes). Errors related to the Annuity products for the
2010 period resulted in a $2.3 million net loss (7% of reported income from continuing operations
before income taxes) and were classified as “Other Actuarial Errors” in the Restatement 10-K.
D. Error in Phoenix’s Reinsurance Accounting
21.
Insurance companies often enter into reinsurance contracts to share the risk inherent
in a block of policies. Generally, these contracts require the reinsurer to pay a portion (or all) of
the expenses associated with a policy or block of policies and the original insurers to pay the
reinsurer compensation for entering into the contract. Phoenix entered into two such contracts with
a reinsurer in 2008 and 2009, for certain term life policies. These reinsurance contracts allowed
Phoenix to reduce its risks associated with its term life business.
22.
Phoenix did not perform a premium deficiency analysis on the underlying block of
term life policies subject to the reinsurance contracts, as required by the relevant accounting
guidance, ASC 944-60. Phoenix assumed that the reinsurer had taken on all of the expenses
associated with the term life business. However, the terms of the reinsurance contract only
provided for the payment of a portion of these expenses. A subsequent analysis performed as part
of the restatement identified a premium deficiency and required Phoenix to establish a liability on
its books. This error had the impact of decreasing net income by $10.6 million for fiscal year-end
2010 (31% of reported income from continuing operations before income taxes) and $7.6 million
for fiscal year-end 2011 (24% of reported income from continuing operations before income
taxes).
4

ASC 944-60-30.
6

23.
Similar to the Annuity products discussed above, Phoenix also identified errors in
the way that its valuation system modelled its reinsurance contracts. Specifically, the valuation
system did not have functionality to model multiple reinsurance treaties for a given policy. Once
restated, all identified Phoenix’s reinsurance accounting errors caused a $3.3 million decrease in
net income for fiscal year-end 2011 (10% of reported income from continuing operations before
income taxes), and a $6.3 million increase in net income for fiscal year-end 2010 (18% of reported
income from continuing operations before income taxes).
E. Error in Phoenix’s Accounting for Derivatives
24.
To hedge certain risks, Phoenix purchased a number of derivatives from, and
entered into certain swap agreements with, investment banks. Pre-restatement, Phoenix valued
these derivatives and swap agreements without taking a credit valuation adjustment (“CVA”), even
though one was required under ASC 815 and 8205 to take account of the counterparty risk for these
derivatives. The CVA is an allowance which accounts for the default risk of the counterparty.
25.
As a result of this error, Phoenix’s net income before taxes decreased by $12.4
million for fiscal year-end 2011 (39% of reported net income before taxes), and $4.2 million for
fiscal year-end 2010 (12% of reported net income before taxes).
Violations
26.
As a result of the conduct described above, Phoenix violated Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder.
27.
Also as a result of the conduct described above, Phoenix violated Section
13(b)(2)(A) of the Exchange Act, which requires reporting companies to make and keep books,
records, and accounts which, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect their transactions
and dispositions of their assets.
28.
Lastly, as a result of the conduct described above, Phoenix violated Section
13(b)(2)(B) of the Exchange Act, which requires all reporting companies to devise and maintain a
system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances that transactions
are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles.
