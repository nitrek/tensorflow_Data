Enhanced Allowance Disclosure –
Changes to the Methodology
Where you changed your allowance methodology in recent
periods, consider discussing:
 Historical loss data you used as a starting point for

estimating losses
 How economicfa
factors affecting loan qualitywe
were

incorporated into the allowance

 Charge-off policy
 Level of specificity for grouping loans to estimate losses
 Application of loss factors to graded loans
 Any other estimation methods or assumptions

10

Enhanced Allowance Disclosure –
Increasing Charge-offs
If you experienced a significant increase in
charge-offs, enhance the disclosure surrounding
how the trend of increasing charge-offs has
impacted or is expected to impact the allowance.
For example, consider disclosing:
 the triggering events or other circumstances
that impact the timing of when an allowance
is established
 how the increasing level of charge-offs is
factored in the determination of the different
components of the allowance

11

Enhanced Allowance Disclosure – Loans
with Concentration of Credit Risk
To the extent that a few loans make up the majority of
the non-accrual loans, and thus there is a
concentration of credit risk, discuss your lending
relationships:

 


 General information about the borrower
(commercial, residential land developer,
commercial business)

business)
 Type of collateral securing the loan
 Amount of total credit exposure

 Amount of allowance for the impaired loan


 


 Any special circumstances surrounding the loan,
such as whether out-of-market, loan participation,
etc.

etc.

Enhanced Allowance Disclosure – Loans Measured
for Impairment Based on the Collateral Value
If you have a significant amount of loans measured for
impairment basedon
onthe

collateral value, consider
disclosing:
 How and when updated third partyappraisals
appraisalsaare

obtained and how this impacts the amount and timing of
recording the loan loss provision and charge-offs

 Whether you make any adjustments to the appraisals

appraisals




and why

 Type of appraisal, such as “retail value” or “as is” value
 How partially charged-off loans measured for impairment

basedon
onthe
thecollateral
collateral value are classified and
accounted for subsequent to receiving an updated
appraisal. For example, disclose whether the loans are
returned to performing status or whether they remain as
nonperforming
14

Enhanced Allowance Disclosure – Loans Measured

(cont’d)
 Typical timing surrounding the recognition of loan as

 Procedures performed between receipt of updated


 





appraisals to ensure impairment of loans measured for

where
the appraisal has not been updated, disclose your
processes and procedures for estimating the value of the

15

Enhanced Allowance Disclosure – Loans Measured
for Impairment Based on the Collateral Value
(cont’d)
If you have a significant amount of loans measured
for impairment based on the collateral value,
describe how charge-offs for confirmed losses
impact the coverage ratio (total allowance for loan
losses divided by total nonperforming loans). For
example, consider providing the following types of
disclosure:
 Nonperforming loans for which the full loss has
been charged-off to total loans

loans




 Nonperforming loans for which the full loss has
been charged-off to total nonperforming loans

Disclosure

classified/quantified separately as accrual and nonaccrual
 Policy regarding how many payments the borrower

Troubled Debt Restructurings (TDRs)
– Enhanced Disclosure (cont’d)

 Separately discuss restructurings made for
“covered loans” that are accounted for under
loss sharing agreements with the FDIC
 If impairment is measured based on the
present value of expected future cash flows,
disclose policy election regarding how the
entire change in present value is reflected in
the financial statements. For example, disclose
whether the amount is recorded entirely within
the provision for loan losses or whether a
portion reflecting the amount attributable to the
passage of time is recorded as interest income.
To the extent that part of the amount is
reflected within interest income, the amount of
interest income recognized should be
disclosed (ASC 310-10-45)
19

Other Real Estate Owned (OREO) –
Enhanced Disclosure
To the extent you have a significant amount of OREO,
consider providing:
 Breakout of OREO by category – lotl loans, commercial

clear disclosure in the footnote to the table and
quantify the amount of loans excluded and why

 The impact of government assistance during the
period on the income statement, including the
amount of government assistance reflected in
interest income and servicing income during the

 Loans modified under the programs may have
credit characteristics that diverge from the
unmodified portfolio, resulting in a concentration of
credit risk that requires disclosure pursuant to FSP
SOP 94-6-1 (ASC 825-10-55). For example,
extended amortization periods, balloon payments,
payment terms that expose borrower to higher
payment after end of five year participation period.
