COMPLAINT AND
JURY DEMAND

Defendants.

Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission ("Commission"), for its Complaint against
Defendants Devon D. Archer ("Archer"), Bevan T. Cooney ("Cooney"), Hugh Dunkerley
("Dunkerley"), Jason W. Galanis ("Jason Galanis"), John P. Galanis ("John Galanis"), Gary T.
Hirst ("Hirst") and Michelle A. Morton ("Morton") (together, the "Defendants"), alleges as
follows:
SUMMARY OF THE ALLEGATIONS
1.

This case involves a fraudulent scheme orchestrated by Jason Galanis to obtain

undisclosed control over two registered investment advisers so that over $43 million of their

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 2 of 43

clients' funds could be invested in sham Native American tribal bonds (hereinafter, the "bonds"
or "Tribal Bonds"), and ultimately diverted to him and his associates and the entities they
controlled at the expense of unwitting investors.
2.

To carry out the Tribal Bond scheme, Jason Galanis enlisted his father (John

Galanis) and five of his associates, Archer, Cooney, Dunkerley, Hirst and Morton. As Jason
Galanis told Cooney and Archer prior to the first issuance of the Tribal Bonds, the "primary
objective" was "to get us a source of discretionary liquidity" - liquidity Jason Galanis would use
to fund his and his father's lavish lifestyles, and to expand the corporate empire in which he,
Archer and Cooney had invested. Jason Galanis brought on Hirst, Dunkerley and Morton as
needed, and compensated them for the roles they knowingly assumed as front men and
facilitators.
3.

Jason Galanis and John Galanis kicked off the scheme in March 2014, when they

convinced a Native American tribal corporation, the Wakpamni Lake Community Corporation,
affiliated with the Wakpamni District of the Oglala Sioux Nation, whose members live in one of
the poorest regions in the United States (the " WLCC"), to become the issuer of the limited
recourse bonds that they had already structured and developed. From August 2014 to April
2015, Jason Galanis and John Galanis arranged for WLCC to issue three tranches of Tribal
Bonds.
4.

Having secured an issuer, Jason Galanis and his associates needed investors to

buy the Tribal Bonds, and they found them in the unsuspecting clients of two investment
advisers over which Jason Galanis and his associates gained control. In July 2014, Jason Galanis
arranged the purchase of investment adviser Hughes Capital Management, LLC ("Hughes") which managed approximately $900 million for various pension funds - and installed Morton as

2

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 3 of 43

CEO and part owner. And, in April 2015, Jason Galanis arranged for Hughes to acquire another
investment adviser with still more pension fund clients' funds under management, Atlantic Asset
Management LLC ("AAM"), and put Morton in charge of the larger enterprise. Jason Galanis
arranged for Valor Group Ltd. ("Valor Group"), an entity controlled by Jason Galanis, Archer,
Dunkerley and others, to provide the financing for both purchases through its wholly-owned
insurance company subsidiaries Wealth-Assurance AG ("Wealth-Assurance") and Valorlife
Lebensversicherungs AG ("Valorlife"), informing Archer and Cooney that this acquisition
promised greater "liquidity" for "their various projects."
5.

Morton understood that Valor Group's financing of both acquisitions was

contingent on her agreement to invest Hughes' and AAM's clients' funds in the Tribal Bonds. In
August 2014, at the direction of Jason Galanis, Morton hired Hirst at Hughes and authorized
Hirst to purchase $27 million of Tribal Bonds on behalf of nine Hughes clients. In April 2015,
again at the direction of Jason Galanis, Morton used $16.2 million of an AAM client's funds to
buy Tribal Bonds.
6.

According to the trust indentures and other documents relating to the Tribal Bond

issuances, the proceeds from each issuance were primarily to be invested in an annuity to benefit
WLCC and generate sufficient income to pay interest, and ultimately to repay the principal, to
the bond holders. In connection with each bond issuance, WLCC entered into an annuity
contract with Wealth Assurance Private Client Corporation ("WAPCC"), an entity described in a
private placement memorandum as a subsidiary of Valor Group. Pursuant to each annuity
contract, the bond proceeds were to be managed by an independent investment manager,
"Investment Management Company A," in a separately managed account at W APCC.

3

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 4 of 43

7.

However, Investment Management Company A was a fake entity created at the

behest of Jason Galanis. Jason Galanis paid an associate ("Galanis Associate") $150,000 to sign
the annuity contracts as the purported control person of Investment Management Company A,
but the Galanis Associate never provided any investment management services. Instead, Jason
Galanis gained undisclosed control over the bond proceeds, and he and the other Defendants
used the proceeds for their personal benefit, including to purchase luxury goods, pay the criminal
defense costs of John Galanis and Jason Galanis in a previously charged case, boost the net
capital of two broker-dealers in which Archer and Cooney had interests, and finance the initial
public offering of "Technology Company," a corporation in which Jason Galanis, Hirst, Cooney,
Dunkerley and Archer held shares, and for which Jason Galanis served as an "advisor."
8.

In September 2015, Jason Galanis, John Galanis and Hirst were charged both by

the Commission and by a grand jury convened by the United States Attorney's Office for the
Southern District of New York ("USAO") with securities fraud arising out of a different and
umelated scheme. SEC v. Galanis, et. al., 15 Civ. 7547 (VSB) (S.D.N.Y.) ("SEC v. Galanis");
and United States v. Jason Galanis, et al., 15 Cr. 0643 (PKC) (S.D.N.Y.) ("US v. Galanis").
9.

While free on bail, Jason Galanis has continued to further the fraudulent scheme

described herein by, among other things, orchestrating payments to the Tribal Bond indenture
trustee to fund the Tribal Bonds' interest payment obligations as they came due.

OTHER RELEVANT ENTITIES
23.

Burnham Securities, an SEC-registered broker dealer based in New York, New

York, served as the placement agent for the Tribal Bonds. At all relevant times, Burnham
Securities was wholly owned by Burnham Financial Group. Beginning in 2014, Jason
Galanis, Archer and Cooney gained control of Burnham Financial Group and Burnham
Securities, through, at least in part, CORFA, a Delaware limited liability company in which

purportedly the ammity provider in connection with the Tribal Bonds. Dunkerley also
incorporated a company called WAPCC in Florida and opened an associated bank account (the
"WAPCC Account") for which he and Hirst are the only signatories, and to which the net Tribal
Bond proceeds were sent by the Indenture trustee.
25.

Valor Group was incorporated as Wealth Assurance Holdings Ltd. by Dunkerley

in the British Virgin Islands in 2013 , and changed its name to Valor Group Ltd. in December
2014. Through Thorsdale Fiduciary and Guaranty Company Ltd. ("Thorsdale"), a Nevada

9

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 10 of 43

incorporated family trust company Jason Galanis controls, Jason Galanis holds a significant
ownership interest in Wealth Assurance Holdings Ltd., and its successor, Valor Group. In 2013,
Wealth Assurance Holdings Ltd. purchased Wealth-Assurance, and Dunkerley was appointed
to Wealth-Assurance's Board of Directors. In November 2014, Wealth Assurance Holdings Ltd.
acquired Valorlife. Jason Galanis became a paid advisor to Valorlife's Board of Directors in
December 2014. Wealth-Assurance provided the financing for GMT's purchase of Hughes, and
Valorlife provided the financing for GMT's purchase of AAM. In addition, Wealth-Assurance's
subsidiary, BFG Investments, became an indirect owner of Hughes and AAM by virtue of an
ownership interest it acquired in GMT.
26.

AAM is an SEC-registered investment adviser which was principally located in

Stamford, Connecticut. In April 2015, AAM was purchased by GMT and merged with Hughes,
an SEC-registered investment adviser, which was principally located in Alexandria, Virginia.
The merged entity retained AAM' s name. AAM was charged by the Commission in connection
with its investment of client funds in the Tribal Bonds in December 2015 and is now in
receivership and in the process of winding down. See SEC v. AAM, 15 Civ. 9764 (WHP)
(S.D.N.Y).
FACTS

27.

The Tribal Bond scheme orchestrated by Jason Galanis consisted of four parts: 1)

pitching WLCC to issue the Tribal Bonds; 2) engineering the Tribal Bond issuances to give
Jason Galanis and his associates undisclosed control over the Tribal Bond proceeds; 3) securing
victims to purchase the Tribal Bonds; and 4) misappropriating the Tribal Bond proceeds for the
benefit of Jason Galanis and his associates, including the Defendants.

10

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 11 of 43

28.

E-mails among Jason Galanis, Archer and Cooney reflect their intent, from the

outset of the scheme, to control and use the proceeds from the Tribal Bonds for their personal
benefit. In April 2014, when an initial issuance of $20 million bonds appeared imminent, Jason
Galanis e-mailed Archer and Cooney: "$20 mm bond approved. Proceeds are $15 mm to us and
5 mm to them." In July 2014, after WLCC had approved issuing the bonds, Jason Galanis emailed Archer and Cooney: "My primary objective is to get us a source of discretionary
liquidity. Sick of begging."
A. The Pitch: John Galanis Finds a Bond Issuer.

29.

John Galanis handled the initial efforts to find a bond issuer for the scheme. In or

about March 2014, John Galanis attended a Native American economic development conference
in Las Vegas, Nevada and made a presentation to several tribes regarding a prospective Native
American bond issuance. John Galanis purported to be representing Burnham Securities, even
though he had no official connection to Burnham Securities.
30.

John Galanis ' s presentation to prospective Native American bond issuers had all

the necessary players (except the issuer) in place, including Burnham Securities as the Placement
Agent. During the conference, a representative of WLCC indicated to John Galanis that WLCC
would be interested in participating in the issuance. John Galanis was WLCC's primary point of
contact regarding the Tribal Bonds throughout the scheme and induced WLCC to issue each
tranche of Tribal Bonds.
B. The Tribal Bonds Are Structured to Allow Jason Galanis and Dunkerley to
Control the Bond Proceeds.

31.

Jason Galanis and John Galanis arranged for WLCC to issue three tranches of

Tribal Bonds: a) $27,077,436 in August 2014; b) $20,000,000 in September 2014; and c)
$16,200,000 in April 2015. The first and last issuances defrauded investment adviser clients of
11

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 12 of 43

Hughes and AAM. The middle issuance did not represent an additional capital raising event;
instead, bond proceeds from the first issuance were used to purchase newly issued Tribal Bonds,
so that Jason Galanis, Archer, Cooney and Dunkerley could obtain $20 million worth of bonds
for their own use without any capital outlay on their part.
32.

To Jason Galanis, the Tribal Bonds were simply a source of cash, providing him

with the liquidity he needed to expand the corporate empire he sought to assemble with Archer,
Cooney and Dunkerley. In one revealing email to Archer and Cooney from August 2014, Jason
Galanis proposed an acquisition of a European fund of funds - brought to him by Dunkerley and identified the source of funds for the acquisition as proceeds from a Tribal Bond issuance.
After describing the deal, Jason Galanis wrote: "Hugh [Dunkerley] [has] locked it up and came
to me for the money, which i have agreed to arrange/provide (probably Indians)."
33.

Each Tribal Bond issuance was governed by an indenture that provided for the

vast majority of proceeds to be invested in an annuity that was supposed to generate income
sufficient to pay interest to the bond investors, plus a smaller annual sum to WLCC for use in
various development projects. The interest payments and ultimate repayment of the principal of
the bond issuance depended on the success of the investments held by the annuity in which the
proceeds of the issuances were to be invested.
34.

In June 2014, Burnham Securities' counsel provided WLCC with a summary of

the bond program that listed Wealth-Assurance as the Annuity Issuer and Investment
Management Company A as the Portfolio Manager.
35.

In May 2013, Jason Galanis had arranged Valor Group's purchase of Wealth-

Assurance, purportedly a Liechtenstein-based life insurance and annuity provider with €1.5
billion in assets under management, and soon after installed Dunkerley on its Board of Directors.

12

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 13 of 43

Ultimately, Wealth-Assurance never provided any annuity contracts in connection with any of
the bond issuances.
36.

In August 2014, when WLCC issued its first bonds, Investment Management

Company A nominally became the investment manager for the bond proceeds. The trust
indenture and a separate investment management agreement with WLCC tasked Investment
Management Company A with selecting an annuity provider and placing the bond proceeds in a
variable annuity. Galanis Associate signed the trust indenture and investment management
agreement on behalf of Investment Management Company A as its Managing Director.
37.

However, Galanis Associate was not an independent investment manager but

simply a shill for Jason Galanis. In return for a $150,000 fee (ultimately paid to him out of bond
proceeds that were supposed to be invested in the annuity), Galanis Associate agreed to act on
behalf of Investment Management Company A in signing the annuity contracts associated with
the bond issuances.
38.

Although the annuity contracts named Investment Management Company A as

the independent manager of the monies held by the annuity provider in a separately managed
account, Galanis Associate exercised no authority over any such account and made no
investment decisions regarding the funds.
39.

The annuity provider was not chosen by Galanis Associate, but by Jason Galanis.

Instead of selecting Wealth-Assurance, Jason Galanis selected WAPCC. The annuity contract
between WLCC and W APCC identifies WAPCC as a British Virgin Islands ("BVI")incorporated entity that is "part of the Wealth-Assurance Group of companies."
40.

In fact, Dunkerley is the sole shareholder of WAPCC and it has no known

affiliation with Wealth-Assurance. At Jason Galanis ' s instruction, or with his knowledge,

13

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 14 of 43

Dunkerley incorporated W APCC in the BVI on August 22, 2014, just four days before Jason
Galanis selected WAPCC as the annuity provider for the first issuance of the Tribal Bonds.
WAPCC' s unaudited financial statements reflect that through the end of December 2014, WLCC
was WAPCC's only annuity "counterparty."
41 .

Also contrary to the annuity contract between WAPCC and WLCC, the bond

proceeds were not directed to a W APCC account at a bank "without any offices and/or branches
in the United States." Instead, the indenture trustee was instructed to send the bond proceeds to a
bank account at a Florida branch of a US bank, in the name of an identically named company
that had been incorporated in Florida on July 7, 2014.
42.

In its Florida incorporation papers, WAPCC listed Dunkerley as its sole officer,

and gave its mailing address as a post office box in Florida used by Hirst. As described below,
the misappropriation of the bond proceeds all flowed from the W APCC Account associated with
W APCC in Florida.
C. Jason Galanis Secures Victims to Purchase the Tribal Bonds by Obtaining Control

over Hughes and AAM.
43.

In order to secure victims to purchase the Tribal Bonds, Jason Galanis and his

associates arranged to obtain control over two investment advisers, thereby gaining access to
captive client funds. First, in August 2014, Jason Galanis, Archer, Cooney and Dunkerley
obtained control over Hughes, and Jason Galanis, Morton and Hirst arranged for Hughes to
invest $27 million of its clients' funds in Tribal Bonds. Second, in April 2015, Jason Galanis,
Archer, Cooney and Dunkerley obtained control over AAM, and Jason Galanis and Morton
arranged for AAM to invest $16.2 million of its clients' funds in Tribal Bonds.

44.

Hughes

In May 2014, Jason Galanis was introduced to Morton, the half-owner of GMT,

which had the stated business purpose of providing socially responsible fixed income investment
management and advisory services as a minority business enterprise. Together, Jason Galanis
and Morton began negotiating to purchase Hughes, an investment adviser with approximately
$900 million under management, based in Alexandria, Virginia.
45.

On June 3, 2014, Jason Galanis provided Morton with a document to provide to

Hughes' then-owner to "demonstrate who [Morton's] financial sponsors are." The document
described a private equity control investor that owned several businesses, including WealthAssurance and Burnham Securities. On June 5, 2014, Jason Galanis sent Morton a term sheet
outlining the terms by which CORFA - a corporation owned in part by Jason Galanis, Archer
and Cooney - would directly or indirectly (through a subsidiary) finance GMT's purchase of
Hughes. Archer and Cooney knew that their agreement to finance the Hughes' acquisition with
CORFA funds was a necessary part of the plan to place the Tribal Bonds and obtain "liquidity"
for themselves and their corporate expansion projects.
46.

Jason Galanis kept Archer and Cooney in the loop regarding the negotiations to

acquire Hughes. On July 16, 2014, he sent them a copy of the executed term sheet for the
acquisition of Hughes. He proclaimed: "I believe they will take $28 million of the [Tribal]
issue." Cooney and Archer expressed their enthusiasm, with Cooney replying: "West Coast
Offense charging down the field!" Archer added: "This is very encouraging! "
47.

On August 1, 2014, Jason Galanis sent Morton a text message stating that he

would form BFG Investments - the entity through which the contribution to the acquisition
would be made - the next day. On August 5, 2014, at the direction of Jason Galanis, Dunkerley
formed BFG Investments and became its managing member.
15

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 16 of 43

48.

One week later, GMT entered into an amended and restated operating agreement

with its members, pursuant to which BFG Investments became a "Preferred Member." The
agreement was signed by Dunkerley on behalf of BFG Investments, and stated that notices to
BFG Investments were to be sent to Archer. After the merger closed, Hughes became GMT's
subsidiary and Morton and her business partner became officers of Hughes.
49.

On August 12, 2014, Jason Galanis arranged for Wealth-Assurance to fund BFG

Investments' initial capital contribution of $2,660,618 to GMT, which GMT used to finance its
purchase of Hughes.
50.

As Morton knew, Jason Galanis, Archer, Cooney and Dunkerley's agreement to

finance the acquisition of Hughes was contingent on her agreement to invest Hughes' client
funds in Tribal Bonds. In July 2014, even before the purchase of Hughes had been completed,
Morton e-mailed Jason Galanis "an update on how we will place the bonds in a portfolio" and
promised him via text message, "I will make sure you make a TON of money and smile all the
way to the bank." On August 12, 2014, Morton sent Jason Galanis a text message noting, "You
invested because of the bonds not me," to which he responded: "The bonds are only possible
because of you my dear."
51.

Pursuant to GMT's amended operating agreement, BFG Investments was

accorded certain privileges, including the right to approve the CIO for GMT and Hughes, and to
appoint members to Hughes' board.
52.

Before GMT completed its purchase of Hughes, Jason Galanis introduced Morton

to Hirst as a potential CIO. On August 12, 2014, Hirst sent Morton a draft employment contract.
Hirst and Morton executed the contract and related paperwork that same day.

16

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 17 of 43

53.

However, a few days later, Hirst informed Morton that he did not want Hughes to

disclose his name in its Form ADV, a form that investment advisers registered with the
Commission are required to file upon registration and annually thereafter. For that reason, Hirst
decided to resign as Hughes' CIO and agreed to act as a paid independent investment consultant
instead, a position that he understood would not require disclosure on Hughes' Form ADV. As
Mo1ion told Jason Galanis, "In regard to Hirst, he opted to be a consultant because as an
employee he would have been required to make certain disclosures for our ADV ... If we want
to follow the contract which has him as CIO its [sic] no problem, we just have to change the title,
but he has to make the disclosures per regulations."
54.

By August 14, 2014, just two days after the purchase of Hughes was completed,

Jason Galanis and Hirst worked to invest Hughes client funds in the Tribal Bonds. Hirst quickly
undertook an analysis of Hughes' clients' accounts and investments to determine what could be
liquidated to generate funds to purchase Tribal Bonds.
55.

Morton asked Hughes' compliance officer to conduct an analysis of the

investment guidelines of seven of Hughes' clients to determine whether they allowed for
purchase of the Tribal Bonds. The compliance officer concluded that most of the clients'
guidelines prohibited privately-placed, unrated bonds like the Tribal Bonds, and that in no case
could the investment be made without consulting the client first.
56.

On August 17, 2014, Jason Galanis, using a Burnham-affiliated e-mail address

(burnhamequitypartners.com), e-mailed Morton a copy of the draft trust indenture for the Tribal
Bonds. It provided that the bond proceeds would be invested in an annuity that would be issued
and managed by Wealth-Assurance. In addition, pursuant to a Placement Agency Agreement for
the Tribal Bonds, Burnham Securities was entitled to a $250,000 fee from the bond sale

17

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 18 of 43

proceeds. The agreement stated that notices to Burnham Securities should be sent to Jason
Galanis (spelled "Galanos" in the agreement) and was signed by Dunkerley. Morton knew that
Burnham Securities would be acting as the Placement Agent for the Tribal Bonds.
57.

On August 17, 2014, Morton e-mailed Jason Galanis, acknowledging the conflicts

of interest presented by her investment of client funds in a transaction in which affiliated
companies - Wealth-Assurance and Burnham Securities - stood to benefit. She complained that
she was spending much time performing due diligence regarding the Tribal Bonds "because of
the multiple views I had to take." She explained: "For instance, since many of the accounts are
ERISA funds, I had to consider those guidelines and regulations, I have a fiduciary duty to
Burnham, and a fiduciary duty to the clients."
58.

In another e-mail dated August 17, 2014, Morton sent Jason Galanis a memo

articulating concerns regarding the Tribal Bonds. Among other things, Morton's memo
questioned whether the tribe affiliated with the issuer-a tribal corporation operating in an
impoverished region-would be legally or financially accountable for the Tribal Bonds and
whether institutional clients would fire Hughes if they were dissatisfied with the investment.
59.

In her e-mail transmitting the memo to Jason Galanis, Morton wrote, in reference

to BFG Investments' investment in Hughes: "The decision regarding what should be done is
yours, not mine ... To be fair to both of us, if you made the investment with this in mind, I do
not have the moral right to stand in the way and everything is in place to move forward .. .. "
She reiterated in a text message to Jason Galanis: "Let's be clear, if you want the bonds to go in,
I have no say. I am not sitting in the position of making a judgement [sic] . If you invested in
Hughes for this sole purpose than it is your call not mine ... If you're thinking that I can or would

18

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 19 of 43

stop this then I have totally screwed up my communication." Jason Galanis told Morton to let
Hirst "make the decision."
60.

Between August 22 and 26, 2014, Hirst signed trade tickets purchasing

$27,077,436 of Tribal Bonds on behalf of nine of Hughes' clients. The funds were sent to a trust
account at US Bank for the benefit of WLCC. Neither Morton nor Hirst informed any of those
clients about the investments beforehand. As one of the costs of issuance associated with the
bonds, WLCC paid Burnham Securities a $250,000 placement agent fee out of the bond
proceeds, of which $125,000 was then paid to Dunkerley as his share of the fee.
61.

Morton and Hirst knew that Morton's "financial sponsors," including Jason

Galanis and Dunkerley, were associated with Wealth-Assurance and Burnham Securities, which
had been described to her as the annuity provider and placement agent, respectively-entities
that would financially benefit from Hughes' clients' purchases of the Tribal Bonds.
Nevertheless, neither she nor Hirst disclosed to Hughes' clients that Hughes was investing their
funds in investments that would financially benefit its undisclosed part owners and financiers.
62.

Upon learning of the investments in the bonds, several Hughes clients expressed

concerns regarding the bonds ' valuation and suitability and demanded that the investments be
unwound. Morton assured them that Burnham Securities, as the placement agent, had other
clients interested in the bonds and was in the process of arranging purchases. However, despite
repeated promises, Burnham Securities never produced buyers for the bonds, and none of
Hughes' clients was able to liquidate its position in the bonds.

2.
63.

AAM

In the fall of 2014, Jason Galanis began searching for additional investors to

purchase another tranche of Tribal Bonds. Morton identified AAM, an investment manager with
$11 billion in assets under management, as a potential target for Hughes.
19

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 20 of 43

64.

During the course of Morton's negotiations to acquire AAM, on October 30,

2014, Morton e-mailed Jason Galanis that she had had a conversation with AAM's Chief
Strategist "about our SRI [Socially Responsible Investing]/Native American Initiative" and that
"he is so on board with this." According to Morton, AAM's Chief Strategist told her that if she
made him aware of the details of the bonds ahead of time, he would do his "damndest to get it
placed within a day after the acquisition." Jason Galanis forwarded the e-mail to Cooney and
Archer, with the note "working on more liquidity and sources for the various projects ... see
below. Promising." Cooney replied: "Very promising Greco!!"
65.

With the backing of Jason Galanis, Archer, Cooney and Dunkerley, Morton

continued to negotiate with AAM. On December 1, 2014, at Jason Galanis's direction or with
his knowledge, Dunkerley provided AAM' s General Counsel a letter on behalf of the "Cor
Group of Companies, Inc.," a CORF A affiliate, confirming its agreement to provide financing to
capitalize the purchase of AAM. On February 2, 2015, Jason Galanis sent Archer and Cooney a
"consultant report" directed to the "Board of Valorlife" regarding the financing of the proposed
acquisition of AAM. Valorlife was a foreign insurer that Valor Group had acquired in
November 2014.
66.

On April 2, 2015, at the direction of Jason Galanis, Valorlife financed the

purchase of AAM through BFG Investments with an upfront capital contribution of $6, 120,3 98.
In addition to the upfront capital contribution, the purchase of AAM also included an agreement
to make a deferred payment of $4,854,420, payable pursuant to two Reset Notes. The deferred
payment was guaranteed by Valor Group and the guaranty was signed by Dunkerley as Valor
Group 's President.

20

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 21 of 43

67.

On March 30, 2015, Jason Galanis forwarded copies of the executed AAM

acquisition documents to Cooney, Archer and Burnham Financial Group's President, and
Cooney replied: "18 Balloons!!! Fantastic J!! !" The terms of the purchase were memorialized
in an Amended and Restated Liability Company Agreement for GMT ("Restated Agreement"),
entered into as of April 2, 2015 . Dunkerley signed the agreement on behalf of BFG Investments
as its Managing Member.
68.

Pursuant to the Restated Agreement, AAM became GMT's wholly owned

subsidiary. The Restated Agreement provided that AAM's Board of Managers was to consist of
four persons, comprised of two Class A Holders (Morton and her business partner) and two
persons selected by BFG Investments as the Class B Holder. Together, the Board of Managers
was granted the exclusive right to control AAM. In addition, GMT was required to appoint a
CIO that was acceptable to BFG Investments.
69.

Immediately after the acquisition of AAM was completed, and in furtherance of

his pledge to Archer and Cooney to obtain more "liquidity" for their "various projects," Jason
Galanis instructed Motion to identify investors to purchase additional Tribal Bonds. By that
point, Morton was aware that there was no active market for the bonds. Since at least November
2014, she had been dealing with client complaints, including threatened litigation, regarding the
original bond investments by Hughes' clients and had been unsuccessful in her efforts to an-ange
for Burnham Securities to find buyers or purchase them itself. Indeed, in January 2015, she emailed Jason Galanis: "I thought that if necessary B[urnham] would bid on the bonds if the
clients wished . It appears not to be the case. We have received one formal communication and I
expect we will receive others in the coming days."

21

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 22 of 43

70.

As before, Morton learned that entities affiliated with her "financial sponsors,"

including Jason Galanis, Archer, Cooney and Dunkerley, would financially benefit from the sale
of this tranche of Tribal Bonds. On April 9, 2015, Burnham Securities' counsel sent Morton a
private placement memorandum for the new issuance of Tribal Bonds. Like the August 2014
Tribal Bonds issuance, it provided that the proceeds of the new issuance would be used for
transaction costs, including a placement agent fee, and to purchase an annuity. It identified
"Wealth Assurance Private Client Corporation, a subsidiary of Valor Group" as the underwriter
and issuer of the annuity contract. It also disclosed that pursuant to a placement agreement
entered into between the issuer, WLCC, and Burnham Securities, "Burnham Securities will
receive an $80,000 fee from the Issuer for the sale of the Bonds by the Issuer."
71.

On April 10, 2015, Jason Galanis sent Morton a "Class A board member

communication request," in which he demanded a conference call to discuss a number of
business related items. In the e-mail, Jason Galanis expressed frustration regarding AAM's lack
of support for a potential investment in additional Tribal Bonds: "On the Native American
initiative, this was and has been a fundamental part of the business plan since we met. .. "and
"[i]t is in everyone's interest to maintain their word." In the e-mail, Jason Galanis stated: "I am
not a member of the board. However, I was responsible for arranging the financing for the
company and have been requested to continue to be the lead in liaising with the investors."
72.

On April 14, 2015, Morton e-mailed Jason Galanis explaining that they "had a

challenge regarding bond placement," and proposing that they could "mitigate the challenge of
restrictive investment policies by going directly to our client base (which numbers over 40
clients) and introduce the concept. Exceptions to investment policies occur all of the time, the
key is to have the relationship necessary and begin the discussions in advance of the placement."

22

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 23 of 43

In the same e-mail, Morton also requested a $500,000 loan, explaining that AAM was suffering
from financial difficulty and was struggling to pay its operating costs. Jason Galanis replied to
Morton's message, "Let's talk, I don't like e-mail."
73.

The next day, Morton texted Jason Galanis: "I would really like to have clarity on

the working capital as soon as possible. The trade will go through in the am." Jason Galanis
replied: "Will wire 305 on Friday. Worst Monday." On April 16, 2015, Morton directed the
investment of $16.2 million of an AAM client's funds in the new issuance of Tribal Bonds. One
week later, AAM received a $305,000 payment, funded by bond proceeds from the WAPCC
Account in Florida and authorized by Dunkerley at Jason Galanis's direction or with his
knowledge.
74.

Morton arranged for AAM to use funds maintained in one of its managed funds

(the "HY Fund") for the bond purchase. HY Fund implements a strategy of making diverse, high
yielding, liquid investments through designated investment managers. HY Fund's only investor
was Pension Fund 1, an existing client of AAM' s for which AAM managed other investments in
addition to its investment in the HY Fund.
75.

The purchase of the Tribal bonds was inconsistent with HY Fund's investment

strategy, and notwithstanding her previous e-mail to Jason Galanis suggesting that AAM
"introduce the concept" to Pension Fund 1 prior to making the investment, Morton did not
discuss the purchase of the bonds with Pension Fund 1 prior to making the investment.
76.

After the purchase, on April 23, 2015, Morton informed Pension Fund 1 about the

investment in the bonds and the fact that there was a potential conflict of interest because the
individuals who controlled the annuity provider and the placement agent were also AAM's
financiers. Morton did not tell Pension Fund 1 that those same individuals were also AAM's

23

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 24 of 43

part-owners, and the largest source of AAM's capital. Nor did Morton disclose that Jason
Galanis had promised her additional funding for AAM in connection with her approval of the
bond purchase.
77.

The next day, Pension Fund 1's Executive Director informed AAM that it

"strongly disagree[d]" with the purchase of the bonds and that Pension Fund 1 "should have been
'

provided advance notice of this questionable purchase, pmiicularly due to the fact that a conflict
of interest exists in the purchase." Pension Fund 1 demanded that the bonds be liquidated
immediately.
78.

Once again, Burnham Securities promised to find a purchaser for the bonds.

However, neither Burnham Securities nor AAM was able to find any purchaser for the Tribal
Bonds.
79.

Pension Fund 1 sent AAM a notice of redemption of all of its funds in HY Fund

on September 24, 2015 and, on October 29, 2015, it notified AAM that it was redeeming the rest
of its funds under AAM' s management. Pension Fund 1 explained that its decision to end its
relationship with AAM was based on Morton's "unilateral actions (which [were not yet]
reversed) to violate investment guidelines and purchase inappropriate securities with the money
contributed by the hard working members of [Pension Fund 1]."
80.

In October 2015, Dunkerley, on behalf of Burnham Securities, e-mailed AAM

acknowledging the lack of a market for the bonds, and admitted that they could not even be
priced: "You may want to refer to the risks section of the PPM where it clearly says there is 'no
market for these and none is expected to develop in the future' .... This situation is clearly true
at the moment and given the current investigation any price attributed to these bonds may not be
appropriate for accounting or even misleading for any other purposes."

24

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 25 of 43

81.

At the time, Dunkerley knew that, contrary to the annuity contract he had signed,

none of the bond proceeds had been sent to a separate account held by WAPCC BVI and
managed by Investment Management Company A, but, in accordance with the scheme, had
instead been sent to the separately incorporated WAPCC in FL and misappropriated from there.

D. Jason Galanis, John Galanis, Dunkerley, Hirst, Archer and Cooney Misappropriate
the Tribal Bond Proceeds.
82.

Based on the documents governing the sale of the $43.2 million in Tribal Bonds

to Hughes and AAM clients, and after the deduction of various issuance costs and up-front
payments to WLCC, $40.1 million of the bond proceeds were to be invested by Investment
Management Company A in annuities issued by WAPCC in BVI. The bonds issued to Hughes
investors were to pay 5.62% interest annually and mature in 10 years; the bonds issued to
AAM's HY Fund were to pay 6.02% interest annually and mature in 7 years. The payment of
the interest and return of the full $43.2 million in principal upon maturity of all the bonds was
dependent on the successful investment of the proceeds by WAPCC, under the direction of
Investment Management Company A.
83.

As set out in the two separate annuity contracts governing the bond issuances to

Hughes and AAM clients (both signed by Dunkerley on WAPCC's behalf), WAPCC promised
that the initial proceeds received would be kept in a "segregated asset account" that would be
"unique to this Contract" and would be "segregated from the Company's other assets." The
annuity contract governing the Hughes clients' bond proceeds also explicitly provided that the
annuity purchase payment was to be made by wire transfer to "a bank without any offices and/or
branches in the United States" (a provision that was apparently edited out of the subsequent
annuity contract used for the bond issuance sold to the HY Fund).

25

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 26 of 43

84.

As described above, instead, all of the bond proceeds were sent to the WAPCC

Account in Florida, held in the name of an identically named entity (W APCC) incorporated and
based in Florida rather than in the BVI, and were never managed by Investment Management
Company A, which, as noted earlier, was a fake entity.
85.

In furtherance of the scheme, with Jason Galanis 's knowledge, Dunkerley

misappropriated the Tribal Bond proceeds from the WAPCC Account by authorizing wires to a
number of other entities, at least on some occasions doing so based on written instructions he
received from Jason Galanis.
86.

Dunkerley wired the largest portion of the proceeds to Thorsdale, an entity Jason

Galanis controlled, from which they were further misappropriated by Jason Galanis for his own
benefit and that of his associates. According to its operating agreement, Thorsdale was
incorporated in Nevada as a "Family Trust Company" for "members of the Berger family and its
Family Affiliates." Berger is the maiden name of Jason Galanis's wife. Jason Galanis had
signing authority over Thorsdale's bank account, held its only debit card, and directed all the
wires that Thorsdale sent that were funded by bond proceeds from the WAPCC Account.
87.

The misappropriation of Tribal Bond proceeds by WAPCC and Thorsdale

included the following:
1.

88.

Payments to Hughes and AAM

Morton's decisions to invest Hughes' and AAM's clients' funds in the Tribal

Bonds were driven in part by her expectation that Jason Galanis would continue to arrange
financial backing for the firms. Not only were her expectations met, but they were met by
Hughes' and AAM's receipt of a portion of the very proceeds that WAPCC was supposed to be
investing on behalf of the bond issuer and for the ultimate benefit of Morton's clients.

26

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 27 of 43

89.

At the direction of Jason Galanis, Hughes and AAM received at least $655,000 of

Tribal Bond proceeds: 1) a $350,000 payment on September 8, 2014, that Jason Galanis had
Dunkerley wire from W APCC to Thorsdale and then to Valor Group, which then wired it to
Hughes; and 2) a $305,000 payment (matching the amount that Jason Galanis had expressly
promised to Morton the day before she effected the April 2015 bond purchase by the HY Fund)
that Dunkerley wired to AAM directly from the WAPCC Account on April 23, 2015.

90.

$2,350,000 to John Galanis

The closing documents for the sale of the first issuance of Tribal Bonds in August

2014 did not reflect any payments to John Galanis for the work he did in presenting the
transaction to WLCC and securing its participation as issuer. Nor was WLCC informed by John
Galanis, or anyone else, that John Galanis would earn any fees in connection with the Tribal
Bonds, although John Galanis knew that proceeds from the issuance would be directed to him by
his son.
91.

Yet, after WAPCC received the bond proceeds in August 2014, all of which it had

received as purchase money for the bogus annuity contract it signed, at Jason Galanis's direction,
Dunkerley sent $2.35 million from WAPCC to an entity controlled by John Galanis called
Sovereign Nations Development Corp. From Sovereign Nations Development Corp ' s bank
account, John Galanis directed several further distributions to another account in his name.

Jason Galanis and Dunkerley Misappropriate Millions to Benefit
Jason Galanis, Dunkerley, Hirst, Cooney and Archer.

Jason Galanis arranged to have W APCC and Thorsdale transfer over $3 million to

lenders and others for the mortgage on and maintenance of his estate in Los Angeles, California.
He also arranged to have money wired from WAPCC and Thorsdale to his criminal defense
attorneys ($497,210) and to his mother, wife and father-in-law (totaling $214,000).
27

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 28 of 43

93.

In addition, Jason Galanis used his Thorsdale debit card to spend thousands more

at restaurants and luxury retailers such as Valentino, Yves Saint Laurent, Barneys, Prada and
Gucci.
94.

Dunkerley, Hirst, Cooney and Archer all benefited from their participation in the

scheme as well through transfers directed by Jason Galanis out of the Thorsdale account that
they receiyed individually or through entities that they controlled, including but not limited to:
a) $700,513 to Archer between November 2014 and April 2015; b) $4,370,000 to Cooney
between August 2014 and April 2015; c) $20,485 to Dunkerley in September 2014; and d)
$1,300,000 to Hirst in August 2014.

Jason Galanis, Archer and Cooney Recycle Tribal Bond Proceeds to
Acquire New Tribal Bonds for Burnham's Use.

In August 2014, the Independent Trustees of an asset manager affiliated with

Burnham Securities sought "iron-clad assurance(s)" from Archer (representing CORFA and
BAM Holdings, LLC) that Jason Galanis would "not be involved with any of the Burnham
entities" or have an "interest of any kind, direct or indirect, in any of the Burnham entities or
their successors, that he will not source deals to the Burnham entities and that the Burnham
entities will not invest with or in, directly or indirectly, any business or enterprise in which Mr.
Galanis has any association, affiliation or investment, pecuniary or otherwise, directly or
indirectly." Archer provided the requested assurances to the Independent Trustees via a letter
dated September 26, 2014, but nonetheless continued to significantly involve Jason Galanis in
Burnham's business activities, not only by allowing Jason Galanis to solicit Burnham Securities'
involvement as the private placement agent for the Tribal Bonds and underwriter for at least one
initial public offering, as described below, but also by accepting his direction and guidance on
how to use the Tribal Bonds to benefit Burnham Securities and its affiliates.
28

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 29 of 43

96.

On October 1, 2014, Jason Galanis used $15 million of the $27 million that

Hughes' clients invested in the August 2014 issuance of the Tribal Bonds to fund the acquisition
of a new $15 million issuance of Tribal Bonds by RSB, an entity wholly owned by Archer. In
other words, instead of having WAPCC invest the first bond issuance's proceeds in an annuity
and assure repayment of the bonds' principal and interest, Jason Galanis used $15 million of
those proceeds to invest in more Tribal Bonds, causing WLCC to issue $15 million more in
obligations even though it was not, in actuality, receiving any additional proceeds to fund an
annuity that would be the only source for repayment of the bonds. The point of this recycling
scheme was to allow Jason Galanis to use the bonds as currency in various transactions,
including to bolster Burnham Securities' net capital.
97.

To coordinate Archer's purchase of the $15 million Tribal Bonds, Jason Galanis

arranged for $15 million to be sent from Thorsdale to RSB. RSB then wired $15 million to the
indenture trustee for the benefit of WLCC to purchase the newly issued Tribal Bonds. Most of
the funds received in this issuance were sent again to WAPCC as purchase money supposedly
for a new annuity. Prior to receiving these funds, RSB's account balance was about $2 million.
In the course of paying for the Tribal Bonds, Archer's bank asked him to identify the source of
the funds. Archer facilitated the recycling of the bond proceeds by telling his bank in a client
representation letter he signed on October 20, 2014: "The funds used to purchase the bonds were
from real estate sales through my business, Rosemont Seneca Bohai LLC," a statement Archer
knew was untrue when he made it.
98.

Jason Galanis then recycled a portion of the funds again, this time to fund the

acquisition of a new $5 million issuance of Tribal Bonds by Cooney. Between October 2 and 6,
2014, Dunkerley, at Jason Galanis's direction or with his knowledge, sent back to Thorsdale a

29

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 30 of 43

large portion of the funds WAPCC had received from WLCC in connection with the $15 million
sale of Tribal Bonds to RSB. On October 8, 2014, Jason Galanis sent $5 million of the money
that Thorsdale received to Cooney, who used it to purchase Tribal Bonds. By twice recycling a
po1iion of the proceeds from the initial bond issuance, Jason Galanis and his coh01is caused
WLCC to issue $47 million of Tribal Bonds in exchange for $27 million (minus transactionrelated fees) in proceeds.
99.

Archer and Cooney then used their illegitimate Tribal Bonds to benefit Burnham

Securities, an entity in which they each held an ownership interest. In April 2015, Archer used
RSB's Tribal Bonds to purchase shares of Valor Group with Dunkerley signing the documents
on Valor Group's behalf. In May 2015, one of Valor Group's wholly-owned subsidiaries
transferred $2.6 million of the Tribal Bonds to Burnham Securities to boost its net capital in
order to meet regulatory requirements.
100.

Similarly, in May 2015, Cooney transferred his $5 million Tribal Bonds to

Burnham Securities in a transaction devised by Jason Galanis "to get Cooney some reliable
income while getting Burnham Net Cap it can commercialize." In an e-mail dated April 24,
2015, to Cooney, Archer and Burnham Financial Group's President, Jason Galanis instructed
them: "if we hustle, we can get the $5 mm on to Burnham's balance sheet this month. This
would require Bevan [Cooney] getting the physical bond delivered to US Bank for transfer into
Burnham's name."
101.

Eventually, on May 29, 2015, Cooney directly transferred the $5 million Tribal

Bonds, on Burnham Securities' behalf, to Broker Dealer 1 in partial consideration of Burnham
Securities' purchase of an interest in Broker Dealer 1. Cooney received nothing in exchange
from Burnham Securities for transferring the Tribal Bonds to Broker Dealer 1 on Burnham

30

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 31 of 43

Securities' behalf, and no documents evidence the contribution by Cooney as either an
investment or loan in Burnham Securities. In response to inquiries from FINRA regarding the
specifics of the bonds and Cooney's contribution of them, Jason Galanis told Broker Dealer 1's
President to tell FINRA that Cooney had been an investor in Burnham Securities since 2013 and
"agreed to make a follow-on investment in 2015 in support of Burnham's business plan to
diversify."

102.

Jason Galanis, Hirst, and Dunkerley Use Tribal Bond Proceeds to
Support an IPO Underwritten by Burnham.

At the direction of Jason Galanis and Hirst, W APCC used a significant portion of

the proceeds from the sale of the April 2015 Tribal Bonds to support the successful initial public
offering of Technology Company, in which Jason Galanis, Hirst, Archer, Cooney and Dunkerley
all held shares, and for which Jason Galanis served as an "advisor."
103 .

In February 2014, Jason Galanis sent Dunkerley the first draft of an S-1 for

Technology Company in connection with a potential discussion regarding "Burnham West
handling the IPO" but asked him to "not distribute to Burnham colleagues until later drafts."
Jason Galanis also told Dunkerley that "Burnham will not be expected to raise any real money,
rather will act as an IPO sponsor." Jason Galanis forwarded the e-mail to Archer and Cooney to
include them in his plans.
104.

In May 2015, Jason Galanis and Hirst coordinated the success of Technology

Company's IPO, which was underwritten by Burnham Securities, with Dunkerley taking a lead
on the deal. Technology Company's stock was initially offered on the NASDAQ on May 19,
2015 at $5/share.
105.

Between April 29th and May l8t11, 2015, Dunkerley, acting at Jason Galanis's

direction or with his knowledge, authorized wires totaling $4,336,000 from the WAPCC
31

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 32 of 43

Account to two brokerage accounts at Burnham Securities, in the names of IPO Participant 1 and
IPO Participant 2. Both accounts were opened by Galanis Associate, at the direction of Hirst.
106.

IPO Participant 1 and IPO Participant 2 used $4,335 ,000 of the funds that they

received from WAPCC to purchase 867,000 shares of Technology Company during the IPO.
The shares purchased by IPO Participant 1 and IPO Participant 2 represented 87% of the shares
offered during Technology Company's IPO. The remaining 13% was also sold to friendly
accounts, including accounts controlled by Hirst.
107.

IPO Participant 1 and IPO Participant 2 liquidated at least a portion of the shares

immediately on the open market at prices ranging from $14 to $36 per share, above the IPO
purchase price of$5 per share. As of October 15, 2015, IPO Participant 1 and IPO Participant 2
liquidated 324, 120 shares of Technology Company for proceeds of $4,523 ,312.
108.

Despite IPO Participant l's and IPO Participant 2's profitable trading with money

furnished by WAPCC, WAPCC did not recoup the $4.3 million it had sent to their accounts.
Instead, IPO Participant 1 and IPO Participant 2, acting at Jason Galanis's direction, sent
millions of dollars to a variety of other transferees, including Jason Galanis 's criminal defense
attorneys, Burnham Financial Group and RSB.

E. In September 2015, Jason Galanis and Hirst Were Charged and Arrested in a
Separate Matter.
109.

In September 2015, the Commission charged Hirst, John Galanis, Jason Galanis,

and two of Jason Galanis's brothers, with defrauding investors in Gerova, whose shares once
traded on the New York Stock Exchange. The USAO filed parallel criminal charges.
110.

John Galanis, Jason Galanis and Hirst are currently free on bail, pending the

resolution of the Gerova criminal charges. As a condition of his release, Jason Galanis is
required to disclose whether he serves as an officer, director, consultant, advisor or investment
32

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 33 of 43

banker as to any company. To evade detection by law enforcement authorities of his ongoing
activities with respect to Burnham Securities, GMT and WAPCC, Jason Galanis directed Galanis
Associate to create a new internet domain, colarisventures.com, along with the e-mail address,
legal@colarisventures.com, immediately after his arrest. Using this new e-mail address, Jason
Galanis has continued to correspond with Dunkerley, Archer, Cooney and others, going so far as
to dictate correspondence Dunkerley should send to third-parties. And he has continued to direct
business decisions and transactions, including coordinating an interest payment due on the Tribal
Bonds, as described in the section below.
F. The Aftermath: Jason Galanis, Archer and Dunkerley Continue to Mislead WLCC
and Scramble to Fund WAPCC's Interest Payment Obligations under the Annuity
Contracts
111.

Pursuant to the annuity contracts in connection with the August and September

2014 issuances of Tribal Bonds, WAPCC was obligated to make respective interest payments in
September 2015 and in October 2015. Since WAPCC had misappropriated the proceeds from
the Tribal Bonds instead of investing them in annuities, Jason Galanis scrambled to ensure that
WAPCC had sufficient funds from other sources to pay the interest payments that were due in
order to protect the Tribal Bond scheme from exposure, calling on associates for contributions as
needed.
112.

In September 2015, Dunkerley authorized WAPCC to forward $1.5 million to the

indenture trustee as interest due on the August 2014 bonds. That amount covered the interest
payments due to investors, but failed to cover an additional $277,182.87 in amrnal income that
WAPCC was obligated to pay WLCC. Based on the sources of funds held in WAPCC's bank
account at the time, the $1.5 million payment that it did make was funded by a small portion of
Technology Company stock sale proceeds it received from IPO Participant 1 and IPO Participant

33

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 34 of 43

2 ($1.3 million), amounts contributed by Archer ($250,000), and/or amounts received from
another associate of Jason Galanis ($250,000).
113.

After he had been arrested, using his new legal@colarisventures.com e-mail

address, Jason Galanis orchestrated the $1, 197 ,311 interest payment due on the October 2014
Tribal Bonds - bonds that Archer and Cooney had "bought" using recycled proceeds from the
first Tribal Bond issuance, and at least a portion of which Burnham Securities now held after
they had been contributed by Valor Group's subsidiary in May 2015. First, on September 30,
2015, Jason Galanis instructed Dunkerley to tell Burnham Financial Group's President to have
Burnham Financial Group wire $903,000 to the indenture trustee on behalf of WLCC. That
same day, in order to make that payment, Burnham Financial Group received the necessary funds
from a wholly-owned subsidiary of Valor Group in a transaction Archer coordinated. The next
day, RSB sent Burnham Financial Group an additional $1 ,098,000, a portion of which Burnham
Financial Group used to send an additional $294,311.11 interest payment to the indenture trustee.
In other words, Burnham Financial Group (through funds provided by Valor Group's subsidiary
and RSB) ended up paying for the interest on the Tribal Bonds that it controlled. But as with the
August 2014 Tribal Bonds, WAPCC failed to make the additional income payment ($250,000)
due to WLCC under the annuity contract.
114.

On October 8, 2015, WLCC sent Dunkerley a letter expressing concern regarding

information it had recently learned about Burnham Securities and the ongoing difficulty it was
experiencing in receiving funds due it under the Annuity contracts. In the letter, WLCC
requested that Dunkerley immediately provide valuations on all three annuity contracts.
115.

On October 15, 2015, at Jason Galanis's direction or with his knowledge,

Dunkerley responded to WLCC ' s letter and attached fabricated annual account statements on

34

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 35 of 43

WAPCC letterhead (reflecting an address in the BVI) for the annuity contracts purportedly
purchased in connection with the August 2014 and September 2014 Tribal Bonds. On
November 5, 2015, also at Jason Galanis 's direction or with his knowledge, Dunkerley provided
a similar fabricated annual account statement for the annuity contract purportedly purchased in
connection with the April 2015 Tribal Bonds. None of the statements contained any information
regarding the underlying investments and each indicated that the value of the accounts had not
changed one penny from the initial amount of money that had purportedly been invested in the
annuities.
116.

On February 17, 2016, after the Commission filed its complaint in SEC v. AAM,

Jason Galanis sent WLCC a letter to rebut the Commission's allegations and to assure WLCC of
the Tribal Bonds' validity and W APCC' s appropriate investment of the bonds' proceeds. In the
letter, Jason Galanis pointed to the timely payment of interest on the bonds as evidence of their
legitimacy, noting, "WLCC bond interest of over $2.72 million was already paid by these
distributions precisely as contemplated in the Indenture and related agreement," and false ly
stated: "These annuity distributions will continue from the assets owned in the annuities.
Therefore, the WLCC bonds will continue to be paid." Among other things, Jason Galanis
concealed the fact that the two interest payments had been funded by sources other than annuity
investments.
117.

More recently, and with an interest payment due date for the April 2015 bond

issuance fast approaching, Jason Galanis changed tacks. In an April 4, 2016 letter to WLCC,
Dunkerley, writing on behalf of W APCC, declared that WAPCC had suspended its interest
payments on the Tribal Bonds. In his letter, written at the direction or with the knowledge of
Jason Galanis, Dunkerley notified WLCC that W APCC would "withhold Annuity distribution

35

Case 1:16-cv-03505 Document 1 Filed 05/11/16 Page 36 of 43

payment to WLCC until such time as WLCC provides a satisfactory financial surety" to
indemnify WAPCC for the costs it and its "agents" incurred in defense of the Commission's
investigation, among other matters.

G. The Commission's Action Against AAM
118.

On December 15, 2015, the Commission filed an emergency action charging

AAM with investment adviser fraud for investing over $43 million in Tribal Bonds without
disclosing the conflicts of interest inherent in the transactions arising from the benefits the bond
sales generated for entities related to AAM' s parent company and financiers. The Commission
obtained a TRO appointing a monitor to oversee AAM, in order to protect AAM's clients from
further inappropriate investments.
119.

On January 8, 2016, based on concerns identified by the Court-appointed monitor,

the Commission obtained an order expanding the monitor's powers to that of a receiver. The
receiver is in the process of winding down the company. By consent of the receiver, the
Commission has obtained a bifurcated judgment as to liability against AAM.
