In the Matter of
DEVON C. MCLEAN

ORDER POSTPONING HEARING
AND SCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On March 1, 2016, Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondent pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934. A hearing is currently scheduled for March 29, 2016. On March 9, the Division of
Enforcement filed a motion to postpone the hearing and schedule a telephonic prehearing
conference for March 21.
The Division’s motion is GRANTED. I POSTPONE the hearing and ORDER that a
telephonic prehearing conference be held on March 21, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern. According to
the Division’s motion, Respondent is incarcerated at CI D. Ray James. The Division shall
coordinate with personnel at that facility to arrange for Respondent’s appearance at the conference.
During the conference, the parties shall address each numbered item in Rule of Practice 221(c), 17
C.F.R. § 201.221(c), and propose dates by which those items will be accomplished, where
applicable. Specifically, the parties should be prepared to discuss a procedural schedule that will
resolve this proceeding and whether summary disposition under Rule 250, 17 C.F.R. § 201.250, is
appropriate. The parties should also be prepared to discuss: (1) if this matter cannot be resolved by
summary disposition, a potential hearing location and how many days might be necessary to
complete the hearing; and (2) the status of Respondent’s efforts to obtain counsel.
The Division states in its motion that it has so far been unable to confirm service of the OIP
on Respondent. I therefore ORDER the Division to file a declaration providing an update on the
status of service by March 18, 2016. If such information is available to the Division, the declaration
should include the specific address at which delivery of the OIP was made, confirmation of
Respondent’s presence at that address, and any other information necessary to establish service
under Rule of Practice 141(a)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2).
The parties, when possible, shall email courtesy copies of any filings in this proceeding in
Microsoft Word and PDF text-searchable format to alj@sec.gov.
