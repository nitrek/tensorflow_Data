ORDER GRANTING RESPONDENTS’
AGREED MOTION FOR EXTENSION
OF TIME TO FILE EXPERT REPORTS

On March 18, 2016, Respondents sent this office an agreed motion for extension of time
to file expert reports. Respondents assert that they have diligently searched for qualified experts
to opine on the customer-priority allegations, but have only recently identified an expert due to
this being the first case brought under the customer-priority rule. Motion at 1. Respondents note
that this extension will not affect any other deadlines and that the Division of Enforcement has
no objection to this motion. Id. at 2.
For good cause shown, I GRANT Respondents’ motion and ORDER that expert reports
are due by March 28, 2016.
