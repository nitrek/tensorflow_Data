For Review of Disciplinary Action Taken by
FINRA

OPINION OF THE COMMISSION
REGISTERED SECURITIES ASSOCIATION — REVIEW OF DISCIPLINARY
PROCEEDINGS
Fraud
Conversion
Private Securities Transactions
Outside Business Activities
Former associated person of member firm appeals from FINRA disciplinary action
finding that he induced investors’ securities transactions through misrepresentations,
converted the investors’ funds to his own use, and engaged in private securities
transactions and outside business activities without providing written notice to his firm.
Held, association’s findings of violations and imposition of sanctions are sustained.
APPEARANCES:
Kenny Akindemowo, pro se.
Alan Lawhead, Michael Garawski, and Jennifer Brooks, for FINRA.
Appeal filed: January 29, 2016
Last brief received: May 17, 2016

2
Kenny Akindemowo, formerly associated with FINRA member firm Pruco Securities
LLC (“Pruco” or the “Firm”), seeks review of FINRA’s disciplinary action taken against him.
FINRA found that Akindemowo induced two investors to engage in securities transactions by
making misrepresentations and then converted the investors’ funds for his own use. Based on
these violations, FINRA imposed two separate bars from association with any FINRA member
firm, ordered Akindemowo to pay disgorgement and prejudgment interest, and assessed costs.
FINRA also found that Akindemowo engaged in private securities transactions and outside
business activities without providing the required disclosures to the Firm, but did not impose
sanctions for those violations.
Akindemowo, who is proceeding pro se, does not dispute that he received funds from the
investors and used those funds for his own purposes. Instead, he contends that he received the
funds as personal loans and that the misconduct at issue in this case has no bearing on his
activities in the securities industry. Based on our independent review of the record, we reject
Akindemowo’s contentions and sustain all of FINRA’s findings of violations and its imposition
of sanctions.
I.

Facts

Akindemowo entered the securities industry in 2000 and was associated with Pruco from
June 2010 to October 2011. During that time, Akindemowo was also registered as an insurance
agent for Pruco’s affiliate, The Prudential Insurance Company of America (“Prudential”). He
resigned from Pruco during its investigation of the misconduct at issue.
A.

Akindemowo represented to two investors that he would invest their funds but
instead he used their funds to pay personal expenses.

This case concerns Akindemowo’s recommendations to two investors, AG and RB,
regarding an investment in Apex Venture Capital Group (“Apex”). According to Akindemowo,
Apex’s business was to pool investor funds and use the funds to make loans to businesses. Apex
would use the proceeds from the loans to make quarterly interest payments to investors and
would keep the difference between the loan proceeds and the investor interest payments.
Akindemowo told investors that they could participate in this investment through his firm,
Goshen Wealth Management Group (“Goshen”). AG and RB transferred a total of $15,000 to
Goshen for this investment. It is undisputed that Akindemowo never provided Pruco with
written notice of these recommendations or his receipt and deposit of the investors’ funds into
Goshen’s account. Unbeknownst to the investors, Akindemowo never invested their funds and
instead used the money to pay personal expenses.
1.

Investor AG

Before meeting Akindemowo, AG’s investment experience was limited to a 401(k) plan
provided by her employer. She began dating Akindemowo in the summer of 2010, and
Akindemowo encouraged her to invest in Apex. He told her that Apex paid investors six percent
interest, and that invested funds could be deposited or withdrawn without fee or penalty each
quarter. AG checked Akindemowo’s LinkedIn page, which stated that he was Goshen’s owner
and chief investment officer. Later in 2010, Akindemowo encouraged AG to withdraw funds

3
from her 401(k) account to invest in Apex and told her that “December was [her] window of . . .
opportunity” to invest.
On December 6, 2010, AG withdrew $10,000 from her credit union account by a check
Akindemowo instructed her to make payable to Goshen. The funds were deposited into
Goshen’s account, and Akindemowo promised but never gave AG documentation of her
investment.
Akindemowo has given various explanations for how he used AG’s money—to pay pastdue property taxes, for Goshen’s lease and office furniture expenses, and for an ultimately
unsuccessful attempt to purchase a book of Allstate insurance business. In fact, he generally
used the Goshen account to pay property taxes and other home and personal expenses as well as
Goshen lease, furniture, and insurance-business expenses. But it is undisputed that Akindemowo
never invested AG’s money in Apex or made any investment on her behalf.
Soon after AG transferred her money to Goshen, Akindemowo and AG ended their
relationship and Akindemowo asked AG if she wanted her investment returned without interest.
AG declined because she wanted to wait until March 2011 to receive the Apex quarterly interest
payment that Akindemowo had described. AG also made repeated unsuccessful requests for
documentation of her investment. Eventually, AG texted Akindemowo that his failure to provide
documentation was “quite unprofessional” and she asked for “options . . . for having [her money]
returned.” Although AG persistently sought written documentation through February 2011,
Akindemowo evaded each request. Finally, in March 2011 AG began trying to set up meetings
with Akindemowo for him to return her investment. But Akindemowo repeatedly cancelled
these meetings.
After months of Akindemowo’s stalling, AG hired an attorney. The attorney sent a letter
to Akindemowo’s Prudential and Goshen addresses on April 13, 2011 seeking a return of AG’s
investment. The letter stated that AG “deposited $10,000 at your direction with Goshen Wealth
Management Group on December 6, 2010 for the purchase of an interest in Apex” and described
Akindemowo’s longstanding refusal to document or return her investment. When a Pruco officer
asked Akindemowo about the letter, he claimed AG was a former girlfriend who had loaned him
money to purchase a home and had sent the letter out of spite. He also claimed that he had set up
Goshen as an LLC before he started at Pruco to purchase and sell homes or cars, but that he was
no longer running this business and that Goshen was not active. Akindemowo never returned
AG’s money.
2.

Investor RB

RB first met Akindemowo in 2008 or 2009 while working as a real estate agent.
Akindemowo re-contacted RB in December 2010 about selling his house. Around this time, RB
asked Akindemowo for advice about investing funds she had received from her mother’s estate.
Akindemowo responded with two investment options: an IRA with Pruco with limited liquidity,
and a pooled investment that could be withdrawn on a regular basis and that would receive a
guaranteed investment return of 9 percent. Over several months, RB tried to determine whether
the pooled investment was “too good to be true.” RB was concerned that she could not find
information about Goshen or Akindemowo on the internet. Akindemowo pressed RB to make an

4
investment decision and tried to assuage her concerns by taking her to his Prudential office to
assure her of his affiliation with Pruco and Prudential.
On March 28, 2011, RB wrote a $5,000 check to Goshen.1 When Akindemowo
deposited the check in Goshen’s account, it had a balance of $115.33. Akindemowo used the
deposit for personal expenses, including a $3,300 mortgage-related payment.
As he had with AG, Akindemowo told RB that he would document her investment.
Despite RB’s repeated requests for the promised documentation, however, Akindemowo
consistently refused to comply. Akindemowo scheduled meetings with RB to provide the
documents, but then arrived without them. RB threatened to contact Akindemowo’s supervisor
at Prudential, but Akindemowo responded that “it wouldn’t make any difference” because “he
was an independent contractor and he can do whatever he wants.” Becoming increasingly
alarmed by Akindemowo’s evasion, RB e-mailed Akindemowo asking him to return her
investment. Akindemowo responded that she would need to wait 90 days.
As RB persisted, Akindemowo’s evasion escalated. In August 2011, Akindemowo gave
her a postdated check for $5,300, but told her to delay cashing it. After more than two weeks of
delays from Akindemowo, RB made two unsuccessful attempts to cash the check, first learning
that the account had insufficient funds and then that the check was facially invalid because it
showed two different payment amounts and did not include her last name.
When she learned that the check was invalid, RB concluded that Akindemowo had
defrauded her, contacted the police, and called Pruco—eventually speaking with Akindemowo’s
supervisor. When she mentioned that the investment involved Goshen, the supervisor referred
the complaint for an internal investigation. Hours later, Akindemowo called RB to accuse her of
“ruin[ing] his livelihood.” He contacted her again after several weeks to promise her “$5,000 if
[she] would make this go away” by “writ[ing] a letter saying that [she] lied.”
Akindemowo resigned in September 2011, while Pruco was investigating AG’s and RB’s
complaints. On October 5, 2011 Pruco reported his resignation and those complaints to FINRA,
which began the investigation leading to this disciplinary proceeding. After Akindemowo
resigned, Pruco repaid both AG and RB with interest.
B.

Akindemowo did not provide Pruco with written notice of his Allstate insurance
business.

Less than three months after joining Pruco, Akindemowo filed articles of incorporation to
register Goshen as a Minnesota LLC to operate as an Allstate insurance agency. Allstate
authorized him to sell Allstate insurance products on September 14, 2010.
Akindemowo did not provide Pruco with written notice of his Allstate insurance
business. A month after joining Pruco, he completed a Form U4 indicating that he was not
1

RB also wrote a $5,000 check to open a Pruco IRA, but Pruco rejected her IRA
application.

5
engaged in any outside business activities, and he attested each month that no additional
activities needed to be disclosed on the Form U4. But in January 2011, after Akindemowo
expressed interest in selling property casualty insurance through a Prudential-affiliated company,
Pruco searched the insurance agent database and discovered his appointment with Allstate.
When a Pruco supervisor told him that his Allstate appointment was impermissible,
Akindemowo assured the supervisor that he would cancel it. He did not do so until March 2011.
C.

FINRA found that Akindemowo committed fraud, converted investor funds, and
failed to provide Pruco with written notice that he was engaging in private securities
transactions and outside business activities.

FINRA’s Department of Enforcement (“Enforcement”) filed a four-cause complaint
alleging that Akindemowo made fraudulent misrepresentations in violation of FINRA Rules
2020 and 2010; converted investor funds in violation of FINRA Rule 2010; failed to provide
Pruco with written notice of private securities transactions in violation of NASD Rule 3040 and
FINRA Rule 2010; and failed to provide Pruco with written notice of outside business activities
in violation of FINRA Rule 3270, its predecessor NASD Rule 3030, and FINRA Rule 2010.
At the hearing, both AG and RB denied that they loaned Akindemowo their funds for his
personal use. AG and RB did not meet before the hearing, but they gave similar testimony about
Akindemowo’s description of the alleged investment, his sales methods, and his evasion of their
repeated requests for documentation and remittance of their money after they had transferred
their funds into Goshen. Documentary evidence corroborated their testimony.
On April 29, 2014, a FINRA Hearing Panel found Akindemowo liable for each of the
charged violations. It found that Akindemowo “exploited the trust of women with whom he had
personal relationships,” “misrepresented that their funds would be invested,” and then
intentionally “converted their funds to his own use.” The Hearing Panel rejected Akindemowo’s
characterization of the transactions, concluded that he acted with scienter when he
misrepresented how the investors’ funds would be used, and “provided a false account of the
facts to his employer, FINRA Staff, and the Hearing Panel.” Based on its findings that
Akindemowo engaged in fraud and conversion, the Hearing Panel imposed two separate bars
from association with a FINRA member firm and assessed hearing costs. The Hearing Panel
also found that Akindemowo failed to provide written notice to Pruco before engaging in private
securities transactions and outside business activities, but declined to assess additional sanctions
for those violations.
Akindemowo appealed to FINRA’s National Adjudicatory Counsel (the “NAC”), which
issued a December 29, 2015 decision affirming the Hearing Panel’s findings. The NAC
concluded that the evidence showed a deliberate intent to defraud the investors. The NAC found
that Akindemowo’s explanations were “riddled with discrepancies” and that AG and RB each
independently provided similar accounts of Akindemowo’s investment pitch, his evasion of their
requests for documentation, and his refusal to return their funds. It affirmed the separate bars for
fraud and conversion and the assessment of hearing costs, ordered Akindemowo to disgorge
$15,000, along with prejudgment interest, and ordered him to pay appeal costs. Like the Hearing
Panel, the NAC declined to impose sanctions for the private securities transaction and outside
business activity violations. This appeal followed.

II.

Analysis

We consider applications for review of self-regulatory organization (“SRO”) disciplinary
actions under Section 19(e)(1) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We determine whether
the applicant engaged in the conduct found by the SRO, whether such conduct violates the
SRO’s rules, and whether such SRO rules are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with the
purposes of the Exchange Act. 2 We base our findings on an independent review of the record.
A.

Akindemowo induced the purchase of a security by means of fraudulent
misrepresentations in violation of FINRA Rule 2020 and Rule 2010.

FINRA Rule 2020 prohibits members and associated persons from “effect[ing] any
transaction in, or induc[ing] the purchase or sale of, any security by means of any manipulative,
deceptive or other fraudulent device or contrivance.” FINRA found that Akindemowo, acting
with scienter, induced AG and RB to remit funds for the purchase of securities by means of “a
manipulative, deceptive or fraudulent device or contrivance, namely the false statements” about
how their funds would be invested. We find that a preponderance of the evidence supports these
findings and FINRA’s conclusion that Akindemowo violated FINRA Rules 2020 and 2010.3
1.

The investment Akindemowo recommended was a security.

We affirm FINRA’s findings that that the Apex investment was a security. Section
2(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933 states that the “term ‘security’ means,” among other things,
an “investment contract,”4 which includes a “contract, transaction or scheme whereby a person
invests his or her money in a common enterprise and is led to expect profits solely from the
efforts of the promoter or a third party.”5 The Apex investment that Akindemowo recommended
satisfied each of these elements. As Akindemowo described it, Apex would pool AG’s and RB’s
funds with those of other investors in a common enterprise in which profits would be generated
solely by the efforts of a third party who would place loans, collect interest payments, and pay

2

15 U.S.C. § 78s(e)(1).

3

FINRA Rule 2010 requires FINRA members and associated persons to “observe high
standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.” It is well established
that a violation of an SRO rule is conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade
and therefore is also a violation of FINRA Rule 2010. See, e.g., North Woodward Financial
Corporation, Exchange Act Release No. 74913, 2015 WL 2151765, at *15 n.8 (May 8, 2015).

7
the investors a specified rate of return from the loan proceeds. These investments were
investment contracts, and therefore securities.6
Akindemowo denies that the transactions with AG and RB “involve[d] securities.” He is
incorrect. As FINRA explained, an investment is deemed a security based on “how it was
presented to the investors,” and not the subjective belief of the respondent.7 To the extent
Akindemowo means that AG’s and RB’s transfers were loans and not intended for investment in
Apex, the record belies that contention. AG and RB both testified that their transfers to Goshen
were not personal loans to Akindemowo, and the Hearing Panel found their testimony credible.
We generally defer to such credibility determinations, unless substantial evidence supports a
contrary finding.8 Here, the record amply supports the Panel’s determination that AG and RB
were telling the truth. They testified unequivocally and similarly about Akindemowo’s
description of a pooled investment paying fixed quarterly interest and allowing regular
withdrawals. And both investors testified that Akindemowo never told them that he needed a
loan before they transferred their funds.
2.

Akindemowo’s material misrepresentations induced the investments.

We also find that Akindemowo’s misstatements about how AG’s and RB’s funds would
be invested operated as a “fraudulent device or contrivance” to induce their investments.
Akindemowo told AG and RB that their funds would be pooled with the investments of others,
that they would receive fixed quarterly interest payments and would be able to redeem their
funds, and that they would receive documentation of their investments. Each of these statements
was false. They were also material because a reasonable investor would want to know how their
funds were actually being used.9 And we agree with FINRA that these falsehoods were the
means by which Akindemowo induced AG and RB to transfer their money.
6

See, e.g., SEC v. Banner Fund Int’l, 211 F.3d 602, 615 (D.C. Cir 2000) (holding that an
investment that pooled investors funds for loans was a security); SEC v. Lauer, 52 F.3d 667, 670
(7th Cir. 1995) (finding that “it is the representations made by the promoters, not their actual
conduct, that determine whether an interest is an investment contract (or other security)” and that
therefore a fictitious investment was an “investment contract” because, “as it was represented to
[the investor],” it was supposed to be an undivided passive financial interest in a pool of assets).
7

See Howey, 328 U.S. at 299 (defining securities based on what the investors were “led to
expect”); Warfield v. Alaniz, 569 F.3d 1015, 1021 (9th Cir. 2015) (noting that “[u]nder Howey,
courts conduct an objective inquiry into the character of the instrument or transaction offered”).
8

(Mar. 31, 2016) (explaining that credibility determinations “based on hearing the witness’s
testimony and observing demeanor . . . are entitled to considerable deference”).
9

See SEC v. Smart, 678 F.3d 850, 857 (10th Cir. 2012) (“[I]t would be material to a
reasonable investor that his or her money was not being used as represented in safe investment
strategies, but rather, in high risk ventures and for the payment of personal expenses.”).

8
We also agree with FINRA that “[t]he fact that Akindemowo [ultimately] failed to
actually buy or sell securities” with the money they transferred does not preclude his liability.10
AG and RB intended to “become actual purchasers” of the securities based on Akindemowo’s
falsehoods, and his fraud “was directly connected” with those false statements.11
Akindemowo acted with scienter when he used these fraudulent statements to induce
AG’s and RB’s transfers. Scienter is “a mental state embracing intent to deceive, manipulate, or
defraud.”12 Scienter includes recklessness, which is defined as conduct that is “an extreme
departure from the standards of ordinary care . . . to the extent that the danger [of deceiving
investors] was either known to the [applicant] or so obvious that the [applicant] must have been
aware of it.”13 Akindemowo’s use of AG’s and RB’s funds was so obviously contrary to the
Apex investment that he described that he must have known he was deceiving them. His efforts
to “misle[ad] AG and RB about the status of” their funds is also evidence of scienter. 14
Accordingly, we find that Akindemowo, with scienter, induced investments in securities
by means of material false statements that were manipulative, deceptive or fraudulent devices or
contrivances and that he thereby violated FINRA Rules 2020 and 2010. We also find that these
rules are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act. Rule
10

See, e.g., SEC v. George, 426 F.3d 786, 789 (6th Cir. 2005) (finding fraud under the
securities laws when investors’ funds for securities transactions were instead used “to pay
purported profits to other investors or to make extravagant personal purchases”).

containing material misstatements that induced the investor to invest); Joseph Abbondate,

information . . . provided to investors, and the flagrant personal use of investor funds”); see also

that a person’s “concealment of his conversion further demonstrates that he acted intentionally”).

9
2020 was designed to prevent fraud and manipulation in the industry,15 and the application of the
rule to Akindemowo’s conduct furthered this objective. 16
B.

Akindemowo converted investor funds in violation of FINRA Rule 2010.

FINRA Rule 2010 requires FINRA members and associated persons to “observe high
standards of commercial honor and just and equitable principles of trade.” The rule is designed
to “regulate the ethical standards” of FINRA members and associated persons,17 and applies to
“business-related conduct that is inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.”18
FINRA defines conversion as the “intentional and unauthorized taking of and/or exercise of
ownership over property by one who neither owns the property nor is entitled to possess it.”19
Because conversion casts doubt on a person’s “ability to comply with the regulatory
requirements of the securities business and to fulfill his fiduciary duties in handling other
people’s money,”20 it is well established that conversion is contrary to the mandate of Rule
2010.21
We agree with FINRA that Akindemowo’s use of AG’s and RB’s funds meets each
element of its definition of conversion. Akindemowo represented that he would invest AG’s and
RB’s money in Apex and AG and RB transferred their funds to him for this purpose. But
Akindemowo did not invest AG’s and RB’s money as they wished. Instead, he used it for his
personal expenses.

16

Rule 2010 is designed to prevent conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles
of trade. As discussed above, the violation of an SRO rule is conduct inconsistent with just and
equitable principles of trade. The application of Rule 2010 to Akindemowo’s conduct furthered
the objective of preventing conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.

10
Akindemowo contends that FINRA’s rules should not apply because the transactions
were purportedly private and personal matters not involving Pruco customers or securities. 22 But
we have long held that Rule 2010 applies to business-related conduct that is inconsistent with
just and equitable principles of trade, and neither Rule 2010 nor FINRA’s definition of
conversion is limited to misconduct involving firm customers or securities. 23 In any case, we
have already found that the transactions involved securities.
Accordingly, we find that Akindemowo’s conversion of investor funds was “patently
antithetical” to just and equitable principles of trade and violated Rule 2010.24 We also find that
FINRA Rule 2010 is, and was applied in a manner, consistent with the purposes of the Exchange
Act. Rule 2010 was designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade, and the
application of the rule to Akindemowo’s conversion is consistent with that objective. 25
C.

Akindemowo engaged in private securities transactions without providing Pruco
with prior written notice in violation of NASD Rule 3040 and FINRA Rule 2010.

NASD Rule 3040 prohibits an associated person from participating in any manner in
“any securities transaction outside the regular course or scope of an associated person’s
employment with a member” without prior written notice to his or her member firm.26 FINRA
found that Akindemowo violated NASD Rule 3040 and FINRA Rule 2010 by participating in the
transactions with AG and RB without prior written notice to Pruco. We agree.

22

Akindemowo asserts that he was not associated with Pruco “during [his] interactions”
and “personal dealings” with AG, but he was associated with Pruco during the investmentrelated dealings that establish his violation of Rule 2010. He was associated with Pruco in
December 2010, when AG transferred her funds to Goshen, through April 2011, when his
longstanding evasion prompted AG to send a letter documenting his misconduct.

was “unethical business-related conduct”); Vail, 101 F.3d at 39 (finding that misappropriation of
funds from a political organization was subject to the SRO rule requiring just and equitable
principles of trade).

flexibly to a “wide variety of conduct that may operate as an injustice to investors or other
participants in the marketplace.”).
26

NASD Rule 3040(3)(1) and (b).

11
It is undisputed that Akindemowo did not provide prior written notice of his transactions
with the investors, and that those transactions were outside of the scope of his employment with
Pruco. And Akindemowo participated in the private securities transactions by introducing and
recommending the pooled investment to investors, directing the investors to send their funds to a
Goshen account he controlled, and using those funds for his own purposes. “Participating in any
manner” in private securities transactions includes soliciting investors by providing information
that may influence their investment decisions and facilitating the execution of transactions. 27
Akindemowo contends that Rule 3040 does not apply because “no securities transactions
were involved.” We have already rejected that argument. And Rule 3040 applies even if the
representative does not believe that the investment is a security.28 Akindemowo also argues that
he “was not associated with a FINRA member during [his] interactions with” AG. Akindemowo
was, in fact, associated with Pruco when he recommended the pooled investment to her,
described December 2010 as her window of opportunity to invest, instructed her to transfer funds
to Goshen, and controlled and used these funds in the Goshen account. We therefore sustain
FINRA’s finding that Akindemowo participated in undisclosed private securities transactions in
violation of NASD Rule 3040 and FINRA Rule 2010.
We also find that these rules are, and were applied in a manner, consistent with the
purposes of Exchange Act. Rule 3040 was designed, among other things, to protect investors
and the public interest. Akindemowo’s violation of the rule prevented Pruco from monitoring
his activities for compliance with regulatory requirements, from disapproving of his activities,
and from intervening before AG and RB remitted or Akindemowo used their funds.
D.

Akindemowo engaged in outside business activities without providing written notice
to Pruco in violation of FINRA Rule 3270, NASD Rule 3030, and FINRA Rule 2010.

FINRA Rule 3270 prohibits associated persons from “be[ing] an employee, independent
contractor, sole proprietor, officer, director or partner of another person, or be[ing] compensated,
or hav[ing] the reasonable expectation of compensation, from any other person as a result of
any” outside business activity, unless he or she has provided prior written notice to his or her
member firm. FINRA Rule 3270 superseded NASD Rule 3030 on December 15, 2010.29 Rule
3030 prohibited any associated person from being “employed by, or accept[ing] compensation
from, any other person as a result of any business activity . . . outside the scope of his
relationship with his employer firm, unless he has provided prompt written notice.” FINRA
found that Akindemowo violated Rules 3270, 3030, and 2010 by failing to provide Pruco with

supervisor told him that the product was not a security).

12
written notice of the business he conducted through Goshen and his efforts to establish an
Allstate insurance business. We agree.
During his association with Pruco, Akindemowo operated an outside business as
Goshen’s owner and chief investment officer and thereby acted as a Goshen officer or director
under Rule 3270 and was employed by Goshen within the meaning of Rule 3030. Akindemowo
also registered Goshen to operate as a Minnesota LLC in September 2010 for his Allstate
business and secured an appointment from Allstate to sell insurance as its agent.30 There is no
dispute that Akindemowo’s Goshen and Allstate business activities were outside of the scope of
his relationship with Pruco, and that he did not disclose these business activities to Pruco in
writing. Although Akindemowo asserts that he updated his Form U4 with any “new
information” required to be disclosed, he did not. In July 2010 and March 2011, Akindemowo
completed Forms U4 indicating that he was not “engaged in any other business either as a
proprietor, partner, officer, director, employee, trustee, agent or otherwise.” He also attested to
Pruco on a monthly basis that there was no need to report any such activities.
Akindemowo attempts to blame his supervisors for failing to require him to report
Goshen or Allstate activities. But even assuming that his supervisors knew about his outside
business activities, the obligation to disclose lies with the registered person, not his supervisors.31
We therefore sustain FINRA’s finding that Akindemowo’s failure to provide written
notice of his outside business activities violated FINRA Rule 3270, NASD Rule 3030, and
FINRA Rule 2010. We also find that these rules are, and were applied in a manner, consistent
with the purposes of the Exchange Act. Rule 3270 and Rule 3030 were designed, among other
things, to protect investors and the public interest. The written disclosure requirement allows
member firms to assess the risks of outside business activities of associated persons and raise
timely objections to such activities. Akindemowo’s failure to provide the written notice required
by the rule frustrated Pruco’s ability to assess the risks that his outside business activities may
cause harm to potential investors and to manage those risks by taking appropriate action.
E.

Akindemowo’s challenges to FINRA’s proceeding lack merit.

Akindemowo claims that it was improper for FINRA to initiate this proceeding after he
resigned from Pruco. But FINRA’s By-Laws provide that a person continues to be subject to the
filing of a complaint based on conduct that occurred prior to his resignation for two years after

30

Cf. Micah C. Douglas, Exchange Act Release No. 37865, 1996 WL 616364 (Oct. 25,
1996) (finding that associated person who registered his own broker-dealer with a state regulator
engaged in undisclosed “outside business activity” that violated just and equitable principles of
trade).

Vastano, 2004 WL 185139, at *5.

13
the effective date of his resignation. 32 The complaint was timely because it was filed in February
2013, within two years of Akindemowo’s resignation in October 2011.
Akindemowo also argues that Pruco cleared him of wrongdoing and only disclosed its
investigation as retaliation for his planned association with another firm. But Pruco was
continuing to investigate AG’s and RB’s claims when Akindemowo resigned, and it was
obligated to disclose its investigation when reporting his resignation.33 In any case, FINRA
initiated this proceeding based on its own investigation of Akindemowo’s misconduct.
Akindemowo also contends that FINRA’s proceeding was unfair. According to
Akindemowo, it was unfair for FINRA to act as “the judge, the prosecutor and the jury.” But
the Commission has approved FINRA rules ensuring separation of functions in FINRA
disciplinary proceedings, and there is no evidence that those rules were not followed here.34
There is also no evidence supporting Akindemowo’s claims that FINRA and Pruco offered to
pay AG and RB for their testimony, that he was not allowed to call any witnesses, and that
FINRA manipulated his testimony. And the record establishes that Akindemowo did not meet
the deadline for calling witnesses and was given ample leeway to testify and cross-examine the
investors and supervisors who testified. Akindemowo also complains that the Hearing Panel
simply adopted the sanction Enforcement recommended.35 We find no evidence of improper
influence by Enforcement staff.36

Akindemowo asserts that the Hearing Panel was not diverse, but he has not offered
evidence that he was unfairly singled out for prosecution or that his prosecution was motivated
by improper considerations such as race, religion, or the desire to prevent the exercise of a
constitutionally protected right. United States v. Huff, 959 F.2d 731, 735 (8th Cir. 1992). He
also had an opportunity to object to the hearing panel members under FINRA rules but did not
do so. See Rule 9233(b) (motions to disqualify). And there is no evidence that the composition
of the panel prejudiced its decision or that it failed to act “fairly and objectively.” Stephen
Thorlief Rangen, Exchange Act Release No. 38486, 1997 WL 163991 (Apr. 8, 1997).

III.

Sanctions

Pursuant to Exchange Act Section 19(e)(2), we will sustain a FINRA sanction unless we
find it is “excessive or oppressive” or imposes an unnecessary or inappropriate burden on
competition.37 As part of this review, we consider any aggravating or mitigating factors,38 and
whether the sanctions imposed by FINRA are remedial and not punitive. 39
A.

The bars FINRA imposed on Akindemowo are neither excessive nor oppressive .

FINRA’s Sanction Guidelines recommend consideration of a bar for egregious cases
involving an associated person who engages in intentional or reckless misrepresentations of
fact.40 And we have repeatedly held that fraud violations are “‘especially serious and should be
subject to the severest of sanctions under the securities laws.’”41 We agree with FINRA that the
egregiousness of Akindemowo’s fraud warrants a bar. Akindemowo acted with scienter and
exploited the trust of persons with whom he had personal relationships.42 He deprived investors
of their funds for his own gain. 43 He repeatedly evaded requests for documentation or remittance
and continued his deceit during Pruco’s and FINRA’s investigations.44 Like FINRA, we note
37

15 U.S.C. § 78s(e)(2). Akindemowo does not claim, and the record does not show, that
FINRA’s action imposed an unnecessary or inappropriate burden on competition.

appropriate additional “case-specific factors.” Guidelines at 6-7.

15
that Akindemowo has consistently given a “false account of the facts,” attempted to shift blame
to the investors and Pruco, and failed to recognize the seriousness of his misconduct and the
harm it caused. The bar FINRA imposed for Akindemowo’s fraudulent statements is neither
excessive nor oppressive.
FINRA’s Sanction Guidelines state that “a bar is standard” for conversion “regardless of
[the] amount converted.”45 This guideline reflects FINRA’s judgment that conversion “poses so
substantial a risk to investors and/or the markets as to render the violator unfit for” industry
association46 because investors and firms must be able to trust associated persons with their
money.47 We agree with FINRA that Akindemowo’s conversion demonstrates a disregard for a
fundamental responsibility of all securities professionals—ethically handling the funds of others.
As we have recently held, “one who, regardless of motivation, intentionally misappropriates
money from others on more than one occasion, may do so again” and “would pose a continuing
and unacceptable threat to investors and other industry participants if not barred.”48 The bar
FINRA imposed for Akindemowo’s conversion is neither excessive nor oppressive.
There are no mitigating circumstances. Akindemowo asserts that the sanctions are “too
extreme and unwarranted,” citing his history of awards at other firms and the purported absence
of other “direct client complaints.” But it is well established that a lack of disciplinary history is
not mitigating.49 Akindemowo also argues that the sanctions should not affect his industry
association because the transactions were “private matters” that were unrelated to securities, his
firm affiliation, or his registration. These assertions are meritless. Akindemowo defrauded
investors with false statements about securities and pocketed funds entrusted to him—this
conduct demonstrates a fundamental unfitness for association in the securities industry.

B.

The disgorgement FINRA ordered is neither excessive nor oppressive.

The Guidelines state that disgorgement of ill-gotten gain may be an appropriate remedy
for misconduct that resulted in a direct or indirect financial benefit to the respondent.50 FINRA’s
order that Akindemowo disgorge the $15,000 that he fraudulently obtained (plus prejudgment
interest)51 serves the remedial purpose of depriving him of his ill-gotten gains.52
Accordingly, we conclude that barring Akindemowo from the securities industry and
ordering disgorgement is neither excessive nor oppressive and is necessary to protect investors.
An appropriate order will issue. 53
