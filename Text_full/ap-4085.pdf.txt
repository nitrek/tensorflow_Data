ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17157

In the Matter of
STEVEN ZOERNACK AND
EQUITYSTAR CAPITAL MANAGEMENT, LLC

STAY ORDER

On March 8, 2016, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) against Respondents. The hearing is scheduled to begin October 3, 2016.
On August 19, 2016, the U.S. Attorney for the Middle District of Florida filed an
application to intervene and motion to stay this proceeding pending a criminal investigation and
expected prosecution of Respondents, arising out of the same or similar allegations that form the
basis of the OIP. Neither the Division of Enforcement nor Respondents object to a stay.
I agree with the U.S. Attorney’s position that a stay of this proceeding is in the public
interest; a stay would avoid prejudicing the pending criminal investigation and expected
prosecution, and the existence of the unresolved criminal matter could impair the effective
presentation of evidence in this administrative proceeding.
Accordingly, the U.S. Attorney’s application to intervene is GRANTED and this
proceeding is STAYED, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.210(c)(3). A telephonic prehearing
conference will be held on December 21, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. Eastern to assess whether the stay
should continue. If, however, the U.S. Attorney files a status report by December 15, 2016,
providing sufficient reasons why the stay should continue, the telephonic prehearing conference
will be canceled.
