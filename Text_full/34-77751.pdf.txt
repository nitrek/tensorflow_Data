In the Matter of the Claim for Award
in connection with
In the Matter of JPMorgan Chase & Co.
Sec. Exchange Rel. No. 70458 (Sept. 19, 2013)
Notice of Covered Action 2013-92

ORDER DETERMINING WHISTLEBLOWER AWARD CLAIM
On July 13, 2015, the Claims Review Staff (“CRS”) issued a Preliminary Determination
related to Notice of Covered Action 2013-92. The Preliminary Determination recommended that
Claimant 2
Claimant 1
the award applications submitted by
(“Claimant 1”) and
(“Claimant 2”) (Claimant 1 and Claimant 2 are together referred to as the “Claimants”) be
denied.1
For the reasons stated below, the claims of the Claimants are denied.
I.

Background

On September 19, 2013, the Commission entered into a settled administrative order (the
“Covered Action”) with JPMorgan Chase & Co. (“JPMorgan Chase”). In its order, the
Commission found that JPMorgan Chase failed to report the full extent of the trading losses that
had occurred during the first quarter of 2012 because of the ineffectiveness of its internal control
function and inadequate communication between JPMorgan Chase’s senior management and the
audit committee of its Board of Directors. Among other sanctions, JPMorgan Chase was ordered
to pay a civil money penalty to the Commission of $200 million.

Claimant 3
Claimant 4
The Preliminary Determination also denied an award to
(“Claimant 3”),
Claimant 5
(“Claimant 4”),
(“Claimant 5”), Claimant 6 (“Claimant 6”),
(“Claimant 7”),
Claimant 7
(“Claimant 8”),
(“Claimant 9”),
(“Claimant 10”), Claimant 11
Claimant 10
Claimant 9
Claimant 8
(“Claimant 11”) and
(“Claimant 12”). Those determinations have not been contested.
Claimant 12
Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 21F-10(f) under the Exchange Act, Claimants 3-12 have failed to exhaust
administrative remedies and the determination to deny an award to them has become final.

On October 22, 2013, the Office of the Whistleblower (“OWB”) posted Notice of
Covered Action 2013-92 for the Covered Action. The Claimants filed timely whistleblower
award claims. Both Claimants thereupon submitted timely award applications on Form WBAPP with supporting materials detailing the information they had provided the Commission.
II.

Claimants’ Claims Are Denied
A. Preliminary Determination and Claimants’ Responses

On July 13, 2015, the CRS preliminarily determined to deny both Claimants’ award
applications because it concluded that neither of them had provided any information that led to
the successful enforcement of the Covered Action. See Section 21F(b)(1) of the Exchange Act,
and Rule 21F-3(a) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-3(a).
Claimants 1 and 2 submitted written responses contesting the Preliminary Determination
on August 10, 2015 and October 26, 2015, respectively. In their written responses, the
Claimants reiterate the information they had provided to the Commission and assert that it
significantly contributed to the success of the enforcement action. Neither of them states that
they heard from Commission’s investigative staff following the submission of their information
nor do they mention any communications they received from the staff.
B. Analysis
To qualify for an award under Section 21F of the Exchange Act, a whistleblower must
voluntarily provide the Commission with original information that leads to the successful
enforcement of a covered judicial or administrative action or related action. 15 U.S.C. § 78u6(b)(1). As relevant here, original information “leads to” a successful enforcement action if
either: (i) the original information caused the staff to open an investigation, reopen an
investigation, or inquire into different conduct as part of a current investigation, and the
Commission brought a successful action based in whole or in part on conduct that was the
subject of the original information; or (ii) the conduct was already under examination or
investigation, and the original information significantly contributed to the success of the action.
Rule 21F-4(c)(1)-(2), 17 C.F.R. § 240.21F-4(c)(1)-(2).
We find that none of the information Claimants submitted led to the successful
enforcement of the Covered Action. First, the tips identified by the Claimants in their award
applications were not provided to investigative staff for further inquiry or for use in connection
with any investigation; instead, each of the Claimants’ tips was designated for “no further
action.” Second, at no point prior to the settlement of the Covered Action did the staff members
responsible for the Covered Action have any contact with, or receive any information from, the
Claimants.
Because the record demonstrates that the Claimants’ information did not lead to the
successful enforcement of the Covered Action and they have not shown otherwise in their
requests for reconsideration of the Preliminary Determination, we deny Claimants’ applications
for an award.

Conclusion

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the whistleblower award claims of Claimant 1 and 2
are denied.

By the Commission.
