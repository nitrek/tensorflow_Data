SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: The Regulatory Flexibility Act ("RFA"), codified at 5
U.S.C. 600-611, requires an agency to review its rules that have a significant economic impact
upon a substantial number of small entities within ten years of the publication of such rules as
final rules. 5 U.S.C. 610(a). The purpose of the review is "to determine whether such rules
should be continued without change, or should be amended or rescinded . . . to minimize any
significant economic impact of the rules upon a substantial number of such small entities." 5
U.S.C. 610(a). The RFA sets forth specific considerations that must be addressed in the review
of each rule:
•

the continued need for the rule;

•

the nature of complaints or comments received concerning the rule from the public;

•

the complexity of the rule;

2

•

the extent to which the rule overlaps, duplicates or conflicts with other federal rules, and,

to the extent feasible, with state and local governmental rules; and
•

the length of time since the rule has been evaluated or the degree to which technology,

economic conditions, or other factors have changed in the area affected by the rule. 5 U.S.C.
610(c).
The Securities and Exchange Commission, as a matter of policy, reviews all final rules
that it published for notice and comment to assess not only their continued compliance with the
RFA, but also to assess generally their continued utility. When the Commission implemented the
Act in 1980, it stated that it “intend[ed] to conduct a broader review [than that required by the
RFA], with a view to identifying those rules in need of modification or even rescission.”
Securities Act Release No. 6302 (Mar. 20, 1981), 46 FR 19251 (Mar. 30, 1981). The list below
is therefore broader than that required by the RFA, and may include rules that do not have a
significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. Where the Commission
has previously made a determination of a rule's impact on small businesses, the determination is
noted on the list.
The Commission particularly solicits public comment on whether the rules listed below
affect small businesses in new or different ways than when they were first adopted. The rules and
forms listed below are scheduled for review by staff of the Commission during the next 12
months. The list includes 11 rules adopted by the Commission in 2005.

Authority:

15 U.S.C. 80a-6(c), 80a-11(a), 80a-22(c) and 80a-37(a)

Description:

The Commission adopted a new rule that allows registered open-end
investment companies (“funds”) to impose a redemption fee, not to exceed
two percent of the amount redeemed, to be retained by the fund. The
redemption fee is intended to allow funds to recoup some of the direct and
indirect costs incurred as a result of short-term trading strategies, such as
market timing. The new rule also requires most funds to enter into written
agreements with intermediaries (such as broker-dealers and retirement
plan administrators) that hold shares on behalf of other investors, under
which the intermediaries must agree to provide funds with certain
shareholder identity and transaction information at the request of the fund
and carry out certain instructions from the fund.

foreign private issuers for their first year of reporting under IFRS to file
two years rather than three years of statements of income, changes in
shareholders' equity and cash flows prepared in accordance with IFRS,
with appropriate related disclosure. In addition, the Commission amended

thereunder, 17 CFR 240.11Aa3-2(b)(2) and 17 CFR 240.11Aa3-2(c)(1).

Description:

The Commission adopted rules under Regulation NMS and two
amendments to the joint industry plans for disseminating market
information. The new rules were designed to modernize and strengthen
the regulatory structure of the U.S. equity markets. The “Order Protection
Rule” requires trading centers to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent the execution of
trades at prices inferior to protected quotations displayed by other trading
centers, subject to an applicable exception. The “Access Rule” requires
fair and non-discriminatory access to quotations, establishes a limit on
access fees to harmonize the pricing of quotations across different trading
centers, and requires each national securities exchange and national
securities association to adopt, maintain, and enforce written rules that
prohibit their members from engaging in a pattern or practice of
displaying quotations that lock or cross automated quotations. The “Sub6

Penny Rule” prohibits market participants from accepting, ranking, or
displaying orders, quotations, or indications of interest in a pricing
increment smaller than a penny, except for orders, quotations, or
indications of interest that are priced at less than $1.00 per share. The
Commission also adopted amendments to the “Market Data Rules” that
updated the requirements for consolidating, distributing, and displaying
market information, as well as amendments to the joint industry plans for
disseminating market information that modified the formulas for
allocating plan revenues (the “Allocation Amendment”) and broadened
participation in plan governance (the “Governance Amendment”).
Finally, the Commission redesignated the national market system rules
previously adopted under Section 11A of the Exchange Act.
Prior Commission
Determination
Under
5 U.S.C. 610:

With respect to the Order Protection Rule, pursuant to Section 605(b) of
the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission certified that the rule
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities. This certification was incorporated into the reproposing
release.1 As stated in Release No. 34-51808 (June 9, 2005) (adopting
release), the Commission received no comments concerning the impact on
small entities or the Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification. With respect
to the Access Rule (Rule 610 and the amendments to Rule 301 of
Regulation ATS), pursuant to Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility
Act, the Commission certified that the rule would not have a significant
economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. This
certification was incorporated into the reproposing release. As stated in
the adopting release, the Commission considered one comment it received
regarding the certification in the reproposing release with respect to the
Access Rule at that time. With respect to the Sub-Penny Rule, a Final
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C.
604 in conjunction with the adopting release. As stated in the adopting
release, the Commission received no comments addressing the Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis prepared in the proposing release or the
substantially identical one set forth in the reproposing release. With
respect to the Allocation Amendment, pursuant to Section 605(b) of the
Regulatory Flexibility Act, the Commission certified that the rule would
not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small
entities. This certification was incorporated into the reproposing release.

As stated in the adopting release, the Commission received no comments
concerning the impact on small entities or the Regulatory Flexibility Act
Certification. Finally, with respect to the Governance Amendment
(amending Exchange Act Rules 11Aa3-1 and 11Ac-12 by redesignating
them as Rules 601 and 603), a Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis was
prepared in accordance with 5 U.S.C. 604 in conjunction with the
Adopting Release. As stated in the adopting release, the Commission
received no comments addressing the Initial Regulatory Flexibility
Analysis prepared in the proposing release or the substantially identical

Under
5 U.S.C. 601:

The Commission adopted amendments to its rules and Form 25 to
streamline the procedures for removing from listing, and withdrawing
from registration, securities under Section 12(b) of the Exchange Act. The
final rules require all issuers and national securities exchanges seeking to
delist and/or deregister a security in accordance with the rules of an
exchange and the Commission to file the amended Form 25 in an
electronic format with the Commission on the EDGAR database. The
final rules also provide that Form 25 serves as an exchange’s notice to the
Commission under Section 19(d) of the Exchange Act. Finally, the final
rules exempt, on a permanent basis, standardized options and security
futures products traded on a national securities exchange from Section
12(d) of the Exchange Act.

Pursuant to Section 605(b) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act, the
Commission certified that amending Rule 12d2-2 and Rule 25 would not
have a significant impact on a substantial number of small entities. The
certification was incorporated in the proposing release, Release No. 3449858 (June 15, 2004). As stated in the adopting release, Release No. 3452029 (July 14, 2005), the Commission received no comments concerning

Description:

The Commission adopted rules and rule amendments relating to filings by

company” as a registrant with no or nominal operations and either no or
nominal assets, assets consisting solely of cash and cash equivalents, or
assets consisting of any amount of cash and cash equivalents and nominal
other assets. The rules and rule amendments prohibit the use of Form S-8
under the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) by shell companies. In
addition, they require a shell company that is reporting an event that
causes it to cease being a shell company to disclose the same type of
information that it would be required to provide in registering a class of
securities under the Exchange Act. These provisions are intended to
protect investors by deterring fraud and abuse in our securities markets
through the use of reporting shell companies.

Description:

The Commission adopted rules to modify and advance significantly the
registration, communications, and offering processes under the Securities
Act. The rules eliminate unnecessary and outmoded restrictions on
offerings. In addition, the rules provide more timely investment
information to investors without mandating delays in the offering process
that the Commission believes would be inconsistent with the needs of
issuers for timely access to capital. The rules also continue the
Commission’s long-term efforts toward integrating disclosure and
11

processes under the Securities Act and the Exchange Act. The rules
further these goals by addressing communications related to registered
securities offerings, delivery of information to investors, and procedural
aspects of the offering and capital formation processes.

amended Item 405 of Regulation S-K to harmonize this
item with the two-business day Form 4 due date and mandated electronic
filing and website posting of Section 16 reports.

Description:

The Commission adopted amendments to the accelerated filing deadlines
that apply to periodic reports so that a “large accelerated filer” (an Exchange
Act reporting company with a worldwide market value of outstanding voting
and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates of $700 million or
more) became subject to a 60-day Form 10-K annual report filing deadline,
beginning with the annual report filed for its first fiscal year ending on or
after December 15, 2006. Prior to that date, large accelerated filers were
subject to a 75-day annual report deadline. Under the amendments,
accelerated filers and large accelerated filers continue to be required to file
their Form 10-Q quarterly reports under a 40-day deadline, rather than the 35day deadline that was scheduled to apply under the previously existing rules.
Further, the amendments revise the definition of the term “accelerated filer”
to permit an accelerated filer that has voting and non-voting common equity
held by non-affiliates of less than $50 million to exit accelerated filer status at
the end of the fiscal year in which its equity falls below $50 million and to
file its annual report for that year and subsequent periodic reports on a nonaccelerated basis. Finally, the amendments permit a large accelerated filer
that has voting and non-voting common equity held by non-affiliates of less
than $500 million to exit large accelerated filer status at the end of the fiscal
year in which its equity falls below $500 million and to file its annual report
for that year and subsequent periodic reports as an accelerated filer, or a nonaccelerated filer, as appropriate
