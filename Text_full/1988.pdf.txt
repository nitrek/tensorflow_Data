Gentlemen:
It is an honor to transmit the Fifty-Fourth Annual Report of the Securities
Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended September 30, 1988.

and

Although the 1988 fiscal year was dominated by activities relating to the October
1987 market break, the Commission carried out its statutory responsibilities
successfully during the fiscal year.
Statutory responsibilities of the Commission include enforcing the federal securities laws, mandating complete and accurate disclosure by issuers, overseeing stock
exchanges and secondary market participants, regulating investment companies
and investment advisers and engaging in appellate and other litigation. The
Commission successfully discharged these responsibilities during the fiscal year in
both headquarters and regional offices.
The chart below shows some indicators of Commission activities during the year:"

• Resources: Although the Commission carried out its mission successfully during fiscal year 1988. several
factors have severely strained resources. One has been an Increase In the number of complex enforcement
cases requiring extensive commitment of resources. Another has been the continued dramatic growth in
the numbers of broker-dealers, investment companies. and investment advisers subject to Commission
regulation. The October 1981 market break and its aftermath have created resource demands, and
Increasing internationalization
of the securities markets is also having an on.going effect on the
Commission and its resources. As a means of addressing resource constraints. and in response to a
request from the Senate Banking Committee. the Executive Director's Office of the Commission prepared
a study and offered legislative alternatives on the feasibility of various means of self.fundlng the agency
while retaining accountability to Congress. The study also analyzed the effects of salary differentials
between the Commission and those in the private sector or in the industry the Commission regulates.

1

Enforcement: During the fiscal year, the Commission initiated 252 enforcement
actions. These cases involved insider trading, market manipulation, deficient or
fraudulent corporate reporting and accounting, broker-dealer violations, and other
matters. Some of the most significant cases in the Commission's history were
initiated or successfully litigated during the time period. The number of complex
cases, requiring substantial resources, increased markedly during the year,
accounting for a lower number of cases brought than in previous fiscal years.
The Commission took steps to enhance enforcement authority, both domestically
and internationally. During the fiscal year, the Commission developed and sent to
Congress the International Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1988. The Act was
designed to strengthen the Commission's ability to protect investors and to enforce
the federal securities laws in increasingly internationalized markets. (Significant
aspects of this legislation were enacted after the close of the fiscal year.) As part of
its internationalization efforts, the Commission signed memoranda of understanding with three Canadian provinces and with Brazil, which serve as models for future
negotiations. In addition, the Commission transmitted to Congress a legislative
proposal, the "Securities Law Enforcement Remedies Act of 1988;' based on
recommendations
in the Report of the National Commission on Fraudulent
Financial Reporting (the Treadway Commission) that would increase enforcement
remedies for a broad range of securities law violations.
Market Manipulation Task Force: In response to increasing abuses in the penny
stock market, the Commission established the Market Manipulation Task Force.
The Task Force, composed of representatives of both headquarters and regional
offices, is considering a number of initiatives to combat the growing problem of
penny-stock fraud and market manipulation, believed to be spreading nationwide.
Working closely with other law enforcement agencies, the self. regulatory orqanlzations, and state securities regulators, the Task Force is considering a variety of law
enforcement and regulatory actions to protect investors against the risks of market
manipulation and fraud.
Full Disclosure: Both on-going responsibilities and the challenges presented by
changes in the marketplace and internationalization were met in the Full Disclosure
program during the fiscal year. The total number of filings given full reviews
increased during the fiscal year. The number of filings relating to tender offers,
"going-private" transactions, and proxy statements given full reviews during the
year also increased, as did the number of annual report reviews. (Registration
statements received during the fiscal year declined somewhat, as a result of the
October 1987 market break.) A special analysis was undertaken of registrant
disclosures in "management's
discussion and analysis of financial condition and
results of operations."
Domestic rulemaking projects were completed during the fiscal year in the areas of
proxy rules, prospectus delivery, availability of no-action and interpretive letters,
and shareholder communications. The Commission also adopted rules intended to
facilitate capital formation by small businesses.
The far-reaching implications of increasing internationalization
of the securities
markets were a major focus of the full disclosure program. Rules governing the
transnational scope of registration requirements under the Securities Act of 1933

2

were proposed during the year. The Commission also proposed a rule providing a
safe harbor from requirements for resales of securities to institutions, which may
afford foreign issuers greater access to United States capital markets. In addition,
Commission staff discussed the development of a coordinated registration process
for multi-jurisdictional
securities offerings and tender offers with the Canadian
provinces of Ontario and Quebec.
Accounting and Auditing Matters: During the fiscal year, on-golng activities in
regard to disclosure issues and oversight of private sector standard setting were
carried out. Additionally, new challenges were addressed, such as those presented
by the recommendations in the Treadway Commission Report and by internationalization. Nine Staff Accounting Bulletins were issued during the year, and rules
were adopted concerning changes by public corporations of their independent
accountants. Rulemaking initiatives were also undertaken concerning opinion
shopping and management reports in response to the report of the Treadway
Commission. Oversight of private sector standard setting continued, as the
standard setting bodies dealt with both emerging issues and with projects designed
to enhance the quality of financial reporting.
During the fiscal year, the Commission continued its work with international
groups, such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions and the
International Federation of Accountants, to facilitate capital formation by addressing questions of differing international accounting and auditing standards.
EDGAR: The Commission's EDGAR system (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis,
and Retrieval) functioned successfully and effectively during its fourth year of
operation, and plans were implemented for the operational stages. During the fiscal
year, the Request for Proposals (RFP) for the operational project was issued and
amended as necessary. Three offers were received and evaluated based on specific
criteria, on-site visits, and face-to-face discussions, with a goal of selecting the
offeror whose proposal was most advantageous to the government, considering
costs and other factors set forth in the RFP.(The contract was awarded on January
3, 1989, after the close of the fiscal year.)
Regulation of the Securities Markets: The October 1987 market break occurred
two weeks into the fiscal year. Activities related to this event were the major focus
in regulation of the markets. Immediately prior to, during, and after the break, the
Commission engaged in intensive monitoring and analysis of market movements
and indicators; the financial condition of broker-dealers and clearing and transfer
agents; the financial and operating condition of stock exchanges; and other
relevant facets of the market. Communications and coordination with market
participants, exchange officials, and other government regulators on concerns
about credit, liquidity, financial soundness, and international ramifications of
developments were frequent and productive. Further intensive study resulted in the
publication, in February 1988, of the Staff Report of the Division of Market
Regulation on the October 1987 Market Break, containing descriptions of the
events and recommendations for further exploration. During this period, the
Commission also cooperated with the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms (the Brady Commission), exchanging information on various market developments. Subsequent testimony by the Commission before several Congressional
committees incorporated some of these recommendations, as means for preventing

3

or ameliorating certain aspects of stress on market systems and mechanisms in the
future. The Commission was a participant in the President's Working Group on
Financial Markets, formed on March 18, 1988. In May 1988, the Working Group
issued an interim report to the President of the United States. The Commission also
acted on several proposals submitted by exchanges and others designed to address
concerns over the events of October 1987. The Commission also transmitted
recommendations
for legislation to Congress.
Additionally, the Commission worked with other regulatory agencies and with
exchanges to take steps, in addition to those outlined above, based on analysis of the
October 1987 market break. These steps addressed the most pressing issues identified
in the staff report: expanding capacity, improving coordination and retarding market
velocity. Specialist and market-maker performance, capital adequacy, and clearing and
settlement concerns were also addressed during and after the fiscal year.
Economic Research and Analysis: During the fiscal year, the Commission consolidated its economic program to provide more comprehensive economic analysis
and financial data. The revised Office of Economic Analysis incorporates existing
economic functions, and will also compile, analyze, and disseminate macroeconomic and financial data to the Commission. The Office continued to perform
regulatory flexibility analyses, and other required functions.
Litigation and Legal Activities: The Office of General Counsel represents the
Commission in appellate and other litigation, and acts as Chief Legal Officer for the
Commission. During the fiscal year, the Office represented the Commission in 314
litigation matters. The Commission also participated amicus curiae in 50 cases,
and entered its appearance in 50 reorganizations under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code. Results favorable to the Commission were obtained in
almost all matters that were concluded during the fiscal year in the Supreme Court,
and the appellate and district courts.
The General Counsel also assists the Commission in preparation of testimony on a
number of important issues, and on legislative proposals submitted to Congress.
During the fiscal year, the number of Congressional appearances reached an
all-time high. Testimony and legislative proposals often involved complex and
difficult interpretations of existing laws and their history (such as the Glass-Steagall
Act) or of new and challenging developments in the marketplace, such as market
reform in the wake of the October 1987 market break.
Investment
Companies and Advisers: Again this fiscal year, the number of
investment companies,
investment advisers, and assets managed by them
increased, while staff in the Division of Investment Management remained essentially unchanged. Examinations completed by headquarters and regional staff
during the year numbered 2,150, a substantial increase that was made possible in
part by the use of computers.
During the year, the Division published a report on financial planners. The report,
prepared at the request of the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance
of the Energy and Commerce Committee of the House of Representatives, explored
the status of the financial planners/investment
advisers, and issues of abuse, and
included demographic data and a report on a pilot project of inspections of

4

investment advisers registered as broker-dealers with the National Association of
Securities Dealers (NASD). Based on the data gathered for the study, the staff report
concluded that violations by planners were not materially different from those by
advisers (although they were more frequent), that potential for self. interested
behavior exists when planners provide advice and sell products, and that demon.
strated abuses by both planners and advisers involve only a very small portion of
the industry. The study also said that the NASD's pilot project demonstrated the
feasibility of having NASD inspectors conduct examinations of financial planners.
Also during the fiscal year, the Commission adopted rules on disclosures of
changes of accountants and disclosures of fees in tabular form in mutual fund
prospectuses. Additional rules standardized computation of performance data in
advertisements and sales literature to enhance comparability of data for the benefit
of investors. Other rules adopted during the year require investment advisers to
retain records relating to performance advertisements.
Among rules proposed
during the year are some that would, if adopted by the Commission, permit mutual
funds and unit investment trusts to make exchange offers under certain conditions,
clarify provisions of Rule 12b-1 plans, permit contingent deferred sales loads under
certain conditions, and exempt some small financial advisers from federal regula.
tion if they register with state regulatory authorities.
Management and Program Support: During the fiscal year, management and
administrative support activities were provided regarding domestic and international policy issues, and regarding the Commission's deliberations on such issues.
For example, during the year, the Commission testified 24 times on issues such as
the October 1987 market break, the President's Working Group on Financial
Markets, Glass-Steagall reform, international enforcement, insider trading, arbitration, financial planners, and the Commission's authorization and appropriations.
During the year, a study and proposed legislative language on alternative
approaches to transferring the agency to self-funding status were substantially
completed by the Office of the Executive Director. (Soon after the close of the fiscal
year, the study was transmitted to Congress.) This study was conducted at the
request of the Securities Subcommittee of the Senate Committee on Housing,
Banking and Urban Affairs. In this regard, it is significant that for the sixth
consecutive year, and the seventh time in its 54-year history, the Commission
collected revenues in excess of its appropriation. During fiscal year 1988, $250
million, most of it from filing fees, was transmitted to the United States Treasury.
During the year, about 49,000 complaints or inquiries from investors, and 2,308
Freedom of Information Act requests were received and processed. The increase of
22 percent in consumer inquiries was primarily a result of the October 1987 market
break. Other requests under the Privacy Act and for records were processed during
the year as well.
Also during the fiscal year, activities were carried out to increase or locate space for
various offices; to modernize financial systems; to increase the number and use of
computers in carrying out the Commission's mission; and to implement a number
of measures relating to hiring, retention, and personnel management.
As the new fiscal year began on October 1, 1988, the aftermath

of the October

5

market break continued to be of concern and to occupy Commission resources. In
addition, a dominant theme, which appears throughout the Report and affects all
areas of the Commission, was internationalization
of the securities markets.
Positioning the Commission to exercise leadership in international securities
regulation has been a major endeavor, and efforts in this area are continuing.
As the fiscal year drew to a close, preparations were underway for, among other
efforts, presentation of a paper on regulation of international securities markets to
the International Organization of Securities Commissions. Presented in Melbourne,
Australia after the close of the fiscal year, the paper, unanimously approved by the
Commission, has served as a working document for international securities
regulation.

Key 1988 Results
In fiscal 1988, the Commission continued to devote significant enforcement
resources to the investigation and litigation of complex cases involving
potential insider trading, financial disclosure and market manipulation violations. There was also a notable increase in the number of securities offering
cases, as well as cases primarily involving investment advisers and investment
companies.

In fiscal year 1988, the Commission obtained court orders requiring
defendants to return illicit profits amounting to approximately $26.1 million,
either as disgorgement or as restitution to defrauded investors or entities.
Disgorgement orders in insider trading cases amounted to $1.9 million. Civil
penalties under the Insider Trading Sanctions Act of 1984 (llSA) amounted
to $1.2 million.
The Commission referred matters, or granted access to its files to federal
and state prosecutorial authorities in 136 cases. An estimated 50 criminal
indictments or informations and 55 convictions were obtained by criminal
authorities during fiscal year 1988 in Commission. related cases.

Introduction
An aggressive and comprehensive program to enforce the federal securities
laws is essential to investor protection and to investor confidence in the
integrity, fairness and efficiency of the securities markets. The Commission's
enforcement program is designed to maintain a presence in all areas within
the Commission's jurisdiction, to concentrate on particular problem areas,
and to anticipate emerging problems.
The Commission's enforcement actions generally are preceded by an
examination pursuant to the Commission's inspection powers or an lnvestlgation. The Commission is empowered to conduct examinations of broker.
dealers, municipal securities dealers, investment advisers, investment
companies, transfer agents and self. regulatory organizations. The Commission conducts informal and formal investigations. Informal investigations are
7

conducted on a voluntary basis, with the Commission requesting persons with
relevant information to cooperate by providing documents and testifying
before the Commission staff. The federal securities laws also empower the
Commission to conduct formal investigations providing the Commission with
the authority to issue subpoenas compelling the production of books and
records and the appearance of witnesses to testify. Both types of investigations
are generally conducted on a confidential, nonpublic basis.
The federal securities laws authorize the Commission to institute both civil
and administrative enforcement actions. The Commission may file injunctive
actions, seek civil penalties in insider trading cases, and institute administrative proceedings. The Commission may also refer matters to the appropriate
governmental authority or self-regulatory organization for enforcement
action.
The primary enforcement action utilized by the Commission is the injunctive action. The federal securities laws authorize the Commission to seek
temporary restraining orders and preliminary and permanent injunctions
against any person who is violating or about to violate any provision of the
federal securities laws. Conduct which violates the courts' injunctions is
punishable by civil or criminal contempt and violators are subject to fines or
imprisonment. In addition to seeking orders prohibiting future violations, the
Commission often seeks other equitable relief in the form of an accounting
and disgorgement of illegal profits, rescission or restitution. When seeking
temporary restraining orders the Commission often requests an order freezing
assets to prevent concealment of assets or dissipation of proceeds of illegal
conduct.
The Commission is specifically authorized to seek civil penalties in connection with insider trading violations. Pursuant to the Insider Trading
Sanctions Act of 1984 (ITSA), the Commission may seek and the court may
impose civil penalties of up to three times the profits gained or losses avoided.
In August 1988 the Commission was authorized to seek civil penalties of up
to $10,000 in connection with violations of Section 30A, the anti-bribery
provision of the Exchange Act.
The Commission is also authorized to institute several types of administrative proceedings. Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)
enables the Commission to institute proceedings to suspend the effectiveness
of a registration statement which contains false and misleading statements.
Administrative proceedings pursuant to Section 15(cX4) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) may be instituted against any person
who fails to comply and any person who is a cause of failure to comply with
the reporting, beneficial ownership, proxy and tender offer provisions; respondents may be ordered to comply or effect compliance with the relevant
provisions. The Commission may also institute administrative proceedings
against regulated entities and associated persons. Sanctions include censures, limitations on activities, suspension or revocation of the registration of
such entities. The Commission may impose similar sanctions on persons
associated with such entities and persons affiliated with investment companies. Administrative proceedings may be instituted against persons who

8

appear and practice before the agency such as accountants and attorneys and
may impose sanctions including suspensions or bars.
Under appropriate circumstances the Commission refers matters to other
federal, state or local authorities or self-regulatory organizations such as the
New York Stock Exchange or the National Association of Securities Dealers.
The Commission's staff may render substantial assistance to criminal authorities such as the Department of Justice for the criminal prosecution of
securities violations.
As a result of developments in the securities markets, the complexity of the
Commission's enforcement activities has increased. Over the past several
years the number of broker-dealers and investment advisers has grown,
trading volume and the volatility of the markets have increased, and new and
more complex trading vehicles and strategies are being offered.
The increased internationalization of the securities markets often has
required the Commission to obtain evidence in its investigations and litigation
from persons residing outside the United States. To accommodate this
development, the Commission has expanded its Office of International Legal
Assistance which coordinates international aspects of the Commission's
enforcement activities. This office also assists in the negotiation of memoranda of understanding with other countries. The Commission has signed
Memoranda of Understanding with Switzerland, the United Kingdom and
Japan. During fiscal year 1988, the Commission entered into comprehensive
agreements with three provinces in Canada and Brazil. These memoranda of
understanding have substantially facilitated the Commission's efforts to
obtain evidence essential to its enforcement program.
A result of the Commission's efforts to conduct an aggressive, comprehensive and effective enforcement program is an increase in protracted litigation.
The Commission has been litigating an important injunctive action against a
brokerage firm, SEC v. rust Jersey Securities, Inc., 1 alleging violations of the
antifraud provisions and seeking disgorgement. During the course of discovery in that action, employees of the firm refused to produce corporate
documents
based upon an assertion of the privilege against selfincrimination. The Commission prevailed on this issue but only after litigating
the matter in the Court of Appeals. The Commission is currently litigating a
significant market manipulation case, SEC v. Monarch Funding Corp., et al.,2
and a case involving allegations of antifraud violations by a major public
accounting firm, SEC v. Price Waterhouse. 3

Program Areas
During 1988, the Commission maintained an aggressive enforcement
presence in each of the areas within the Commission's jurisdiction. The
Commission also established new programs and maintained existing programs to address particular problem areas. The principal program areas for
1988 included insider trading and other violations related to contests for
corporate control; manipulation of over-the-counter stocks; securities offering
violations; financial fraud; and broker-dealer, investment adviser and invest9

ment company violations. The Commission has utilized the full complement
of enforcement remedies available to it during the past fiscal year, selecting
the type of action and relief appropriate in light of the violative conduct and
parties involved.
Insider Trading
Insider trading refers generally to the purchase and sale of securities in
breach of a fiduciary duty or a relationship of trust or confidence, while in
possession of material nonpublic information about an issuer or the trading
market for an issuer's securities. The federal securities laws prohibit such
trading not only by corporate officers and directors and other persons having
a relationship of trust or confidence with the issuer or its shareholders, but
also by persons who misappropriate material nonpublic information from
sources other than the issuer. Tippees of such persons may also be subject to
the prohibition. Insider trading in the context of tender offers is also prohibited. Although cases involving insider trading are only one component of the
Commission's comprehensive enforcement program, the magnitude and
gravity of the cases recently brought by the Commission and the criminal
prosecutions initiated by the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Southern District
of New York reflect the continuing importance of this issue.
With respect to insider trading cases the Commission has filed actions
seeking temporary restraining orders and asset freezes to prevent the concealment and movement of illegal profits. The Commission has also sought
permanent injunctions and other equitable relief including disgorgement of
profits or losses avoided. Generally, in insider trading cases the Commission
has sought civil penalties under ITSA. Also, if broker-dealers or investment
advisers or persons associated with such entities engage in insider trading
violations the Commission will institute administrative proceedings and seek
suspensions or bars from further association with the securities industry. This
past fiscal year, the Commission brought 25 enforcement actions based
primarily on insider trading violations, and 2 other actions which included
insider trading allegations.
Many of the insider trading cases brought by the Commission this fiscal year
reflected aspects of the continuing internationalization of the securities
markets. The Commission dealt with challenges such as obtaining service of
persons abroad and securing and protecting assets against movement outside
the Commission's jurisdiction. In SEC v. Wang and Lee, 4 a major international
insider trading case filed in June 1988, the Commission alleged that an
analyst in the mergers and acquisitions department of a major investment
banking firm provided information concerning proposed mergers or other
extraordinary transactions involving the firm's clients to an investor who was
a Taiwan national residing in Hong Kong. While in possession of this
information, the investor allegedly directed the purchase and sale of securities
of at least 25 issuers through various accounts, realizing at least $19 million
in illegal profits.
The Commission obtained a temporary restraining order which included a
freeze of all assets belonging to the defendants. Following entry of the order,
10

one defendant attempted unsuccessfully to retrieve funds in Hong Kong from
a bank. At the Commission's request, the court ordered the defendants not to
seek further relief from the previous order in either foreign or other United
States courts, and ordered the bank holding the investor's funds, which had
a branch in New York which was utilized in defendant's fund transfers, to pay
over $12 million into the registry of the court for safekeeping pending further
order of the court. A default judgment was entered against the foreign investor
in October 1988 and at year end proceedings were continuing before a
Magistrate to fix the amount of disgorgement. The bank has noticed an appeal
with respect to the order requiring payment into the registry.
The analyst, who admitted receiving $200,000 from the trading scheme,
pleaded guilty to these felony charges and was sentenced to a three-year
prison term, to be followed by three years of probation.
Two fiscal 1988 insider trading cases highlighted the importance of multinational agreements and cooperation. In one, the Commission made use of
the Hague Convention to effect service on two foreign nationals named as
defendants. In SEC v. Kerherve 5 the Commission alleged that the two foreign
nationals, who resided in Cairo, Egypt, unlawfully traded in the securities of
Texas International Co. while in possession of inside information about the
discovery of a major oil field in Egypt. Within days of filing the case, and the
entry of a temporary restraining order and an order freezing assets, the two
defendants in Egypt were personally served with process at their offices in
Cairo, Egypt pursuant to the Hague Convention. The Department of State and
the Egyptian authorities provided extraordinary assistance in this case.
Shortly after being served, defendants consented to the entry of injunctions
against them and to over $50,000 in disgorgement and penalties.
In SEC v. ColLier,6 an action involving inside information about proposed
takeover attempts by clients of an international investment bank, a managing
director of the investment bank allegedly used this information to purchase
and direct the purchases of shares in the target companies. United States
accounts were used to purchase shares on the London Stock Exchange;
trading was also effected through a Cayman Islands entity. Injunctions were
entered, by consent, against the two defendants. The British Department of
Trade and Industry provided assistance in this matter, in accordance with the
Memorandum of Understanding executed by the two countries.
Among the cases alleging violations of Section 14(e) and Rule 14e-3 of the
Exchange Act, which prohibits insider trading in connection with tender
offers, were SEC v. Sierchio 7 and SEC v. Chestman.8 In these cases, the
Commission alleged that the defendants traded in securities of Waldbaum,
lnc., while in possession of inside information obtained from the president of
Waldbaum concerning an imminent tender offer for the company. Injunctions,
disgorgement orders and ITSA penalties were entered by consent against two
of the three defendants. Defendant Chestman, against whom the injunctive
action remained pending at the close of the year, was subsequently indicted;
this indictment was the first to allege criminal violations of Section 14(e).
The Commission filed an injunctive action against Marcus Schloss & Co.,
Inc., a registered broker-dealer, alleging that trades for the account of Marcus
11

Schloss were made based on information concerning proposed mergers and
acquisitions obtained from Michael N. David. David, an associate of a law firm,
was enjoined previously. Injunctions by consent were entered this year against
Marcus Schloss 9 and against Andrew Solomon,"? an employee of Marcus
Schloss. Marcus Schloss agreed to pay $136,900 in disgorgement of trading
profits and an ITSA penalty of $273,800. An injunctive action filed this fiscal
year against Douglas Ronald Yagoda, another employee, remained pending at
the end of the fiscal year. 11
The Commission also took additional remedial administrative action.
Solomon, who had also allegedly tipped David concerning a proposed
leveraged buyout which Marcus Schloss had been approached about, received
a 12-month suspension from association with a broker-dealer and certain
other regulated entities. 12 Marcus Schloss was censured and ordered to adopt
and implement recommendations of an independent consultant employed to
review relevant policies and procedures of the firm.13
Considerable staff resources are used in insider trading cases, many of
which are litigated over an extended period of time. The Commission
successfully litigated an action against two alleged tippees named in SEC v.
Musella. 14 This injunctive action, instituted in 1983, alleged that a number of
individuals traded while in possession of nonpublic information concerning
proposed mergers or acquisitions obtained from a law firm by an employee of
that firm. In January 1988, the court ruled that the remaining two defendants,
who had no direct link with either the primary tipper or the first tier of tippees,
had not insulated themselves from a finding of scienter by consciously
avoiding learning about the confidential sources of the information. Summary
judgment was entered against the two tippees.
A judicial determination also resolved competing claims for priority to
profits ordered to be disgorged by defendants in two settled cases, SEC v.
Levine,lS and SEC v. Wilkis.16 In addition to the entry of injunctions,
defendants in these cases had consented to orders to disgorge approximately
$14.8 million. The court denied claims for priority for payment by government
tax authorities, and approved a Commission plan pursuant to which all
disgorged funds will be made available to investor claimants. At the close of
1988, this matter was on appeal.
Other significant insider trading cases during fiscal year 1988 included SEC
v. Karcher,l? in which the Commission alleged that a number of employees of
Carl Karcher Enterprises and members of the Karcher family sold shares while
in possession of inside information prior to the announcement of anticipated
decreased earnings for the company in the coming quarter. This case was in
litigation at the end of the fiscal year. In SEC v. Russolillo, 18 the Commission
obtained the entry of an injunction against an insider who allegedly purchased
8,000 shares of stock while in possession of information concerning an
imminent merger proposal from another bank. Russolillo also consented to an
order of disgorgement in the amount of $33,307 and payment of $49,961 in
civil penalties. In related criminal proceedings, six persons were charged with
trading while in possession of inside information in this case, and, by the close
of the fiscal year, Russolillo and three others had pleaded guilty.
12

Manipulative Activities
The Commission is charged with ensuring the integrity of trading on the
national securities exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, and, along
with the exchanges and the NASD, engages in continuing surveiIlance of
these markets. Attempts to manipulate the market may take many forms, and
may involve raising or lowering the price of listed securities as well as "penny"
stocks (low-priced securities traded in the over-the-counter markets). The
Commission has attempted to deal with these violations by instituting a
number of different types of enforcement proceedings.
In September 1988 the Commission filed SEC v. DrexeL Burnham Lambert, 19
an injunctive action alleging that a multi-service investment banking firm
registered as a broker-dealer with the Commission, its vice-president and
manager of its high yield and convertible bond department, and others
devised and carried out a scheme involving stock manipulation, fraud on the
broker-dealer's own clients, failure to make required disclosures regarding the
beneficial ownership of securities, insider trading and numerous other
securities law violations. The complaint alleged that at least sixteen series of
violative transactions were undertaken pursuant to a secret arrangement with
Ivan Boesky, who last year was enjoined and sanctioned administratively by
the Commission based on alleged insider trading violations.
Defendants allegedly retained an undisclosed beneficial interest in securities which were purportedly sold and were the subject of proposed merger or
acquisition activity. These securities were traded by the Boesky organization,
in certain instances under the direction of the Drexel defendants. This
arrangement allegedly allowed the firm, among other things, to trade secretly
in securities on its restricted list, and to profit from use of material nonpublic
information to which it had access solely because of its fiduciary relationship
with corporate clients. The complaint also alleged that the firm and its
vice-president traded while in possession of inside information received from
clients in at least two transactions not involving Boesky, and that other
persons arranged to have Boesky take securities positions for them, and failed
to disclose their beneficial ownership as required. This action was in litigation
at the close of the year.
This fiscal year the Commission proceeded administratively against a
broker-dealer and its president alleging manipulative activities in connection
with three securities offerings (In the Matter of Rooney, Pace, Inc. 20). The
Commission found, among other things, that the broker-dealer sold to its own
customers almost all of the shares of an offering which it underwrote and
thereafter manipulated the market which it dominated, that it failed to
exercise due diligence in connection with another offering it underwrote, and
that, acting as an undisclosed underwriter of a third offering, it sold stock
short in advance of the secondary offering and failed to report acquisition of
an interest in over five percent of the outstanding shares. By consent, the
broker-dealer withdrew its registration with the Commission; the president
was suspended for nine months and agreed to certain limitations on his
conduct for five years.

13

Market manipulation may also occur on the international level. In SEC v.
Zico Investment Holdings, Inc.,21 a British Virgin Islands corporation and
citizens of Great Britain were enjoined, by consent, based on allegations that
they had engaged in a manipulative scheme to depress the market price of the
common stock of Bancroft Convertible Fund, Inc. (a closed-end investment
fund traded on the American Stock Exchange) in order to depress the price
prior to the commencement of a tender offer by Zico for Bancroft.
"Penny" stocks have become the subject of numerous manipulative
schemes. Typically, these schemes involve "shell" companies, either newly
formed "blank check" companies (companies which conduct registered
offerings disclosing that the proposed use of proceeds is to seek business
opportunities) or older companies with no assets or operations, but small
trading markets. These companies are then merged with private companies
purported by the promoters to have great growth potential. Stocks in the
merged companies are promoted through releases announcing the merger
and marketed to the investing public through the use of extreme highpressure tactics. The securities may then be manipulated to reach inflated
prices, at which point the promoters may dump shares they own, and move on.
Participants in these schemes may include promoters, broker-dealers,
attorneys, accountants, and transfer agents. While the shares are low-priced,
often actually priced in pennies, profits of broker-dealers involved in trading
these stocks can be enormous, and investors can suffer major losses. These
schemes have spread nationwide, and the Commission has commenced active
programs to deal with them, including establishment of an in-house task force
to propose regulatory solutions.
In 1988 in SEC v. Porto 22 the Commission initiated an injunctive action in
which it alleged that a loose confederation of defendants created corporations,
took them public and manipulated the price of the stocks in the aftermarket.
Five issuers, also named in the enforcement action, allegedly filed false and
misleading registration statements with the Commission that, among other
things, failed to disclose their control by two of the major promoters.
Figureheads or persons totally unassociated with the issuers were listed as
officers, directors and controlling shareholders. All of the issuers' filings were
untimely or delinquent, and many were false and misleading and contained
forged or unauthorized signatures. The defendants also allegedly misappropriated money raised from the investors and engaged in kickback schemes.
The offering documents and structures of the companies were similar, each
a blank check offering lnvolvlnq units consisting of common stock and
warrants. All of the issuers and securities were listed in the "pink sheets" and
generally traded at substantial premiums above their offering price in aftermarket trading. Each issuer, through the same financial public relations firm,
allegedly disseminated false and misleading information concerning impending mergers and acquisitions.
In January 1988, the district court froze the assets of the defendant
companies. The Commission also instituted five separate administrative
proceedings pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act, based on alleged
misstatements and omissions in companies' registration statements. Pursu14

ant to default judgments, the Commission issued stop orders suspending the
effectiveness of the registration staternents.P
In November 1987, the Commission successfully litigated an action against
SEC v. Steven A. Keyser.24 The United States District Court for the District of
Utah enjoined the former president of the company, who was alleged to have
diverted all of the proceeds of the initial "blank check" offering of the
company to his own use. As part of the remedial relief, shares he held in the
company were returned.
In fiscal 1988, the Commission, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Exchange
Act, instituted ten-day suspensions of trading of 124 penny stocks listed in the
"pink sheets." In most instances, trading suspensions are ordered because of
substantial questions as to the adequacy, accuracy or availability of public
information concerning a company's financial condition or business operations or because transactions in the company's securities suggested possible
manipulation or other violations.
In the first proceeding of its type instituted recently, the Commission
censured a broker-dealer, In the Matter of Richfield Securities, Inc.,25 which
consented to findings that it had no reasonable basis for believing that
information in its files concerning a previously suspended security was
reasonably reliable and current, as required by Rule 15c2-11 of the Exchange
Act. The broker-dealer was also ordered to comply with its undertakings to
implement procedures to assure future compliance with Rule 15c2-11.
Where possible, the Commission brings proceedings against professionals
who take an active part in penny stock schemes. In November 1987, for
example, in In the Matter of Tommy B. Duke, an attorney who had previously
consented to be enjoined in connection with the fraudulent promotion and
manipulation of shares of two formerly dormant shell companies, and who,
among other things, had written opinion letters and facilitated the issuance of
the shares, consented to an order pursuant to Rule 2(e) of the Commission's
Rule of Practice denying him the privilege of practicing before the Commission for 18 months.26
Corporate Control
Sections 13 and 14 of the Exchange Act require, among other things,
disclosures in connection with the acquisition of more than five percent of a
class of equity securities registered with the Commission, proxy solicitations
and tender offers for more than five percent of a class of equity securities
registered with the Commission. These requirements are intended to ensure
that investors have material information needed to make informed investment
or voting decisions concerning potential changes in the control of a corporation. The Commission instituted both administrative and injunctive proceedings in corporate control cases this fiscal year.
In June 1988, following a trial on the merits, the United States District Court
of the District of Columbia, in SEC v. First City Financial Corp., 27 determined
that the defendants had engaged in a "parking" scheme to conceal their
intentions to accumulate shares of stock of Ashland Oil Corp. The court
determined that the defendants violated Commission requirements for timely
15

disclosure of accumulations of over five percent of a class of securities by
accumulating shares held in various nominee and proprietary accounts held
by a New York broker-dealer. Noting that these requirements serve a "vital
public function to alert the marketplace to every large. rapid aggregation of
accumulation of securities, regardless of technique employed," the court
ordered injunctions entered against the defendants. The court also adopted
the Commission's proposal for disgorgement. ordering the defendants to
disgorge over $2.7 million, representing the difference between the price the
defendants paid for the securities after their disclosure obligations arose and
the amount they received for the shares.
Securities Offerings
Securities offering cases represent a major portion of the Commission's
enforcement activities. These cases involve the offer and sale of securities in
violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act and may also
involve material misrepresentations
concerning risks involved. return on
investment and the uses of proceeds of the offering. These cases cover a broad
range of securities offerings. from $20 million in unregistered promissory
notes (SEC v. Towers Credit COrp.28) to $5 million of securities in a Brazilian
gold mine (SEC v. Hunter Maek Belton 29) to $8.5 million of securities in an
unregistered investment company (SEC u Joseph Anthony Belmonte
A number of securities offering cases are filed on an emergency basis. In
addition to seeking injunctive relief. the Commission may also seek asset
freezes, accountings. disgorgement of profits and the appointment of
receivers.
Disgorgement in the amount of $5.4 million was ordered in SEC v.
Bramble.31 a case involving unregistered offerings of investment contract
interests in stallionlbroodmare syndications. misrepresentations concerning
the quality of the mares. the financial condition of the company. and the use
of proceeds of the offering. The Commission also obtained disgorgement
orders in a case alleging misuse of proceeds of a $3.2 million offering of
unregistered securities (SEC v. James Simpson 32). and a case involving an
unregistered offering which generated at least $13 million based on false
representations that the offeror company was in the business of refining gold
from the beaches of Costa Rica (SEC v. Goldeor, Inc. 33).
The Commission frequently seeks follow-up administrative sanctions in
offering cases. For example, the Commission barred a previously enjoined
registered representative alleged to have misappropriated proceeds from the
unregistered sale of investment securities in amounts of $600.000 (In the
Matter of John A. Grant 34). It barred from practice before the Commission an
attorney who prepared registration statements in connection with fraudulent
public offerings which raised $32.5 million (In the Matter of James F.

3e,.

McGovern 35).

The Commission also barred the owner and principal of a broker-dealer and
an investment adviser who had been enjoined from violations of the antifraud
and registration provisions in connection with a $3 million offering of oil, gas
and real estate limited partnerships (In the Matter of Katherine Williams
16

McGuire 36). In a similar

proceeding, the Commission sought sanctions
against another principal of a broker-dealer and an investment adviser based
on the entry of an injunction in connection with the unregistered offering of
interests in real estate partnerships and misappropriation of at least $7 million
of the proceeds (In the Matter of William Edgar Crowder 37). That proceeding
was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
Financial Disclosure
Actions involving false and misleading disclosures concerning the financial
condition of companies and the issuance of false financial statements are
often complex and require more resources than other types of cases, but their
effective prosecution is essential to preserving the integrity of the disclosure
system. In fiscal year 1988 the Commission brought 28 cases containing
significant allegations of financial disclosure violations against issuers, regulated entities or their employees (including 5 actions in which financial
disclosure violations were alleged in addition to other primary violations).
Many of these cases included alleged violations of the accounting provisions
of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. The Commission also brought 5 cases
alleging misconduct on the part of accounting firms or their partners or
employees.
With respect to financial fraud cases, the Commission instituted a variety of
enforcement actions. The Commission filed injunctive actions against issuers
and responsible officers and directors. Administrative proceedings pursuant
to Section 15(c)(4) were instituted against persons who failed to comply with
certain provisions of the federal securities laws and persons who caused such
failures. The Commission also instituted administrative proceedings pursuant
to Rule 2(e) against both accountants who served as chief financial officers of
issuers and against accountants who were involved in audits of publicly-held
companies.
A number of cases involved the improper recognition of revenue or income.
These included recognition of sales of computer systems despite contingencies affecting customer obligations to pay for the systems (SEC v. Flexible
Computer COrp.38), recognition of sales of franchises despite the absence of
reasonable assurances that the purchase price was collectible (SEC v. Primo,
Inc.39) and improper recognition of six "bill and hold" transactions totalling
$4.5 million (SEC v. Electro-Cetheier Corp. 40).
In SEC v. The Cannon Group Inc.41 the Commission alleged that a film
producer and distributor had materially overstated reserves by, among other
devices, underamortizing film costs and overestimating anticipated revenues
from the sale of films. In addition to the entry of permanent injunctions
against defendants, Cannon was required, among other things, to undergo a
review by its auditors of the adequacy of its accounting procedures and
controls.
Some cases were based on violations of the books and records and internal
controls provisions of the Exchange Act in connection with interim or
quarterly financial statements. In SEC v. Stereo Village 42 an injunction was
entered based on allegations that books and records which were not posted on
17

a current basis resulted in an overstatement of earnings for the first three
quarters of the year; the corrected figures resulted in reductions of between 47
and 98 percent in net earnings for each quarter. In SEC v. Lane Telecommunications, lnc., 43 the Commission alleged that the company overstated revenues by approximately $1.4 million and pretax net income by approximately
$754,000 for the second quarter of its 1984 fiscal year, and as a result,
materially overstated its revenues and understated its loss at year end. Two
defendants consented to the entry of an injunction; at year end the action was
pending with respect to a third defendant.
The Commission used its authority pursuant to Section 15(cX4) of the
Exchange Act to order future compliance with the reporting provisions by
persons found to be a "cause" of financial reporting violations. These included
the chief financial officer of an insurance company, found to be a cause of the
company's improper recognition of gains upon simultaneous sale and repurchase of debt securities (In the Matter of USF&G COrp.44); three officers and
directors of an operating company, found to have made inadequate provision
for bad debts in the company's financial statements (In the Matter of Michael
p. Richer 45); and the chief financial officer of a computer services and
equipment company, found to be a cause of improper recognition of sales of
ATM terminals due to false and inadequate information concerning the
transactions in the company's books and records, (In the Matter of Steven L.
Komm46).

The Commission also instituted proceedings under Section 15(cX4),ln the
Matter of E.F. Hutton Group, Inc., 47 finding that internal accounting controls
deficiencies prevented adequate disclosure to customers of the risks of
trading in certain industrial revenue bonds and created a potential loss
contingency for the broker-dealer. The Commission ordered future compliance by the broker-dealer, and further ordered it to include an explanation of
issues raised in the Order in its forthcoming annual report.
In a combined proceeding, the Commission issued a Report of Investigation
and the Federal Home Loan Bank Board instituted administrative proceedings
pursuant to Section 15(cX4), In the Matter of American Savings and Loen
Association of Florida (ASLA),48based on the false and misleading disclosures
ASLA made in periodic reports and proxy materials concerning the unusual
nature of and risks attendant to repurchase and reverse repurchase transactions that resulted in an overcollateralized position of approximately $100
million with E.S.M. Securities, Inc., ultimately causing a $69 million after-tax
loss to ASLA. Pursuant to Section 15(cX4), the FHLBB ordered ASLA to
comply in the future with applicable provisions of the federal securities laws,
and also ordered that outside counsel review various ASLA filings and press
releases for a period of five years. The Commission published a Report of
Investigation pursuant to Section 21(a) of the Exchange Act, setting forth in
detail its findings and conclusions in the matter.
Proceedings against accountants are an important part of the Commission's
enforcement program. Pursuant to Rule 2(e) of the Commission's Rules of
Practice, the Commission instituted proceedings alleging improper professional conduct on the part of a chief financial officer who prepared financial
18

statements which materially misstated net income In the Matter of Keith
EHelajac;49 a chief financial officer who was responsible for financial statements which improperly recorded financial transactions as sales (In the Matter
of Steven L. Komm);50 and an independent auditor found to have conducted an
inadequate audit with respect to recordation of taxes and inventory, resulting
in overstatement of net income by the subject company (In the Matter of
Norman Abrams).51 Commission-lmposed sanctions ranged from permanent
bars from practicing before the Commission, to bars with a right to reapply to
practice after a period of years and upon satisfying certain specified conditions, to review by supervisors or outside auditors of work to be filed with the
Commission.
Investment Companies
With respect to investment companies the Commission initiated civil
actions seeking injunctive relief and further equitable relief including accountings, suspension of redemption of fund shares, and the appointment of a
disbursing agent to liquidate a trust. The Commission also filed an injunctive
action against the officers and interested directors of an investment company,
its adviser and its underwriter. During fiscal 1988, the Commission instituted
the first administrative proceedings involving distribution plans pursuant to
Rule 12b-1.
In two instances, the Commission sought the liquidation of investment
companies as ancillary relief in civil injunctive proceedings. In SEC v. The
Santa Barbara Fund,52 the Commission alleged that the fund, among other
things, breached various stated investment restrictions, exceeded stated
expense limitations, and sold and redeemed shares based on a materially
incorrect net asset value. The Commission also alleged that the fund's
president and adviser had redeemed initial shares of the fund at considerable
personal gain, in violation of representations made in the fund's prospectus.
The fund consented to entry of an order permanently enjoining it, together
with the ancillary remedies of an accounting, suspension of redemption of
fund shares pending liquidation, and liquidation. In SEC v. Westem Guerenteed Income Trust, Series 85-1, et al., 53 the Commission obtained a permanent
injunction by consent against several registered unit investment trusts and
their affiliates, alleging that in connection with offerings of interests in the
trusts the defendants had overstated trust assets in prospectuses and annual
reports to unitholders, failed to deposit trust monies with a custodian as
represented, and incurred operating fees greatly in excess of prospectus
estimates. As ancillary remedies, the court ordered an accounting and
appointed a disbursing agent to liquidate the trusts.
Several other cases highlighted the unique strictures according to which
investment companies, their affiliates, and governing bodies are required to
operate under the Investment Company Act of 1940. In In the Matter of The
Gabelli Group, lnc., 54 the adviser and other affiliates of two registered
investment companies consented to the entry of an administrative order
finding that they participated in a joint enterprise with the funds (i.e., the
concerted acquisition and holding of stock of a company included within the
19

funds' portfolios for the purpose of a leveraged buy-out of the portfolio
company by the affiliates) without first obtaining the Commission's review and
approval of the transaction, as required by Section 17(d) and Rule 17d-1 of the
Investment Company Act, as well as findings of failure to comply with the
beneficial ownership reporting provisions of Section 13(d) and Rule 13d-1 of
the Exchange Act.
In SEC v. Forty Four Management, Ltd., et al.,55 the Commission obtained a
permanent injunction against officers and interested directors of a registered
investment company, the fund's underwriter, and its adviser, finding that the
defendants had breached fiduciary duties owed to the fund and its shareholders by, among other things, causing the fund to incur legal fees (including fees
paid to one of the defendant directors) to bring a lawsuit seeking damages
solely for the benefit of the underwriter. Two defendants, both disinterested
directors of the fund, contested the Commission's allegations that their failure
to oppose the investment company's funding of the underwriter's lawsuit
constituted a "breach of fiduciary duty involving personal misconduct;' under
Section 36(a) of the Investment Company Act; these actions remained
pending at the close of the fiscal year. The remaining defendants consented to
being permanently enjoined from participating in the operation of any
registered investment company.
In a pair of unrelated administrative cases, the Commission brought its first
enforcement cases alleging violations of Section 12(b) of the Investment
Company Act, and Rule 12b-1, pursuant to which registered open-end
investment companies are authorized to adopt arrangements enabling fund
assets to be expended for the purpose of facilitating the distribution of fund
shares. In In the Matter of Carey Fund Management, Inc., 56 the Commission
alleged, among other things, that an adviser had caused the fund, notwithstanding its prospectus and proxy representations to the contrary, to acknowledge an aggregate $400,000 liability to the fund's distributor for distribution
expenses exceeding the annual ceiling of 0.4 percent of the fund's annual
average daily net assets, as was provided by the distribution plan adopted by
the fund pursuant to Rule 12b-1. The adviser was censured and ordered to
comply with remedial undertakings to forego the payment of past unreimbursed distribution expenses, to reimburse the fund for non-distributlon
related expenses previously allocated to the fund, and to institute and
maintain improved procedures to oversee the operation of any distribution
plan adopted under Rule 12b-1 by any of the adviser's current or future
investment company clients.
The second 12b-1 case was In the Matter of Continental Equities Corporation
of America, 57 in which a registered broker-dealer serving as the distributor of
shares of a complex of registered open-end investment companies consented
to findings that it had failed reasonably to supervise its employees with a view
towards preventing violations of Exchange Act recordkeeping provisions
relating to the implementation of the 12b-l distribution plans of the
investment companies. Inadequate recordation of expenses prevented the
broker-dealer from furnishing to the trustees of the investment companies
fully detailed information regarding expenses allocated for payment pursuant

20

to their 12b-l plans. The broker-dealer was censured and ordered to comply
with remedial undertakings.
Investment

Advisers

The Commission also instituted several significant enforcement actions
involving investment advisers. These actions included injunctive actions
alleging the misappropriation of client funds and seeking injunctive relief and
further equitable relief in the form of the freezing of assets, and accountings,
disgorgement and liquidation. The Commission also instituted administrative
proceedings involving investment advisers who made unsuitable recommendations and who failed to disclose to investors material information concerning the cost and execution of trades.
In SEC v. David Peter Bloom 58 the Commission obtained a permanent
injunction prohibiting an individual and his controlled corporation from future
violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. The defendants consented to findings that, without
registering as investment advisers, they had engaged in an advisory business
whereby more than $10 million of funds obtained from approximately 100
clients since January 1986 had been diverted to their own use. Instead of
investing their clients' funds in securities, as they had indicated they would,
the defendants diverted approximately $8 million to the acquisition of various
paintings, real estate, furnishings, and jewelry. Additional client funds were
expended upon substantial donations to various art and educational institutions. As ancillary remedies, the court appointed a receiver to perform an
accounting and liquidation of the defendants' assets. In parallel administrative
proceedings, the defendants also consented to the entry of orders barring
them from association with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, investment
company, or municipal securities dealer. 59
SEC v. Dennis L. Jeffers, et at.60 involved a scheme known as the "College
Assistance Program" wherein a registered investment adviser, its principal
owner, and other employees advised clients to place second mortgage loans
upon their residences and invest the proceeds of the loans in a series of highly
speculative ventures controlled by the principal owner. Clients were falsely
advised that there was little or no risk in the investment program; that their
investment would generate income sufficient to meet their monthly mortgage
expenses and the costs of educating their college-age children; and that, after
four years, they would receive a lump sum to payoff the mortgage and any
outstanding student loans, together with a residual return upon their investment. Approximately $3.1 million was raised from a total of 96 clients.
Defendants were enjoined from further violations of the antifraud prohibitions
of the Investment Advisers Act.
Several other Investment Advisers Act cases pointed up the fiduciary duties
owed by advisers to their clients. In one administrative proceeding, In the
Matter of Marie Bailey & Co., 61 a registered investment adviser and its principal
consented to the entry of an order finding that the respondents had, among
other things, failed to disclose to their clients (75 percent of whom were
referred to the registrant by registered representatives of a broker-dealer firm)

21

that use of the brokerage firm to effect transactions in their account could cost
the customers excess commissions and not result in best execution of trades.
As sanctions, the respondents were censured and ordered to comply with
remedial undertakings to, among other things, fully disclose all potential
conflicts of interest associated with the registrant's brokerage practices.
In another proceeding, In the Matter of Westmark Financial Seroices, Corp., 62
a registered investment adviser and its principal consented to the entry of an
administrative order finding that the respondents had breached fiduciary
duties owed to their clients by failing to disclose that they would receive
brokerage commissions for sale of certain securities recommended to be
purchased by their clients and that the clients could purchase the securities
from other unaffiliated broker-dealers, and by recommending securities
unsuitable for their clients' investment needs and circumstances. As sanctions, the registrant was censured and the principal was suspended from
association with any broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment
company, or investment adviser for a period of 120 days.
Finally, in In the Matter of Edwin FIShbaine,63 a registered investment adviser
consented to the entry of an administrative order finding violations of Section
17(b), the anti-touting provision of the Securities Act, as well as the antifraud
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act, based on his failure to disclose the
receipt of cash and other consideration in exchange for publishing favorable
articles and recommendations regarding the securities of various issuers. As
sanctions, the respondent's registration as an investment adviser was revoked,
and he was permanently barred.
Broker-Dealers

A major segment of the Commission's enforcement cases involve brokerdealers. Allegations in these cases typically include violations of the financial
responsibility and the broker-dealer books and records provisions, or involve
fraudulent sales practices such as excessive markups. These types of cases
remain a priority with the Commission. This past year, the Commission
instituted a broad range of enforcement actions involving broker-dealers.
The Commission filed a series of proceedings involving the conduct of a
former registered representative at a broker-dealer firm with offices nationwide, and the failure of his branch manager and the firm to adequately
supervise him. The registered representative allegedly had made material
misrepresentations and omissions in connection with his solicitation of
customers to buy almost 15 percent of the float of a company traded on the
American Stock Exchange; approximately half of this stock was purchased on
margin. Administrative proceedings were brought and settled against the
registered representative, In the Matter of Bryce S. Kommerstad,64 and the
branch manager, In the Matter of Dale E. Berlage;65 the registered representative was also enjoined, SEC v. Kommerstad.66 Noting that a system of
supervision which relies solely on supervision by branch managers is not
sufficient, the Commission censured the broker-dealer, In the Matter of Dean
Witter Reynolds, Inc.,67 and ordered it to modify, adopt and maintain procedures to assure effective supervision of the activities of its employees.
22

The Commission's financial recordkeeping and reporting provisions
require broker-dealers subject to the Currency and Foreign Transaction
Reporting Act of 1970 to report currency transactions in excess of $10,000.
In April 1988, the Commission instituted injunctive proceedings in which
a broker-dealer together with its principal officers consented to the entry of
permanent injunctions, SEC v. Flagship Securities, Inc. ,68 based on allegations that they sought to avoid currency transaction reporting requirements
by splitting deposits of cash into separate deposits on different days and
setting up fictitious accounts. In subsequent administrative proceedings, In
the Matter of Flagship Securities, Inc., 69 the broker-dealer was censured and
ordered to comply with undertakings to engage in no currency transactions
with customers, and to undergo periodic review by independent accountants. The two principals were barred for the greater of six months or the
period of incarceration or probation which may be imposed in the criminal
proceeding pending against them.
In another proceeding involving currency transaction reporting, a brokerdealer, whose employees attempted to avoid these reporting requirements by
converting cash into checks to be deposited in customers' accounts, was
censured and undertook to review and revise its internal control procedures In
the Matter of E.F. Hutton & Co., Inc. 70 The manager of the branch office which
engaged in the conduct was suspended for 30 days. An administrative
proceeding was also instituted against a salesman at the branch office, In the
Matter of Brian J. Lareau.71 This proceeding was pending at the close of the
fiscal year.
In In the Matter of Paine Webber, Inc. 72 the Commission found that excessive
markups had been charged to customers in sales of stripped United States
Treasury bond coupons. The registered broker-dealer, which set up a program
of voluntary repayment, was censured and ordered to comply with procedures
designed to prevent a reoccurrence of the conduct.
In other settled administrative proceedings, the Commission barred a
registered representative of a broker-dealer from association with any broker,
dealer, municipal securities dealer, investment adviser or investment company on the basis of his criminal conviction in California State Court involving
the theft of over $93,000 in customer funds, In the Matter of Paul Gerald
White. 73 In a proceeding against an unregistered broker-dealer who engaged
in the business of selling securities, In the Matter of Petro-Source Securities,
Inc.,74 the Commission also imposed a bar, with a right to reapply after three
years.
Finally, the Commission instituted proceedings which alleged that a brokerdealer had allowed persons who had been convicted of crimes to become
associated with it, in violation of Section 15(bX6) of the Exchange Act, and
had also allowed an individual subject to an outstanding Commission bar to
become associated with it. At the close of the fiscal year, the proceeding had
been settled against all respondents except the broker-dealer, In the Matter of
Robert M. Winston.75

Sources for Further Inquiry

The Commission publishes in the SEC Docket litigation releases which
describe its civil injunctive actions and criminal proceedings involving
securities-related violations. Among other things, these releases report the
identity of the defendants, the nature of the alleged violative conduct, and the
disposition or status of the case. Commission orders that institute administrative proceedings or provide remedial relief also are published in the SEC
Docket.

Full Disclosure System

The full disclosure system is administered by the Division of Corporation
Finance. The system is designed to provide investors with material information, foster investor confidence, contribute to the maintenance of fair and
orderly markets, facilitate capital formation, and inhibit fraud in the public
offering, trading, voting, and tendering of securities.

Key 1988 Results
Administration of the full disclosure program was affected by a number of
economic and legal developments in fiscal year 1988. In the months immediately following the October 1987 market break, there was a significant
decline in the number of registered public offerings filed with the Commission. Throughout the year, the number of those filings remained below prior
year levels. A total number of 3,484 registration statements were filed in fiscal
year 1988 (exclusive of post-effective amendments and filings that become
effective without staff action), a decrease of 29 percent from the prior fiscal
year. That decrease resulted from a 28 percent decline in the number of debt
offerings (77 4 versus 1,082) and a 29 percent decline in equity offerings (2,710
versus 3,841). The number of initial public offerings (IPOs) decreased in fiscal
year 1988 by 23 percent from fiscal year 1987, which included an 18 percent
decline in registration statements filed on Form S-18 with the regional offices
(687 versus 835). Over half of the regional filings (56 percent) were blank
check offerings, representing a 1 percent increase from the prior fiscal year
(384 versus 380). Resources in the regional offices continued to be needed to
review post-effective amendments containing new financial statements and
descriptions of properties and businesses acquired with the proceeds of such
blank check offerings. With the decline in the number of filings under the
Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act), the staff was able to review the financial
statements and management's discussion and analysis in approximately twice
as many annual reports. Additional resources were used to review tender offer
and merger proxy filings, which increased considerably in the last three
quarters of the year. A special review of registrants' disclosures in their
management's discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of
operations was undertaken.
A major focus of the program was the far-reaching implications of the
increasing internationalization of the securities markets. Securities markets
around the world are changing as an increasing number of issuers offer both
debt and equity across national boundaries and in offerings in several markets
at one time. As a result, the lines of demarcation between international and
domestic capital markets are beginning to blur, and domestic markets face
serious competition from a largely unregulated, international financial mar-

25

keto Internationalization of the markets raises numerous issues under United
States securities laws for domestic issuers raising capital offshore, and for
foreign issuers selling to United States investors, at home or abroad. In its
activities during the year, the Commission took action to address the
internationalization of the securities markets, including proposing rules to
govern the transnational scope of the registration requirements of the
Securities Act. The Commission also proposed a safe harbor from the
registration requirements for resales of securities to institutions, which may
afford foreign issuers greater access to United States capital markets. The
Commission also undertook discussions with the Canadian provinces of
Ontario and Quebec concerning development of a coordinated registration
process for multi-jurisdictional securities offerings and tender offers.
In other rulemaking activity, the Commission adopted rules that eliminated
the need for issuers to file preliminary proxy material under certain circumstances, expedited the availability of no-action and interpretive letters,
reduced the statutory aftermarket prospectus delivery period for certain public
securities offerings, and exempted securities held by participants in employee
benefit plans from certain shareholder communications requirements. The
Commission also adopted rules intended to facilitate capital formation by
small businesses. These included an expansion of the accredited investor
definition under Regulation 0, and a provision exempting from registration
securities of non-reporting issuers offered pursuant to compensatory benefit
plans. In addition, the Commission issued an interpretive release regarding
issuer disclosure obligations with respect to the defense contract procurement
inquiry, and submitted proposed legislation to the Congress to modernize the
Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (Trust Indenture Act).
Review of Filings
During the year, the Division continued its efforts to have at least 50 percent
of its review staff comprised of accountants. As this program recognizes,
accounting expertise is essential to review the increasingly innovative financial instruments being publicly offered, and the complex and diverse capital
structures being created as a result of recent financing transactions. With an
increased percentage of accountants, review efforts will be concentrated on
financial statements and related management's discussion and analysis
disclosures of issuers.
During fiscal year 1988, the staff fully reviewed the financial statements and
related management's discussion and analysis disclosures of 2,941 reporting
issuers, issuers which file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act). This was accomplished through the full review of 599
reporting issuer registration statements filed under the Securities Act, 2,166
Form 10-K annual reports, and 314 merger proxies, and through the full
financial statement review of the annual reports of 567 issuers. The staff
reviewed 1,444 and 156 registration statements filed by new issuers under the
Securities Act and the Exchange Act, respectively, proxy material relating to
93 contested proxy solicitations, 276 going private transaction filings, and
26

248 Schedules 14D-1 with respect to third-party tender offers for 213 issuers.
In addition, another 78 Schedules 140-1 were reviewed with respect to 9
limited partnership roll-up transactions. The table below sets forth the number
of selected filings receiving a review during the last five fiscal years.

Rulemaking, Interpretive, and Legislative Matters
Scope of Registration

Requirements

On June 10, 1988, the Commission published for comment proposed new
Regulation S, a series of rules intended to clarify the extraterritorial application of the registration provisions of the Securities Act.76 Proposed Regulation
S consists of a general statement that the registration provisions apply to
offers and sales that occur within the United States, but do not apply to offers
and sales that occur outside the United States. The general statement would
provide that the elements to be examined in determining whether an offer or
sale is made outside the United States include the locus of the offer or sale,
the absence of directed selling efforts in the United States, the likelihood of
the securities coming to rest outside the United States, and the justified
expectations of the parties to the transaction as to the applicability of the
registration requirements.
The proposed regulation also provides safe harbor provisions designed to
protect against an indirect offering in the United States. One safe harbor (the
issuer safe harbor) would apply to offers and sales by issuers, securities
professionals participating in the distribution process pursuant to contract,
and their affiliates. The other safe harbor (the resale safe harbor) would apply
to resales by other persons. Two general conditions would apply to the safe
harbors. First, the sale must be made in an "offshore transaction;' and second,
no directed selling effort could be made in the United States.
The issuer safe harbor would establish several classes of securities based on
the nationality and reporting status of the issuer, and the degree of United
States market interest in the issuer's securities. In addition to the general
requirements, a class would be subject to specific restrictions on sales,
depending on the degree of likelihood that the securities sold would "flow
back" to the United States. The resale safe harbor would permit persons not
affiliated with either the issuer or professionals involved in the distribution
process to resell any securities in generally the same manner in which they
could be sold in a primary distribution, and also to resell certain securities on
or through the facilities of a foreign securities exchange.
Resales to Institutional Investors
On October 21, 1988, the Commission published for comment a proposed
new Rule 144A that would provide a non-exclusive safe harbor from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act for resales to institutions with
respect to three tiers of transactlons.F The first tier (the qualified institutional
buyer tier) would permit unlimited resales of any securities of any issuer,
provided that the purchaser was a specified institution with assets in excess of
$100 million, or that the seller reasonably believed that the purchaser was
such a qualified institution. The second tier (the non-fungible securities tier)
would allow unlimited resales of securities to a wider class of specified
institutions if securities of the class offered or sold were not traded publicly in
the United States, and the securities were non-convertible debt securities,
28

non-convertible preferred stock, or securities issued by a company subject to
the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act. The third tier (the fungible
securities tier) would cover resales of non-convertible debt securities, nonconvertible preferred stock, and securities of reporting companies that are
traded in a public market in the United States to the same class of institutions
as permitted in the second tier. Such resales would be subject to greater
restrictions than resales made pursuant to the first two tiers.
Change in Holding Period for Restricted Securities
In the release proposing new Rule 144A, the Commission also proposed
amendments to the rules concerning the public resale of restricted securities
that would amend the provisions of those rules relating to the required holding
period for such securittes.?" To sell restricted securities under current Rules
144 and 145, a person must have beneficially owned the securities for at least
two years, no matter how long a period has transpired since the issuer or any
affiliate thereof originally sold the securities. Requiring the securities to be
held for two years by each successive holder before permitting public resales,
without regard to the time elapsed from the actual offering by the issuer or
affiliate, appears unnecessarily restrictive. Accordingly, the amendments
would redefine the two-year holding period to commence on the date the
securities were acquired from an issuer or its affiliate, and to run continuously
from the date of the acquisition. A comparable change would be made in the
calculation of the three-year period prescribed by Rule 144(k).
Proxy Rules
On December 21, 1987, the Commission adopted amendments to its proxy
rules that were proposed in fiscal year 1987. The amendments eliminated
filing requirements for preliminary proxy and information statements where
the only matters to be considered at a non-contested annual shareholder
meeting are the election of directors, selection or ratification of auditors,
andlor shareholder proposals.I?
Shareholder Proposal Rule
In the release adopting the proxy rule amendments, amendments to the
shareholder proposal rule also were adopted.P? These amendments deleted
the provision that had permitted exclusion of a shareholder proposal from a
registrant's proxy materials where a proponent delivered written proxy materials to holders of more than 25 percent of a class of the registrant's securities.
They also specified requirements with respect to requests by a registrant for
documentary support of a proponent's beneficial ownership.
Shareholder Communications
On April 27, 1988, the Commission adopted amendments to exclude
specified employee benefit plan participants from the operation of the proxy
processing and direct communications provisions of the shareholder communications rules.'" Under these amendments, the exclusion is mandatory with
29

respect to participants in employee benefit plans established by the registrant,
but optional where such plans are established by an affiliate of the registrant
and hold registrant securities. In either case, the registrant is required to cause
proxy material to be furnished to plan participants. The definition of employee
benefit plan was also amended, for purposes of the shareholder communications rules, to include those plans that are established primarily for employees, but also include other persons, such as consultants.
Prospectus Delivery Requirements
On April 4, 1988, the Commission adopted an amendment to its rule
governing the obligation of dealers to deliver prospectuses in aftermarket
transactions following registered public offerings of companies not subject to
the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.82 For registered offerings of
securities listed on a national securities exchange or authorized for inclusion
in an electronic inter-dealer quotation system of a registered securities
association, the amendment reduced the 40 or 90 day prospectus delivery
period to 25 calendar days after the date of the offering.
Change in Fiscal Year/Quarterly Reporting
On June 2, 1988, the Commission published for comment a proposal to
revise the reporting requirements applicable when an issuer changes its fiscal
year end.83 The Commission also proposed revisions to make the new
reporting requirements consistent with the existing quarterly reporting system, and to modify the period covered in a new registrant's first quarterly
report. The proposed rules would permit the filing of a quarterly report for
transition periods of less than six months, in lieu of a more detailed annual
report. The proposed rules also would codify existing staff administrative
practices relating to acceptance of less than full year financial statements.
Acquisitions by Limited Partnerships
On July 8, 1988, the Commission published for comment two alternative
versions of a new Rule 465 concerning Securities Act disclosure requirements
for acquisitions by limited partnerships during the selling period for a
registered public offering.84 The proposed rule would permit automatic
effectiveness of post-effective amendments that are filed to provide information concerning significant acquisitions by blind pool limited partnerships in
specified industries. Under both alternatives, offers and sales of limited
partnerships could continue after an acquisition became probable, if the
prospectus were supplemented with specified acquisition information and a
post-effective amendment containing required acquisition information were
filed by a specified date. Under either alternative, failure to file the posteffective amendment in a timely manner would require the sales effort to be
suspended until such filing occurred.
Regulation D Exemptions

From Registration

Requirements

On March 3, 1988, the Commission adopted several amendments
30

to the

rules comprising Regulation D, which provides certain exemptions from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act.85 The amendments revised
the definition of accredited investors to (a) include additional institutional
investors such as savings and loan associations, credit unions, broker/dealers,
and certain trusts, partnerships, and corporations; (b) permit a joint as well as
an individual income test for accrediting natural persons; and (c) eliminate a
purchaser of securities valued at $150,000 or more. For some transactions,
the total offering price limit was raised from $500,000 to $1 million, if at least
$500,000 is registered at the state level, and a general solicitation now will be
permitted in states which provide no qualifying registration procedure under
certain circumstances. A new level of disclosure requiring that a certified
balance sheet be prepared was also adopted for offerings of less than $2
million.
At the same time, the Commission proposed several additional revisions to
Regulation D.86 The proposed revisions would add to the list of accredited
investors certain employee benefit plans established and maintained by state
governments or their political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities.
The proposed revisions also would eliminate the requirement to file a Form D
as a condition to the Regulation D exemption, and would provide that isolated
and minor deviations from the requirements of Regulation D that occur
despite a good faith and reasonable attempt to comply would not cause loss
of the exemption.
Securities Act Exemptions for Compensatory Benefit Plans
On April 14, 1988, the Commission adopted Rules 701, 702, and 703,
which provide an exemption from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act for certain offers and sales of securities made pursuant to the
terms of compensatory benefit plans or written contracts between the issuer,
its parent or majority owned subsidiaries, and their employees, directors,
general partners, officers, consultants, and advisors, if the issuer is not subject
to the reporting requirements of the Exchange Act.87 The amount of securities that may be subject to outstanding offers in reliance on the exemption,
plus the amount of securities sold in the preceding 12 months pursuant to the
exemption, may not exceed $5 million. The rules also require that a Form 701
be filed with the Commission no later than 30 days following the first sales
which bring aggregate sales over $100,000.
Defense Contracts Procurement Inquiry
On August 1, 1988, the Commission issued a statement with respect to the
disclosure obligations of companies affected by the government's inquiry into
illegal or unethical activity in the procurement of defense contracts.88 The
statement reminded registrants of their obligations under the federal securities laws to disclose material information on the inquiry. Among other
matters, specific attention was directed to the requirements of Regulation S-K
regarding disclosure of a registrant's business operations, material legal
proceedings involving the registrant or its management, and management's
31

discussion and analysis of the registrant's financial condition and operating
results. The Commission also reminded registrants that the disclosure
requirements apply equally to companies that are subject to the inquiry, and
to companies that, although not targeted in the investigation, otherwise may
be materially affected by it.
Publication of No-Action and Interpretive Letters
On April 7, 1988, the Commission adopted rule amendments to provide for
the expedited publication of interpretive and no-action correspondence at the
time a response is sent or given to the requesting party, unless temporary
confidential treatment is granted.89 The Commission simultaneously codified
the application of the existing publication rule to certain exemption letters.
Trust Indenture Legislative Proposal
On November 30, 1987, the Commission submitted to Congress its
recommendations for amendment of the Trust Indenture Act.90 If enacted, the
proposed bill, entitled the Trust Indenture Reform Act, will comprehensively
modernize federal regulation of publicly offered debt securities. Under the
proposed bill, mandatory indenture terms would be self-executing and
imposed by law, a measure that will simplify preparation of indentures.
Conflicts of interest would be relevant to a trustee's eligibility only after
default. The proposal also would broaden the Commission's exemptive
authority to allow variation from the statute, and would allow foreign
trusteeships in specified circumstances.
Conferences
SEC Government-Business

Forum on Small Business Capital Formation

The seventh annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small Business
Capital Formation was held in Washington, D.C. on September 26-27, 1988.
Approximately 250 small business executives, accountants, attorneys, government officials, and other small business representatives were in attendance. The format of the conference was structured around a series of lectures
and discussion groups on debt financing techniques. A report on the forum
will set forth a list of recommendations for legislative and regulatory changes
developed by the participants. The report will be sent to Congress and made
available to the public.
SEC/NASAA Conference under Section 19(c) of the Securities Act
On April 18-19, 1988, approximately 60 senior staff officials of the
Commission met with approximately 65 representatives of the North American Securities Administrators Association in Washington, D.C. to discuss
methods of effectuating greater uniformity in federal and state securities
matters. Following the conference, the staff issued a final report that described
a number of resolutions that were approved, summarized the discussions of
the working groups, and identified conference participants.

Accounting and Auditing Matters
Key 1988 Results
Fiscal year 1988 was characterized by a number of significant public and
private sector initiatives intended to enhance the reliability of financial
reporting and to ensure that the accounting profession meets its important
public responsibilities imposed under the federal securities laws.
For example, the Commission adopted rules to improve the disclosures
concerning changes in independent accountants and initiated a related rule
proposal which would accelerate the timing of these disclosures. The Commission also issued a rule proposal to require managements of publicly held
companies to explicitly state their responsibilities for the presentation of
financial information and the effectiveness of their companies' internal
controls. Also. under Commission oversight, the Auditing Standards Board of
the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) adopted nine
new auditing standards designed to enhance auditors' communication and
responsibilities. These actions are reflective of a comprehensive system of
public and private sector initiatives-which
includes the Commission's programs, private sector standard-setting, the peer review program of the AlCPA,
state licensing activities, and civil litigation-under
which the integrity of
financial reporting for public companies is constantly being reviewed, modified and improved.
The following are the primary Commission programs to achieve compliance
with the accounting and financial disclosure aspects of the federal securities
laws:
• Rulemaking initiatives to supplement

accounting standards, implement
financial disclosures and establish independence criteria for
accountants;
• The review and comment process resulting in improvement of filings,
identification of emerging accounting issues (which can result in
rulemaking or private sector standard-setting), and identification of
problems warranting enforcement actions;
• The enforcement program imposing legal sanctions and serving to
deter irregularities by enhancing the care with which registrants and
their accountants analyze accounting issues; and
• Oversight of private sector efforts, conducted principally by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) and the AICPA, to
establish accounting and auditing standards and to improve the quality
of audit practice.
The Commission's review and comment process and enforcement programs
are discussed elsewhere in this report. The remainder of this section summarizes the Commission's accounting-related rulemaking initiatives and its
oversight of private sector activities. In addition, this section comments on
33

several initiatives addressing issues arising out of the continued internationalization of the securities markets.
Accounting-Related Rules and Interpretations
Regulation S-X provides guidance as to the form and content of financial
statements filed with the Commission. The Commission has also adopted
various rules that specify disclosure of financial information outside of the
financial statements. For example, certain supplementary financial information, selected financial data, and a management's discussion and analysis of
a company's financial condition and results of operations are required by
Regulation S-K. In addition to requiring financial disclosure by registrants,
Commission rules also address the qualifications of accountants (including
their independence) and accountants' reports on financial statements.
To address significant accounting issues, the Commission may issue
interpretive releases and, when announcing rule changes, provide guidance
for compliance with new or amended rules. In addition, the Commission staff
periodically issues Staff Accounting Bulletins (SABs) to inform the financial
community of the staffs views on accounting and disclosure issues.
Nine SABs were issued during fiscal year 1988. The SABs addressed topics
such as: the appropriate income statement classification by utilities for
disallowed or abandoned plant costs; requirements for financial statements of
properties securing mortgage loans; the application of the "push down" basis
of accounting; the appropriate disclosures concerning the potential impact of
issued but not yet adopted accounting standards; the appropriate financial
reporting for a proposed Mexican Debt Exchange transaction; the effect of
certain de minimis sales by affiliates on pooling of interests accounting; the
appropriate accounting for the allocation of debt issue costs; accounting for
quasi-reorganizations; and accounting for transactions undertaken by a company's principal shareholder for the benefit of the company?'
National Commission on fraudulent financial Reporting
In recognition of the accounting profession's responsibilities in the area of
reliable and complete financial reporting, various organizations came
together to sponsor the National Commission on Fraudulent Financial
Reporting (Treadway Commission).92 The Treadway Commission studied
issues involved in the prevention and detection of fraud in the context of
financial reporting, and issued its final report in October 1987.93 The report
contains recommendations for the public company, the independent public
accountant, the Commission, and others to improve the regulatory and legal
environment.
The SEC has taken the following rulemaking actions in areas discussed in
the Treadway Commission report.
Opinion Shopping-The SEC has adopted amendments to its disclosure
requirements regarding changes in accountants and potential opinion shopping sltuatlons.P" Subsequent to fiscal year end, the SEC also adopted rule
amendments to accelerate the timing for reporting these disclosures.f"
34

Management Reports- The SEC has proposed requiring a report regarding
management's responsibilities for the preparation of the registrant's financial
statements and the registrant's system of internal controls.P"
Peer Review-The SEC has proposed mandatory peer review for auditors of
SEC registrants.97
Tunely Reviews By Auditors of Interim Information- The SEC voted to issue
a concept release soliciting comments on whether its rules should be
amended to require that a registrant's independent accountant review on a
timely basis interim financial information filed with the SEC.
In addition to these rulemaking activities, the SEC has taken the following
other actions on matters discussed in the Treadway Commission report.
Enforcement Remedies- The SEC forwarded to Congress a legislative
proposal entitled the "Securities Law Enforcement Remedies Act of 1988;'
which would permit assessment of civil money penalties in administrative and
civil proceedings under the federal securities laws, would permit the SEC and
the courts to suspend or bar violators of these laws from service as an officer
or director of any company that files reports with the SEC, and would expand
the scope of Section 15(cX4) of the Exchange Act to cover violations of the
proposed Act. 98
Reexamination of Audit Committee Requirements by Exchanges- The Commission voted to communicate with self-regulatory organizations (other than
the New York Stock Exchange, which already imposes a requirement for an
audit committee comprised of members independent of management) to
encourage them to consider upgrading and expanding the scope of their audit
committee standards.
Oversight of Private Sector Standard-Setting
Through active oversight, the Commission monitors the structure, activity,
and decisions of the private sector standard-settinq organizations.
FASB-Financial statements filed with the Commission are presumed to be
misleading unless they are prepared in accordance with accounting principles
that have substantial authoritative support. In this regard, the Commission's
approach has been to look to the FASS to establish and improve accounting
principles, and the FASS's performance continues to be generally satisfactory.
Oversight of the process involves not only Commission review of the
standards established by the FASS, but also the direct participation of staff
members and, in some instances, the Commission itself in the initial setting
of standards. The Commission and its staff monitor the progress of FASS
projects and developments closely, maintain frequent contact with the FASS
to discuss topical issues, and participate in meetings, public hearings, and
task forces.
During fiscal year 1988, some constituents expressed concern about the
nature and extent of FASS standards. While the Commission recognizes the
right of all parties to express their concerns, criticisms and suggestions for
change (and indeed encourages such expressions), it believes that the FASS's
independence and the openness of its processes are vital to the FASS's ability
to serve the public interest and perform its tasks well. The Commission staff
35

is working with the FASB and the Financial Accounting Foundation to
consider practical ways to improve the FASB's procedures while maintaining
its independence and openness.
A brief discussion of FASB activities follows.
Postemployment Benefits Other Than Pensions-Subsequent
to fiscal year
end, the FASB issued an exposure draft of a standard on employers' account.
ing for postemployment benefits other than pensions.99 Research has indlcated that the cost of these benefits is significant for some companies and the
FASB has tentatively concluded that postretirement health care benefits
represent a form of deferred compensation and that an obligation should be
recognized as services are rendered. A public hearing is planned on this
subject for 1989.
Income Taxes-In December 1987 the FASB issued a statement on accounting for income taxes. 100 The statement changes the method of accounting for
income taxes by adopting a liability approach resulting in, among other
things, the recognition in current earnings of the impact of an enacted change
in corporate income tax rates. Subsequent to fiscal year end, the FASB
decided to defer the effective date of this statement for one year to allow
companies and their auditors more time to effect compliance with the
statement. 101 Also, the FASB will publish interpretive gUidance to assist
companies and accountants in implementing the new standard.
Financiel lnstrumems-« The FASB continues to work on its major long-term
project to address financial instruments and off-balance sheet financing
issues. An exposure draft was issued in November 1987 that would require
certain disclosures about financial assets, liabilities and instruments not now
recognized in the financial statements. 102 Subsequent parts of the project will
include issues related to: (a) accounting for rlsk-transfer instruments such as
guarantees and interest rate hedging instruments; (b) off-balance sheet
financing arrangements; (c) the appropriate measurement basis for financial
instruments; and (d) accounting for securities with both debt and equity
characteristics, including the impact on stock compensation.
Other Activity- The FASB also issued statements during the fiscal year
dealing with: accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for long
duration contracts; and sales and leasebacks involving real estate.t03 Other
significant projects on the FASB's agenda include: (a) consolidations and the
reporting entity; (b) discounting; and (c) impairment of long lived assets.
Tunely Finencisl Reporting Guidance-The FASB's efforts to provide more
timely guidance on emerging issues resulted in the issuance during fiscal year
1988 of a technical bulletin concerning accounting for mortgage servicing
fees and rights. 104 Subsequent to fiscal year end, technical bulletins dealing
with the right of setoff and accounting for leases were issued. 105
The FASB's Emerging Issues Task Force (EITF), in which the Commission's
Chief Accountant participates, continues to perform an important and useful
role in identifying and resolving accounting issues. Since its inception in
1984, the EITF has discussed over 190 issues covering a broad range of topics
including financial instruments, business combinations, accounting for lever.
aged buyouts (LBOs), and income taxes. Registrants are expected to follow the
36

positions agreed upon by the EITF. Those that do not follow these positions
will be asked to justify departure from any consensus reached.
AICPA-In addition to oversight of the private sector process for setting
accounting standards, the Commission also oversees various activities of the
accounting profession conducted primarily through the AICPA. These
include: the Auditing Standards Board (ASB) which establishes generally
accepted auditing standards; the Accounting Standards Executive Committee
(AcSEC) which provides guidance on specific industry practices through its
issuance of statements of position and practice bulletins and prepares issue
papers on accounting topics for consideration by the FASB; and the SEC
Practice Section of the Division for CPA Firms (SECPS) which seeks to
improve the quality of audit practice by member accounting firms that audit
public companies through various requirements, including peer review.
ASB-During fiscal year 1988, the ASB adopted nine auditing standards in
connection with its so-called "expectation gap" project. 100 The standards were
developed in close cooperation with the Commission's staff. The new standards should enhance and clarify auditors' responsibilities and thus promote
better audits.
AcSEC-AcSEC has a key role in the identification of accounting practices,
including those in specialized industries not sufficiently addressed by existing
authoritative literature. During fiscal year 1988, the Commission staff worked
with AcSEC to provide guidance in a number of areas, including accounting
for past due interest received in connection with the Brazilian debt restructuring, accounting for the airline industry (including frequent flyer awards),
accounting for revenues relating to computer software, and various issues
relating to government contractors. Also, the Commission's Chief Accountant
sent a letter during fiscal year 1988 requesting AcSEC to address accounting
issues related to the recognition of interest received in connection with various
kinds of lending activities by financial institutions and others. AcSEC
responded by undertaking a project in this area.
SECPS- The membership requirements of the SECPS are designed to
strengthen the quality control systems of member firms, thus enhancing the
consistency and quality of practice before the Commission. According to the
1988 SECPS annual report, 87 percent of public companies are audited by
SECPS member firms, and the revenues of those companies constitute 99
percent of the total revenues of all public companles.P" Member firms are
committed to a tri-annual peer review under the close scrutiny of the Public
Oversight Board (POB). The SECPS also reviews and makes inquiries regarding the quality control implications of alleged audit failures involving public
clients by SECPS member firms.
The Commission exercises oversight of the SECPS through frequent
contact with the POB and members of the executive and peer review
committees of the SECPS. In addition, the staff reviews POB files and selected
working papers of the peer reviewers. This oversight has shown that the peer
review process contributes significantly to improving the quality control
systems of member firms and, therefore, that it should enhance the consistency and quality of practice before the Commission.

37

International Accounting and Auditing Standards
Significant differences currently exist between countries in accounting and
auditing standards. These differences serve as an impediment to multlnational offerings of securities. The Commission, in cooperation with other
members of the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSC),
has participated in initiatives by international bodies of professional accountants to establish appropriate international standards which might be considered for use in multinational offerings. For example, the Commission staff has
worked with the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC), an
international body with membership in 71 countries, to revise international
accounting standards. In fiscal year 1988, an IOSCIIASC working group
proposed significant changes in the international accounting standards to
reduce accounting alternatives as an initial movement toward appropriate
international accounting standards. Subsequent to fiscal year end, the IASC
published the proposals for a nine month comment period. Issues of completeness and lack of specificity in international accounting standards still
need to be addressed.
The Commission staff also began to work with the International Federation
of Accountants (IFAC)to revise international auditing guidelines. Auditors in
different countries are subject to different independence standards, perform
different procedures, gather varying amounts of evidence to support their
conclusions, and report the results of their work differently. The Commission
staff, as part of an IOSC working group, began participating this year in a
project by IFAC to expand and revise international auditing guidelines to
narrow these differences. The Commission staff will continue to participate in
these initiatives.

The EDGAR Project
Introduction
The primary purpose of EDGAR is to increase the efficiency and fairness of
the securities markets for the benefit of investors, securities issuers, and the
economy. Through EDGAR, information will be filed electronically for acceptance and review by the Commission staff. Once accepted, public information
also will be rapidly available to investors, the media and others via computer
screens in the Commission's public reference rooms and through various
subscription services. When fully operational, EDGAR will accelerate dramatically the filing, processing, dissemination and analysis of time-sensitive
corporate information filed with the Commission.
The EDGAR Pilot system completed its fourth full year of successful
operation on September 24, 1988. It has demonstrated clearly the feasibility
of electronic filing and review procedures. As of the end of fiscal year 1988,
over 40,000 electronic filings had been made since September 1984.
The Commission also continued to move ahead with its plan to develop a
fully operational EDGAR system. Offers were received initially on April 29,
1987 in response to the Commission's Request for Proposals. The Operational
contract was awarded on January 3, 1989 to The BDM Corporation, bidding
with Mead Data Central, Sorg Incorporated, and Bechtel Information Services.
Pilot System
The Pilot system serves a group of volunteer companies whose filings are
processed by the Corporation Finance Division and the Investment Management Division. At the end of fiscal year 1988, there were over 500 registrants
fully participating in the Pilot. In addition, over 900 other registrants were
participating in the Pilot on a partial basis by electronically submitting filings
of specific form type. The latter group includes investment companies
submitting annual and semi-annual reports on Form N-SAR, registered
public utility holding company systems or subsidiaries submitting forms
required under the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and institutional
investment managers submitting Form 13 F-E to report securities held in
their managed accounts.
During fiscal year 1988, several enhancements were added to the Pilot to
make electronic filing more convenient and to test potential features of the
Operational system. For example, a multiple registrant filing procedure was
added on April 23, 1988. This enhancement enables up to ten co-registrant
companies to be named when submitting one filing. Prior to the change, the
Pilot procedures required each registrant to submit a separate filing. One of
the registrants (the "primary" filer) submitted the text of the entire filing and
each of the other registrants (the "non-primary" filers) submitted a filing

39

consisting of a statement incorporating by reference the primary filer's filing.
The new, streamlined procedures allow a single filing to be submitted on
behalf of all registrants involved. The filing is stored only once on the system,
but is keyed to each registrant listed in the submission header so that it can
be displayed on an EDGAR terminal as a filing by each registrant. In addition,
a complete microfiche copy of the filing is made for each registrant and the
filing is entered in the Commission's workload system for each registrant.
Another Pilot enhancement involves the acceptance of special characters by
the Pilot. The Pilot was designed to accept electronic text only in the American
Standard Code for Information Interchange (ASCII). The ASCII character set
includes letters, numbers and a few special characters such as spaces, periods,
commas and dollar signs. However, the ASCII set excludes many common
control characters such as vertical tab (VT), line feed (LF), and form feed (FF).
These characters were considered invalid for direct Pilot transmissions.
Consequently, when a filer workstation inadvertently transmitted such characters to the Pilot, the filing was either rejected or the invalid characters
appeared in the text of the filing. To avoid these difficulties, filers had to ensure
that these special characters were removed from their filings before transmission. As of June 30, 1988, the Pilot system was enhanced to recognize and
accept specific control characters in direct transmissions. This change has
simplified direct transmission of electronic filings since it permits more
effective use of popular word processing and communications software on filer
workstations.
In April 1988, an updated version of IBM's operating system software was
successfully installed on the Pilot mainframe. As a result of this change, the
Pilot operates more efficiently and is easier to maintain.
During fiscal year 1988, an independent validation and verification test
procedure for Pilot enhancements was developed and implemented. It is
designed to test new system features in a user/filer environment before they
are incorporated in the Pilot production system. These tests are in addition to
the normal program and system tests that have always been performed by the
Pilot contractor. The effectiveness of this test procedure will be monitored with
a view toward adopting it for use in the development of the Operational
system.
Operational System
During the past fiscal year, plans for Operational EDGAR continued to move
forward. The EDGAR RFP was originally released on May 7, 1986 and bids
were received on February 27, 1987. However, prior to awarding the contract,
the Commission announced its intention to reopen competition because of a
change in the funding strategy for the Operational contract.
On October 23, 1987 an amended RFP was issued, with proposals due in
late January 1988. After two extensions, the Commission received initial
proposals for the Operational EDGAR system on April 29, 1988. Preliminary
evaluation of those proposals was completed in October 1988. Following
face-to-face discussions with the offerors, best and final proposals were

40

received on December 2, 1988. The Operational contract was awarded on
January 3, 1989 to the BDM Corporation bidding with Mead Data Central,
Sorg Incorporated, and Bechtel Information Services.
Benefit Analysis
In fiscal year 1988, the Commission contracted with the MITRE Corporation
to perform an independent study of the external (non-SEC) benefits and costs
of the EDGAR Operational system, including one-stop filing. One-stop filing
would occur if a filing made with the Commission also could be utilized to
fulfill filing requirements with state regulatory agencies and self-regulatory
organizations (SROs) such as the New York Stock Exchange. The study took
several months to complete, and the two final reports were delivered to the
Commission in late December, 1988 and early January, 1989. A previous
Commission study had documented the expected SEC internal benefits and
costs of Operational EDGAR.
In doing the external benefit/cost study, MITRE analyzed three possible
scenarios. First, MITRE analyzed the external benefits and costs attributable
to the EDGAR Operational system assuming it will be developed as defined by
the EDGAR RFP.The RFP provides for the transmittal of designated electronic
filings from EDGAR to the SROs or their agent, and to the states through their
agent, the North American Securities Administrators Association (NASAA).
Based on the MITRE analysis, the EDGAR system, as defined by the RFP,
would have net external benefits in excess of $200 million over the eight year
life of the EDGAR contract. Based on the earlier SEC study, the net internal
benefits of EDGAR would exceed $20 million over the same period. Thus, the
total net benefits over eight years are calculated to exceed $220 million. These
benefits are more than double the estimated cumulative cost of the Pilot and
Operational systems combined including the contractor-funded cost of disseminating the electronic filings under a regulated fee schedule.
Second, MITRE analyzed the incremental benefits and costs that would be
attributable to one-stop filing if the EDGAR system were enlarged to accommodate direct, interactive access to the EDGAR database by the states
through its agent, NASAA, and the self-regulatory organizations. Based on
the MITRE analysis, the EDGAR system with direct, interactive access by
NASAA and the SROs would realize a significant fraction of $150 million as
net external benefits over the life of the EDGAR contract. These incremental
benefits would exceed the estimated $20 million in additional costs that would
be required to expand the EDGAR system to permit direct, interactive access
by NASAA and SROs representatives.
Finally, MITRE analyzed the incremental benefits and costs attributable to
one-stop filing if the EDGAR system were augmented with "satellite" EDGARcompatible systems at NASAA and two major SROs. Based on the MITRE
analysis, the estimated incremental cost of this approach would be $30
million for establishing and operating satellite EDGAR system to NASAA only
or $75 million for establishing and operating satellite EDGAR systems at
NASAA and two major SROs.

41

Office of EDGAR Management
The Commission has enhanced its managerial and technical expertise in
preparation for the Operational system by creating a separate Office of
EDGAR Management.
The Director reports to the Chairman of the Commission and has overall
responsibility for the procurement, implementation and operation of the
EDGAR system. In addition to overseeing the Office of EDGAR Management,
the Director is the Contracting Officer for the project with responsibility for
maintaining liaison within the Commission and with filers and users of the
filed information. The Director will be assisted in these tasks by a professional
staff consisting of a Deputy Director and a counsel, as well as three branch
chiefs. Staffing for fiscal 1988 included approximately 15 positions.
Conclusion
Although there have been several delays in the award of the contract for
Operational EDGAR, the Commission is firmly committed to proceeding with
it. Following the award of the EDGAR contract in January 1989, work will
focus on the design of the Operational system and the associated rulemaking.

Key 1988 Results
The Division of Market Regulation, with the assistance of the regional
offices, is charged with the responsibility of overseeing the operations of the
nation's securities markets and market professionals. In fiscal year 1988 over
11,000 broker-dealers and nine active exchanges, as well as the overthe-counter markets, were subject to the Commission's oversight.

The October 19, 1987 market break generated several analyses and studies,
including an 850-page report by the Division. After the market break the
Commission responded to Congressional inquiries, provided testimony, developed legislative proposals, processed rule proposals from the various selfregulatory organizations (SROs), and conducted inspections of SRO activities
related to the markets' volatility.
Fiscal year 1988 was also an active year in the international arena.
Additional multinational market linkages were completed and memoranda of
understanding were concluded with other countries to share needed regulatory and surveillance information.
The broker-dealer field examination program was enhanced through the
use of portable computers to review firms' net capital and mark-up compliance. Further enhancement to the program is underway through the development of software that focuses on sales practice activities.

Securities Markets, Facilities, and Trading
The October 1987 Market Break

108

During October 1987, the nation's securities markets experienced an
extraordinary surge of volume and price volatility. The most widely followed
indicator of the United States stock market, the DowJones Industrial Average
index of 30 New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) stocks, had reached an
intra-day record high of 2746.65 on August 25, 1987. On October 2, the DJIA
closed at 2640.99. During the week of October 5, the index declined by
158.78 points and, during the week of October 12, by 235.47 points. On
October 19, the DJIA declined 508.32 points, and by its low point mid-day on
October 20 it had declined to 1708.70, or over 1,000 points (37 percent) below
its August 25 high. Even with its erratic but substantial recovery over the next
few trading sessions, by October 30, the DJIA stood at 1,994, down over 26
percent from its August high.
Broader indexes also declined sharply for the month of October. For
example, the Standard & Poors index of 500 stocks declined 21.8 percent, and
the composite indexes for the nation's three principal equities markets, the
NYSE, the American Stock Exchange (Amex), and the National Association
of Securities Dealers' automated quotations system (NASDAQ) for overthe-counter stock trading, experienced declines in October of 21.9 percent, 27
percent, and 27.2 percent, respectively. Similarly, record-breaking trading
volume was experienced on each market. On the NYSE, projections that
trading volume would increase steadily from daily averages of less than 200
million shares to daily averages of more than 300 million shares were
shattered by consecutive 600 miIlion share trading sessions on October 19
and 20. The American Stock Exchange and NASDAQmarkets were similarly
tested by record trading with average daily volume for the week of October 19
of 31.7 and 244.4 million shares, respectively, compared to average daily
volume in September of 12.4 and 148.3 million shares, respectively.
In light of these extraordinary events, the Division conducted a comprehensive study of the causes, effects, and regulatory ramifications of this market
activity. The purpose of the resulting report was to provide an independent
factual basis to enable the Commission to determine appropriate regulatory
responses to help ensure the soundness of the nation's securities markets and
the protection of investors. 109
The primary focus of the Division's report was the effect of derivative
products upon the securities markets in general, and on the October
market in particular. The Division found that although no single factor
caused the market break, the existence of various trading strategies
involving derivative stock indexes accelerated or exacerbated the decline.
The Division concluded that the market break left a legacy of continued
high volatility and decreased market quality. Further, these factors were
believed to have potentially long-term negative effects on the participation
of individual investors in the stock market. Finally, while citing its
continued belief that the derivative index markets perform valuable
hedging and market timing functions, the Division made a large number of

44

~


recommendations
for corrective action, including the introduction of
trading in market baskets of stocks, increased margins and modified price
limits for futures transactions, and improved reporting requirements.
The Division also reviewed the responsibilities and performance of
exchange specialists. It concluded that, despite questionable practices on the
part of some firms, on the whole specialists met their market making
obligations. The Division did stress, however, that the NYSE and the Amex
should review carefully individual specialist performance and commence
reallocation proceedings or disciplinary action where appropriate. The Division also reviewed the capital requirements of specialists in light of the
changing market environment. Similar analyses were conducted for market
makers in the over-the-counter market, and specialists and market makers in
the options markets. The report also included comprehensive reviews of the
financial responsibility rules, clearance and settlement systems, exchange
and NASDAQ operational performance, and issuer repurchase activity.
In addition, the Commission devoted considerable resources to the preparation of Congressional testimony regarding the October 1987 market break.
In particular, the Chairman testified at various times before the Senate
Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs; the Senate Committee on
Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry; the Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce; and the
House Committee on Agriculture. In general, the testimony focused on
descriptions of the Commission's actions during and after the market break
and outlined numerous financial market reforms designed to lessen the
likelihood of another serious market decline.
In late June and early July 1988, the Commission transmitted to Congress
a series of legislative proposals designed to enhance the efficiency and
fairness of the United States capital markets and to help avoid future market
declines. 110 The Commission's proposed legislation, if enacted, would have
(1) granted the Commission emergency authority regarding trading hours,
position limits, and clearance and settlement; (2) allowed the Commission to
suspend securities trading during emergencies; (3) permitted the Commission
to require enhanced reporting of large securities positions and of the activities
of holding company systems; (4) required coordination of clearance and
settlement; (5) modified the margin-setting structure for stocks and stock
index derivative products and required that margin be set at "prudential"
levels; and (6) transferred to the Commission jurisdiction over equity index
futures and options on such futures.
The Commission also responded to a significant number of Congressional
inquiries during fiscal year 1988 pertaining to the Commission's actions and
recommendations regarding the October 1987 market break. 111 These letters
discussed, for example, contingency planning and information-sharing during
market emergencies, upgrading of securities exchanges' order handling and
execution systems, and international cooperation regarding the securities
markets.
The Commission participated in the President's Working Group on Financial Markets, which was appointed by President Reagan to consider the major

45

issues and recommendations included in the various studies of the October
1987 market
break and possible actions
to carry out those
recornrnendatlons.W
The Working Group, which, in addition to Chairman
Ruder, included top officials of the Treasury Department, the Federal Reserve
Board, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, submitted a report
to the President in May 1988.113 The Working Group's report contains
recommendations regarding trading halts, margin levels for securities and
derivative products, coordination of clearance and settlement systems, and
contingency planning for market emergencies.
The Commission also participated actively in the formulation and implementation of various actions taken by the SROs to address the problems
associated with the October 1987 market break. Market reforms were undertaken by the SROs in a wide range of areas, including trading systems'
capacity; individual investor access to markets; market maker performance
and capital; market information, coordination, and contingency planning;
clearance and settlement; portfolio trading; and circuit breakers. 114 Further
information on these actions will be set out in the following sections.
The National Market System
Rule 11Aa2-1 under the Exchange Act provides procedures for designating
certain securities as National Market System (NMS) securities and Rule
lIAa3-1 requires that transactions in NMS securities be reported on a
real-time basis, increasing market efficiency and improving execution of
orders. Under these rules, all securities-whether
traded on exchanges or
over-the-counter (OTC)-for which transaction reports are required to be
submitted pursuant to an effective transaction reporting plan are designated
as NMS securities. As a result of the October market break, the number of
OTC securities designated as NMS securities decreased to 2,900, about 200
less than in fiscal year 1987.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission approved a number of NASD
proposals relating to market structure issues. The Commission approved a
proposal that authorizes the NASD to halt OTC trading in exchange-listed
securities when the primary market for the securities halts trading pending
the dissemination of material news. lIS The Commission also approved a
proposal by the NASD to develop a new service consisting of a low-speed
ticker signal through which subscribers could obtain a moving display of last
sale reports for all NASDAQ/NMS securities from any of a number of
vendors.116
In addition, the Commission adopted an amendment to its rule governing
transaction fees, to continue to exempt exchange transactions in OTONMS
securities from the imposition of Section 31 transaction fees for one year.117
The Amex and NASD submitted rule proposals to establish systems to
facilitate trading of unregistered securities. Arnex's proposed system, called
SITUS (System for Institutional Trading of Unregistered Securities), would be
available only to institutions, and would include only the securities of
non-reporting compenles.U'' On the other hand, the NASD's proposal,
PORTAL(Private Offerings, Resale and Trading through Automated Linkages),
46

would be open to both institutions and highly capitalized individuals and
would include the securities of any foreign or domestic "world-class"
company.119 The Division has requested that the Amex and NASD provide,
prior to publication of the proposals for comment, specific information
regarding the clearing and trading facilities of their systems and the Commission's access to trading information.
The Commission published for comment an NASD proposal to establish a
permanent subscriber fee of $50.75 per month for each interrogation or
display device receiving NASDAQ transaction and quotation data disseminated through the National Quotation Data Service (NQDS), and to request
that the Commission approve the retroactive application of the fee to all
subscribers currently receiving the NQDS from vendors. 120
Finally, the Commission issued a release endorsing the North American
Securities Administrators' Association (NASAA) development of "Blue Sky"
exemptive standards for NASDAQlNMS securities that are comparable to the
States' exemptive standards for exchange-listed securities. 121
National System for Clearance and Settlement of Securities Transactions
During fiscal year 1988, the National Clearance and Settlement System
(National System) was tested by high trading volume and price volatility. As
reported in the Commission's testimony before Congress and as described in
the Division of Market Regulation's Report on the October 1987 Market Break,
all components of the National System performed well despite the pressures
of unprecedented volume and price volatility.l22 Nevertheless, the Commission's testimony and the Division's Report contain many recommendations for
enhancements to all components of the National System.l23
As reported above, the Commission participated actively in the President's
Working Group on Financial Markets. The Interim Report of the Working
Group details many initiatives for consideration and implementation to
improve intermarket clearing, credit and payment systems.F" During fiscal
year 1988, the Commission worked actively with clearing agencies, banks,
broker-dealers and other federal regulators to consider and implement those
changes. For example, the Commission granted the Intermarket Clearing
Corporation (ICC) temporary registration as a clearing agency 125 and
approved proposals by ICC and the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC) to
establish mechanisms for maintaining and margining portfolios of options
and futures contracts on related underlying foreign currency and stock index
products.P" The Commission also submitted to Congress proposed legislation that would, among other things, authorize the Commission and the
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) to facilitate the development of coordinated clearing facilities for securities, options and related
futures transactions.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission approved clearing agency proposals that continued expansion of the services of the National System to
mortgage-backed, U.S. Government, mutual fund, and municipal securities.
For example, the Commission approved, as a permanent service, the National
Securities Clearing Corporation's (NSCC) Mutual Fund Settlement, Entry, and
47

Registration Verification Service, which provides centralized automated handling of mutual fund orders. 127 The Commission also approved the temporary
registration of the Government Securities Clearing Corporation, to provide
comparison services for inter-dealer and brokers' brokers' trades in U.S.
Treasury securttles.F" The Commission also extended the temporary registration of MBS Clearing Corporation (MBSCC), which provides clearing and
certificate depository services for mortgage-backed securities.129
Securities

Immobilization

The October 1987 market break tested securities industry processing
systems with unprecedented high volume. As discussed in the Division of
Market Regulation's report on the market break, efforts during the last decade
to immobilize securities certificates and to automate, to the extent possible,
transfer agent and securities depository recordkeeping and transfer tasks
facilitated smooth processing of record numbers of transfers and deliveries. 130
In fiscal year 1988, the Commission continued to make progress in its
efforts to facilitate the immobilization of securities certificates. For example,
the Commission approved changes to NYSE and NASD rules to require that
members use securities depositories to confirm, affirm and settle institutional
trades in corporate equity securities for delivery against payment or receipt
against payment. 131 Also, the Commission approved, as a permanent system,
the Depository Trust Company's (DTC) same-day funds settlement system,
which expands DTC's certificate immobilization and book-entry delivery
services to certain securities settling in same-day funds, such as municipal
notes and auction-rate preferred stock. 132
Internationalization
As part of its secondary market internationalization program, the Commission continued to foster the development of international linkages between
clearing agencies and to foster foreign participation in the National Clearance
and Settlement System. For example, the Commission issued two no-action
letters concerning links that will facilitate settlement of international securities transactions through centralized clearing entities. International Securities
Clearing Corporation (ISCC) entered into a link agreement with Centrale de
Livraison de Valeurs Mobilieres (CEDEL) whereby ISCC members who also are
members of CEDEL may request ISCC to transmit instructions to CEDEL
concerning custody, clearance and settlement within the CEDEL system. 133
ISCC also entered into a link agreement with Central Depository (Pte) Ltd.
(CDP), a subsidiary of the Stock Exchange of Singapore, whereby ISCC would
maintain a sponsored account at DTC for the custody of U.S. securities held
by members of CDp'134 The Commission also approved OCC rule changes
that permit members to deposit certain Canadian government securities to
meet OCC margin requtrements.P"
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission took several actions with respect
to the application of Rules 10b-6, 1Ob-7, and 10b-8 under the Exchange Act
to offerings involving concurrent United States and foreign distributions. Rule
48

10b-6 proscribes certain conduct by persons participating in a distribution to
prevent such persons from artificially conditioning the market for a security to
facilitate the distribution. Rule 1Ob- 7 governs market stabilization activities
during distributions. Rule 10b-8 governs the market activities of participants
in a rights offering. The Commission continued to review and grant requests
for relief under these anti-manipulation rules for multinational offerings on a
case-by-case basis. The Commission's actions permitted non-Gnited States
distribution participants to continue certain customary market activities in
foreign jurisdictions, subject to certain conditions designed to prevent a
manipulative impact on the United States market. For example, letters were
issued which permitted Spanish,136 United Kingdom,137 and Norwegian 138
distribution participants to bid for and purchase securities in their respective
domestic markets during multinational rights distributions in accordance
with certain "passive market making" conditions. 139
As a result of the enactment of the Financial Services Act of 1986 (FSA) in
the United Kingdom (U.K.), United States (U.S.) broker-dealers doing business
in the U.K. require authorization by U.K. regulators and, among other things,
those firms become subject to U.K. net capital standards. The U.K. regulators
are authorized by the FSA to disapply U.K. net capital standards where waiver
would not result in undue risk to investors. In August 1988, U.K. regulators
(i.e., the Securities and Investments Board (SIB), the Bank of England (BoE)
and four U.K. self-regulatory organizations 140) entered into an information
sharing agreement with the Commission and four U.S. self-regulatory organizations (SROs) 141 permitting the U.K. regulators to rely on U.S. SROs and
the Commission to monitor the capital adequacy under U.S. capital requirements of U.S. brokerage firms that have branches in the U.K.
The terms of the agreement provide that the SIB, the BoE and U.K. SROs
will waive their capital adequacy rules as to particular broker-dealers where
the U.S. SROs provide to the U.K. regulators copies of quarterly reports filed
with them and certain other non-routine information of a material nature
related to the financial or operational condition of the broker-dealers. The
Commission agreed to notify the SIB or BoE where it becomes aware that a
particular broker-dealer's financial or operational condition is materially
impaired. The U.K. regulators agreed to notify the Commission where they
become aware that a U.K. branch of a U.S. broker-dealer has a substantial
financial, operational or other problem.
In response to the increasing cross-border activities of securities firms, the
Commission issued a release clarifying the United States broker-dealer
registration requirements under the Exchange Act for foreign brokerdealers.142 The release included a staff interpretive statement regarding the
applicability of United States broker-dealer registration requirements to
foreign entities engaged in securities activities involving United States investors, and sought comments prior to adopting a Commission interpretive
statement on this subject. In the release, the Commission also proposed for
comment Rule 15a-6, developed from previous staff interpretive positions,
which would exempt from broker-dealer registration foreign entities that deal
with certain non-United States persons or with specified United States
49

institutional investors under limited conditions. Subsequently, the Commission published a comment letter presenting an alternative formulation of
proposed Rule 15a-6 that would broaden the scope of Rule 15a-6 to include,
in rule form, the substance of the staffs interpretive statement. 143

Options and Other Derivative Products
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission reviewed several rule changes that
were intended to address market volatility concerns, including the problems
disclosed in the staffs study of the October 1987 market break. First, the
Commission reviewed rule changes submitted by the NYSE, Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE), Arnex, NASD, and Midwest Stock Exchange
(MSE) that established, on a one-year pilot basis, coordinated circuit breaker
procedures. The new rules provide for a one-hour halt in the trading of all
equity and options securities after a 250-point decline in the Dow Jones
Industrial Average (DJIA) and a two-hour trading halt after a 400-point
decline. 144The Commission also reviewed an NYSE proposal to apply certain
limitations on program trading when the price of the Standard and Poor's 500
Stock Index futures contract traded on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange
(CME) falls 12 points below the previous day's closing value. Also examined
was an NYSE proposal to provide priority delivery to the specialist's post, via
the NYSE's Designated Order Turnaround System (DOT), to individual investors' market orders of 2,099 or fewer shares on any trading day on which the
DJIA moves 25 points from the previous day's close. These three proposals
ultimately were approved early in fiscal year 1989.145 These procedures
replaced a six-month NYSE pilot program that had prohibited index arbitragerelated stock transactions through DOT on days when the DJIA had moved 50
or more points from the previous day's close. 146
Second, the Commission approved an NYSE rule change that adopted, on
a permanent basis, certain auxiliary market opening procedures to accommodate increased order flow experienced on quarterly expirations of stock
index derivative products. 147These procedures permit the NYSE to handle in
a more orderly and efficient manner the large volume of stock trading that
often occurs on quarterly expirations.
Third, in the wake of the October 1987 market break, the Commission
approved rule changes by the options exchanges in November 1987 and May
1988, to amend their rules to increase customer margin requirements for
equity and index options. 148
In fiscal year 1988, the Commission worked on new derivative product
proposals in several different areas. First, the CBOE submitted to the
Commission a proposed rule change containing procedures that will be
applicable to participants in the CBOE's joint venture with the Chicago Board
of Trade (CBT).149
Second, pursuant to Section 2(aXl XB)of the Commodity Exchange Act, the
Commission sent to the CFTC several comment letters concerning proposed
new stock index futures contracts. Among these was a letter not objecting to
the designation of the CBT as a contract market to trade futures contracts on
the CBOE 50 and 250 Stock Indexes.15o The CBOE 50 and 250 both are
50

capitalization-weighted indexes. The CBOE 50 is comprised of the 50
highest-capitalization stocks traded on the NYSE that are eligible for options
trading on the CBOE, while the CBOE 250 includes the highest market value
United States equities listed on the NYSE. The futures contracts will trade on
the CBOE floor pursuant to the CBOE/CBT joint venture agreement.
The Commission's comment letters also dealt with a variety of proposals
evidencing the growing internationalization of markets. The Commission sent
~

to the CFfC a letter not objecting to designation of the CST as a contract

,

market to trade futures contracts based on the CBT Japanese Stock Index
(TOPIX).151The TOPIX is a capitalization-weighted stock index based on the
prices of all of the approximately 1,110 stocks traded in the first section of the
Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE).
In addition, the Commission sent a letter to the CFfC not objecting to the
designation of the CME as a contract market to trade futures contracts on the
Nikkei Stock Average (Nikkei). 152The Nikkei is a price-weighted stock index
based on the prices of 225 stocks traded in the first section of the TSE. The
Commission also sent a letter to the CFfC not objecting to designation of the
CME as a contract market to trade options on its Nikkei futures contracts. 153
Further, the Commission sent a letter to the CFfC not objecting to the
designation of the CME as a contract market to trade futures contracts based
on the Europe, Australia, and Far East (EAFE) Index.154 The EAFE is a
capitalization-weighted stock index and consists of 981 stocks from 19
nations. It is designed to be a barometer of the securities markets of Europe,
Australia, and the Far East, which represent over half of the capitalization and
trading volume of the world's stock exchanges.
The Commission also issued a comment letter to the CFfC not objecting to
designation of the Coffee, Sugar, and Cocoa Exchange as a contract market to
trade futures contracts on the International Market Index (lMI).155The IMIis a
capitalization-weighted index based on the prices of 50 foreign stocks traded
in the European Community, Japan, and Australia. The IMIcomponent stocks
are traded either directly or as American Depositary Receipts on the Amex or
the NYSE, or through NASDAQ.
In response to a CFfC request, the Commission sent a letter to the CFfC
not objecting to a CFfC no-action position concerning a Toronto Stock
Exchange proposal to offer and sell stock index futures contracts based on the
Toronto Stock Exchange "35" Index and on the Toronto Stock Exchange "35"
Spot Index to United States citizens.156 Each index is composed of 35
Canadian "blue chip" stocks included in the top 50 Toronto Stock Exchangelisted companies in terms of market value.
Third, the Commission approved two separate amendments to Rule 3a12-8
under the Exchange Act, again reflecting internationalization trends. The first
amendment designated government debt securities issued by Australia,
France, and New Zealand as "exempted securities" for purposes of the
marketing and trading in the United States of futures contracts on those
securities. 157The most recent amendment, adopted early in fiscal year 1989,
added Austria, Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Switzerland, and West
Germany to Rule 3a12-8's list of eligible sovereign issuers.158 The rule
51

previously had exempted the debt securities of Great Britain, Canada, and
Japan for purposes of futures trading.
Fourth, the Commission sent to the CFfC a comment letter on the CFfC's
advance notice of proposed rulemaking regarding the regulation of hybrid
and related lnstruments.P? Hybrid instruments combine a commodity or
option component with a traditional debt or equity security. The CFfC had
proposed a regulatory framework to determine the legal status of these
instruments, provide certain exemptions from CFfC regulation, and establish
a no-action position concerning certain hybrid products. The Commission's
letter detailed concerns about the proposal and recommended that the CFfC
rescind the notice of proposed rulemaking because many of the hybrid
instruments were already adequately regulated under other laws.
In fiscal year 1988, the Commission also took several actions relating to the
options exchanges' automated order routing and execution systems. In
particular, the Commission approved a proposed rule change filed by the
Amex to expand its automatic execution system, known as Auto-Ex, to all
equity options on a permanent basis. 100 The expansion is designed to afford
public customers a more efficient method of executing small market and
marketable limit orders in such options. The Commission also approved a rule
change by the CBOE to make the CBOE's Retail Automatic Execution System
(RAES) a permanent facility for classes of equity options designated by the
CBOE.161 Finally, the Commission approved a rule change by the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx) that established as a pilot program a small order
options routing system called the Automated Options Market (AUTOM)
system. 162
In other significant actions, the Commission approved a rule change
modifying the hours that trading in foreign currency options may be conducted on the Phlx.163 The rule change provides Phlx with the flexibility to
conform its trading hours to coincide with trading hours in the European and
Far East foreign exchange markets.
The Commission approved a proposed rule change filed by the CBOE to
speed up the opening rotation process for Standard & Poor's 100 Stock Index
options (OEX), especially during extreme market conditions such as those
encountered during the October 1987 market break. 164 The Commission also
approved a CBOE rule change to list long-term index and equity option series
that expire 12 to 24 months from the time they are Iisted.165
In addition, the Commission approved CBOE and Amex rule changes that
provide for a one-year pilot program during which public customers may
apply for a "hedge exemption" from broad-based index option position
Iimits.1OO The Commission also approved rule changes from the CBOE, the
Amex, the Phlx, and the PSE that provide for a two-year pilot program during
which certain hedged positions will be exempt, without application, from
equity option position Iimits.167
In fiscal year 1988, the securities self-regulatory organizations published
revised policy statements concerning their respective prohibitions of index
options frontrunning.l68 Frontrunning generally refers to trading a stock,
option or future while in possession of material non-public information

52

regarding an imminent block transaction that is likely to affect the price of the
stock, option, or future.
Finally, in a proceeding under Section 19(c) of the Exchange Act, the
Commission held public hearings regarding whether to adopt Rule 19c-5,
which would establish a policy permitting the trading in more than one market
of the same options on exchange-listed stocks and direct the options
exchanges to remove their current regulatory restrictions on such "multiple
trading." 169 The proposed rule was under consideration at year-end.
Regulation of Brokers, Dealers, Municipal Securities
Transfer Agents

Dealers, and

Broker-Dealer Examinations
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission staff expanded its use of portable
computers to conduct broker-dealer examinations. Regional office examiners
were provided with computers as well as with training in the use of net capital
and mark-up software programs developed during 1987. Also, the Commission fostered coordination among various SROs regarding the practical use of
computers in their own examination programs and continued its development
of additional software programs.
The broker-dealer oversight program continued to emphasize reviews of
sales practice activities at large, national firms. On-site sales practice and
operations reviews were performed at both the headquarters and branch
offices of such firms. In addition, numerous oversight examinations of
newly-registered government securities firms were conducted. In preparation
for examining these firms, regional office examiners were provided with
special training, as well as a checklist and a manual tailored for examinations
of government securities broker-dealers.
The number of enforcement referrals continued to increase from previous
years. As a result of a broad range of violations found during examinations,
there was a 23 percent increase in these referrals in fiscal year 1988. For
instance, a special sweep of examinations at a large number of "penny stock"
broker-dealers resulted in referrals to enforcement for numerous sales practice
violations, including undisclosed, excessive mark-ups on principal trades.
The Commission staff completed 510 examinations, of which 421 were
oversight and 89 were cause examinations. The number of oversight examinations completed represents an eight percent decrease from the prior year,
whereas the number of cause examinations represents a 37 percent increase.
The decrease in oversight examlnations and the increase in cause examinations resulted from the need for the Commission to respond to crisis situations
growing out of the October 1987 market break and to an increased incidence
of sales practices abuses by penny stock broker-dealers.
Municipal Securities Underwriters
The Commission issued a release proposing for comment Rule 15c2-12
under the Exchange Act, which would require municipal underwriters partic53

ipating in offerings exceeding $10 million to (a) obtain and review copies of
nearly final official statements prior to bidding for or purchasing the offerings;
(b) contract with issuers or their agents to obtain final official statements in
sufficient quantities to make them available in accordance with rules established by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB); and (c) make
available copies of preliminary and final official statements to investors and
other interested persons on request.'?? In the release, the Commission also
emphasized the responsibility of municipal underwriters to have a reasonable
basis for believing in the accuracy of key representations concerning the
securities that they underwrite, and requested comment on a proposal by the
MSRB to establish a central repository to collect information concerning
municipal securities.171
The Commission took these steps in conjunction with the release of its
report concerning municipal securities regulation 172 and the staffs report
concerning the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) default. 173
The staff report examined the circumstances surrounding the default on $2.25
billion of municipal revenue bonds issued by WPPSS to finance the construction of two nuclear power plants, and discussed significant areas in which
disclosures made to investors were deficient. The Commission report set forth
a four-part approach to developments related to municipal securities disclosure, including (a) proposing for public comment Rule 15c2-12; (b) emphasizing the responsibility of municipal securities underwriters, under the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, to have a reasonable basis
for recommending the securities that they underwrite in both negotiated and
competitive offerings; (c) commenting favorably on other initiatives, such as
the Government Finance Officers Association Disclosure Guidelines and the
development of the Government Accounting Standards Board, and seeking
comment on the MSRB's proposal to establish a central repository for
municipal securities disclosure documents; and (d) issuing a supplemental
staff memorandum concerning unit investment trusts, which are a substantial
component of the municipal securities market, and which will undergo special
inspections by the Commission's Division of Investment Management and its
regional offices to determine whether regulatory changes are needed.
Government Securities Brokers and Dealers
Several government securities brokers that are registered with the Commission under Section 15C of the Exchange Act (Applicants) requested an
exemption from the registration requirements of Section 15(a) regarding the
offering of securities by those firms to the public in connection with a federal
program to reduce foreign military debt to the United States. 174 The promissory notes underlying the securities were guaranteed only 90 percent as to
principal and interest by the Defense Security Assistance Agency of the
Department of Defense, and the remaining 10 percent was secured by United
States Government securities or derivatives thereof. Without deciding
whether the securities were government securities within the meaning of
Section 3(aX42) of the Exchange Act, the Commission exempted the Applicants from the requirements of Section 15(a), based on Applicants' represen-

54

tations that they would (a) effect transactions in these securities exclusively
with broker-dealers or government securities broker-dealers registered with
the Commission pursuant to Section 15(a); (b) comply with alI rules adopted
by the Secretary of the Treasury under Section 15C, including applicable net
capital regulations; and (c) publish quotations and effect transactions in these
securities solely in connection with their normal activities as interdealer
brokers in the government securities markets. 175
Bank Securities Activities
In conjunction with the federal banking regulators, the Commission submitted to Congress proposed amendments to S. 1886, the Financial Modernization Act of 1987. The amendments included various provisions relating to
the status of banks under the Exchange Act registration requirements for
securities "brokers" and "dealers." The definition of "broker" in the Exchange
Act would have been amended to exclude a bank unless it publicly solicited
brokerage business or received incentive compensation for brokerage. Brokerage for trust accounts would not have been included, however, unless the
bank received incentive compensation and publicly solicited brokerage
business other than by advertising, in conjunction with advertising its other
trust activities, that it effected securities transactions. This exemption for trust
accounts would not have applied to securities safekeeping, self-directed
Individual Retirement Accounts, or managed agency or other functionalIy
equivalent accounts of the bank, unless the bank did not publicly solicit this
business and did not receive incentive compensation for these activities.
Also, exemptions from the "broker" definition would have been created for
so-called bank "networking" arrangements, where a bank contracted with an
independent broker-dealer to provide brokerage services on the premises of
the bank; transactions for employee benefit accounts; bank "sweeps" of
depositors' funds into money market accounts; transactions in certain exempt
securities, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, or commercial bills;
banks' transactions for their affiliates' accounts; and primary offerings of
securities by an issuer, not involving a public offering, to certain purchasers.
Banks that limited their brokerage activities to fewer than 1,000 transactions per year (other than transactions exempted from the amended "broker"
definition), and that did not have a subsidiary or affiliate registered with the
Commission as a broker-dealer, also would have been excluded from the
"broker" definition. Further, a bank without a securities affiliate could have
effected transactions in municipal securities without being deemed a
"broker;" where the affiliate existed, however, the bank would have been
required to spin out alI its municipal securities dealing business into the
affiliate.
The proposed amendments would have amended the "dealer" definition in
the Exchange Act in a complementary fashion, by excluding banks that
engaged in certain purchases and sales for their own account. A bank would
not have been deemed a "dealer" by engaging in transactions involving
exempted securities other than municipal securities, or commercial paper,
bankers' acceptances, or commercial bills. Similarly, trust and other fiduciary
55

activities would not have brought a bank within the amended "dealer"
definition. A bank that engaged in the issuance or sale of securities backed by
or representing an interest in obligations originated or purchased by the bank
or its affiliates or subsidiaries also would not have been a "dealer," provided
that the underlying obligations were not third-party securities. In addition, a
bank without a securities affiliate could have bought and sold municipal
securities without being deemed a "dealer."
Moreover, the proposed amendments would have conferred on the Commission the authority to exempt, by rule. regulation. or order. any person or
class of persons from the amended "broker" and "dealer" definitions consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, or the purposes of the
Exchange Act. The broker-dealer registration requirements in Section 15 of
the Exchange Act would have been amended to require banks that came
under the amended "broker" or "dealer" definitions to create a separate
subsidiary or affiliate to perform these activities. unless they engaged in these
activities on an exclusively intrastate basis. This change would not have
restricted. however, the substantive authority of any bank or bank holding
company, under the national banking laws or any provision of state banking
law. to offer any permitted securities brokerage or dealing services through an
affiliate or subsidiary.
Congress did not enact the proposed amendments before adjourning.
Broker-Dealer Registration Application

The Commission adopted revisions to Form BD. the uniform broker-dealer
registration application, to provide that the applicant's consent to service of
process would apply to actions or proceedings brought by the Commission or
any self-regulatory organization in connection with the applicant's brokerdealer activities,176 and to an application for a protective decree filed by the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (SIPC).177
Short Sales

In August 1988, the Commission adopted Rule lOb-21(T) under the
Exchange Act to address manipulative short selling prior to underwritten
public offerings.178 The rule prohibits a person who effects short sales of an
equity security during the period beginning at the time that a registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933 relating to the same class of equity
securities is filed and ending at the time that sales may be made in the
offering. from covering such short sales with offered securities purchased from
an underwriter or other broker or dealer participating in the offering. The
Commission adopted Rule lOb-21(T) on a temporary basis to consider, at a
later date, whether the rule is achieving its intended purpose.
Lost and Stolen Securities

During fiscal year 1988, the Commission adopted changes to Rule 17f-l
under the Exchange Act. which sets forth participation, reporting, and inquiry
requirements for the Lost and Stolen Securities Program (program). Among
56

other things, the amendments to Rule 17f-1 require government securities
brokers and dealers to participate in the Program.179
Statistics for the calendar year 1987 (the most recent year available) reflect
the Program's continuing effectiveness. As of December 31, 1987, 21,356
institutions were registered in the Program. During the year, registered
institutions reported as lost, stolen, missing or counterfeit 643,648 certificates
valued at $2,765,976,343. Those institutions also reported the recovery of
192,611 certificates valued at $685,518,298. At the end of 1987, the value of
securities contained in the Program's data base was $12,837,687,098. Registered institutions made inquiry concerning 2,195,967 certificates. Inquiries
concerning 2,564 certificates valued at $9,230,307 matched reports of lost,
stolen or missing securities on file in the data base.

Oversight of Self-Regulatory Organizations
National Securities

Exchanges

As of September 30, 1988, nine active exchanges were registered with the
Commission as national securities exchanges. During the fiscal year, the
Commission granted exchange applications to delist 71 debt and equity
issues and 15 options issues and granted applications by issuers requesting
withdrawal from listing and registration for 31 issues. In addition, during the
fiscal year, the Commission granted 1,142 applications by exchanges for
unlisted trading privileges.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission adopted Rule 19c-4 under the
Exchange Act (commonly called the "one share-one vote" rule). This new rule
amends exchange and association (i.e., NASD) rules to prohibit the listing on
an exchange, or the authorization for quotation on an inter-dealer quotation
system, the common stock or other equity securities of a company, if it issues
securities or takes other corporate action that would have the effect of
nullifying, restricting, or disparately reducing the per share voting rights of its
existing common stock shareholders.P? The Commission adopted the rule
after holding public hearings on the issue in December 1986, and again in
July 1987.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission received 180 proposed rule
changes from the stock exchanges. The Commission approved several
significant rule filings, including proposals of the NYSE to revise Rule 103A,
the Exchange's Specialist Performance Evaluation and Improvement Process.
The revisions, among other things, incorporate newly developed objective
performance measures into the Rule 103A process, codify Exchange reallocation procedures, and establish minimum standards for specialist performance. The revised Rule is being implemented on a two-year pilot basis. The
Commission also approved a NYSE proposal that amends both the minimum
standards for listing on the Exchange and for continued listing, particularly to
take into account the special trading characteristics of very high-priced stock
issues.181
The Commission approved an NYSE rule proposal that significantly
strengthens the requirements for internal trade review, reporting, and other
57

compliance procedures for NYSE members. 182 Under the rule, NYSE member
firms are now required to establish procedures for the review of member,
employee, and proprietary trades for violations of securities laws and
Exchange rules prohibiting insider trading and the use of manipulative or
deceptive devices. NYSE members also would have to prepare an annual
report for internal review by management detailing compliance efforts and
problems during the previous year. The Commission also approved proposed
rule changes from the Amex and NYSE that eliminate the maximum limit on
the amount of fines that may be imposed in connection with an exchange
disciplinary action.183
An NYSE proposal to regulate off-floor telephone access to members on
the floor of the Exchange was approved by the Commission during fiscal
year 1988.184 The rule specifically prohibits the use by members of
portable telephones on the floor, but permits telephone wire linkages to
members' off-floor offices. While the rule also allows a specialist unit to
establish a telephone link to its off-floor offices, it prohibits using such
telephones to transmit to the trading floor any orders for the purchase or
sale of securities.
In addition, the Commission approved proposed rule changes from the
NYSE, Amex, and CBOE that require member firms to submit certain
customer and proprietary trading information in an automated format. 185 The
exchanges routinely request this information in connection with their market
surveillance inquiries. Automating such submission should facilitate the
Exchanges' efforts in this area.
The Commission also approved proposed rule changes of the NYSE and
Amex that raise capital requirements from $100,000 to $600,000 for Amex
specialists and from $100,000 to $1 million for NYSE speclaltsts.l'" In
addition, early in fiscal year 1989, the Commission approved a proposed rule
change of the NYSE that raises capital requirements for other members who
execute transactions on the floor from $50,000 to $100,000.187
The Commission approved a proposed rule change by the PSE that permits
the addition of up to five specialist posts each for its Los Angeles and San
Francisco equities trading floors, for a total of up to 10 new specialist posts. 188
It also approved. for a six month trial period, a proposed rule change by the
Boston Stock Exchange (BSE) that permits the Exchange to establish an
automated, small order communication, order routing and execution system
for member organizations to be known as BEACON.189
Finally, the Commission approved a proposed rule change from the NYSE
that, among other provisions, requires the registration of securities lending
representatives, securities traders and their direct supervisors; expands the
definition of the term "registered representative" to include employees
involved in the handling of accounts or orders for the purchase or sale of
securities or handling of business in connection with investment advisory or
investment management services; and requires that securities lending representatives and their direct supervisors sign a "code of ethics" agreement as an
addendum to their Forms U-4, the uniform SRO application form for the
registration of members' associated persons. 190
58

Other significant Commission activities relating to its oversight of exchange
and NASD rulemaking, including developments in the options markets, are
discussed in the section of this chapter, above, entitled "Securities Markets,
Facilities, and Trading."
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
The NASD, the only national securities association registered with the
Commission, has over 6,500 member firms. In fiscal year 1988, the NASD
reported a total of 712 final disciplinary actions, which consisted of 542 formal
and summary disciplinary actions by its District Committees and 170 formal
and summary actions by its NASDAQ and Market Surveillance Committees.
In addition, the Commission received 64 filings of proposed rule changes
from the NASD and approved 54 proposed rule changes in fiscal year 1988.
Among the important changes approved by the Commission 191 were proposals to create a link for the transmission of end-of-day quotations in certain
NASDAQ securities to the Stock Exchange of Singapore, 192 and to establish
the Order Confirmation Transaction (OCT) service allowing eligible firms to
negotiate trades and confirm order executions of all sizes through computer
terminals.193 The Commission also approved an NASD proposal, based in
large part on the October 1987 market break experience, requiring participation in the NASD's Small Order Execution System (SOES) for all market
makers in NASDAQlNMS securities. 194 This rule further provides that SOES
will continue to operate when the inside quote is locked or crossed and
prohibits those who voluntarily withdraw as market makers in NASDAQ
securities from re-entering quotes in NASDAQ for 20 business days. The
Commission also reviewed NASD proposals which, in general, prohibit the use
of non-cash compensation in connection with the sale of direct participation
programs and in public offerings of other securities.195
The Commission also examined an NASD proposal, approved in early fiscal
year 1989, that is designed to improve the regulatory environment with
respect to OTC securities that are not part of the NASDAQ system (so-called
"pink sheet" stockS).l96 Under the proposal the NASD established an electronic system for mandatory price and volume reporting by members for these
securities and amended its Best Execution Interpretation relating to retail
transactions in these stocks. In addition, the Commission published for
comment an NASD proposal to establish a six-month pilot program for the
electronic display of current market-maker quotations and expressions of
interest in pink sheet stockS.197
Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board
In fiscal year 1988, the Commission received seven proposed rule changes
from the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board and approved 11 MSRB rule
filings, some of which were received during fiscal year 1987. Of particular note
was the approval of an amendment concerning the delivery of interchangeable
municipal securities and the confirmation of transactions for these securities
that would permit a delivery of municipal securities to be either in registered
59

or bearer form unless the parties to the transaction specifically agree to a
particular form.198
The Division also evaluated a request from the MSRB concerning whether
stripped coupon municipal securities should be regarded as municipal
securities for purposes of the MSRB's regulatory jurisdiction. The request
raised a number of difficult legal and policy issues. The Division's response,
dated January 19, 1989, states that under certain conditions stripped coupon
municipal securities should be regarded as municipal securities for purposes
of the MSRB's regulatory jurisdiction.
Clearing Agencies
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission received 89 proposed rule
changes from registered clearing agencies and approved 86 rule changes. For
example, the Commission approved NSCC's proposal to establish comparison
services for member transactions in foreign securities,l99 MBSCC changes to
its depository division rules concerning default assessments,200 and OCC
changes to its by-laws and rules concerning cross-margin of closely-related
options and futures 201and, based largely on the October 1987 market break
experience, the waiver of margin requirements
in extreme market
conditions.202
Inspections of SRO Surveillance And Regulatory Compliance
The inspections staff devoted considerable resources in fiscal year 1988 to
gathering and analyzing trading information for the Division's October 1987
Market Break Report_ This effort was closely coordinated with similar studies
of the Presidential Task Force on Market Mechanisms (known as the Brady
Commission) and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission and included
the assistance of the Commission's regional offices and Division of Investment
Management. It encompassed collecting data directly from a wide range of
market participants, including firms active in futures-related program trading,
other broker-dealers, futures commission merchants, mutual funds, investment advisers, and others. Further, a special purpose inspection was conducted that involved field work at each of the major self-regulatory
organizations in January and February 1988 to evaluate the impact of the
market break on their operations and the adequacy of the SROs' proposed
remedial actions.
Also, a comprehensive inspection of the New York Stock Exchange regulatory programs for specialist trading was conducted between July and
September 1987. While the inspection staff found that the Exchange's
surveillance, investigatory and disciplinary programs for specialists functioned adequately, in early fiscal year 1988, the Division recommended
improvements in a number of specific areas, including increased use of minor
fines in lieu of informal discipline, remedial actions for investor complaints
involving executions of stop orders, and enhancements to file management
and documentation. In addition, recommendations were made to coordinate
better specialist disciplinary actions with the process of allocating newly-listed

60

securities to specialists. In addition to the comprehensive inspection, two
special purpose post-market break inspections were conducted in March and
April 1988. The first inspection reviewed the Exchange's final determinations
concerning inquiries into poor market-making performance by some specialists during the October 1987 market break. The inspection found that, overall,
the Exchange adequately addressed those instances of specialist performance
that generated staff investigations. The second post-break inspection reviewed
specialist financial surveillance programs. The inspection found that, while
necessary data collection enhancements still are being developed, recent
improvements to this program have responded adequately to the concerns
raised in the October 1987 Market Break Report.
An inspection of the Boston Stock Exchange found that, while interim
surveillance procedures which the Commission recommended earlier are in
place, the project to develop surveillance capabilities from the Exchange's
Automated Communications Order-Routing Network is approximately two
years behind schedule in its full implementation. The Commission recommended that this project be completed as soon as practicable.
Inspections of the Philadelphia Stock Exchange surveillance, investigatory,
and disciplinary programs for equities and options trading found that the
Exchange had addressed most of the concerns raised in the previous inspection in 1986. While these programs now are functioning adequately, with
increased automation of equities and options market surveillance, the Commission recommended that the Exchange review its procedures for detecting
prearranged trading in options and compare its procedures to those of other
exchanges to determine if further enhancements in this area are warranted.
The Commission conducted an inspection of the NASD's surveillance
program for trading in NASDAQ securities. The inspection found that while
market surveillance for NASDAQ issues is functioning adequately, there
remain certain areas where continued progress is needed, especially in the
acquisition of accurate daily audit trail data. Some of these deficiencies also
were identified by the NASD's own Regulatory Review Task Force and
consultants hired to perform an overall review of its compliance programs. The
Commission encouraged the NASD to commit resources to implement these
recommendations promptly.
The inspections staff also completed several reviews of program trading and
its effects in periods of extreme market volatility. One such study analyzed
trading on January 8, 1988, when the Dow Jones Industrial Average fell
140.58 points. This review found that while program trading was not the cause
of the market decline, it may have accelerated this price movement. Additional reviews conducted for April 6, 1988 (when the DJIA rose 64.16 points)
and April 14, 1988 (when the DJIA fell 101.46 points) found a similar
relationship between program trading and these instances of price volatility.
The reviews for April 6 and 14, 1988 also raised significant questions
regarding the effectiveness of the New York Stock Exchange's attempts to
minimize market volatility by placing restrictions on the use of automated
order-routing systems for index arbitrage programs when the DJIA moved 50
points from the previous closing value. Analyses of trading on April 6 and 14,
61

1988 indicated, however, that program orders could be routed easily without
the use of automated systems. Accordingly, revised restrictions on trading
during periods of extreme market volatility were proposed by the Exchange as
Rule 80A, and were approved by the Commission on October 19, 1988, after
the close of the fiscal year.203
The inspections staff also participated with other Commission staff and
respresentatives of the NYSE and several broker-dealers in a review of the
regulatory issues raised by trades designed to capture dividend payments.
This trading strategy has attracted considerable media and Congressional
interest because on some days trading volume associated with these strategies
accounts for unusually large percentages of daily volume in individual stocks
as well as of consolidated volume in all NYSE.listed issues. A memorandum
concerning the staffs findings was sent to Congress after the year-end.204
In addition, the inspections staff worked closely with the self-regulatory
organizations (SROs) constituting the Intermarket Surveillance Group. Two
areas were of particular concern for the Commission and the ISG in 1988.
First, efforts continued to monitor improvements in surveillance and investigatory programs to address insider trading, with particular emphasis on
reducing the average time required for the SROs to refer suspicious trading to
the Commission's enforcement staff. In this regard, progress was made in
implementing a system to have the SROs and the Commission obtain selected
trading data from broker-dealers in a standardized, electronic format as part
of the "Electronic Blue Sheeting Project." Second, the Commission, together
with the CFTC and the ISG, addressed cross-market surveillance, and related
regulatory issues, between the securities and index futures markets.
The staff conducted inspections of the advertising review programs at the
CBOE, Amex and NYSE. At the CBOE and Amex the inspections focused on
the exchanges' review of options communications submitted prior to use by
member firms and the review of member options communications during the
exchanges' routine options sales practices examinations. At the NYSE, the
inspection focused on the NYSE's review of options and equities communications submitted by members prior to use, the periodic review or "spot
checks" of a sample of all members' advertising, educational material and
sales literature conducted by the NYSE on a biennial cycle, and the review of
communications during the routine broker-dealer examination program.
Although minor deficiencies were noted in each inspection, the staff concluded that all programs were satisfactory. The staff offered recommendations
to each exchange where appropriate and concluded that some regulatory
issues requiring improved coordination among the exchanges should be
referred to the Options Self-Regulatory Council to help assure that all
exchanges use uniform standards when reviewing options communications of
broker-dealers belonging to multiple self-regulatory organizations.
The staff conducted inspections of the formal disciplinary programs at the
NASD District Offices in Atlanta, Chicago and New York. Those inspections
focused on delays in processing disciplinary matters occurring during the
earliest stages of case development (l.e., anticipated actions) and in presenting potential cases to the appropriate District Committee for initial consider62

ation. The staff found minor delays in the District Offices in Atlanta and New
York and major delays in the District Office in Chicago. The staff noted that
significant improvements had occurred in the formal disciplinary program in
New York since the last inspection of that office.
Also, the regional office staff conducted inspections of seven of the fourteen
NASD District Offices, including the Association's offices in Seattle, San
Francisco, Los Angeles, Kansas City, Chicago, Cleveland, and Philadelphia. As
in prior years, the staff noted isolated deficiencies in the Districts' financial
surveillance, cause investigation, formal disciplinary and broker-dealer examination programs. However, the staff concluded that, overall, the NASD was
successfully meeting its statutory responsibility at the District level.
The staff conducted an inspection of the CBOE to assess implementation of
changes initiated by the CBOE as the result of previous inspections of the
Departments of Compliance and Enforcement. The staff found that the
Department of Compliance conducts thorough and well-documented options
sales practice examinations and cause investigations and that the Department
of Enforcement prosecutes violations aggressively and in a timely manner. All
three programs were found to be substantially improved since the previous
inspection.
The staff conducted an inspection of the NYSE Division of Enforcement to
assess implementation of the changes arising out of four previous inspections
of the NYSE. The inspection disclosed that the NYSE had implemented many
of the staffs previous recommendations. The staff also found that the NYSE
had developed a number of management and procedural initiatives and had
made a significant commitment of additional staffing resources. The staff is
continuing to monitor the NYSE's progress in addressing deficiencies noted in
the previous inspections.
In addition, the staff continued to meet on a quarterly basis with the NYSE
and NASD to discuss current regulatory issues affecting the Commission's
examination and inspection programs.
Applications for Re-entry
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission received 100 SRO applications to
permit persons subject to statutory disqualifications, as defined in Section
3(aX39) of the Exchange Act, to become or remain associated with brokerdealers. The distribution of filings among the SROs was the following: NASD
(78); NYSE (20); and MSE (2). Of the total filings processed, 5 were subsequently withdrawn, 95 were completed and 5 were pending at year-end.
SRO Final Disciplinary Actions
Section 19(dX1) of the Exchange Act and Rule 19d-1 require all selfregulatory organizations to file reports with the Commission of all final
disciplinary actions.
A Rule 19d-1 filing reports a completed action that may have been initiated
at any time during the previous years. The duration of a SRO action frequently
reflects the severity of the violation(s) charged, the number of respondents
63

involved, and the complexity of the underlying facts. SROs generally conclude
cases involving minor or technical violations with a single respondent in less
than a year. Cases involving serious trading violations (e.g., price manipulation, prearranged trading, front-running, etc.) require more time to complete
because of the necessity of demonstrating specific intent to the disciplinary
panel that acts as a trier of fact. Consequently, the volume of Rule 19d-1
notices submitted by a SRO in a given year is not a precise measure of its
proficiency in market surveillance and compliance. Nevertheless, the number
of actions reported can be useful in assessing the regulatory effectiveness of
different SROs over similar time periods, and this information has proved
useful in focusing inspections of SRO regulatory programs.
In fiscal year 1988 the Amex filed 47 Rule 19d-1 reports, the CBOE filed
168; the NYSE filed 134; the PHLX filed 205; the PSE filed 70; the registered
dearing agencies, the BSE and the MSE flled none; and the NI\SD fi\ed

The SIPC Fund amounted to $390.5 million on September 30, 1988, an
increase of $1.3 million from September 30, 1987. Further financial support
for the SIPC program is available through a $500 million confirmed line of
credit established by SIPC with a consortium of banks. In addition, SIPC may
borrow up to $1 billion from the United States Treasury Department through
the Commission.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission acted favorably on a number of
SIPC actions providing for the reimposition, beginning January 1, 1989, of
revenue based assessments on its member broker-dealers at the rate of 3/16
of 1 percent of each member's annual gross revenues from the securities
business, with minimum assessments of $150 per year for each member.2°6

Significant Legislative Developments
In February 1988, the Commission sent a staff report, Finsncial Planners:
Report of the Staff of the United States Securities and Exchange Commission to
the House Committee on Energy and Commerce's Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance, to the House Subcommittee in response to its July

1986 request that the Commission study investment advisers (advisers) and
financial planners. The staff report provided statistical information on financial planners and their clients and reviewed recent Commission inspections of
registered advisers that are financial planners. The staff found that: (a) the
types and significance of the violations found in inspections of financial
planner registrants generally were not materially different from those found in
inspections of other types of advisers, although the percentage of financial
planners cited for deficiencies was higher than for other advisers; (b) there is
potential for self-interested behavior when financial planners both provide
advice and sell financial products; and (c) demonstrated abuses by investment
advisers and financial planners involve only a very small portion of the
advisory industry.
Disclosure Requirements
In November 1987, the Commission adopted an amendment to the
disclosure requirements of Form N-SAR, the semi-annual report form for
registered investment companies, to require the change of accountant disclosures currently required of other types of issuers on Form 8_K.207
In February 1988, the Commission adopted revisions to Form N-1A, the
mutual fund registration statement form, to require a fee table at the front of
each fund prospectus that: (a) lists all transactional expenses, such as sales
loads; (b) lists all annual fund expenses, such as management expenses; and
(c) includes an "Example" which illustrates the amount of expenses that would
be incurred by an investor at the end of one, three, five, and ten years. The
Commission also adopted amendments to Form N-1A that improve the
narrative prospectus disclosure of fees deducted under, and the nature of, Rule
12b-1 distribution plans. The revisions of Form N-1A allow investors to more
easily compare expense structures of different funds?08
In February 1988, the Commission adopted a package of new rules and rule
amendments that standardize the computation of mutual fund performance in
advertisements and sales literature to enhance investors' ability to compare
performance c1aims.209
In June 1988, the Commission proposed Rule 30b 1-3 under the Investment
Company Act to require registered investment companies to file specified
reports covering a defined transition period. The new rule, if adopted, would
require investment companies that change their fiscal year end to file a Form
N-SAR report within 60 days of either the close of the period between the end
of their old fiscal year and start of the new fiscal year, or the date they
determine to change their fiscal year.210
In August 1988, the Commission proposed three new forms, Forms
N-17f-1, N-17f-2, and ADV-E, to be used by accountants when meeting
66

current filing requirements under the Investment Company
Investment Advisers Act. The proposed forms would, if adopted,
required filing of accountant examination certificates with the
which should increase for both investors and the Commission's
bility to the information on those certificates.211

EDGAR Filings
In July 1985, the Office of Public Utility Regulation began accepting
electronic filings from registered public utility holding company systems and
their member companies. An EDGAR Pilot Branch was formed in October
1985, which began processing electronic filings for a volunteer group of
investment company registrants in November 1985. The volunteers include a
representative group of 199 management investment companies and 78 unit
investment trusts with over 3300 separate series. Electronic filings of semiannual reports on Form N-SAR also were made by 848 registered management investment companies not participating full-time in the EDGAR Pilot.
As of September 30, 1988, the Commission received 29,752 investment
company filings through the EDGAR Pilot Branch.
Over one-third of all active registered management investment companies
are now making electronic filings on Form N-SAR. The Division of Investment Management has asked the Commission's Office of Information Systems Management to continue work on the Commission's N-SAR database to
provide an efficient means to transfer the information contained in these
filings to the database, and permit the automated manipulation of that
information. The number of filers filing their N-SARs electronically has
reached a point where the Commission's N-SAR database, using data
extracted from reports filed through EDGAR, can be a useful resource in the
investment company inspection program and other Commission activities.
Regulatory Policy
Significant Investment Company Act Developments-In July 1988, the
Commission proposed revised Rule 11a-3 under the Investment Company
Act, which, if adopted, would permit a mutual fund or its principal underwriter,
under certain conditions, to make an exchange offer to the fund's own
shareholders or to shareholders of another fund in the same family of
funds.212 At the same time, the Commission requested additional comment
on proposed Rule 11c-1 under the Investment Company Act, which, if
adopted, would conditionally permit a unit investment trust or its sponsor to
make exchange offers to certain unit holders.
In June 1988, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 12b-1 under
the Investment Company Act.213 Rule 12b-1 permits, subject to specified
conditions, a mutual fund to adopt a plan to use fund assets to pay costs
associated with the distribution of fund shares. The proposed amendments, if
adopted, would: (a) clarify and enhance standards for approval or continuation
of distribution plans; (b) ensure that payments under a distribution plan are
made on a current basis and for specific distribution services actually provided

67

to the fund; and (c) prohibit funds that adopt or continue distribution plans
from being held out to the public as "no-load" funds or from being otherwise
offered in a misleading manner using similar terminology. At the same time,
the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 17d-3 under the Investment
Company Act, which exempts from the requirement of prior Commission
approval certain distribution agreements between funds and their affiliated
persons. The proposed amendments, if adopted, would expand the ability of
affiliated funds to finance distribution efforts jointly. The Commission also
proposed to amend Form N-1A, the registration statement form for mutual
funds. The proposed amendments, if adopted, would require additional
disclosure regarding the amount of payments under distribution plans.
In November 1988, the Commission proposed Rule 6c-10 under the
Investment Company Act, which, if adopted, would permit under specified
conditions mutual funds and certain related to impose sales loads that are
payable on a deferred basis.214 At the same time, the Commission proposed
amendments to Form N-1A, which would accommodate the deferred sales
loads that would be permitted if Rule 6c-10 is adopted.
Significant Investment Advisers Act Developments-In
November 1987, the
Commission proposed, and in August 1988, adopted, amendments to Rule
204-2, the recordkeeping rule under the Investment Advisers Act, to require
registered investment advisers to keep for Commission inspection all of their
advertisements and to make and keep all records necessary to form the basis
for performance information in their advertisements. The rule amendments
permit Commission inspectors to examine advertisements and the basis for
performance information in advertisements for compliance with the antifraud
provisions of the Investment Advisers Act.215
In September 1988, the Commission proposed two rules under the Investment Advisers Act, Rules 203(bX1)-1 and 203(bX3)-2, that, if adopted, would
exempt certain small advisers from federal registration as advisers if they
register in each state in which they do business. The Commission also
proposed amendments to relieve advisers that would be exempt under the
proposed rules from the Investment Advisers Act's recordkeeping rule,
advertising rule, cash solicitation rule, disciplinary disclosure rule, and
restrictions on principal and agency cross transactions. These exemptions
would significantly reduce federal regulation for certain small advisory businesses that are regulated at the state leveI.216
Significant Insurance Products Developments-In
July 1988, the Commission proposed for comment revisions to Forms N-3 and N-4, the registration
statement forms used by insurance company separate accounts issuing
variable annuity contracts under the Investment Company Act and the
Securities Act of 1933.217 The proposed amendments would, if adopted,
consolidate prescribed expense data in a tabular presentation (fee table) near
the front of the prospectus.
Significant Public Utility HoLding Company DeveLopments- There are 13
registered public utility holding company systems with aggregate assets, as of
June 30, 1988, of $89.3 billion, an increase of $2.0 billion, or 2.3 percent over
June 30, 1987. Total operating revenues for the twelve months ended June 30,
68

1988, were $32.7 billion, an $800 million increase from the twelve months
ended June 30, 1987. There are 70 electric or gas utility subsidiaries, 84
non-utility subsidiaries, and 22 inactive companies in the 13 registered
systems, a total of 189 companies operating in 24 states (excluding six power
supply subsidiary companies).
During fiscal year 1988 the Commission authorized $5.9 billion of senior
securities and common stock financing for the 13 registered systems: $4.6
billion in long-term debt financing and $1.3 billion in common and preferred
stock. Long-term debt financing decreased by 8.0 percent from fiscal year
1987, primarily due to the volume of refinancings undertaken in prior years.
In addition, $624 million in pollution control financing and $4.9 billion in
short-term debt financing were approved. The pollution control financing was
a 45.1 percent increase from amounts authorized in fiscal year 1987. Shortterm debt decreased by 10.1 percent from the previous year. Total authorizations in fiscal year 1988 of $11.5 billion were less than financings authorized
in fiscal year 1987 by $800 million, a decrease of 6.5 percent. The Commission also authorized the expenditure of $575 million for nuclear fuel and oil
and gas development and exploration expenditures of $34 million. The
Commission's continuing review of holding company fuel procurement activities, accounting policies, audits of service companies, as well as its review of
annual reports of holding company subsidiary service companies and fuel
procurement subsidiaries and quarterly reports by holding company nonutility subsidiaries, resulted in savings to consumers during fiscal year 1988
of approximately $36.6 million. These savings came about primarily as a
result of requiring electric utility subsidiaries of registered public-utility
holding companies to credit revenues from their sale of excess oil and gas
($14.2 million) and from subleasing coal and oil barges ($22.1 million) to the
cost of fuel billed to customers, and through the audits of service companies
($.3 million).
Significant

Institutional

Disclosure Program Developments-Securities

Exchange Act Section 13(f)(1) and Rule 13f-1 require specified "institutional
investment managers" to file quarterly reports on Form 13F. Under Rule
l3f-2(T), these managers may file the report on Form l3F-E through
magnetic tape by using the Commission's pilot electronic disclosure system,
EDGAR. Managers filing these reports disclose specified equity holdings of
the accounts over which they exercise investment discretion. As of June 30,
1988, Form l3F reports had been filed by 1,691 managers for holdings
totaling $1.199 trillion. Through September 1, 1988, 50 managers electronically filed Form 13F-E reports for the quarter ended June 30, 1988, reporting
almost 17,000 securities holdings totaling over $61 billion.
Form l3F reports are available to the public at the Commission's Public
Reference Room promptly after filing. Two tabulations of the information
contained in these reports are available for inspection: (1) an alphabetical list
of the individual securities, showing the number of shares held by the
managers reporting the holding; and (2) a list with the total number of shares
of a security reported by all reporting managers. Both tabulations normally
are available two weeks after the date on which the reports must be filed.

Significant Applications and Interpretations
Investment Company Act Matters-In August 1988, the Commission authorized Merrill Lynch & Co. to offer a dual distribution system for its group of
mutual funds that will give investors a choice in how to pay distribution and
sales fees.218 The system gives investors the option of either paying a
conventional front-end sales load or paying an annual distribution fee and a
deferred sales load that decreases each year until eliminated. Although these
alternatives have been available in the form of separate funds, the Merrill
Lynch plan allows individual funds to offer two separate classes of shares: one
class with the front-end sales load; the other with the annual distribution fee
and deferred sales load. The two classes of shares represent interests in one
securities portfolio within a particular fund. Investors may also switch between
funds in the Merrill Lynch group of funds so long as they stay with their class
of shares.
Two banks filed applications as trustees on behalf of separate trusts
established to acquire loans from the Department of Education and the
Department of Housing and Urban Development, and to issue bonds and
certificates of beneficial interests in the trusts collateralized by such loans. The
non-recourse loans would be sold as part of the federal government's loan
asset sales program. The Commission issued exemptive orders under the
Investment Company Act for the trusts on May 3 219 and July 28, 1988.220
On January 12, 1988, the Commission ordered an administrative hearing
on an application filed by the Teachers' Insurance and Annuity Association
and the College Retirement Equities Fund (TIAA-CREF) for exemptive relief
from certain provisions of the Investment Company Act concerning variable
annuity separate accounts.221 The hearing was originally scheduled to begin
on June 6, 1988. However, in light of proposed changes in TlAA-CREPs
operations and in order to allow settlement discussions between TlAA-CREF
and the Commission staff and the entities and individuals who requested the
hearing to proceed, the hearing was postponed on several occasions.
On August] 7, 1988, the staff granted no-action relief with respect to certain
trusts to be created by the State of Israel, which would issue securities to the
public without registering as investment companies.222 The net proceeds of
each offering would be loaned to Israel in order to prepay all or a portion of
foreign military sales loans made by the Federal Financing Bank to Israel for
purchase of defense articles, defense services, design and construction
services, and related expenses.
On August 2, 1988, the staff granted no-action relief to a foreign investment
company operating abroad where it proposed to make a private placement
offering of securities under Rule 506 of Regulation D in the United States
coincident with a public offering of its securities outside the United States, and
where, upon completion of the offerings, no more than 100 persons that were
nationals or residents of the United States would be beneficial owners of the
foreign investment company's securities.223
On June 7, 1988,224 and again on July 15, 1988,225 the staff granted
no-action relief to separate New York State agencies of foreign banks that

70

proposed to issue commercial paper in the United States without registering
as investment companies. Although it ordinarily takes the position that
foreign banks and branches of foreign banks are not banks for purposes of the
Investment Company Act, the staff granted narrow relief here to permit the
New York State agencies to rely on their counsel's opinion that the nature and
extent of federal and state regulation and supervision of these New York
agencies, established under New York State banking laws, was substantially
equivalent to the regulation of New York state-chartered banks.
Investment Advisers Act Matters-On September 23, 1988, the staff advised
the Investment Company Institute that it would not recommend any enforcement action to the Commission with respect to investment advisers who
advertise performance without deducting clients' advisory fees from the gross
returns derived from those accounts if the performance results are provided to
prospective clients only in one-on-one, private transactions.226 This position
modifies the staffs earlier position that, in all circumstances, advisers
advertising performance results must deduct advisory expenses.
Holding Company Act Matters-The Commission authorized WPL Holdings,
Inc. (Holdings) to acquire all of the common stock of Wisconsin Power and
Light Company (WPL), and exempted it from all provisions of the Holding
Company Act except Section 9(aX2).227WPL holds all of the capital stock of
Beloit Water, Gas and Electric Company and 33.1 percent of the capital stock
of Wisconsin River Power Company. Holdings stated that the principal reason
for the reorganization was to facilitate diversification and to provide additional
financing flexibility for the holding company system. Separate requests for a
hearing and for permission to intervene as a full party were denied. The matter
has been appealed by the intervenors to the District of Columbia Circuit Court
of Appeals. The Commission authorized The Southern Company (Southern),
a registered holding company, to acquire all of the outstanding common stock
of Savannah Electric and Power Company (Savannah).228 Holders of Savannah
common stock received 1.05 shares of Southern common stock for each
Savannah share owned. At the time of the acquisition, Savannah had total
assets in excess of $400 million and annual revenues of about $180 million.
Southern estimated that efficiencies created by the combination could result
in annual savings of approximately $50 million.
The Commission authorized Sierra Pacific Resources (Resources) to acquire
a 14.5 percent common stock interest in a new electric generating company,
Enterprise, which will construct and operate a coal-fired generating unit
estimated to cost $600 million and to be located at the Thousand Springs
Project (Project) in Nevada.229 While the Project may ultimately include seven
additional generating units, any acquisition by Resources of any securities of
Enterprise to construct any additional units will be subject to further Commission authorization. Requests for a hearing were denied. The matter has
been appealed by the intervenors to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth
Circuit.
The Commission authorized EUA Power Corporation (EUA Power), a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Eastern Utilities Associates (EUA), a registered
holding company, to reorganize its existing debt through an exchange of
71

securities and the issuance of additional shares of preferred stock to EUA.23o
The reorganization was necessitated by the delay in the licensing of Unit 1 of
the Seabrook Nuclear Power Project in which EUA Power is a 12.13 percent
owner. The transaction allows EUA Power, at its option, to pay interest in cash
or "in-kind" by issuing additional debt securities. Jurisdiction was reserved
over transactions to be effected with regard to EUA Power on or after May 15,
1989.
The Commission authorized EUA and New England Electric System
(NEES), both registered holding companies, to form new wholly-owned
subsidiaries and to participate as general partners, through the new subsidiaries, in Ocean State Power (aSP), a partnership formed to construct, own,
and operate a combined cycle electric generating facility in Rhode Island.231
Capital provided to the new subsidiaries by EUA and NEES will not exceed
$30 million and $25 million, respectively. Blackstone Valley Electric Company, a wholly-owned subsidiary of EUA, will sell the property for the facility
to asp for approximately $1.6 million.
By prior Commission order, Central and South West Corporation (CSW), a
registered holding company, was authorized to organize and acquire CSW
Credit, Inc. (CSW Credit), a corporation created to factor accounts receivable
of the CSW electric utility companies. Subsequent orders authorized CSW
Credit to expand its factoring activities to include the purchase of receivables
of electric and gas utilities not associated with the CSW system. The amount
of nonassociate receivables acquired, however, was not permitted to exceed
the amount of receivables acquired from CSW associate companies. CSWand
CSW Credit have requested removal of the limitation on the factoring of
receivables of nonassociate utilities.232 The Commission determined that it
was appropriate in the public interest that a hearing be held with respect to the
proposed transaction. The hearing began on September 16, 1988, and
testimony concluded on October 27, 1988. The parties and participants will
be submitting proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law and briefs to
the administrative law judge.

•• State Courts and Administrative Tribunals.

The General Counsel represents the Commission in all litigation in the
United States Supreme Court and the courts of appeals. This litigation
includes appeals of district court decisions in Commission injunctive actions
and petitions for review of Commission orders. The General Counsel also
defends the Commission and its employees when sued, prosecutes adrnlnistrative disciplinary proceedings against securities professionals, and appears
amicus curiae on behalf of the Commission in significant private litigation
involving the federal securities laws. In addition, under the supervision and
direction of the General Counsel, the regional offices represent the Commission in corporate reorganization cases under the Bankruptcy Code that have
a substantial public investor interest. The General Counsel also analyzes
legislation that would amend the federal securities laws or otherwise affect the
Commission's work and prepares legislative comments and congressional
testimony. In addition, the General Counsel reviews proposed Commission
action to ensure that enforcement and regulatory programs are consistent
with the Commission's statutory authority.
The General Counsel represented the Commission in 314 litigation matters
in fiscal year 1988. During the year, 27 court of appeals and Supreme Court
cases were concluded, all but three favorably to the Commission. There were
26 appeals in Commission injunctive actions, three of which were concluded,
with no outcomes unfavorable to the Commission. By comparison, the
General Counsel handled 304 litigation matters in fiscal year 1987 and 285
litigation matters in fiscal year 1986. In fiscal year 1987, there were 16 appeals
in injunctive actions, six of which were concluded, with only one outcome
unfavorable to the Commission.
In fiscal year 1988, there also were 29 appellate and district court actions
seeking to overturn Commission orders in administrative proceedings or
affirming self-regulatory organization (SRO) disciplinary proceedings against
securities professionals. Of these appeals, six were' concluded, with only one
adverse result. Ten such actions were concluded in fiscal year 1987, with only
one adverse result.
73

The federal securities laws provide for private remedies as well as government enforcement actions. Because decisions in private cases may have
precedential effect on its own regulatory activities, the Commission's participation in such cases is an important supplement to its enforcement program.
The Commission participated as amicus curiae (friend of the court) in 50 cases
during the year, compared to 46 cases in fiscal year 1987 and 42 cases in fiscal
year 1986. It participated in 17 private cases that were decided, only three of
which resulted in a decision adverse to the Commission.
The General Counsel also handled more than 209 other proceedings before
the Commission or in the federal district courts. These included 61 suits
brought against the Commission or its staff and 95 suits seeking access to
Commission documents, including actions under various public information
statutes. Of the latter, 89 suits involved discovery subpoenas in private actions
where the Commission is not a party. In fiscal year 1987, there were 56 suits
brought against the Commission or its staff and 86 suits (including 78
third-party subpoenas) under the various public information statutes.
During fiscal year 1988, 108 debtors with publicly-held securities registered
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) commenced
Chapter 11 reorganizations. The Commission entered its appearance in 50 of
these cases, which, together with four non. registered companies, involved
assets of about $10 billion and nearly 230,000 public investors. A list of
pending Chapter 11 cases in which the Commission has filed a notice of
appearance is set forth in Table 38 of the Appendix to this report.
In addition to litigation, the General Counsel is involved in significant
legislative and regulatory work. For example, the office assisted the Chairman
and the Commissioners in preparing testimony on issues such as the structure
of the financial services industry and proposals to amend laws governing the
securities activities of banks; proposed legislation defining insider trading;
tender offer reform; and the Report of the National Commission on Fraudulent
Financial Reporting. The Office also assisted the Commission in preparing
legislative proposals concerning, among other things, the sanctions and
remedies available to the Commission; the definition of insider trading; and
the authority of the Commission to conduct investigations on behalf of a
foreign securities authority.
Litigation
Insider Trading-In Lomberdnn, S.p.A. v. SEC and Trasatlantic Financial Co.
v. SEC,233 the Commission successfully urged that the Supreme Court deny

review of a decision by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second
Circuit 234 affirming a judgment in favor of the Commission against defendants who traded on nonpublic information that had been misappropriated
from the bidder in a corporate takeover. The defendants' petitions to the
Supreme Court raised three issues: (1) whether notice by publication in a
European newspaper was adequate under the Constitution (the primary issue
addressed by the Second Circuit); (2) whether trading on misappropriated
non public information is a violation of antifraud rules; and (3) whether
74

disgorgement is available as a remedy when allegedly no private investors
have a valid action for restitution. The Commission argued that review was
unnecessary because the lower courts correctly decided that under the
circumstances of this case-including
efforts by the Italian defendants to
deceive the Commission about their involvement in the illegal trades and
difficulties posed by foreign bank secrecy laws-the published notice was
adequate and did not violate constitutional due process guarantees. The
Commission further argued that petitioners' conduct clearly fell within the
proscriptions of the federal securities laws, and that disgorgement is a
well-established remedy to prevent the unjust enrichment of wrongdoers.
In the insider trading cases of SEC v. Levine and SEC v. WiLkis,235 the United
States District Court for the Southern District of New York agreed with the
Commission that the defendants had acquired no more than bare legal title to
trading profits obtained illegally and that a constructive trust had attached to
the profits in favor of the victimized investors. The court therefore concluded
that the disgorged funds were not available to satisfy claims against the
defendants by the Internal Revenue Service and other tax authorities, because
at no time did the defendants have the kind of property interest in the funds
to which tax liens could have attached. The court subsequently approved a
distribution plan designed to return all disgorged trading profits to investors
who traded contemporaneously with the defendants.P''
Constitutional Challenges To Commission Enforcement Actions-In a number of recent Commission enforcement actions, the defendants have argued
that the Commission, as an independent agency whose members are not
removable at will by the President, is barred by Article II of the Constitution
from bringing enforcement actions. The Commission has argued that the
President's substantial authority over the Commission, including "for cause"
removal power, satisfies the constitutional requirement that the President
"take care that the Laws be faithfully executed." In SEC v. Blinder, Robinson &
CO.,23?the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit adopted the
Commission's position on this issue. In so ruling, the Court relied heavily on
the Supreme Court's recent decision upholding the constitutionality of the
independent counsel statute 238 and the Supreme Court's decision in Humphrey

s Executor

v. United States.239

In a case related to the Tenth Circuit action, Blinder, Robinson & Co. and
Meyer Blinder v. SEC,24o the Blinder defendants challenged the constitutionality of the Commission's actions and sought review of a Commission order in
an administrative proceeding in the United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit. The District of Columbia Circuit agreed with the
Commission that it should not reach the Article IIissue because that issue was
on appeal to the Tenth Circuit. Subsequently, as described below under
litigation concerning broker-dealers and market professionals, the Commission successfully opposed Supreme Court review of the District of Columbia
Circuit decision on a different issue.
In fiscal year 1988, two federal district courts also rejected constitutional
challenges
to the Commission's
enforcement authority. In SEC v.
Moskowitz,241 the court denied the constitutional challenge. In SEC v.
75

Davis,242 the court denied a motion to dismiss and concluded that the SEC's
exercise of civil enforcement responsibilities does not constitute an unconstitutional delegation of enforcement authority.
Broker-Dealers And Market Professionals-In
Blinder, Robinson, Co. and
Meyer Blinder v. SEC,243 as urged by the Commission, the Supreme Court

denied certiorari. Petitioners argued that it is a violation of due process for the
Commission to litigate an injunctive action in district court and then initiate
an administrative proceeding to impose sanctions for the same conduct. In
opposition to the grant of certiorari, the Commission argued that the
Exchange Act gives it the authority both to seek injunctions and to determine
whether administrative remedies are in the public interest, and does not
require the Commission to elect between the two types of proceedings.
Further, the Commission noted, as established by the Supreme Court in
Withrow v. Larkin,244 an administrative agency may combine adversarial and
adjudicative functions without offending due process.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission also defended two Commission
orders in Antoniu v. SEC. 245 Petitioner, a securities professional convicted of
insider trading, seeks review of a Commission order directing the National
Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) to disapprove his proposed employment with a Minneapolis broker-dealer and a subsequent Commission order
barring him from association with any broker-dealer. Concerning the first
order, the Commission's brief argues, among other things, that the Commission has broad discretion to review determinations by the NASD and other
self-regulatory organizations concerning the proposed employment of persons who are disqualified under the Exchange Act from association with an
NASD member firm. The brief also refutes the petitioner's argument that the
procedure employed by the Commission in issuing its order violated Section
15A(gX2) of the Exchange Act and his right to due process, explaining that the
statute provides for such a Commission veto of an NASD determination to
allow proposed employment. The procedural protections provided in the
NASD hearing satisfy due process concerns.
In The Stuen-Jemes Co., Inc. and Marc N. Geman v. SEC,246 the United
States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit affirmed a
Commission decision interpreting the Commission's net capital rule and
upholding the NASD's imposition of sanctions against a broker-dealer and its
executive vice-president. The court agreed with the Commission that the
company had erred in calculating its net capital in connection with a
firm-commitment underwriting, giving deference to the Commission's interpretation of its net capital rule. At the commencement of such an underwriting, a broker-dealer is committed to purchasing the securities at a discount
from the offering price but does not know whether it will be able to sell those
securities at the offering price. At that time the broker-dealer must calculate
net capital, taking a "haircut" or deduction from the face amount of the
offering to reflect the risk of loss that the broker-dealer bears. Under the net
capital rule, this "haircut" may be diminished, and net capital in effect
increased, by the amount of "unrealized profit" from the offering. The firm in
this case argued that a non-accountable expense allowance should be treated

76

as "unrealized profit." The Commission interprets the term "unrealized profit"
to exclude such an expense allowance and to include only the "concession"
received by the broker-dealer from the issuer, which is the discount from the
offering price. The court rejected the petitioners' contention that the Commission had violated the Administrative Procedure Act and the Freedom of
Information Act in not publishing its interpretation of the rule prior to any
adjudicatory proceeding, reasoning that the Commission's interpretation
simply explained an already existing regulation. In contrast, if the Commission had adopted a new rule or substantially modified an existing rule,
publication might have been required.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit affirmed a
Commission order imposing sanctions on a broker-dealer's registered representative in Kane v. SEC. 247 The Commission had suspended the representative from association with any broker-dealer for six months because of his
participation in the sale of unregistered securities. The Commission took the
position that the representative was responsible for determining whether the
securities could be lawfully sold without registration, and that he had willfully
failed to make the "searching inquiry" necessary for this determination. The
court agreed with the Commission that the six-month sanction imposed on
the representative was justified, rejecting the representative's contention that
the illegal sale of unregistered securities to the public was merely a "technical"
violation of the federal securities laws.
The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit also affirmed the
Commission's decision in C.E. Carlson, Inc. and Charles E. Carlson v. SEC,248
suspending C. E. Carlson, Inc.'s broker-dealer registration for two months,
barring Mr. Carlson's association with any broker or dealer for eight months,
and prohibiting both of them from participating in any securities offering. The
court held that: (1) the Commission's findings that respondents violated
antifraud provisions of the securities laws were supported by substantial
evidence; (2) the Commission did not abuse its discretion in denying certain
discovery motions that were intended to produce evidence relevant to a
selective prosecution defense; and (3) the Commission did not abuse its
discretion in its selection of sanctions.
In Ettinger v. Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith, Inc., 249 a suit between a
brokerage firm and its customer, the Commission participated as amicus
curiae, arguing that it is a fraud under Exchange Act Rule IOb-5 for a
broker-dealer to charge undisclosed excessive mark-ups. Agreeing with the
position urged by the Commission, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Third Circuit reversed the district court's decision that a broker-dealer's
compliance with routine disclosure requirements set forth in Exchange Act
Rule I Ob-l 0 precludes fraud liability. The Third Circuit recognized that the
Commission, in adopting Rule IOb-IO, had set a minimum standard for
customer confirmation disclosure and did not intend that compliance with
that rule would provide a broker-dealer with a safe harbor for fraud.
The Commission filed amicus curiae briefs, both in district court and on
appeal, in McLaughlin, Piuen, Vogel, Inc. v. Oross,250 concerning arbitration
under rules adopted by the various self-regulatory organizations and approved

77

by the Commission. The United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit
agreed with the Commission that the hearing provision in the small claims
arbitration rule adopted by the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (and
other SROs) does not deny broker-dealers either due process or equal
protection. In this case, a broker-dealer challenged an arbitration decision
awarding the brokerage firm's customers $2,500. The decision was based on
written submissions. The brokerage firm argued that the procedure was
constitutionally defective because, although the firm could submit whatever it
wanted in writing, the firm could obtain an oral hearing only if the arbitrator
decided that one would be appropriate or necessary or if the customer had
consented. The customer, however, could obtain an oral hearing upon request.
The Commission argued that the rule gives broker-dealers an ample opportunity to present their cases, which is all that due process requires, and that the
difference in the treatment of broker-dealers and public customers under the
rule has a rational basis.
Finally, in SEC v. Suter,251 the Seventh Circuit rejected Suter's appeal from
a district court order that denied reconsideration of the court's prior decision
not to vacate a permanent injunction entered against him. In this appeal, Suter
argued unsuccessfully for the third time that his publication of an investment
newsletter rendered him immune from any Commission regulation. The court
characterized his arguments on the merits as frivolous, and sua sponte
awarded the Commission costs incurred in defending the suit.
Detiniiion of a Security- The Commission has participated as a friend of the
court in selected private lawsuits involving the question of whether a particular
instrument is a security. In fiscal year 1987, the Commission filed such an
amicus brief in Sanderson v. Rothenmund.252 In fiscal year 1988, the district
court in that case adopted the Commission's position, holding that certain
debt instruments called International Certificates of Deposit, which were
issued by a corporation that was not subject to bank regulation, were "notes"
within the definition of "security" in the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The court concluded that: (l) the
instruments were indistinguishable from standardized notes of small denomination sold to the public, which have been consistently held to be securities;
and (2) because these instruments were "notes" within the statutory definition
of security, the court did not need to determine whether the instruments
constituted "investment contracts" -also defined by the Securities Act as
securities-within
the meaning of SEC v. \¥oJ. Howey Co. 253
In response to the United States Supreme Court's request for the views of the
United States, and in accord with the Commission's position, in Variable
Annuity Life Insurance Co., et el. v. Otto 254 the Solicitor General filed a brief
urging that the Court grant certiorari. The United States Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit had held that a fixed-annuity contract with a variable
component was a security subject to the federal securities laws, rather than an
"annuity contract" exempt from regulation under Securities Act Section
3(aX8). The brief took the position that review was appropriate because the
Section 3(aX8) exemption for annuity contracts might be applicable and many
similar instruments have been marketed in reliance on this exemption. The
78

brief discussed several factors that are significant in determining the applicability of the exemption, including: (1) whether the insurance company
assumes substantial investment risk; (2) the manner in which the contract is
marketed and whether the appeal to customers is made on the basis of
stability and security; and (3) whether the insurance company assumes a
meaningful mortality risk under the contract. The brief contended that the
annuity contract at issue met the investment-risk criterion because the issuer
assumed all risk with respect to principal paid and an adequate minimum
fixed rate of interest. The Supreme Court declined review.
At the invitation of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit,
the Commission filed an amicus brief in Adena Exploration, Inc. v. Sylvan,255
urging that certain interests in oil and gas rights are securities under the
federal securities laws. The Commission's brief argues that the Supreme
Court's analysis in Landreth Timber Co. v. Landreth 256 is applicable to these
interests. Like "stock"-the interest at issue in Landreth-these
oil and gas
rights lend themselves to consistent definition and are plainly within the
Securities Act definition of a security. The Securities Act lists "fractional
undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights" as one category of
"security." Thus, the Commission explains, in determining whether the oil and
gas interest at issue is a security, a court should examine only whether the
interest has the characteristics typically associated with a "fractional undivided interest in oil, gas, or other mineral rights." The Commission's brief also
states that the degree of sophistication of the parties and the extent of the
investor's participation in exploration of the oil and gas leasehold have no
relevance to the determination of whether these interests are securities under
the federal securities laws.
In Arthur Young & Co. v. Reves,257 the Commission filed a friend-of-the-court
memorandum in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit in
support of a petition for rehearing and suggestion for rehearing en bane. The
court of appeals panel had concluded that certain demand notes that were
widely offered and sold to the public by an Arkansas farmers' cooperative are
not securities. The panel reasoned that: (1) the demand feature of the notes
took them out of the definition of security; and (2) interest on a note does not
constitute "profit" under the SEC v. \¥oJ. Howey Co. 258 test for "investment
contract." The Commission contends that the demand feature of the notes is
not determinative of their status under the federal securities laws; that the
"investment contract" test is inapplicable where an instrument is a security
under any of the tests for "notes;" and that, in any event, "profit" under Howey
includes any type of return on an investment, including interest.
Liability Under Section J 2 of the Securities Act-Substantially agreeing with
the Commission's arguments as amicus curiae, and reversing the United States
Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, the Supreme Court held in Pinter v.
Dahl 259 that the in pari delicto, or equal fault, defense is available in a private
action under Section 12(1) of the Securities Act, which affords a private
remedy of rescission for sales of unregistered securities in violation of the Act.
Under the in pari delicto doctrine, judicial relief may be denied because of a
plaintiffs own culpability. As the Commission had urged, the Court applied a
79

two-pronged test for application of the defense in a Section 12 action: (1) the
plaintiff must be at least equally responsible for the issuer's illegal failure to
register the securities or its failure to conduct the sale in a manner that
satisfies the Act's registration exemption provisions; and (2) the plaintiff must
be primarily a promoter of the securities offering, rather than an investor. The
Court also held that only persons who either pass title to a security or solicit
a purchase may be liable as sellers under Section 12(1). Further, the Court
endorsed the Commission's position that one does not "solicit" unless he is
"motivated at least in part by a desire to serve his own financial interests or
those of the securities owner." The Court declined to take a position on
whether its decision as to the scope of "seller" liability under Section 12(1)
applies to Section 12(2) of the Securities Act, a provision which imposes
liability on persons who offer or sell a security by means of a material
misstatement or omission. The case law, however, generally holds that the
term "seller" has the same meaning in Section 12(1) as it does in Section
12(2). The Court also did not reach the question whether aiding and abetting
liability is available in actions under Section 12.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, at the invitation of the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, the Commission addressed the scope
of "seller" liability under Section 12(2) of the Securities Act, an issue left open
by the Supreme Court in Pinter v. Dahl.26o In Wilson v. Ruffa & Hanover, P. c.,261
the Commission argued as amicus curiae that a law firm cannot be held liable
under Section 12(2) as a statutory "seller" where the law firm did no more than
prepare allegedly false offering materials and send the materials to several
prospective buyers, including the plaintiff, at the issuer-client's request. The
Commission stated that the Pinter reasoning, while addressed to actions under
Section 12(1), also governs actions under Section 12(2). Thus, the Commission contended, the law firm can be held primarily liable under Section 12(2)
only if it passed title to the securities-which
it plainly did not do-or
"solicited" the plaintiffs purchase. The Commission reasoned that a person
cannot be deemed to have solicited a purchase unless he contacts the buyer,
either personally or through an agent, in a meaningful manner, and that the
merely ministerial act of sending the buyer offering materials at the request
of the client-issuer is not such an action. The Commission also stated that
there is no aiding and abetting liability under Section 12(2) of the Securities
Act, because, just as the Supreme Court in Pinter found no indication that
Congress intended in Section 12 to impose primary liability on collateral
participants, there is no indication that Congress intended to impose liability
on such persons through secondary liability concepts. The Commission
pointed out that while the language of Section 12(2) requires this narrow
construction, a plaintiff may be able to proceed under Exchange Act Rule
10b-5, as to which courts have permitted aider and abettor liability, assuming
the requirements of an action under that Rule are met, including scienter and
causation.
Tender Offer and Merger Litigation-In
the past fiscal year, the Commission
has participated in several cases raising significant federal securities law issues
in the context of mergers and tender offers. In Basic, Inc. v. Levinson, lnc., 262
80

the Supreme Court adopted the Commission's view on the proper standard
under Rule 10b-5 for determining materiality of preliminary merger neqotlations. In that case, a company had issued statements effectively denying that
it was involved in merger discussions, when in fact it was involved in
discussions that ultimately led to its being acquired at a premium. As the
Commission urged, the Supreme Court concluded that materiality is to be
determined by whether a reasonable investor would consider the information
important to his investment decision. The Court, again agreeing with the
Commission, held that in merger cases this determination requires balancing
the significance of the proposed merger against the likelihood of its occur.
renee. The Court also endorsed the Commission's view that the failure to
disclose such material information could constitute fraud on the market.
Under that view where an active secondary market such as the New York Stock
Exchange is involved, reliance on corporate statements can be established by
a rebuttable presumption that investors relied on the integrity of a market
price that reflected those corporate statements.
In Nationwide Corp. v. Howing Co., 263 the Supreme Court requested the
views of the United States as to whether to grant certiorari to review a
decision of the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit that
there is an implied private right of action under Section 13(e) of the
Exchange Act. That provision governs going.private transactions, including mergers that involve the issuance of proxy statements. The violation
involved in the case concerned a failure to make disclosures required by
Rule 13e-3 to appear in a proxy statement relating to a going.private
transaction. This rule requires an issuer to state in a proxy statement
soliciting approval of a going.private merger whether the issuer believes
that the transaction is fair to shareholders and to explain in reasonable
detail why it holds this belief. This information must be prominently
displayed and must contain more than mere conclusory statements. The
Solicitor General filed a brief arguing, in accord with the Commission's
position, that Supreme Court review was unnecessary because shareholders have a well-established cause of action under Section 14(a) of the Act
to redress violations of the Commission's proxy rules, and the plaintiffs in
this case therefore had a cause of action regardless of whether there is an
implied cause of action under Section 13(e). The Court denied certiorari.
In two separate cases in the federal courts of appeals, Newmont Mining Corp.
v. Pickens 264 and IU International Corp. v. NX Acquisitions Corp. ,265 the
Commission participated as amicus curiae, stating its view as to the Williams
Act's disclosure requirements with respect to financing for a tender offer. In
both cases, the courts adopted the Commission's position that neither the
Williams Act nor Commission rules promulgated thereunder require a tender
offeror to have firm financing in place before it begins its offer. The courts
noted, in accord with the Commission's view, that the Act and rules do require
the offeror to fully and accurately disclose whatever financing has been
arranged or planned. The courts agreed with the Commission that, if and
when a tender offeror acquires firm financing during the offer, the offeror must
amend its disclosure statement accordingly and may have to extend the
81

period of the offer to give shareholders an adequate opportunity to consider
the new information before deciding whether to tender their shares.
The Commission further explained its view of Williams Act requirements in
connection with financing in R.H. Macy & Co. v. Campeau Corp. 266 Responding to the court's request, the Commission participated as amicus curiae,
advising the district court that if a tender offeror does not have firm financing
commitments at the outset of a tender offer, then, when the offeror obtains
substantially all the necessary firm financing commitments, the terms and
conditions of that financing would have to be disclosed. Commission rules
require that investors be provided at least five business days to consider such
a change in the offer, and, if fewer than five business days remained in the offer,
the offer would have to be extended to provide shareholders at least five days
to consider it. The Commission further advised the court that "expressions of
willingness" to commit to purchase $1.8 billion in notes from a tender offeror
made in letters by three banks did not amount to firm financing, since the
"expressions of willingness" were not legally binding commitments. Before
the district court could rule on the issue, the target company accepted one of
the tender offers and the suit terminated.
In Koppers v. American Express Co., 267 the Commission responded by
letter to a district court request for its view on whether the Williams Act is
violated if an investment banker both acts as a dealer-manager for a tender
offeror and proposes taking an equity interest in the offeror and fails to
point out this alleged conflict of interest in disclosure documents. The
Commission acknowledged that conflicts could arise where a multi-service
firm proposes to act in both capacities. However, conflicts of interest can be
avoided by using preventive policies and procedures commonly used in the
industry such as Chinese Walls, restricted lists, and watch lists. The
Commission noted that the Williams Act would not ordinarily require
disclosure of apparent conflicts or preventive measures because the
information would not ordinarily be deemed material to the target company's shareholders as they decide whether to tender their shares. However,
disclosure of apparent conflicts and preventive measures would be required
if a failure to follow proper procedures resulted in contingent liabilities
materially affecting a firm's ability to provide or obtain financing for the
tender offer. The court agreed with the Commission that the tender offer
should not be enjoined on this basis.
The Commission filed an amicus curiae brief in American Carriers, Inc. v.
Bay tree Investors, Inc.,268 a case raising the issue of when a tender offer
commences for purposes of triggering the Williams Act's disclosure
requirements. In that case, the offeror challenges a district court's finding
that it commenced a tender offer when it sent to the press a letter stating
an intention to make a tender offer for 51 percent of the target's stock,
subject to approval by the target's board of directors. The offeror failed to
file disclosure documents or withdraw the offer within five days after its
announcement,
which the Commission argues violated the Williams Act
and Commission Rule 14d-2(b). The Commission asserts that its releases
proposing and adopting the rule make clear that an announcement of a
82

prospective conditional offer that includes the specific terms of the offer
triggers the Williams Act disclosure requirements. The Commission also
points out that such an offer can, and in this case did, have a significant
impact on market activity, and this impact triggers shareholder need for
information about the offeror and its plans for the target company.
Constitutional Challenges to State Takeover Statutes-In fiscal year 1988, the
Commission participated, as amicus curiae, in three federal district court cases
challenging the validity of state takeover statutes under the Supremacy and
Commerce Clauses of the United States Constitution. RP Acquisition Corp. v.
Staley Continental, Inc.269 involved Delaware's takeover statute, which bars for
three years mergers and other combination transactions between a Delaware
corporation and a person (including any entity) acquiring 15 percent or more
of the company's stock, unless: (l) the company's board of directors approves
the transaction prior to the acquirer's acquisition of 15 percent of the
company's shares; (2) the acquisition results in the acquirer holding 85
percent or more of the target company's stock (exclusive of inside directors'
and employee stock plans' shares); (3) the transaction is approved by the target
company's board and two-thirds of its shareholders, exclusive of the acquirer,
after the 15 percent acquisition; or (4) the pre-acquisition board members
continuing in office approve certain tender offers by the issuer or a third party,
or mergers with or asset sales to third parties. The Commission's brief argued
that the statute vests incumbent management with broad power in determining whether a change-in-control transaction will go forward, thus frustrating
the fundamental purpose of the Williams Act, which is to foster shareholder,
rather than management, choice with respect to tender offers. Thus, the
Commission concluded that the Delaware statute was preempted under the
Supremacy Clause of the Constitution. The Commission also argued that the
Delaware statute was invalid under the Commerce Clause because it impedes,
and may in fact prevent, the interstate commerce in securities incident to a
tender offer. This burden on commerce significantly outweighs any legitimate
state interest promoted by the statute. The district court rejected these
arguments and upheld the constitutionality of the statute. The case became
moot, however, when the parties settled their dispute.
The United States District Court for the Eastern District of Wisconsin
accepted the Commission's Supremacy Clause argument without reaching
the Commerce Clause issue in KfE Corp. v. Mark IV Industries, Inc., 270 and
thus held Wisconsin's takeover statute unconstitutional.
That statute
barred for three years any business combination between Wisconsin
corporations that have their principal executive offices in, or certain other
contacts with, Wisconsin and persons who acquire 10 percent or more of
the company's stock, unless the company's board approves the combinetion prior to the 10 percent acquisition. Unlike the Delaware statute in RP
Acqulsition Corp., the Wisconsin statute contained no other exceptions.
This case too became moot because the parties reached a settlement.
The Commission advanced the same arguments in Salant Acquisition Corp.
v. Manhattan Industries, Inc.271 to challenge a New York takeover statute. That
statute prohibited for five years combination transactions between certain New
83

York corporations and persons acquiring 20 percent of such a company's
stock, unless the company's board of directors approves the transaction before
the acquirer crosses the 20 percent threshold. The court did not reach the
constitutional issues.
Flrst.Amendment Challenge- The United States Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia Circuit this year affirmed the Commission's power to
assure that publications concerning securities are not misleading or deceptive. In SEC v. Wall Street Publishing Institute, lnc., 272 the Court of Appeals
reversed in part a district court order denying, on First Amendment grounds,
an injunction sought by the Commission pursuant to the anti. touting provisions of the Securities Act. The injunction would have required a magazine
publisher to disclose that it had received consideration from a securities issuer
for touting that company's stock. The District of Columbia Circuit held that
regulation of the exchange of information regarding securities is subject to
only limited First Amendment scrutiny. Applying that standard, the court held
that the disclosure injunction sought by the Commission was not an impermissible prior restraint on publication, because the injunction was imposed
only after full judicial review and was a narrowly-crafted injunction against a
continued practice of publishing articles without disclosure of consideration.
Nevertheless, the court refused to consider the provision of free text by a
company for use in the magazine to be a form of consideration, because that
would result in a constitutionally impermissible intrusion into the editorial
processes protected by the First Amendment.
Motions to Vacate Injunctions-In SEC v. Blinder, Robinson S Co., lnc., 273 the
United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit affirmed a district court
order denying a motion brought under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 60(b)
to vacate injunctions entered against a broker-dealer firm and its principal. In
denying the motion, the district court pointed out that the firm's principal,
who remains in control of the firm, had orchestrated a program of disseminating "deliberately deceptive misinformation" and had acted with an "intent
to deceive" investors. As the Commission urged on appeal, the Tenth Circuit
held that the correct standard for determining whether a party is entitled to
Rule 60(b) relief from an injunction is the strict standard set forth in United
States v. Swift SCo, 274 and that in order to obtain such relief a party is required
to make a "clear showing of a grievous wrong evoked by new and unforeseen
circumstances." Agreeing with the Commission, the Tenth Circuit ruled that
petitioners had failed to make the requisite showing.
The Commission successfully opposed a motion to vacate a permanent
injunction in SEC v. AUison.275 The injunction had been entered in 1982 upon
a district court finding that petitioner had sold securities in violation of the
registration provisions of the Securities Act and had that same year been
enjoined by another federal court from fraudulently manipulating the securities market. The motion to vacate was grounded on petitioner's claims that
disclosure of the injunction would hinder a potential business opportunity to
serve as a corporate officer and that the injunction was causing him "psychological stress." Shortly after the close of the fiscal year, the district court
denied the motion.
84

Discovery Matters In Commission Enforcement Actions-In
SEC v. First
Jersey Securities, Inc. ,276 the United States Court of Appeals for the Second

Circuit affirmed a district court order finding a branch manager of First Jersey
in contempt for failing to produce subpoenaed corporate documents. The
court of appeals thus rejected the manager's assertion of the Fifth Amend.
ment's privilege against self. incrimination. The manager had contended that
the act of production itself would incriminate him, relying on cases upholding
the privilege if the act of production would reveal incriminating information
previously unknown to the government, such as the existence, authenticity or
possession of the documents. The Second Circuit agreed with the district
court that the testimonial effect of production would be negligible because the
existence, possession, and authenticity of the documents were foregone
conclusions. The court found it unnecessary to rule on the Commission's
contention that the act-of-production privilege, like the general Fifth Amendment privilege, does not apply to a custodian of corporate records.
Litigation InvolVing Requests For Access To Commission Records-Although
the Commission received more than 5,500 Freedom of Information Act (FOIA)
and confidential treatment requests in fiscal year 1988, only three of those
requests resulted in the filing of court actions against the Commission, all of
which are awaiting resolution. The Commission received 2,362 requests under
the FOIA for access to Commission records and 3,295 requests for confidential treatment from persons who submitted information. In fiscal year 1988,
there were 70 appeals of denials of FOIA requests to the Commission's
General Counsel and six appeals of denials of confidential treatment requests.
In fiscal year 1988, the Commission filed its brief in Occidental Petroleum
Corp. v. SEC,277 an appeal in which the Commission seeks to overturn a
district court order requiring the Commission to take additional procedural
steps in determining Occidental's claim for confidential treatment of documents requested by a third party under FOIA. The documents had been
obtained by the staff during its investigation of questionable foreign payments. The Commission's brief argues that the Commission's procedures give
a confidential treatment requestor adequate notice and opportunity to submit
evidence to the FOIA officer and the General Counsel, who conducts a de novo
review. The brief also argues that the additional procedures proposed by the
district court are either contrary to law or would establish bad policy. Shortly
after the beginning of the new fiscal year, the United States Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia heard oral argument in this appeal.
In In re Sealed Case,278 plaintiffs in a private securities law civil action
sought to overturn a district court order upholding the Commission's claims
that information the plaintiffs were seeking through discovery was protected
from discovery by the attorney work product doctrine and the law enforcement
investigatory files privileges. The plaintiffs had sought testimony from Commission staff concerning information that the Commission had gathered in an
enforcement investigation. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit agreed that both the law enforcement investigatory privilege and
attorney work product immunity applied to the information sought, and had
been properly asserted by the Commission. Because both privileges are
85

qualified, however, the court remanded the case to allow the district court to
balance competing public and private interests.
Actions Under the Equal Access ToJustice Act (EAJA)-In SEC v. Fox,279the
United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the district court's
denial of attorneys' fees under the EAJA to the prevailing party in a
Commission insider trading action. The court held that the district court had
not abused its discretion in determining that the Commission was substantially justified in bringing the action, even though Fox won the case on the
merits. In the court's view, the facts established by the Commission could have
supported a finding that the information possessed by defendants when they
traded was material and that the defendants acted with scienter.
Actions Against the Commission-The
United States District Court for the
District of Columbia granted a Commission request for attorneys' fees as a
sanction under Federal Rule Civil Procedure 11 in Awkard v. SEC. 280 The
district court adopted the Commission's method of using market rates for
private attorneys of commensurate experience in calculating the amount of
fees, and indicated that the government may similarly seek attorneys' fees as
a sanction under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 37 against private litigants
who violate federal discovery rules.
In Panaro v. von Stein,281 the court dismissed an action which alleged that
the Commission and several employees had violated the plaintiffs constitutional rights during a Commission investigation. Plaintiff had repeatedly
failed to appear for her deposition and had subsequently moved for a
voluntary dismissal of the lawsuit which would enable her to reinstate it at a
later date. The court dismissed the lawsuit with prejudice as to certain
defendants and without prejudice as to the remaining defendants. To date,
plaintiff has not reinstated her allegations.
.
In SEC v. The Electronic Warehouse, Inc. ,282 a Commission injunctive action,
defendant William A. Calvo filed a counterclaim alleging that the staff had
engaged in misconduct. The United States District Court for the District of
Connecticut held that defendant Calvo's counterclaim was barred by Section
21(g) of the Exchange Act, which prohibits consolidating Commission injunctive actions with other actions absent Commission consent. The court also
struck Calvo's affirmative defenses based on alleged staff misconduct, and
permanently enjoined Calvo from violating antifraud provisions of the federal
securities laws. The violations stemmed from Calvo's role as the underwriter's
attorney in the public offering of stock of The Electronics Warehouse, Inc.
In SEC v. The Royale Group, Ltd.., 283 the United States District Court for the
District of Columbia denied a motion by defendants, The Royale Group, Ltd.,
and entered an order against them imposing sanctions. The court had entered
the contempt order based on defendants' failure to file annual and quarterly
reports as required by an injunction to which they consented in 1982. The
court rejected defendants' arguments that they had mistakenly consented to
the injunction without realizing that contempt could be imposed "without
further notice."
Actions Against Professionals Under Commission Rule 2(e) The staff is
litigating against a number of professionals under Commission Rule 2(e).

86

During the last fiscal year, two such actions were concluded. In In re Bill R.
Thomas,284 the Commission found that a partner in a national accounting firm
had engaged in improper professional conduct, had violated antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws and had aided and abetted violations of the
reporting provisions when he audited the financial statements of a publiclyowned corporation in which he owned stock. The Commission permanently
denied the respondent the privilege of appearing or practicing before it.
Shortly after the end of the fiscal year, the United States Court of Appeals for
the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Commission in all respects.285
In In re SchuLtzenberg,286 after two weeks of trial, a partner in the national
accounting firm of Touche, Ross & Co. consented to a Commission order that
censured him and ordered him not to practice before the Commission for one
year, subject to certain conditions. The staff had alleged that the partner
engaged in improper professional conduct by issuing an "unqualified" audit
report when he lacked a reasonable basis for expressing an opinion on the
adequacy of the allowances reserved for certain potential losses, and failed to
address inaccuracies with respect to aging accounts information that was
contained in the client's public filings.
Actions Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act-The
district courts
dismissed two actions filed under the Right to Financial Privacy Act seeking
to block Commission subpoenas of customer financial information from their
banks.287 In each of these cases, the Court found that the Commission was
seeking the records for a legitimate law enforcement purpose, and that the
records were relevant to the investigation. The courts therefore ordered
compliance with the Commission's subpoenas.
Actions Raising Equal Employment Issues-In Broderick v. Ruder,288 the
United States District Court for the District of Columbia found that Title VIIof
the Civil Rights Act of 1964 was violated when the management of the
Commission's former Washington Regional Office created and left unrernedied a sexually hostile work environment which impaired the plaintiffs ability
to perform her job. The court also found that the plaintiff had been retaliated
against because of her complaints regarding the environment. The Commission subsequently settled the case, and retained an Equal Employment
Opportunity (EEO) expert to review the Commission's EEO process and
policies and make recommendations for improvement.
Significant Legislative Developments
Insider Trading-At the conclusion of the session, the 100th Congress
passed The Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988.
That Act included a variety of provisions designed to enhance the effectiveness of Commission enforcement efforts and increase the penalties for insider
trading. The Act amended the Insider Trading Sanctions Act to provide actions
for civil penalties against controlling persons who fail to take appropriate steps
to prevent or detect insider trading violations by their employees or controlled
persons. Provisions of the Act also require broker-dealers and investment
advisers to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
87

that are reasonably designed to prevent the misuse of material, nonpublic
information. The Act increased the criminal penalties for securities law
violations, expressly granted private rights of action for damages to contemporaneous traders in insider trading cases, and authorized the Commission to
award payments to persons who provide information in insider trading cases.
As discussed below, the Act also included a provision designed to enhance
cooperation in international enforcement efforts. Finally, it authorized a
special study of the securities laws to be conducted by the Commission,
contingent upon the subsequent appropriation of funds. The Insider Trading
and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988 was signed by President
Reagan on November 19, 1988.
During the second session of the 100th Congress, the Senate continued its
consideration of a statutory definition of insider trading. Following a series of
hearings before the Subcommittee on Securities of the Senate Banking,
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which included consideration of a
Commission legislative proposal, the Commission submitted a revised proposal to define insider trading on November 18, 1987. Chairman Ruder
testified concerning this revised definition at a hearing before the Subcommittee on December 15, 1987. On February 8, 1988, the Commission
proposed language for inclusion in the legislative history to accompany the
revised insider trading definition.
International Enforcement-On
June 3, 1988, the Commission sent to
Congress the International Securities Enforcement Cooperation Act of 1988.
The legislation, in an attempt to facilitate greater international cooperation
among securities authorities, proposed an amendment to Section 21(a) of the
Exchange Act to provide the Commission with discretion to conduct investigations for the purpose of assisting a foreign securities authority. It specified
that, in exercising this discretion, the Commission shall consider whether the
requesting authority has agreed to provide reciprocal assistance in securities
matters to the Commission, and whether compliance with the request would
prejudice the public interest of the United States. This provision was included
in the Insider Trading and Securities Fraud Enforcement Act of 1988.
Other provisions of the proposed bill would permit the Commission to
maintain the confidentiality of certain records obtained from foreign authorities under reciprocal agreements, and would make explicit the Commission's
rulemaking authority to grant both domestic and foreign persons access to the
Commission's investigative files. Finally, the proposed legislation would
amend the Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act of 1940, and the
Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to permit the Commission to impose
sanctions on securities professionals found by a foreign tribunal to have
engaged in misconduct abroad that, had the same misconduct taken place in
the United States, would have subjected the professional to a Commission
disciplinary proceeding. Chairman Ruder testified in support of the proposed
legislation before the Subcommittee on Securities of the Senate Banking,
Housing and Urban Affairs Committee on June 29, 1988, and before the
Subcommittee on Telecommunications and Finance of the House Energy and
Commerce Committee on August 3, 1988.

88

Securities and Exchange Commission Authorization Act of 1987 -In November 1987, Congress passed the Securities and Exchange Commission Authorization Act of 1987, which included budget authorizations for fiscal years
1988 and 1989 and a number of technical amendments to the federal
securities laws previously proposed by the Commission. President Reagan
signed this legislation into law on November 4, 1987.
The Act authorizes appropriations of $158 5 million and $172.2 million for
fiscal years 1988 and 1989, respectively, including expenditures of $15
million and $20 million in those years for the development of the Commission's proposed electronic data gathering, analysis and retrieval project
(EDGAR). The most significant of the Act's technical amendments enhanced
the enforcement authority of the Commission and the bank regulatory
agencies over transfer agents and persons associated with them. This new
authority is comparable to the Commission's authority over brokers and
dealers, municipal securities dealers, government securities brokers and
dealers, and persons associated with those entities.
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act-On
August 23, 1988, President Reagan
signed into law the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act of 1988. Title V
of the Trade Act amended the accounting and anti-bribery provisions of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977_ The Commission had previously
testified before the 100th Congress in favor of a bill that proposed similar
amendments.
The amendments modified the accounting provisions of Section 13(b) of
the Exchange Act in several ways. They added a new subparagraph (5) that
prohibits any person from knowingly circumventing or failing to implement a
system of internal accounting controls, or knowingly falsifying any required
book, record, or account. The amendments also provided that criminal
liability may be imposed only for violations of new subsection (bX5). In
addition, they specify that an issuer's books and records need contain only the
level of detail and degree of assurance that would satisfy prudent officials in
the conduct of their own affairs.
With respect to the anti-bribery provisions of Section 30A, Title V changed
the standard of liability for payments made through third parties from the
prior "knowing or having reason to know" standard to a "knowing" standard.
The amendments also established an affirmative defense to liability based on
a showing that the payment was lawful under the written laws and regulations
of the foreign official's country or that it was for certain reasonable and bona
fide expenditures incurred by or on behalf of a foreign official. Finally, Title V
raised the maximum criminal fine for violations of Section 30A to $2 million
for issuers and $100,000 for individuals, and authorized the Commission to
seek a civil penalty of up to $10,000 for a violation.
Finencisl Seroices-During
the 100th Congress, Chairman Ruder testified
four times before Congressional committees that studied the structure and
regulation of the financial services industry and considered proposed legislation to repeal or modify the Glass-Steagall Act.289 Chairman Ruder
expressed the Commission's support for its own legislative proposal, the
proposed Bank Broker-Dealer Act, which was introduced in the House as H.R.
89

2557 and in the Senate as S. 1175. That proposed legislation would generally
subject banks engaged in securities activities to the same regulations,
enforced by the Commission, that apply to all other entities engaged in those
activities. In February 1988, the Commission's staff, in conjunction with the
staffs of the bank regulatory agencies, drafted proposed amendments to the
federal securities laws to address investor protection concerns raised by the
expansion of bank securities activities. Those amendments would bring most
bank securities activities within the broker-dealer regulatory framework
designed by Congress for the protection of investors, and would also address
investor protection issues raised by bank entry into investment company
activities.
At the request of Chairman Edward J. Markey, the Commission prepared a
report on issues raised by Glass-Steagall Act repeal for the Subcommittee on
Telecommunications
and Finance of the House Energy and Commerce
Committee. The Commission's report, as well as Chairman Ruder's testimony
before the Subcommittee on April 13, 1988, expressed support for modification or repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, provided that such modification or
repeal is accompanied by the amendments to the federal securities laws
drafted by the staffs of the Commission and the banking regulators.
Securities Law Enforcement Remedies Act-On September 28, 1988, the
Commission sent to Congress the "Securities law Enforcement Remedies Act
of 1988;' a legislative proposal which would amend the Securities Act, the
Exchange Act, the Investment Company Act, and the Investment Advisers Act
to provide the Commission with new enforcement remedies. The proposed
legislation would provide that civil money penalties could be imposed by the
Commission in administrative proceedings, and by courts in civil actions
brought by the Commission. It would also provide the Commission with
administrative authority to bar or suspend corporate officers and directors
from service in that capacity with a public company, and affirms the authority
of courts to impose such remedies in Commission civil actions. Finally, the
proposed legislation would expand the scope of Section 15(c)(4) of the
Exchange Act to permit sanctions to be imposed under that section for
violations of Section 16(a) of the Act.
The proposed legislation was based, in part, on recommendations of the
National Commission on Fraudulent Financial Reporting (the Treadway
Commission). The Treadway Commission Report, which was issued in
October 1987, made forty-nine recommendations to reduce the incidence
of fraudulent financial reporting. The recommendations
were directed to
public companies, the accounting profession, the Commission and other
regulatory authorities, and the academic community. On May 2, 1988,
Chairman Ruder presented the Commission's views before the House
Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations concerning the thirteen
recommendations
that were addressed to, or that would have a direct
impact on, the Commission. Chairman Ruder stated that the Commission
would, in addition to drafting the legislation described above, consider
implementing
certain other Treadway Commission recommendations
through rulemaking.

90

Market Break Proposals-During
the fiscal year, Chairman Ruder testified at
a series of hearings held by various Congressional committees on issues
raised by the October 1987 market break.29O In particular, on June 14, 1988,
Chairman Ruder testified before the House Committee on Agriculture concerning legislative proposals that were endorsed by the Commission at an
open meeting on May 26, 1988. Subsequently, the Commission transmitted
specific legislative recommendations to Congress on June 23, July 6, and
July 7, 1988. Congress did not take action on these proposals before it
adjourned.
The legislative proposals sent to Congress on June 23, 1988, consist of four
separate recommendations. First, the Commission proposed that it be provided with authority to take a variety of actions to respond to a market
emergency. Such authority, which would be roughly equivalent to current
Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) emergency authority, would
include the authority to implement delayed openings and early closings of the
securities markets as well as temporary trading halts.291 Second, the Commission recommended amendments to the Exchange Act and the Commodity
Exchange Act to add certain findings to those Acts expressing the need for an
enhanced clearing system and directing the Commission and the CFTC to
facilitate the establishment of integrated, cross-market clearance and settlement systems. Third, the Commission proposed amending the Exchange Act
to include a holding company risk assessment provision that would expressly
authorize the Commission to require certain entities registered with the
Commission, including brokers and dealers, to report information relating to
their associated persons that may have a material impact on the financial or
operational condition of the registered entity. Fourth, the Commission sought
authority to adopt reporting rules regarding large securities transactions and
certain transactions in futures markets that are related to transactions in the
securities markets. The Commission expressed the view that such authority
would enhance its ability to identify and monitor activities that are likely to
affect the equities markets. The Commission also recognized that confidentiality and privacy protections must be an essential part of such legislation.
On July 6, 1988, the Commission sent to Congress another portion of the
proposed legislation endorsed by the Commission at the May 26 meeting.
That proposal would amend the Exchange Act and the Commodity Exchange
Act to establish a new regulatory scheme for setting initial and maintenance
margin levels on securities (other than exempted securities) and equity index
futures (and options on such futures). The proposal would allocate responsibility for setting margins to the securities and commodities self-regulatory
organizations, and provide for regulatory oversight by the Commission and
the CFTC of "prudential" margins, i.e., the margin levels deemed necessary to
protect securities and commodities futures firms and clearing corporations
from margin defaults. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
would have residual authority to regulate margins as it deems necessary or
appropriate to accommodate commerce and industry, to maintain fair and
orderly financial markets, or to govern the use of credit to finance securities
transactions, having due regard for general credit conditions of the economy.

91

On July 7, 1988, the Commission transmitted to Congress the final portion
of its legislative package. That proposal, which was designed to create a more
consolidated regulatory structure for the securities and stock index futures
markets, would amend the federal securities laws and the Commodity
Exchange Act to provide the Commission with regulatory authority over
equity and derivative equity instruments-stocks,
options, stock index
futures, and options on stock index futures.
Municipal Securities-On September 22, 1988, the Commission authorized
the release of a 376-page report prepared by its staff (Staff Report) containing
a comprehensive discussion of the facts and circumstances that led to the
largest default of publicly-issued securities in the history of the capital
markets: In the Matter of Transactions in Washington Public Power Supply
System (WPPSS)Securities. The Staff Report described the participation of the
parties involved in the WPPSS project and its financing, and discussed several
areas in which the disclosures made to investors in WPPSS securities were
deficient. In a separate letter transmitting the Staff Report to Congress,
Chairman Ruder stated that the Commission had determined to close the
investigation without initiating an enforcement action after considering the
facts set forth in the Staff Report in the context of applicable legal standards
and industry practices, the potential costs and benefits that would be
associated with Commission enforcement action, and the extent to which the
WPPSS matter reflected systematic characteristics of the regulatory framework for municipal securities that might be addressed more appropriately by
regulatory or legislative initiatives.
In order to put into perspective certain of its decisions concerning the
municipal securities markets, including the WPPSS matter, the Commission issued a Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission on
Regulation of Municipal Securities (Report). That Report described the
background against which the Commission's decisions in this area were
made, including the existing regulatory framework applicable to municipal
securities, the circumstances surrounding both the 1975 New York City
fiscal crisis and the WPPSS matter, and the extent to which voluntary
efforts by various entities had improved the degree of investor protection
in the municipal securities market.
In addition, the Report discussed a Commission release requesting comment on a proposed rule that would require underwriters of issues of
municipal securities having an aggregate offering price in excess of ten
million dollars to obtain and review a nearly final official statement before
bidding for or purchasing the securities. That release also requested comment
on the Commission's interpretation of the legal standards applicable to
municipal underwriters, based upon judicial decisions and previous administrative actions, which emphasized that underwriters must have a reasonable
basis for believing the key representations concerning any municipal securities that they underwrite. Finally, the release requested comment on a
proposal by the MSRB and members of the industry to establish a central
repository to collect information concerning municipal securities. The Report
also described the institution of a special inspection project to evaluate the

92

unit investment trust industry and determine whether any regulatory changes
are needed.

Corporate Reorganizations
The Commission acts in a statutory advisor's role in reorganization cases
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code to see that the interests of public
investors are adequately protected. In these cases a debtor generally is allowed
to continue business operations under court protection while it negotiates a
plan to rehabilitate the business and to pay the company's debts. Reorganization plans often provide for the issuance of new securities to creditors and
shareholders in exchange for part or all of their claims or interests in the
debtor, under an exemption in the Bankruptcy Code from registration under
the Securities Act.
In its capacity as special advisor, the Commission may raise or present its
views on any issue in a Chapter 11 case. Although the Commission may not
initiate an appeal, it frequently participates in appeals taken by others. While
Chapter 11 relief is available to businesses of all sizes, the Commission
generally limits its participation to cases involving debtors that have publicly
traded securities registered under the Exchange Act. In fiscal year 1988, the
Commission presented its views on a variety of issues.
Committees-Official
committees are empowered to negotiate with a
debtor in possession on the administration of a case and to participate in all
aspects of the case, including formulation of a reorganization plan. With court
approval, an official committee is permitted to employ, as a cost of administration, one or more attorneys, accountants, or other professionals to assist
the committee in performing its duties. In addition to a committee representing creditors holding unsecured claims, the Code allows the court or a United
States Trustee to appoint additional committees for stockholders and others
where necessary to assure adequate representation of their interests. During
fiscal year 1988, the Commission moved or supported motions for the
appointment of committees to represent investors in three Chapter 11
cases.292
In two cases-In
re Global Marine, lnc., et al.293 and In re Allegheny
International, lnc., et al. 294_the Commission supported efforts by certain
indenture trustees to form separate official committees to represent public
holders of subordinated debentures. In both cases, the mandatory unsecured
creditors' committee had represented not only the general unsecured creditors (senior creditors) but also the subordinated debentureholders. In Global
Marine the committee consisted of four holders of general unsecured claims
and four representatives of holders of public subordinated debentures. In
Allegheny, the sole representative for debentureholders on the committee was
the indenture trustee. In both cases, the debtors' proposed plans of
reorganization-which
provided for disparate treatment for holders of senior
unsecured debt and subordinated debt-created
a conflict of interest between
the members of the committee which prevented the committee from effectively representing the interests of the subordinated debenture holders. Consequently, negotiations of the plan of reorganization were stymied.

93

The Commission argued in both cases that the conflict of interest
impeded the existing committee from providing holders of the public debt
with adequate representation at a critical juncture of the case-the
negotiation of the terms of plan of reorganization. The Commission
therefore urged that it was critical that public investors be represented by
a separate committee able to advocate their interests. The Commission
pointed out that since the proceedings were in the latter stages the
increased administrative costs of an additional committee should not be a
significant burden to the estate. In GLobaLMarine, the bankruptcy court
agreed with the Commission that a separate committee should be
appointed but limited the scope of the duties of the new committee to
negotiation of a reorganization plan. In Allegheny, the bankruptcy court
denied the motion to appoint a separate committee of debentureholders
but ordered the United States trustee to appoint two additional members to
the unsecured committee to represent debentureholders.
The Commission addressed another important issue relating to committees
in In re MeLridge, Inc.295 In this case, objections were filed by creditors and an
indenture trustee raising the issue of the proper standard to be applied to the
review of an interim fee application of counsel for an official equity securityholders' committee where the estate proves to be insolvent. The Commission
argued that: (1) the statutory language and the policy underlying the Bankruptcy Code required that official committee counsel be compensated for
services reasonably related to the performance of the committee's official
responsibilities; and (2) whether the debtor is, or may be, insolvent is irrelevant
to whether compensation should be awarded to official equity committee
counsel pursuant to Section 330 of the Bankruptcy Code. After a hearing, the
bankruptcy court, without deciding the question of whether the debtor's
insolvency was relevant to an award of compensation under Section 330 of the
Code, granted counsel's interim fee application.
Estate Administration- The Commission acts to protect the interests of
public investors in reorganization cases by participating on selected issues
involving administration of the debtor's estate that have a significant impact
upon the rights of public investors.
In In re Beldunn-United Corp. et aL., 296 the Commission, in an appeal to the
district court, addressed the question of the proper legal standard for
determining whether an indenture trustee is entitled to compensation from
the estate as an administrative expense for its activities on behalf of the
bondholders during the course of the reorganization. The bankruptcy court
had denied almost all of an indenture trustee's request for reimbursement as
an administrative expense under Section 503(b) of the Bankruptcy Code,
which authorizes reimbursement for services that make "a substantial contribution in a case." The court found that, for the most part, the indenture
trustee's activities and those of its counsel benefitted only the bondholders
and thus did not constitute a demonstrable benefit to the estate as a whole. In
the Commission's view, the bankruptcy court applied too stringent a test in
requiring a direct benefit to the estate stemming from the indenture trustee's
participation in the reorganization process.
94

The Commission urged in its brief that an indenture trustee should be
entitled to compensation pursuant to the "substantial contribution" standard
if:
(1) the indenture trustee has, through its representation of the interests of
bondholders, made demonstrable efforts towards furthering the reorganization process; and
(2) the indenture trustee's services or those of its counsel do not duplicate
the services of official participants or other indenture trustees.
This test strikes a proper balance between the purposes of the administrative
expenses provision of Section 503(b)-encouraging participation of parties in
interest in reorganization proceedings-and
preserving the assets of the
estate for rehabilitation of the debtor and ultimate distribution to creditors.
This matter is still pending.
In In re Allegheny International, Inc. ,297 the Commission participated in
litigation on the issue of whether an annual meeting of stockholders can be
held during the pendency of a Chapter 11 case. The regular annual meeting
had been scheduled by Allegheny's board of directors after the company filed
its Chapter 11 petitions. Creditors of Allegheny had sought unsuccessfully to
enjoin the annual meeting and a proxy contest for control of the board of
directors conducted under the direction of the official equity securityholders'
committee. The Commission urged that: (1) the correct legal standard in
deciding whether or not to enjoin an annual shareholder meeting, consistent
with the position urged by the Commission in In re Johns-Manville Corp., 801
F.2d 60 (2d Cir. 1986), is that an annual meeting that is sought during the plan
negotiation phase of a Chapter 11 reorganization case should not be enjoined
absent a showing of "clear abuse" of the shareholders' corporate governance
rights, such that holding the meeting would jeopardize any possibility of
reorganization; and (2) the district court correctly held that the record in this
case did not support a finding of clear abuse. The annual meeting took place
pursuant to a district court order and management retained control of the
board. The pending appeal before the Third Circuit was thereafter terminated
by stipulation.
With regard to a question of adequacy of notice for the filing of claims, in
In re Standard Metals,298 the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit, in a decision on rehearing, agreed with the Commission's position that
both the debtor and the bankruptcy court have a duty to assure that adequate
notice is given to unscheduled creditors of the date by which claims against
the debtor must be filed (claims bar date), at least when their existence
becomes known prior to the filing of a plan of reorganization. In this case, the
bankruptcy court and the district court had dismissed as untimely a class
claim filed on behalf of industrial revenue bond purchasers who had securities
fraud claims against the debtor. The claims were not listed on the debtor's
schedules, and no notice was given to unscheduled creditors of the claims bar
date. The bankruptcy court, in a opinion upheld by the district court, ruled
that neither the debtor nor the bankruptcy court has a duty to assure notice
of the claims bar date to unscheduled creditors.
The Tenth Circuit ruled, on rehearing, as the Commission had urged, that

95

where no notice of the claims bar date was directed to holders of the bonds and
an individual bondholder filed a late claim on behalf of the bondholder class,
notice to the bondholders was required once the existence of their claims
became known. Observing that the bondholder claimants in the case became
known to the debtor and to the bankruptcy court early in the reorganization
proceeding, the court ordered that notice now be directed to the bondholders
and that they be given an opportunity to file claims in the reorganization case.
The Tenth Circuit left standing, however, its earlier ruling that class claims are
not permissible in bankruptcy.299
During the fiscal year, the Commission reiterated in a number of bankruptcy
cases its position taken in several cases last year (53rd Annual Report at 73),
that class claims are permissible in bankruptcy. The Commission believes
that, under principles of statutory construction, the well-recognized right to
file class claims outside of bankruptcy is equally available in bankruptcy
cases. Further, the Commission concludes that there are sound policy reasons
for allowing class claims in bankruptcy. The class action is a particularly
suitable device for the assertion of multiple small claims where, although no
one individual has a stake in the outcome sufficient to support the costs of
filing and pursuing the claim, the litigation may be conducted economically
if the claims are aggregated. Finally, allowing class claims in bankruptcy
fosters the bankruptcy policy of resolving all legal obligations of the debtor in
one proceeding.
In In re American Reseroe,300 the Commission won an important victory
when the Seventh Circuit, agreeing with the statutory and policy arguments
made by the Commission, ruled that class proofs of claim are permissible in
bankruptcy. In In re Standard Metals Corporation 301 the Solicitor General of
the United States filed a brief on behalf of the Commission in the Supreme
Court on a petition for a writ of certiorari in that case. The brief reiterated the
Commission arguments that, under the Bankruptcy Code and Rules, class
proofs of claim are permissible in bankruptcy proceedings. For several
reasons unique to this case, however, the brief concluded that certiorari should
not be granted. Subsequently, the petition for a writ of certiorari was dismissed
after the parties had reached a settlement providing for most of the relief they
sought before the Supreme Court.
The Commission has participated in several other cases urging that class
claims are permissible in bankruptcy. In In re Charter CO.302 an appeal is
pending in the Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit. Appeals are also
pending before the district courts in In re L7V Corporation 303 (class claim
denied) and in In re Allegheny International, Inc. et al.304 (class claim denied).
Finally in a case of note, in In re Allis.Chalmers Corporation, et al.305 the
bankruptcy court, in a ruling that was not appealed, disagreed with the
Commission and ruled that class proofs of claim are not permissible in
bankruptcy cases. Instead, it (1) directed the debtor to provide notice by
publication or other means calculated to alert members of the class of the
pendency of the class action, and (2) extended the claims bar date for a
reasonable period to allow individual claims to be filed by such potential
creditors.

96

In In re Melridge, Inc.306 the Commission addressed the question of whether
an indenture and debentures qualified under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939
were executory contracts. In this case the indenture trustee moved to require
the debtor to assume the indenture, claiming it was an executory contract. The
effect of assuming the indenture would be to automatically make the
indenture trustee's services during the case an administrative expense. In
response, the debtor moved to reject the indenture and debentures themselves, as burdensome executory contracts. The effect of such rejection would
be to eliminate participation in the bankruptcy proceeding by the indenture
trustee. The Commission argued in response that the indenture and debentures issued under it are not executory under the Code because nothing
remains for the bondholder to do except receive payment. Moreover, the
post-default duties of an indenture trustee are not obligations for the benefit
of the debtor/issuer, which can be subject to rejection under Section 365, but
rather are for the benefit of the bondholders. The Commission also pointed
out that to allow rejection would contravene the policies of the Trust Indenture
Act and the Bankruptcy Code which both contemplate an active role for the
trustee. Finally, the Commission pointed out that assumption of the indenture
as requested by the indenture trustee, which would automatically secure an
administrative expense priority for its services, is contrary to the statutory
scheme established in the Bankruptcy Code for compensating indenture
trustees for services rendered in connection with reorganization proceedings.
The bankruptcy court denied the debtor's motion but did not reach the
question of whether the indenture or the debentures were executory contracts.
Disclosure Statements/Plans of Reorganization-A disclosure statement is a
combination proxy and offering statement used in soliciting acceptances of a
plan of reorganization. Such plans often provide for the exchange of new
securities for claims and interests of creditors and shareholders of the debtor.
The Bankruptcy Code provides that adequate disclosure is to be made without
regard to whether or not the information provided would otherwise comply
with the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws. But, in
recognition of the Commission's special expertise on disclosure questions,
the Bankruptcy Code recognizes the Commission's right to be heard, distinct
from its special advisory role, on the adequacy of disclosure. For this reason,
the Bankruptcy Rules require service on the Commission of all disclosure
statements.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission received approximately 6,713
disclosure statements filed in Chapter 11 cases involving both privately-held
and publicly-held corporations. The staff limits its review to those disclosure
statements filed in cases involving a publicly-held company or a company
likely to be publicly traded as a consequence of the reorganization. During
1988, the staff reviewed 151 disclosure statements.
In its review of disclosure statements, the staff seeks to determine whether
the issuance of securities under a plan is consistent with the exemption from
registration in the Bankruptcy Code and otherwise in compliance with the
federal securities laws. The Commission also reviews statements to determine
whether there is adequate disclosure concerning the proposed plan. Generally,

97

the Commission seeks to resolve questions concerning bankruptcy disclosure
through staff comments to the plan proponent. If questions cannot be
resolved through this process, the Commission may object to the disclosure
statement in the bankruptcy court.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission commented on disclosure statements in 83 cases, the vast majority of which were adopted by debtors. The
Commission was compelled to object to disclosure statements in two cases. In
In re Vidalia Sweets Brand, Inc. ,307 the Commission filed objections to the
debtor's disclosure statement arguing that it did not contain adequate
information because it failed to disclose: (1) the rationale or authority for
substantively consolidating the debtor with another Chapter 11 debtor; (2)
sufficient financial information, including a current and pro forma balance
sheet and projections of future operations; (3)a liquidation analysis to support
the debtor's conclusion that shareholders would receive nothing upon liquidation; (4) a basis on which to determine whether the proposed plan is
feasible; (5) the debtor's intention with respect to meeting its reporting
requirements under the Exchange Act; (6) the effect of dilution upon existing
shareholders; and (7) tax consequences of the plan to creditors and stockholders. The disclosure statement also failed to disclose, accurately, the
transactional exemption from registration of the securities proposed to be
issued under the plan. The bankruptcy court agreed with the Commission's
objections and declined to approve the disclosure statement. In In re The
Rolfite Company 308 the Commission filed objections to the debtor's disclosure statement arguing that it did not contain adequate information because
it failed to: (1) contain a required provision prohibiting the issuance of
non-voting equity securities; (2) characterize existing equity securityholders,
whose voting rights are to be substantially diluted under the proposed plan, as
impaired, thus denying them the opportunity to review the disclosure statement and vote on the plan; and (3) provide additional or more complete
financial information concerning the debtor. The debtor consented to amend
the disclosure statement to meet the principal objections posed by the
Commission.
Compliance with the Registration Requirements of the Securities Act-Section
1145 of the Bankruptcy Code contains a limited exemption from registration
under the Securities Act for the distribution of securities by a debtor, or an
affiliate or successor to the debtor, pursuant to a plan of reorganization and in
exchange for claims against or securities of the debtor or such affiliate. The
issuance of securities pursuant to a plan is deemed to be a "public offering;'
which means that there is no restriction on resale of such securities unless the
seller is an "underwriter" as specifically defined in Section 1145(b).
In one case litigated this year, In re Cordyne Corporalion,309 the Commission
filed objections to confirmation of the debtor's plan of reorganization for
failure to comply with the registration provisions. The plan, if confirmed,
would have resulted in a unrelated privately-held entity becoming a public
company through the issuance of unregistered securities pursuant to a merger
with the debtor, a publicly-held company with no assets. The plan also sought
to raise new capital for the reorganized entity through the issuance of

98

certificates of indebtedness to certain lenders resulting, on conversion of the
certificates, in the issuance of the debtor's unregistered securities. First, the
Commission argued that the proposed merger transaction to issue stock to
the shareholders of an unrelated entity did not qualify for the Section 1145
exemption. Those shareholders did not have a pre-petition or any other claim
against or interest in the debtor. Nor could the shareholders of the unrelated
entity, which had no preexisting relationship with the debtor, be considered as
shareholders of affiliate of the debtor for purposes of Section 1145. Second,
the Commission argued that the securities (common stock and warrants) to be
issued to the lenders also did not qualify for the Section 1145 exemption.
Since the funds to be raised were to be used solely after confirmation by the
reorganized debtor, Section 364, the provision governing the issuance of
certificates of indebtedness, was not applicable and the certificates issued to
the lenders were not valid administrative claims. Section 364 authorizes a
debtor to borrow funds as an administrative expense for the debtor's business
operations during the case, not for post-confirmation purposes. Hence, the
Commission argued that Section 1145, which exempts from registration the
issuance of securities in exchange for administrative claims, could not be
relied upon to exempt the issuance of debtor's securities in exchange for the
lenders' certificate of indebtedness. Finally, the Commission objected to
confirmation of the debtor's plan of reorganization pursuant to Section
1129(d) because, even if the court concluded that the foregoing transactions
were within the Section 1145 exemption, the plan still could not be confirmed
since its principal purpose was to avoid the application of Section 5 of the
Securities Act. The Commission argued that the debtor's plan was a device by
which a privately owned corporation would become publicly owned without
complying with the registration provisions of Section 5 of the Securities Act
of 1933. The bankruptcy court, accepting the Commission's arguments,
denied confirmation.

Economic Research and Analysis
Key 1988 Results
The economic and statistical research program provides analysis and
technical support designed to aid the evaluation of the economic aspects of
Commission and self-regulatory regulation and its impacts on the rapidly
changing global marketplace. This program is carried out by the Office of
Economic Analysis (OEA).
The economic staff provides the Commission with economic advice and
research sudies on rule proposals, established policy, and the capital markets.
The staff assists the Commission in making decisions affecting the fairness,
efficiency, and structure of our nation's securities industry and markets. In
addition, the program encompasses statistical monitoring of major program
initiatives impacting the securities industry and the preparation of monthly
reports on developments in domestic and international capital markets.
Several developments have increased the volume and complexity of the
work performed by the Economic and Statistical Program, including the
October 1987 market break, the application of new technology within the
industry, and the increasing use of economics and financial theory in
enforcement cases. In addition, the growing internationalization of securities
markets has increased the need to keep abreast of economic, regulatory, and
institutional changes in foreign securities markets that could have an effect on
the operation and competitiveness of the United States securities markets.
Internationalization presents both challenges and opportunities for the
United States securities markets and its regulators. The events of October
1987 indicated once again the extent to which the world's securities markets
have become interrelated. Further growth and integration of international
securities markets is anticipated in the years ahead, presenting numerous
regulatory and economic issues. This integration and growth of the global
markets will require the development of a global regulatory perspective that
preserves the efficiencies associated with international capital mobility, while
maintaining the integrity and fairness of the United States market. The rapid
maturation of foreign securities markets and the regulatory restructuring that
is now occurring in the United Kingdom, Canada, Japan, and the European
Community offer important regulatory challenges to the Commission. It is
essential to maintain the fairness and integrity of our markets while leaving
U.S. firms free to meet the challenges of increased international competition
in the provision of financial services.
During fiscal year 1988, the economics staff reviewed 115 rules, encompassing the full range of the Commission's regulatory program. In addition,
the economics staff reviewed 95 RFAanalyses and certifications, and provided
advice, technical assistance, and empirical analyses of 310 issues of concern
to the Commission and its operating divisions. Twelve monitoring programs
100

were developed or maintained to study the implementation of major rules,
new trading facilities, and developments in the domestic and international
securities markets. The economics staff created or maintained approximately
75 computerized databases needed to analyze issues and prepared about 600
written responses to technical and data inquiries.
In the securities markets area, the staff prepared a monthly monitoring
report on developments in domestic and international financial markets.
The staff is completing a follow-up report to the Commission's July 1987
Report on the Internationalization of the Securities Markets which was
submitted to Congress. Specifically, the staff is analyzing the extent and
nature of international trading in securities, United States and foreign
portfolio investment patterns, the growth of the international bond and
equity markets, major regulatory restructuring in overseas markets, and
the emergence of various international funds as vehicles to facilitate
international capital flows. The staff continues to monitor and analyze
major developments impacting financial markets, including the effects of
changes in the macroeconomic environment on domestic and international securities markets. The staff helped develop a system to detect and
analyze possible instances of market manipulation involving the use of
options. The staff also assisted the Division of Market Regulation in
responding to Congressional inquiries concerning the extent and impact of
dividend capture programs of Japanese life insurance companies.
Following the October 1987 market break, the staff prepared a comprehensive analysis of the financial condition of securities firms. The staff also
analyzed the impact of the market break on bid-ask spreads, quotation depth
and intraday price volatility on a cross-section of stocks. This analysis was
included in the Division of Market Regulation's report on the October 1987
market break.
In the full disclosure area, the staff responded to a request from the
Chairman to examine the "blank check" phenomenon. The study profiled the
principals and outside professionals associated with blank check offerings,
periodic reporting compliance, post-effective acquisitions, and the market
maker participation in these issues.
The staff assisted the Commission by providing technical assistance in
litigation regarding the new Delaware takeover law.The analysis indicated the
frequency with which various categories of firms would have been affected by
the new law. The staff also examined the effect that the new law has had on
reincorporations and on underlying stock prices.
Studies completed in the corporate control area covered such topics as
leveraged buyouts, sources of tender offer financing, dual class recapitalizations, effects of defeating takeover attempts, and market anticipation of
takeovers. These studies provided the Commission with comprehensive
information identifying important trends in this area. The staff also prepared
a study on the profitability of acquisitions made by target firms of hostile bids.

Management and Program Support
Key 1988 Results
The goals of program direction are to formulate and communicate policy
and to manage agency resources, enabling the Commission to fulfill its
statutory responsibilities. These goals are accomplished by performing two
functions-policy
management and administrative support. Policy management encompasses policy formulation, information dissemination, and management of the agency's resources. Administrative support entails services
such as accounting, data processing, staffing and logistics to support Com.
mission objectives.
Policy Management
In carrying out its mission, the Commission made special efforts to solicit
a wide range of viewpoints on issues affecting investors and the securities
industry. Chairman Ruder and the other Commissioners conferred with
industry and investor representatives on such issues as market volatility,
reform of the securities laws and internationalization. With respect to internationalization, the Commission negotiated cooperative memoranda of
understanding with Canada and Brazil. Additionally, the Chairman visited
regulatory officials in Japan, the United Kingdom and other countries to
discuss the need for greater coordination among the international capital
markets.
The Commission held 74 meetings in fiscal year 1988, during which it
considered 380 matters including rule proposals, enforcement actions, and
other matters that significantly affect the securities markets and the nation's
economy. The Commission also considered 627 routine or emergency items
seriatim.
The Commission's management staff maintained a comprehensive program of oversight, conducting a series of management studies and initiating
special projects throughout the year. The Office of the Executive Director
conducted a special study, requested by the Securities Subcommittee of the
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, into transforming
the agency from appropriated to self-funded status. The study report will be
provided to the Senate Committee early in fiscal year 1989. Among other
projects conducted during fiscal year 1988 were evaluations of investor
complaint processing and public reference room procedures and reviews of
internal controls. In addition, internal audits were conducted of Commission
organizations, programs, functions and activities.
Consumer Affairs and Information Services
Consumer affairs specialists responded to approximately 49,000 complaints and inquiries during fiscal year 1988. Of these, approximately 28,000
102

involved investor disputes with registered broker-dealers. 9.100 related to
general investor inquiries. 6,100 concerned issuers of securities, and 2,500
pertained to mutual funds. The remaining 3,289 involved transfer agents,
banks, investment advisers, or self-regulatory organizations (SROs).
The number of complaints and inquiries represents a 22 percent increase
over the previous year. The primary factor contributing to the increase was the
stock market break in October 1987. A secondary factor was the increased
public awareness of the SEC due to publicity of recent insider trading cases.
During fiscal year 1988, the Office of Consumer Affairs participated with
other SEC organizations in developing the staff report on the October 1987
market break. The office conducted an analysis of "market break complaints"
received by the SEC and the SROs during October 14-30, 1987. Over 1,500
written complaints were directly attributable to the market break. An additional 9,300 telephone complaints and inquiries were received during a
six-week period, beginning October 19. Findings resulting from the consumer
complaint analysis are contained in Chapter 12 of the staff report entitled, The
October 1987 Market Break.
The Office of Consumer Affairs and Information Services also responds to
a variety of information requests. During fiscal year 1988, the office processed
2,308 Freedom of Information Act requests, 35 Privacy Act requests, and
3,295 requests for confidential treatment. In addition, the office coordinated
3,725 requests from the Congress for Commission records, an 87 percent
increase over the previous year.
The Office of Consumer Affairs also assists the Commission's program
areas by gathering specialized data from complaints in support of program
objectives. For example, the office compiles data pertaining to broker-dealer
sales practice abuses and overall complaint trends within the financial services
industry. Investor complaints constitute a prime source of investigatory leads
for the agency's enforcement program.
Public Reference
The Commission maintains public reference rooms in the Washington D.C.,
New York and Chicago offices. In response to the need to improve control over
the Commission's resources, while at the same time enhancing services to the
public, the SEC restructured the Public Reference Room in Washington, D.C.
During fiscal year 1988, more than 43,700 visitors used the Commission's
primary Public Reference Room in Washington D.C. At this facility, the public
can view most corporate filings, broker-dealer and investment adviser registrations, Commission releases, and other public materials. Approximately
380,907 pieces of microfiche, containing 329,431 public documents, were
made available to the public during the fiscal year.
Equal Employment Opportunity
During 1988, the EEO office conducted a national seminar focusing on
EEO and Affirmative Action Programs. Among those attending were EEO
Counselors, Federal Women's Program Coordinators, and Hispanic Employ103

ment Coordinators. In addition, the Commission continued to train agency
staff members on the prevention of sexual harassment in the workplace.
At the same time, the Commission re-activated its Federal Women's
Program. The program emphasized issues important to female employees,
such as personal security and childcare. As in previous years, the Commission
conducted special activities recognizing minority group achievements during
Afro-American History Week, Asian-Pacific American Heritage Week, Hispanic Heritage Week, and Women's Week.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission made gains in the employment of
minority groups and women. By the end of fiscal year 1988, women
constituted almost one-half of the total SEC workforce. In fiscal year 1988, the
employment of black males increased from 5.6 percent to 7.0 percent, and
black females rose from 20.9 percent to 22.0 percent. During the same period,
the employment of Hispanic females increased from 1.4 percent to 2.0
percent, while employment percentages remained constant for Hispanic
males and American Indian/Alaskan natives at 1.0 percent. Additionally,
employment of Asian American/Pacific Islander men and women grew by 1.1
percent and 0.9 percent, respectively.
The SEC-Securities Industry Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity continued its financial support of minority students by awarding $11,100
in scholarships. In addition, through the committee, the Commission coordinated with industry in developing employment strategies to maintain a
balanced workforce of minorities and women during the time of severe
personnel cutbacks in the industry followinq the October 1987 market break.

Facilities Management
Fiscal year 1988 presented numerous space and logistical challenges for
the Office of Administrative Services. The office acquired additional office
space for the Denver Regional Office and for headquarters in Washington, D.C.
The headquarters acquisition provided space for an increase in staff, as well as
continuing consolidation of program staffs. Additionally, the office worked
with General Services Administration (GSA) in locating new space for the
forced relocation of the New York Regional Office.
The Office of Administrative Services exercised increased responsibility in
contracting activities as well. Through authority acquired from GSA, the
agency assumed contracting activities for lease arrangements and service
contracts. The office awarded approximately $13 million in contracts in fiscal
year 1988, an increase of approximately $4 million over fiscal year 1987. A
significant portion of the increase is attributed to the purchase and installation
of a new mainframe computer that replaced the Commission's obsolete unit.

Financial Management
Throughout fiscal year 1988, the Commission continued to modernize its
automated financial systems. The Commission installed a new U.S. Treasuryapproved accounting system, the Federal Financial System (FFS). FFS
provides all accounting and financial reporting operations, and will permit the
104

SEC to decentralize the input of financial data by providing organizations with
on-line access. The Commission continued to expand its use of microcomputers in the preparation of financial reports required by Congress, the Office
of Management and Budget, and other executive oversight agencies.
The Commission also continued to enhance its internal financial operating
procedures. The processing of employee travel claims was improved, thereby
allowing the Commission to achieve a 16.5 percent reduction in its value of
outstanding employee travel advances. The use of electronic funds transfer
was expanded to pay two-thirds of all Commission employees, which greatly
reduced "float" time and increased the amount of funds in U.S. Treasury
interest-bearing accounts.
During fiscal year 1988, Commissioners participated in 59 meetings and
conferences. To pay the cost of attendance, private entities reimbursed the
Commission $41,991 while the government's portion amounted to $3,007.
The Commission was reimbursed $117,953 for staff participation in 320
meetings and conferences, while the government's portion of these costs
totaled $20,841.
Information Systems Management
During fiscal year 1988, the Office of Information Systems Management
(ISM) made great strides towards modernizing the Commission's computer
equipment and systems. First, replacement of the agency's outdated central
processing unit was accomplished, responding to concerns expressed by
Congress. Second, the Commission dramatically expanded its inventory of
microcomputers, integrating more efficient computer applications into pro.
gram activities. The Commission acquired over 600 desktop and laptop
microcomputers. This equipment was systematically distributed to regional
and headquarters offices, thereby enhancing staff activities in all program
areas. Third, ISM upgraded communications capability of regional offices to
headquarter's mainframe systems, and improved administrative systems.
To ensure efficient use of the new computer equipment, ISM provided
enhanced user services and specialized programming assistance. ISM established a new training center and extended existing services offered by the User
Support Information Center to encompass technical reference, user assistance, and traditional and self-paced instruction. A comprehensive training
course was conducted for regional and headquarters staff assigned laptop
computers for use in examination and investigatory programs.
In addition to general user support, ISM developed microcomputer applications capable of storing, retrieving, and analyzing large amounts of data for
use in major enforcement actions. ISM also provided specialized computer
services to Commission staff to support the market break study and increased
staff access to external market databases.
Personnel Management
During fiscal year 1988, the Office of Personnel revised regulations on
within-grade increases and quality step increases by linking pay raises more
105

closely with job performance, implemented new regulations that facilitate
more timely resolution of employee grievances, and amended merit promotion announcement procedures to reduce lapse time in filling vacancies.
The personnel office responded to the Commission's automation initiatives
with a priority computer training program. In fiscal year 1988, approximately
1,200 employees received training on computer systems or applications.
The Office of Personnel responded to increased emphasis on employee
benefits and quality of worklife by creating a unit specializing in health
benefits, retirement plans, injury compensation, and employee development.
Additionally, the Commission developed regulations pertaining to employee
drug testing, implemented smoking regulations, provided funds for shared
federal day-care facilities, enhanced employee counselling activities, and
instituted a program for leave sharing.
The Commission continued to be challenged in recruiting and retaining
qualified staff. To meet this challenge, the personnel office implemented a
continuing program for the recruitment of attorneys, accountants, securities
compliance examiners, computer programmers, and secretaries. The SEC
also successfully lobbied the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) for
additional direct hiring authority and promptly implemented OPM delegations of authority. Finally, the Commission persuaded OPM to revise the
qualification standards for securities compliance examiners in order to reach
a greater number of qualified individuals.
During fiscal year 1988, the Commission administered a balanced personnel management program through appropriate recognition of employee
performance. In fiscal year 1988, the SEC awarded more than $800,000 in
incentive and performance awards. During the same time, the Commission
brought disciplinary actions against 13 employees and allowed another 21
employees to resign in lieu of removal because of performance or conduct.
Commission Operations
For the sixth consecutive year, and the seventh time in its 54-year history, in
fiscal year 1988 the SEC collected revenue in excess of its appropriation. The
Congress appropriated $135,221,000 for the Commission in fiscal year 1988;
the Commission delivered to the U.S. Treasury $250 million in fee collections
and disgorgements. Fee revenue is collected from four basic sources: securities registrations under the Securities Act of 1933 (49 percent of the total fiscal
year 1988 fee revenue), transactions on securities exchanges (35 percent),
tender offer and merger filings (13 percent), and miscellaneous filings (3
percent).
Public Affairs
The Office of Public Affairs communicates information on Commission
activities to those interested in or affected by Commission actions, including
regulated entities, the press, employees of the Commission and the general
public. Both on-going activities and special projects are undertaken by the
office in support of the Commission's mission.
106

During fiscal year 1988, the October 1987 market break and its aftermath
and increasing internetionallzation of the securities markets created new and
intensive challenges for the office. Workload increased substantially, in almost
all areas. These increases seem likely to continue into the present and future
fiscal years.
All on-going programs of the office, designed to disseminate information to
those affected by or interested in the Commission's work, were carried out
during the year.
Public Affairs staff prepares the SEC News Digest every business day. The
Digest provides information on virtually all SEC actions-rule
changes,
enforcement actions against individuals or corporate entities, acquisition
reports, releases, decisions on requests for exemptions, upcoming Commission meetings, and other events of interest. Information on Commission
activity is also disseminated through notices of administrative actions,
litigation releases, and other materials. The News Digest is available in the
Public Reference Room.
Press releases issued prior to Commission meetings and press briefings
conducted after these meetings provide insight into proposed and adopted
changes in policies and regulation. The office also issues press releases on
upcoming events, on-going programs, and special projects. In all, 89 news
releases were issued during the year. Special projects such as studies and
reports on emerging issues in the financial markets are also publicized. Many
Commission actions are of nationwide, and increasingly, international interest. When appropriate, these actions are drawn to the attention of regional,
national and international press.
The office directs publication of the SEC Annual Report that provides
information on Commission activities to Congress, the securities bar and
other interested parties, and through the Depositary Library System, to
selected colleges and universities throughout the country.
Speeches presented by Commissioners and senior staff and testimony are
retained and disseminated in response to requests from the public. During the
year, the staff responded to approximately 72,000 requests for information
and coordinated programs for 275 foreign visitors. Also during the year, the
staff updated and revised such publications as the "SEC Publications Guide",
"SEC Concise Directory" and "Work of the SEC".
Public Affairs publishes a regular newsletter for employees, the Employee
News, and prepares a daily summary of news clips for Commission employees.

APPENDIX
THE SECURITIES

INDUSTRY

Revenues, Expenses, and Selected
Balance Sheet Items
Broker-dealers that are registered
with the Commission produced revenues of $66.3 billion in calendar year
1987, three percent above the 1986
level. While brokerage
revenues
increased markedly from earlier years,
the October stock market decline
adversely impacted the dealer side of
the business.
Pushed by record volume, revenues
from securities brokerage increased by
$2.6 billion (12 percent) in 1987. The
brokerage side accounted for 36 percent of total revenues in 1987, compared to 33 percent in 1986. The
increase in securities commissions of
$2.6 billion (18 percent) accounted for
the majority of this growth. Margin
interest also rose by $500 million, while
revenues from mutual fund sales
declined by an equivalent amount.
As broker-dealers maintain substantial positions in equity securities, the
October 1987 market decline resulted
in significant dealer losses. Revenues

130

from trading and investment fell $3.7
billion (20 percent) in 1987 while profits from underwriting declined by $1.0
billion (15 percent).
"All other revenues," which are dominated by interest income from securities purchased under agreements to
resell and fees from handling private
placements, mergers, and acquisitions
rose $4.1 billion (23 percent) in 1987.
These revenues accounted for 33 percent of total revenues in 1987, compared to 28 percent in 1986.
The strong growth in stock market
trading volume in the first 9 months of
1987 resulted in an increase in
expenses of 13 percent to $63.2 billion.
Combined with the dealer-related drag
on revenues, pre-tax income fell 62
percent to $3.1 billion. The pre-tax
return on equity in 1987 was 9 percent,
compared to 27 percent in 1986.
Assets fell by eight percent to $479.2
billion at year-end 1987, with liabilities
declining 9 percent to $445.2 billion.
Ownership equity increased $4.9 billion during 1987 to $46.9 billion.

Securities Industry Dollar In
1987 For Carrying and
Clearing Firms
Data for carrying and clearing firms
which do a public business are presented here to allow for more detail as
reporting requirements for firms which
neither carry nor clear differ and data
aggregation of these two types of firms
necessarily results in loss of detail. Carrying and clearing firms are those firms
which clear securities transactions or
maintain possession or control of customers' cash or securities. This group
produced 84 percent of the securities
industry's total revenues in calendar
year 1987.
Brokerage activity accounted for
about 34 cents of each revenue dollar in
1987, an increase from 31 cents in
1986. Securities commissions were the
most important component, producing
23 cents of each dollar of revenue,
while margin interest and revenues
from mutual fund sales generated six
cents and five cents, respectively.
The dealer side produced 60 cents of
each dollar of revenue. Twenty-one of
these cents came from trading and
investments,
10 cents from underwriting, and 30 cents from other
securities-related revenues. The latter
is comprised primarily of interest
income from securities
purchased
under agreements to resell and fees

134

from handling private placements,
mergers and acquisitions.
Total expenses consumed 98 cents of
each revenue dollar, compared to 89
cents in 1986. The result was a pre-tax
profit margin of 2 cents per revenue
dollar, compared to 11 cents in 1986.
Employee-related expenses (registered representatives'
compensation
and clerical and administrative employees' expenses) are the largest component of expenses. Employee-related
expenses consumed 38 cents of the
revenue dollar in 1987, a slight
increase from 1986. As a percent of
revenues, interest expense rose to 29
percent, from 25 percent in 1986.
Total assets of broker-dealers carrying and clearing customer accounts fell
by $42.3 billion to $452.6 billion at
year-end 1987. Long positions were the
most important factor, with the value of
inventory falling $47.7 billion to
$114.4 billion. Resale agreements was
one of the few asset categories to grow,
increasing 14 percent to $211.9 billion
at year-end 1987. Resale agreements
now comprise 47 percent of total
assets. Most of the remaining assets
represented receivables, either from
customers or other broker-dealers.
Total liabilities decreased $45.3 billion, or 10 percent to $424.6 billion.
Virtually all individual liability items
shared in this decline. Owners' equity
rose 12 percent, from $25.0 billion in
1986 to $28.0 billion in 1987.

Self-Regulatory Organizations:
Expenses, Pre-Tax Income and
Balance Sheet Structure
In 1987 the total revenues of selfregulatory organizations (SROs) with
marketplace jurisdiction rose approximately $118.4 million to $896.6 million, an increase of 15.2% over 1986
(the 1986 increase was 21 % over
1985). The New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE), National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD), American Stock
Exchange (Amex) and Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE) accounted
for 79.2% of all SRO total revenues, up
from 79.0% in 1986. The SROs' revenues are earned primarily from listing,
trading, and market data fees. The
NYSE reported total revenues of $349.4
million, of which 58.2% consisted of
listing and trading fees, while 15.7%
($55 million) consisted of market data
fees. The Amex reported total revenues
of $114.5 million, the NASD reported
$144.8 million and the CBOE reported
$101.7 million. The NYSE experienced
the largest magnitude increase in revenues ($53 million), while the Cincinnati
Stock Exchange (CSE) experienced the
largest percentage increase (46%) in
revenues.
The total expenses of all marketplace
SROs were $765.2 million in 1987, an
increase of $117.7 million (18%) over
1986. The NYSE incurred the largest
magnitude increase in expenses ($33.4
million), while the CSE experienced the
largest percentage increase in total
expenses (57%).
Aggregate total expenses increased
commensurately
with increases in
aggregate total revenues. Accordingly,
aggregate pre-tax income of these
SROs remained virtually unchanged in
1987 at about $125.2 million. The
NYSE experienced both the largest
magnitude increase in pre-tax income
($68.3 million) and the largest percentage increase (40%) from 1986. The
only other SRO that experienced a pre-

142

tax income gain from 1986 levels was
the CBOE, where pre-tax income
increased $.88 million, a 5% increase
from its 1986 level. The other marketplace SROs experienced a decline in
pre-tax income. The NASD's decrease
in pre-tax income of $7.69 million
(-29%) from its 1986 level was the
largest magnitude decrease in pre-tax
income experienced by any marketplace SRO, while the Pacific Stock
Exchange's (PSE's) 287% decrease
( - $3.60 million) in pre-tax income was
the largest percentage decrease in pretax income, with the PSE sustaining a
loss, before taxes, of about $2.35 million. Only one other exchange, the
CSE, experienced a loss. The Amex
experienced a pre-tax income decrease
of $4.01 million, or -20%, the Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx) a
decrease of $2.52 million, or - 57%,
and the Boston Stock Exchange a
decrease of $ 70 thousand or - 5 %.
The Midwest Stock Exchange experienced a decrease in pre-tax income of
$2.64 million, a decrease of 57% from
1986. Finally, at the CSE 1987 pre-tax
income decreased $128,0.00 (- 57%),
while at the Spokane Stock Exchange
1987 pre-tax income decreased $9,000
( -38%).
The total assets of all marketplace
SROs were $1,286 million in 1987, a
decrease of 17% from 1986. The largest amount of increase in total assets
was experienced at the NYSE, where
total assets increased $80.2 million
(23 %) from 1986 to 1987. The total
assets of the NASD and the CSE also
increased significantly, while the Phlx
and the PSE experienced significant
asset decreases from 1986 levels.
The aggregate net worth of the marketplace SROs rose to $546.4 million in
1987 from $474.7 million in 1986, an
increase of 15%. The NASD and the
PSE both experienced declines in their
net worth, while all other SROs experienced positive growth in their net
worth, with the CSE as the largest

percentage
gainer at 281 %. The
NYSE's net worth increased by 18%
from $184.8 million to $218.9 million.
Aggregate clearing agency service
revenue increased by 24 percent, or
$68 million, in 1987 due to increases in
securities trading volume and additional use of depository services. Total
depository service revenue increased
$44 million primarily due to a $39
million gain by the Depository Trust
Company (DTC), a $5 million gain by
the Midwest Securities Trust Company
(MSTC) and a $5 million increase at the
MBS Clearing Corporation (MBSCC), a
new registrant organized to service the
mortgage-backed
securities industry.
Service revenue of clearing corporations increased almost $24 million,
largely because of increases of $10
million at the National Securities Clearing Corporation (NSCC) and almost $8
million at the Options Clearing Corporation (OCC).
Total depository pre-tax income was
down $8.5 million. The main reason
was MBSCC's pre-tax loss of $7.5 million, owing to a reorganization of its
depository division and its contemplated conversion to a limited purpose
trust company. In addition, DTC earned
$2.5 million less than the previous year,
when it retained fees in order to
increase shareholders' equity. DTC, as
with all clearing agencies, adjusts
refunds of fees and its fee structure to
provide the amount of earnings which
it wishes to retain.
The
depositories
continued
to
expand their base for service revenues
by increasing the number of shares on
deposit and the face value of debt securities in custody. At the end of 1987,
the total value of securities in the
depository system reached $3 trillion,
of which DTC alone held over $1.8
trillion, not including some $1 trillion
in certificates held by transfer agents as
DTC's agent. This movement of certificates into depositories was due to further expansion of depository-eligible

issues and the desire of participants to
avail themselves of depository services.
The MSTC had 642.000 eligible issues
at year-end, up 19%. and DTC had
some 491,000. up 32%. The major
portion of the increase in securities
placed in depositories was in debt
issues, particularly municipal bonds,
which increased 33 %, to more than
two.thirds of the principal amount of all
municipal bonds currently outstanding
in the United States.
The clearing corporations recorded
an aggregate
increase in pre-tax
income of almost $1.5 million. NSCC
posted a pre-tax earnings decrease of
$3.3 million, OCC recorded an increase
of $2.3 million, and the newly registered
MBS Clearing
Corporation
(MBSCC) had a gain of $4 million in its
clearing division's pre-tax income.
In April 1987. the PSE announced
the closure of the clearance and depository functions not essential to PSE's
trading operations. As a result. $47
billion of securities were moved to
DTC's custody at midyear. NSCC now
processes almost all of PSE's clearing
volume. The Pacific Clearing Corporation (PCC) incurred a pre-tax loss of
$2.6 million after a loss of $344.000 in
1986. Half of the 1987 loss resulted
from costs of discontinued operations.
The Pacific Securities Depository Trust
Company (PSDTC) reported pre-tax
income of $517,000 versus a pre-tax
loss of $291.000 in 1986. The combined stockholders' equity of PCC and
PSDTC was $45,000 after PSE converted $2.4 million of PCC debt to PSE
into contributed capital. PSE members'
equity totaled $14.4 million at the end
of 1987.
The aggregate net worth of all clearing corporations and depositories rose
by $6.6 million to a new high of over
$45 million. In addition to the increase
in net worth. participant clearing fund
contributions increased by $123 million, or 16%. These funds provide protection to the clearing agencies in the

143

event of a participant default by means
of a pro-rata charge against the clearing fund. The OCC's fund absorbed a
loss of $6.8 million due to the default of
a clearing member resulting from the
extraordinary market events of October

144

1987. The default assessment was the
first ever against non-failing partlclpants' contributions. Despite this loss,
the OCC participants'
clearing fund
increased 39% to $292 million.

Exemptions
Section 12(h) Exemptions
Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act
authorizes the Commission to grant a
complete or partial exemption from the
registration provisions of Section 12(g)
or from other disclosure or insider trading provisions of the Act where such
exemption is consistent with the public
interest and the protection of investors.
For the year beginning October I,
1987 one application was pending and
an additional twenty four applications
were filed during the year. One of these
applications was granted. Twenty four
applications were pending at the end of
the year.
Exemptions For Foreign Private
Issuers
Rule
12g3-2
provides
various
exemptions from the registration provisions of Section
12(g) of the
Exchange Act for the securities of foreign private issuers. Perhaps the most
important of these is that contained in
subparagraph (b) which provides an
exemption for certain foreign issuers

148

which submit, on a current basis, the
material specified in the rule. Such
material includes that information
about which investors ought reasonably to be informed and which the
issuer: (1) has made public pursuant to
the law of the country in which it is
incorporated or organized; (2) has filed
with a foreign stock exchange on which
its securities are traded and which was
made public by such exchange; and (3)
has distributed to its security holders.
Periodically, the Commission publishes
a list of those foreign issuers which
appear to be current under the exemptive provision. The most current list is
as of July 13, 1988, and contains a total
of 1,040 foreign issuers.

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS
There were 3,497 companies registered under the Investment Company

CERTIFICATE
IMMOBILIZATION
Book-entry deliveries continued to
outpace physical deliveries in the settlement of securities transactions among
depository participants. This tendency is
illustrated in Table 24, IMMOBIUZATION
TRENDS. The Table captures the relative
significance of the mediums employed,
in a ratio of book-entry deliveries to
certificates withdrawn from DTC. The
figures exclude municipal bearer bonds.
In 1987, while the number of shares
traded in U.S. markets increased by
32 %, the total certificates withdrawn
from DTC increased less than 10%, and

160

the ratio of book-entry deliveries to certificates withdrawn continued to grow. In
1987, the ratio was over two and a half
times the 1982 figure of 3.0 book-entry
deliveries rendered for f!Nery certificate
withdrawn.

Foreign Restricted List
The Securities and Exchange Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign Restricted List which is designed to
put broker-dealers, financial institutions,
investors and others on notice of possible
unlawful distributions of foreign securities in the United States, The list consists
of names of foreign companies whose
securities the Commission has reason to
believe have been, or are being offered
for public sale in the United States in
possible violation of the registration
requirement of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. The offer and sale of
unregistered securities deprives investors of all the protections afforded by the
Securities Act of 1933, including the
right to receive a prospectus containing
the information required by the Act for
the purpose of enabling the investor to
determine whether the investment is
suitable. While most broker-dealers
refuse to effect transactions in securities
issued by companies on the Foreign
Restricted List, this does not necessarily
prevent promotors from illegally offering
such securities directly to investors in the
United States by mail, by telephone, and
sometimes by personal solicitation. The
following foreign corporations and other
foreign entities comprise the Foreign
Restricted List.

Right to Financial Privacy
Section 21(h) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C.
78u(hX6») requires that the Commission "compile an annual tabulation of
the occasions on which the Commission used each separate subparagraph
or clause of [Section 21(hX21») or the
provisions of the Right to Financial
Privacy Act of 1978 [12 U.S.c. 3401-22
(the RFPA»)to obtain access to financial
records of a customer and include it in
its annual report to the Congress." During the fiscal year. the Commission
made no applications to courts for
orders pursuant to the subparagraphs
and clauses of Section 21(hX2) to
obtain access to financial records of a

customer. The table below sets forth
the number of occasions upon which
