In the Matter of
JEFFRY C. EISNAUGLE

ORDER DENYING REQUEST TO VACATE BARS
Jeffry C. Eisnaugle seeks to vacate an administrative order, dated December 27, 2012
(the "Order"), to the extent that it bars him from association with any nationally recognized
statistical rating organization ("NRSRO") or municipal advisor.1
The Order barred Eisnaugle from association with "any broker, dealer, investment
adviser, municipal securities dealer, or transfer agent" and "from serving or acting as an
employee, officer, director, member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or
principal underwriter for, a registered investment company or affiliated person. . . ." It did not,
however, bar him from association with an NRSRO or a municipal advisor. Accordingly, Jeffry
C. Eisnaugle's request to vacate NRSRO and municipal advisor bars is denied.
By the Commission.
