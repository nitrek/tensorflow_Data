Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activities; Re-Proposal of Regulation SBSR and
Certain Rules and Forms Relating to the Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers and
Major Security-Based Swap Participants
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rules; proposed interpretations.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC” or “Commission”) is
publishing for public comment proposed rules and interpretive guidance to address the
application of the provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (“Exchange
Act”), that were added by Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”), to cross-border security-based swap activities.
Our proposed rules and interpretive guidance address the application of Subtitle B of Title VII of
the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to each of the major registration categories covered by Title VII
relating to market intermediaries, participants, and infrastructures for security-based swaps, and
certain transaction-related requirements under Title VII in connection with reporting and
dissemination, clearing, and trade execution for security-based swaps. In this connection, we are
re-proposing Regulation SBSR and certain rules and forms relating to the registration of
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants. The proposal also
contains a proposed rule providing an exception from the aggregation requirement, in the context
of the security-based swap dealer definition, for affiliated groups with a registered security-based
swap dealer. Moreover, the proposal addresses the sharing of information and preservation of
confidentiality with respect to data collected and maintained by SDRs. In addition, the
Commission is proposing rules and interpretive guidance addressing the policy and procedural
framework under which the Commission would consider permitting compliance with comparable
regulatory requirements in a foreign jurisdiction to substitute for compliance with requirements
of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, relating to security-based swaps
(i.e., “substituted compliance”). Finally, the Commission is setting forth our view of the scope
of our authority, with respect to enforcement proceedings, under Section 929P of the DoddFrank Act.

Background

The global nature of the security-based swap market highlights the critical importance of
addressing the application of the Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act 1 (“Title VII”) to cross-border
activities. 2 The Commission has received numerous inquiries and comments from market
participants, foreign regulators, and other interested parties concerning how Title VII and the
Commission’s implementing regulations thereunder will apply to the cross-border activities of
U.S. and non-U.S. market participants. To respond to these inquiries and comments, the
Commission is providing our preliminary views on the application of Title VII to cross-border
security-based swap activities 3 and non-U.S. persons that act in capacities regulated under the
Dodd-Frank Act in the proposed rules and interpretations discussed below.
A. The Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act
The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, among other reasons, to promote the financial stability
of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system. 4 The
2008 financial crisis highlighted significant issues in the over-the-counter (“OTC”) derivatives
markets, which have experienced dramatic growth in recent years 5 and are capable of affecting
significant sectors of the U.S. economy. 6 Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act provides for a
comprehensive new regulatory framework for swaps and security-based swaps, including by: (i)
providing for the registration and comprehensive regulation of swap dealers, security-based swap
dealers, major swap participants, and major security-based swap participants; (ii) imposing
clearing and trade execution requirements on swaps and security-based swaps, subject to certain

Stat. 1376 (2010).

Unless otherwise indicated, references to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act in this release are to
Subtitle B of Title VII.

3

Generally, in this release, the application of Title VII to “cross-border activities” refers to the
application of Title VII to a security-based swap transaction involving (i) a U.S. person and a
non-U.S. person, (ii) two non-U.S. persons where one or both are located within the United
States, or (iii) two non-U.S. persons conducting a security-based swap transaction that otherwise
occurs in relevant part within the United States, including by negotiating the terms of the
security-based swap transaction within the United States or where performance of one or both
counterparties under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person.

The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted “[t]o promote the financial stability of the United States by
improving accountability and transparency in the financial system, to end ‘too big to fail’, to
protect the American taxpayer by ending bailouts, to protect consumers from abusive financial
services practices, and for other purposes.” Pub. L. No. 111-203, Preamble.

From their beginnings in the early 1980s, the notional value of these markets grew to
approximately $650 trillion globally by the end of 2011. See Bank for International Settlements,
Statistical release: OTC derivatives statistics at end-December 2011 (May 2012) at 1, available
at: http://www.bis.org/publ/otc_hy1205.pdf.

exceptions; (iii) creating recordkeeping and real-time reporting regimes and public
dissemination; and (iv) enhancing the rulemaking and enforcement authorities of the
Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”). 7
Specifically, the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the CFTC will regulate “swaps,” the
Commission will regulate “security-based swaps,” 8 and both the CFTC and the Commission

7

See Pub. L. 111-203 §§ 701-774.

8

The definition of “security” in both the Exchange Act and the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities
Act”), 15 U.S.C. 77a et seq., was amended by the Dodd-Frank Act to include security-based
swaps. Pub. L. 111-203, Section 761(a)(2) (inserting “security-based swap” after “security
future” in Section 3(a)(10) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10)) and Section 768(a)(1)
(inserting “security-based swap” after “security future” in Section 2(a)(1) of the Securities Act,
15 U.S.C. 77b(a)(1)). The revision of the Exchange Act’s definition of “security” raises, among
other things, issues related to the definition of “broker” in Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4), the definition of “dealer” in Section 3(a)(5) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(5), the exchange registration requirements in Sections 5 and 6 of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. 78e and 78f, respectively, and the requirement in Section 12 of the Exchange Act that
securities be registered before a transaction is effected on a national securities exchange. See 15
U.S.C. 78l(a). The Securities Act requires that any offer and sale of a security must either be
registered under the Securities Act (see Section 5 of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e) or made
pursuant to an exemption from registration (see, e.g., Sections 3 and 4 of the Securities Act, 15
U.S.C. 77c and 77d, respectively). In addition, the Securities Act requires that any offer to sell,
offer to buy or purchase or sell a security-based swap to any person who is not an eligible
contract participant (“ECP”) must be registered under the Securities Act. See Section 5(e) of the
Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. 77e(e). Because of the statutory language of Section 5(e), exemptions
from this requirement in Sections 3 and 4 of the Securities Act are not available. This release
does not address the requirements under Section 5 of the Securities Act.
The Commission adopted interim final rules that provide exemptions from certain provisions of
the Securities Act, the Exchange Act, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (“Trust Indenture
Act”), 15 U.S.C. 77aaa et seq., for those security-based swaps that prior to July 16, 2011 were
“security-based swap agreements” and are defined as “securities” under the Securities Act and the
Exchange Act as of July 16, 2011 due solely to the provisions of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.
See Exemptions for Security-Based Swaps, Securities Act Release No. 9231 (July 1, 2011), 76
FR 40605 (July 11, 2011); see also Extension of Exemptions for Security-Based Swaps,
Securities Act Release No. 9383 (Jan. 29, 2013), 78 FR 7654 (Feb. 4, 2013). The Commission
also issued temporary exemptions under the Exchange Act regarding certain issues raised by the
inclusion of security-based swaps in the definition of “security.” See Order Extending
Temporary Exemptions under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in Connection with the
Revision of the Definition of “Security” to Encompass Security-Based Swaps, and Request for
Comment, Exchange Act Release No. 68864 (Feb. 7, 2013), 78 FR 10218 (Feb. 13, 2013); see
also Order Granting Temporary Exemptions Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in
Connection With the Pending Revision of the Definition of “Security” To Encompass SecurityBased Swaps, and Request for Comment, Exchange Act Release No. 64795 (July 1, 2011) 76 FR
39927 (July 7, 2011).

(together, the “Commissions”) will regulate “mixed swaps.” 9 Title VII also amends the
Exchange Act to include many specific provisions governing security-based swaps that could
apply to cross-border security-based swap transactions and to non-U.S. persons who act in
capacities regulated under the Dodd-Frank Act. 10 These provisions primarily relate to
Commission oversight of security-based swap dealers, 11 major security-based swap
9

In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act adds to the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”) and Exchange
Act definitions of the terms “swap dealer,” “security-based swap dealer,” “major swap
participant,” and “major security-based swap participant,” and amends the CEA definition of the
term “eligible contract participant.” These terms are defined in Sections 721 and 761 of the
Dodd-Frank Act and, with respect to the term “eligible contract participant,” in Section 1a(18) of
the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 1a(18), as redesignated and amended by Section 721 of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Section 712(d)(1) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that the CFTC and the Commission, in
consultation with the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, shall jointly further
define the terms “swap,” “security-based swap,” “swap dealer,” “security-based swap dealer,”
“major swap participant,” “major security-based swap participant,” “eligible contract participant,”
and “security-based swap agreement.” Further, Section 721(c) of the Dodd-Frank Act requires
the CFTC to adopt a rule to further define the terms “swap,” “swap dealer,” “major swap
participant,” and “eligible contract participant,” and Section 761(b)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act
permits the Commission to adopt a rule to further define the terms “security-based swap,”
“security-based swap dealer,” “major security-based swap participant,” and “eligible contract
participant,” with regard to security-based swaps, for the purpose of including transactions and
entities that have been structured to evade Title VII or the amendments made by Title VII.
The Commission and the CFTC jointly adopted rules and interpretive guidance further defining
the terms “swap,” “security-based swap,” and “security-based swap agreement,” and regulations
regarding mixed swaps. See Further Definition of “Swap,” “Security-Based Swap,” and
“Security-Based Swap Agreement”; Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement
Recordkeeping, Exchange Act Release No. 67453 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR 48208 (Aug. 13, 2012)
(“Product Definitions Adopting Release”). The Commission and the CFTC also jointly adopted
rules further defining the terms “swap dealer,” “security-based swap dealer,” “major swap
participant,” “major security-based swap participant,” and “eligible contract participant.” See

The provisions of the Exchange Act relating to security-based swaps that were enacted by Title
VII also are referred to herein as “Title VII requirements” or “requirements in Title VII.”

See Section 764(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission, jointly with the CFTC, adopted
rules further defining the term “security-based swap dealer.” See Intermediary Definitions

security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap dealers pursuant to Section 15F(f) of
the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f), as added by Section 764(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act.
12

See Section 764(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission, jointly with the CFTC, adopted
rules further defining the term “major security-based swap participant.” See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30596. In a number of releases, the Commission also has
proposed rules regarding the registration and substantive requirements for major security-based
swap participants. See note 11, supra.

B. Overview of the Cross-Border Proposal
With limited exceptions, the Commission has not proposed specific provisions of rules or
forms or provided guidance regarding the application of Title VII to cross-border activities. 19
Rather than addressing these issues in a piecemeal fashion through the various substantive
rulemaking proposals implementing Title VII, the Commission instead is addressing the
application of Title VII to cross-border activities holistically in a single proposing release. 20
This approach provides market participants, foreign regulators, and other interested parties with
an opportunity to consider, as an integrated whole, the Commission’s proposed approach to the
application of Title VII to cross-border security-based swap activities and non-U.S. persons that
act in capacities regulated under the Dodd-Frank Act. 21
After providing an overview of the security-based swap market, the Commission’s
preliminary views on the scope of application of Title VII to cross-border security-based swap
activity, and the legal and policy principles guiding the Commission’s approach to the
application of Title VII to cross-border activities in Section II, we set forth our proposed
approach in the subsequent sections of the release.

The Commission has proposed a rule addressing the application of the security-based swap trade
reporting requirement to cross-border transactions and to non-U.S. persons. See Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75239-40, as discussed in Section VIII, infra. The
Commission also has proposed rules imposing special requirements on “nonresident securitybased swap dealers,” “nonresident major security-based swap participants,” “non-resident swap
data repositories,” and “non-resident SB SEFs.” See Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at
65799-801, as discussed in Section III.E, infra; SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77310, as
discussed in Section VI, infra; and SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 11000-3, as discussed in

Guidance”). In Section XIII.B below, we solicit general comment on the differences between our
proposed approach and the CFTC’s proposed approach.

20

In Sections III and IV, we propose rules and interpretive guidance regarding the
registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants, including the treatment of foreign branches of U.S. banks and the provision of
guarantees in the cross-border context. In connection with this, we are re-proposing the
following rules and forms: 17 CFR §§ 249.1600 (Form SBSE), 249.1600a (Form SBSE-A), and
249.1600b (Form SBSE-BD). 22
In Sections V - VII, we propose rules and interpretive guidance regarding the registration
of security-based swap clearing agencies, SDRs, and SB SEFs, as well as discuss generally under
what circumstances the Commission would consider granting exemptions from registration for
these infrastructures. To facilitate relevant authorities’ access to security-based swap data
collected and maintained by Commission-registered SDRs, the Commission also is proposing
interpretive guidance to specify how SDRs may comply with the notification requirement in the
Exchange Act and specifying how the Commission proposes to determine whether a relevant
authority is appropriate for purposes of receiving security-based swap data from an SDR. 23 In
addition, the Commission is proposing a tailored exemption from the indemnification
requirement in the Exchange Act. 24
In Sections VIII – X, we propose rules and interpretive guidance regarding the
application of Title VII to cross-border activities with respect to certain transactional
requirements in connection with reporting and dissemination, clearing, and trade execution for
security-based swaps. As discussed further below, these requirements apply to persons
independent of their registration status. In connection with this, we are re-proposing the
following rules: 17 CFR §§ 242.900 – 242.911 (Regulation SBSR). 25
In Section XI, we set forth a proposed policy and procedural framework under which we
would consider permitting compliance with comparable regulatory requirements in a foreign
jurisdiction to substitute for compliance with certain requirements of the Exchange Act, and the
rules and regulations thereunder, relating to security-based swaps (i.e., “substituted
compliance”). 26 Generally speaking, the Commission is proposing a policy and procedural
framework that would allow for the possibility of substituted compliance in recognition of the
potential, in a market as global as the security-based swap market, for market participants who
engage in cross-border security-based swap activity to be subject to conflicting or duplicative

compliance obligations. 27 In addition, the Commission is proposing a rule that would set forth
procedures for requesting a substituted compliance determination.
In Section XII, the Commission sets forth our view of the scope of our authority, with
respect to enforcement proceedings, under Section 929P of the Dodd-Frank Act. 28 Section XIII
sets forth a general request for comment, including request for comment on the consistency of
our proposed approach with the CFTC’s proposed approach to applying the provisions of the
CEA that were enacted by Title VII in the cross-border context.
Finally, in Section XIV, the Commission addresses the Paperwork Reduction Act, and
Section XV provides an economic analysis of the proposed approach, including a discussion of
the associated costs and benefits of the proposals discussed in Sections III - XI, as well as a
discussion of issues related to efficiency, competition, and capital formation.
Because this release is directly related to security-based swap data reporting and
dissemination, clearing, and trade execution, as well as the regulation of various persons required
to register as a result of amendments made to the Exchange Act by Title VII, we anticipate that
some of the rules, forms, and interpretive guidance proposed herein, and comments received
thereon, will be addressed in the adopting releases relating to the impacted substantive rules. In
some areas, we may decide to address comments received on the proposals contained in this
release by adopting rules in a separate rulemaking. 29

27

Separately, in Sections V - VII below, the Commission also discusses generally when we would
consider exempting non-resident security-based swap clearing agencies and SB SEFs that are
subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation in their home countries, and
certain SDRs that are non-U.S. persons, from certain obligations under the Exchange Act,
including the requirement to register.

28

The rules, forms, and interpretive guidance proposed herein and discussed in Sections II -XI
below relate solely to the applicability of the registration (and the attendant substantive
regulation) and reporting and dissemination, clearing, and trade execution requirements in Title
VII, and are not intended to limit or address the cross-border reach or extraterritorial application
of the antifraud or other provisions of the federal securities laws.

29

The Commission is not addressing in this release issues relating to compliance dates of final rules
adopted pursuant to amendments made to the Exchange Act by Title VII. Compliance issues,
including compliance dates, will be addressed in connection with the various Title VII final rules.

C. Consultation and Coordination
As discussed more fully below, a number of market participants, foreign regulators, and
other interested parties have already provided their views on the application of Title VII to crossborder activities through both written comment letters to the Commission and/or the CFTC and
meetings with Commissioners and Commission staff. 30 The Commission has taken the
commenters’ views expressed thus far into consideration in developing these proposed rules,
forms, and interpretive guidance. 31 In addition, in developing this proposal, the Commission
has, in compliance with Sections 712(a)(2) 32 and 752(a) 33 of the Dodd-Frank Act, consulted and
coordinated with the CFTC, the prudential regulators, 34 and foreign regulatory authorities.
Efforts to regulate the swaps market are underway not only in the United States but also
abroad. In 2009, leaders of the Group of 20 (“G20”)—whose membership includes the United
States, 18 other countries, and the European Union (“EU”)—called for global improvements in
the functioning, transparency, and regulatory oversight of OTC derivatives markets.
Specifically, the G20 leaders declared that:
[a]ll standardised OTC derivative contracts should be traded on exchanges or electronic
trading platforms, where appropriate, and cleared through central counterparties by end30

The views expressed in comment letters and meetings are collectively referred to as the views of
“commenters.” See Appendix D for a list of commenters referred to in this release and the
location of their comment letters on the Commission’s (or the CFTC’s) website.

31

In addition, the Commission and the CFTC held a joint public roundtable regarding the
application of Title VII to cross-border activities. See Joint Public Roundtable on International
Issues Relating to the Implementation of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and
Consumer Protection Act, Exchange Act Release No. 64939 (July 21, 2011), 76 FR 44507 (July
26, 2011).

32

Section 712(a)(2) of the Dodd-Frank Act states, in part, that “the Securities and Exchange
Commission shall consult and coordinate to the extent possible with the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission and the prudential regulators for the purposes of assuring regulatory
consistency and comparability, to the extent possible.”

33

Section 752(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act states, in part, that “[i]n order to promote effective and
consistent global regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the prudential regulators (as that
term is defined in Section 1a(39) of the Commodity Exchange Act), as appropriate, shall consult
and coordinate with foreign regulatory authorities on the establishment of consistent international
standards with respect to the regulation (including fees) of swaps.”

34

The term “prudential regulator” is defined in Section 1a(39) of the CEA, 7 U.S.C. 1a(39), and
that definition is incorporated by reference in Section 3(a)(74) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(74). Pursuant to the definition, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
(“Federal Reserve Board”), the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation, the Farm Credit Administration, or the Federal Housing Finance Agency
(collectively, the “prudential regulators”) is the “prudential regulator” of a security-based swap
dealer if the entity is directly supervised by that agency.

23

2012 at the latest. OTC derivative contracts should be reported to trade repositories.
Non-centrally cleared contracts should be subject to higher capital requirements. We ask
the [Financial Stability Board] and its relevant members to assess regularly
implementation and whether it is sufficient to improve transparency in the derivatives
markets, mitigate systemic risk and protect against market abuse. 35
In subsequent summits, the G20 leaders have reiterated their commitment to OTC derivatives
regulatory reform. 36 The Commission has participated in numerous bilateral and multilateral
discussions with foreign regulatory authorities addressing the regulation of OTC derivatives. 37
Through these discussions and our participation in various international task forces and working
groups, 38 we have gathered information about foreign regulatory reform efforts and have
discussed the possibility of conflicts and gaps, as well as inconsistencies and duplications,
between U.S. and foreign regulatory regimes. We have taken these discussions into
consideration in developing these proposed rules, forms, and interpretations.
In addition, the Commission and the CFTC have conducted staff studies to assess
developments in OTC derivatives regulation abroad. As directed by Congress in Section 719(c)

http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/international/g7g20/Documents/pittsburgh_summit_leaders_statement_250909.pdf.

36

For example, on June 18-19, 2012, the leaders of the G20 convened in Los Cabos, Mexico, and
reaffirmed their commitments with respect to the regulation of the OTC derivatives markets. See
the G20 Leaders Declaration (June 2012), para. 39, available at: http://www.g20.org/documents/.

37

Senior representatives of OTC derivatives market regulators from G20 jurisdictions have met on
a number of occasions to discuss international coordination of OTC derivatives regulations. See,
e.g., Joint Press Statement of Leaders on Operating Principles and Areas of Exploration in the
Regulation of the Cross-Border OTC Derivatives Market (Dec. 4, 2012), available at:
http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/2012-251.htm; Joint Statement on Regulation of OTC
Derivatives Markets (May 7, 2012), available at: http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2012/201285.htm; and Joint Statement on Regulation of OTC Derivatives Markets (Dec. 9, 2011), available
at: http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2011/2011-260.htm. See also Financial Stability Board
(“FSB”), OTC Derivatives Market Reforms, Fifth Progress Report on Implementation (April 15,
2013) (“FSB Progress Report April 2013”), at 47, available at:
http://www.financialstabilityboard.org/publications/r_130415.pdf (noting that SEC staff has
regularly consulted its counterparts in other jurisdictions to discuss and compare approaches to
the application of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act in cross-border contexts); FSB Progress
Report April 2013 at 5 and 45-46 (discussing meetings of the group of market regulators “to
identify and explore ways to address issues and uncertainties in the application of rules in a crossborder context, including options to address identified conflicts, inconsistencies, and
duplication.”).

38

The Commission participates in the FSB’s Working Group on OTC Derivatives Regulation
(“ODWG”), both on its own behalf and as the representative of the International Organization of
Securities Commissions (“IOSCO”), which is co-chair of the ODWG. The Commission also
serves as one of the co-chairs of the IOSCO Task Force on OTC Derivatives Regulation.

24

of the Dodd-Frank Act, on January 31, 2012, the Commission and the CFTC jointly submitted to
Congress a “Joint Report on International Swap Regulation” (“Swap Report”). 39 The Swap
Report discussed swap and security-based swap regulation and clearinghouse regulation in the
Americas, Asia, and the European Union, and identified similarities and differences in
jurisdictions’ approaches to areas of regulation, as well as other areas of regulation that could be
harmonized. The Swap Report also identified major clearinghouses, clearing members, and
regulators in each geographic area and described the major contracts (including clearing volumes
and notional values), methods for clearing swaps, and the systems used for setting margin in
each geographic area. 40
D. Substituted Compliance
As noted above, we recognize the potential, in a market as global as the security-based
swap market, that market participants who engage in cross-border security-based swap activity
may be subject to conflicting or duplicative compliance obligations. To address this possibility,
we are proposing a “substituted compliance” framework under which we would consider
permitting compliance with requirements in a foreign 41 regulatory system to substitute for
compliance with certain requirements of the Exchange Act relating to security-based swaps,
provided that the corresponding requirements in the foreign regulatory system are comparable to
the relevant provisions of the Exchange Act. 42 The availability of substituted compliance should
reduce the likelihood that market participants would be subject to potentially conflicting or
duplicative sets of rules.
As discussed more fully below, the Commission would perform comparability analysis
and make substituted compliance determinations with respect to four separate categories of
requirements. 43 If, for example, a foreign regulatory system achieves comparable regulatory
39

See CFTC and SEC, Joint Report on International Swap Regulation (Jan. 31, 2012), available at:
http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2012/sec-cftc-intlswapreg.pdf.

40

In addition, Commission and CFTC staff submitted a joint study to Congress on the feasibility of
requiring the derivatives industry to adopt standardized computer-readable algorithmic
descriptions which may be used to describe complex and standardized financial derivatives. See
Joint Study on the Feasibility of Mandating Algorithmic Descriptions for Derivatives: A Study
by the Staff of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Commodity Futures Trading
Commission as Required by Section 719(c) of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer
Protection Act (Apr. 7, 2011), available at: http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2011/719bstudy.pdf. In preparing this report, Commission and CFTC staff coordinated extensively with
international financial institutions and foreign regulators.

41

In this release, the term “foreign” is used interchangeably with the term “non-U.S.” See, e.g.,
note 372, infra (discussing the definition of “foreign security-based swap dealer”).

42

See Section XI, infra.

43

Specifically, the Commission is proposing to make substituted compliance determinations with
respect to the following categories of requirements: (i) requirements applicable to registered
security-based swap dealers in Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations
thereunder; (ii) requirements relating to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-

25

outcomes in three out of the four categories, then the Commission would permit substituted
compliance with respect to those three categories of comparable requirements, but not for the
one, non-comparable category for which comparable regulatory outcomes are not achieved. In
other words, we are not proposing an “all-or-nothing” approach. In addition, in making
comparability determinations within each category of requirements, the Commission is
proposing to take a holistic approach; that is, we would ultimately focus on regulatory outcomes
rather than a rule-by-rule comparison. Substituted compliance therefore should accept
differences between regulatory regimes when those differences nevertheless accomplish
comparable regulatory outcomes.
E. Conclusion
In proposing these rules, forms, and interpretations, the Commission is mindful that the
security-based swap market is global in nature and developed prior to the enactment of the
Dodd-Frank Act. 44 There are challenges involved in imposing a comprehensive regulatory
regime on existing markets, particularly ones that have not been subject to the particular
regulation that the Dodd-Frank Act provides. Any rules and interpretive guidance we adopt
governing the application of Title VII to cross-border activities could significantly affect the
global security-based swap market. As discussed further below, to the extent practicable and
consistent with our statutory mandate, 45 the Commission has proposed these rules and
interpretations with the intent to achieve the regulatory benefits intended by the Dodd-Frank Act
and to facilitate a well-functioning global security-based swap market, including by taking into
account the impact these proposed rules and interpretations will have on counterparty protection,
transparency, systemic risk, liquidity, efficiency, and competition in the market. In addition, the
Commission is mindful of the fact that the application of Title VII to cross-border activities
raises issues of potential conflict or overlap with foreign regulatory regimes. Furthermore, the
Commission is attentive to the fact that a number of registrants may be registered with both us
and the CFTC. 46
The rules and interpretations proposed today represent the Commission’s preliminary
views regarding the application of Title VII to cross-border security-based swap activities and to
non-U.S. persons who act in capacities regulated under the Dodd-Frank Act. We note that these
proposed rules and interpretations are tailored to the unique circumstances of the security-based
swap market, and as such would not necessarily be appropriate to apply to the Commission’s
regulation of traditional securities markets. We also recognize that there are a number of
possible alternative approaches to applying Title VII in the cross-border context. Accordingly,
based swaps; (iii) requirements relating to clearing for security-based swaps; and (iv)
requirements relating to trade execution for security-based swaps. See Section XI, infra.

26

the Commission invites public comment regarding all aspects of the proposed approach,
including each proposed rule and interpretation contained herein, and potential alternative
approaches. In particular, data and comment from market participants and other interested
parties with respect to the likely effect of each proposed rule and interpretation regarding
application of a specific Title VII requirement, and the effect of such proposed application in the
aggregate, will be particularly useful to the Commission in evaluating possible modifications to
the proposal and understanding the consequences of the substantive rules that have not yet been
adopted under Title VII.

II.

Overview of the Security-Based Swap Market and the Legal and Policy Principles
Guiding the Commission’s Approach to the Application of Title VII to CrossBorder Activities

In this section, the Commission provides a general overview of the security-based swap
market that informs our proposed implementation of Title VII, including a description of the
various dealing structures used by U.S.-based and foreign-based entities to conduct their
security-based swap businesses, and existing clearing, reporting, and trade execution practices.
We also discuss the Commission’s preliminary views on the scope of application of Title VII and
the principles guiding our proposed approach to applying Title VII in the cross-border context.
A. Overview of the Security-Based Swap Market
1. Global Nature of the Security-Based Swap Market
The security-based swap market is a global market. 47 Security-based swap business
currently takes place across national borders, with agreements negotiated and executed between
counterparties often in different jurisdictions (and at times booked and risk-managed in still other
jurisdictions). 48
The global nature of the security-based swap market is evidenced by the data available to
the Commission. 49 Based on market data in the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation’s
Trade Information Warehouse (“DTCC-TIW”), 50 viewed from the perspective of the domiciles
of the counterparties booking credit default swap (“CDS”) transactions, approximately 49% of
U.S. single-name CDS transactions in 2011 were cross-border transactions between a U.S.domiciled 51 counterparty and a foreign-domiciled counterparty 52 and an additional 44% of such

47

See, e.g., IIB Letter at 1 (noting the “truly global nature of the OTC derivatives market”); Cleary
Letter IV at 2 (noting that swaps and security-based swaps trade in a “unique global market”);
Société Générale Letter II at 2 (noting the “global nature of the derivatives business”); see also
Bank of International Settlements (“BIS”), Committee on the Global Financial System, No. 46,
The macro financial implications of alternative configurations for access to central counterparties
in OTC derivatives markets (Nov. 2011) at 1, available at: http://www.bis.org/publ/cgfs46.pdf
(referring to the “globalized nature of the market, in which a significant proportion of OTC
derivatives trading is undertaken across borders”).

48

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter I at 2.

49

See Section XV.B, infra (discussing in detail the global nature of the security-based swap
market).

50

The information was made available to the Commission in accordance with the agreement
between DTCC-TIW and the OTC Derivatives Regulatory Forum (“ODRF”).

51

The domicile classifications in DTCC-TIW are based on the market participants’ own reporting
and may not have been verified. Prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, funds and accounts
did not formally report their domicile to DTCC-TIW because there was no systematic
requirement to do so. After enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the DTCC-TIW has collected the

28

CDS transactions were between two foreign-domiciled counterparties. 53 Thus, approximately
7% of the U.S. single-name CDS transactions in 2011 were between two U.S.-domiciled
counterparties. 54 These statistics indicate that cross-border transactions are the norm, not the
exception, in the security-based swap market. 55 Accordingly, the question of how the
Commission is implementing Title VII with respect to security-based swaps will, to a large
extent, be affected by how the Commission applies Title VII to the cross-border transactions that
are the majority of security-based swaps.
2. Dealing Structures
Dealers use a variety of business models and legal structures to conduct security-based
swap dealing business 56 with counterparties in jurisdictions all around the world. 57 Commenters
have indicated that both U.S.-based and foreign-based entities use certain dealing structures for a
variety of legal, tax, strategic, and business reasons that often pre-date the enactment of the
Dodd-Frank Act. 58 Among the reasons cited for the variety of dealing structures is the desire of

registered office location of the account or fund. This information is self-reported on a voluntary
basis. It is possible that some market participants may misclassify their domicile status because
the databases in DTCC-TIW do not assign a unique legal entity identifier to each separate entity.
Notwithstanding this limitation, we believe that the cross-border and foreign activity presented in
the analysis by the Commission’s Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation
demonstrates the nature of the CDS market. See Section XV.B.2.c, infra.
52

DTCC-TIW classified a foreign branch or foreign subsidiary of a U.S. domiciled entity as
foreign-domiciled. Therefore, CDS transactions with a foreign-domiciled counterparty include
CDS transactions with a foreign branch or foreign subsidiary of a U.S.-domiciled entity as
counterparty.

53

Put another way, in 2011, a vast majority (approximately 93%) of U.S. single-name CDS
transactions directly involved at least one foreign-domiciled counterparty. This observation is
based on the data compiled by the Commission’s Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial
Innovation on single-name CDS transactions with U.S. reference entities from the DTCC-TIW
between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2011. See Section XV.B.2.d, infra.

54

Id.

55

We note, however, that, in addition to classifying transactions between a U.S. counterparty and a
foreign branch of a U.S. bank as a cross-border transaction (see note 51, supra), these statistics
characterize as cross-border transactions those in which all or substantially all of the activity takes
place in the United States and all or much of the risk of the transactions ultimately is borne by
U.S. persons.

56

As used in this release, “security-based swap dealing,” “security-based swap dealing activity,”
“dealing activity,” and related concepts have the meaning described in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 30596, unless otherwise indicated in this release.

29

counterparties to reduce risk and enhance credit protection based on the particular characteristics
of each entity’s business. 59
In this subsection, we describe certain dealing structures that U.S.-based entities and
foreign-based entities in the security-based swap market might use. In each of these dealing
structures, because the booking entity is the counterparty to the security-based swap transaction
resulting from the dealing activity (i.e., the principal) and bears the ongoing risk of performance
on the transaction, we view the booking entity, and not the intermediary that acts as an agent on
behalf of the booking entity to originate the transaction, as the dealing entity. 60
(a) U.S. Bank Dealer
A U.S. bank holding company may use a U.S. subsidiary that is a banking entity to deal
directly with U.S. and foreign counterparties. Such U.S. bank dealer may use a sales force in its
U.S. home office to originate security-based swap transactions in the United States and use
separate sales force in foreign branches to originate security-based swap transactions with
counterparties in foreign local markets. 61 The resulting security-based swap transactions may be
booked in the home office of the U.S. bank or in a foreign branch of the bank. 62
(b) U.S. Non-bank Dealer
A U.S.-based holding company may use a non-bank subsidiary to conduct security-based
swap dealing activity in the U.S. market and foreign local markets. The U.S. non-bank dealer
may act as principal to originate and book transactions in the United States and use a sales force
in the foreign local markets (e.g., salespersons employed by its foreign affiliate) as agent to
originate transactions on its behalf, and then centrally book the resulting transactions in the U.S.
non-bank dealer. In some situations, such as where the holding company has rated debt, but the
U.S. non-bank dealer does not, the U.S. non-bank dealer’s performance under security-based
swaps may be supported by a parental guarantee provided by the holding company. 63 The
guarantee would typically give counterparties to the U.S. non-bank dealer direct recourse to the

59

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter at 2.

60

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30617 n.264 (“A sales force, however,
is not a prerequisite to a person being a security-based swap dealer. For example, a person that
enters into security-based swaps in a dealing capacity can fall within the dealer definition even if
it uses an affiliated entity to market and/or negotiate those security-based swaps (e.g., the person
is a booking entity).”). See also Section III.D, infra.

holding company for obligations owed by such non-bank dealer under the security-based swaps
as though the guarantor had entered into the transactions directly with the counterparties. 64
(c) Foreign Subsidiary Guaranteed by a U.S. Person
A U.S.-based holding company also may conduct dealing activity in both U.S. markets
and foreign markets out of a foreign subsidiary. 65 The foreign subsidiary may use a sales force
in the United States (e.g., salespersons employed by its U.S. affiliate) to originate security-based
swap transactions with counterparties in the U.S. markets, or may directly solicit, negotiate, and
execute security-based swap transactions with counterparties in the U.S. markets from outside
the United States, and centrally book the resulting transactions itself. The foreign subsidiary also
may conduct security-based swap dealing activity in various foreign markets using local
salespersons as agent to originate and centrally book the resulting security-based swap
transactions itself. In some situations, such as where the U.S.-based holding company has rated
debt, but the foreign subsidiary does not, the foreign subsidiary’s performance under securitybased swaps may be supported by a parental guarantee provided by the holding company. 66
Such guarantee would typically give its counterparty direct recourse to the U.S. parent acting as
guarantor for obligations owed by such foreign subsidiary under the security-based swaps. As a
result, a guarantee provided by a U.S. person of another person’s obligations owed under a
security-based swap transaction poses the same degree of risk to the United States as the risk
posed by a transaction entered into directly by such U.S. person.
In circumstances where a foreign non-bank subsidiary of a U.S. holding company has
sufficient credit-worthiness and does not rely on a U.S. parental guarantee to support its
creditworthiness, the risk of the security-based swaps entered into by the foreign subsidiary of a
U.S.-based holding company resides in the foreign subsidiary outside the United States.
(d) Foreign-Based Dealer
i.

Direct Dealing

Foreign-based entities also may use a number of business models and legal structures to
conduct global security-based swap dealing activity in both the U.S. and foreign markets. Like
U.S. dealers, foreign dealers may deal directly with U.S. counterparties and non-U.S.

counterparties without using any agents in the local market to intermediate and book the
resulting transactions in the foreign entities themselves. 67
ii.

Intermediation in the United States

Foreign dealers also may use local personnel with knowledge of and expertise on the
local markets to intermediate security-based swap transactions in each local market, for instance,
using salespersons in the United States to originate security-based swaps in the U.S. market, and
either book the resulting transactions in an entity based in the United States (such as a U.S.
affiliate) or centrally book the resulting transactions in a foreign central booking affiliate. 68
Intermediation activity within the United States on behalf of foreign entities may occur in
two principal legal structures.
First, foreign dealers that are banking entities may conduct dealing activity with U.S.
counterparties out of their U.S. branches. In this structure, a foreign banking entity may
originate and book transactions in its U.S. branch, or the U.S. branch may originate transactions
that are booked in the foreign home office. 69
Second, both bank and non-bank foreign dealers may conduct dealing activity out of their
U.S. subsidiaries. The U.S. subsidiaries may act as principal to originate and book securitybased swaps in the United States and enter into inter-affiliate back-to-back transactions with the
foreign central booking entity (usually the foreign parent) for purposes of centralized booking
and centralized risk management. 70 The U.S. subsidiary also may act as agent to originate
security-based swaps in the United States on behalf of the foreign entity and the resulting
transactions would be booked in a centralized foreign booking entity, usually the foreign parent.
In some situations, such as where the foreign-based entity has rated debt, but the U.S. subsidiary
does not, the U.S.-based subsidiary’s performance under security-based swaps that it enters into
as principal may be supported by a parental guarantee provided by the foreign-based entity. 71
The transactions originated by the U.S. branch of a foreign bank or a U.S. subsidiary of a
foreign bank or non-bank entity may not be limited to those with U.S. counterparties in the U.S.
security-based swap market. Foreign bank or non-bank entities may utilize their U.S. branches
or U.S. subsidiaries to conduct dealing activity with, for instance, non-U.S. counterparties
located in various jurisdictions within the same region or same time zones, such as Canada or

subsidiary acting as agent but books the transaction itself outside the United States.
3. Clearing Practices
Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, there was no provision in the Exchange
Act or any other laws in the United States for the mandatory clearing of OTC derivatives.
Although initiatives related to central clearing had been considered before 2008, the 2008
financial crisis brought a new focus on CDS as a source of systemic risk and contributed to a
more general recognition that central clearing parties (“CCPs”) could play a role in helping to
manage bilateral counterparty credit risk in OTC CDS. 72
In November 2008, the Commission, in consultation and coordination with the Federal
Reserve Board and the CFTC, took steps to help facilitate the prompt development of CCPs for
OTC derivatives. 73 Specifically, the Commission authorized the clearing of OTC security-based
swaps by permitting certain clearing agencies to clear CDS on a temporary conditional basis. 74
As the Commission and other regulatory agencies monitored the activities of those clearing
agencies, a significant volume of interdealer OTC CDS transactions and a smaller volume of
72

The President’s Working Group on Financial Markets made the central clearing of OTC
derivatives a top policy objective in 2008. See Policy Objectives for the OTC Derivatives Market
(Nov. 14, 2008), available at: http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/finmkts/Documents/policyobjectives.pdf; see also Policy Statement on Financial Market
Developments (Mar. 13, 2008), available at: http://www.law.du.edu/images/uploads/presidentsworking-group.pdf; and Progress Update on March Policy Statement on Financial Market
Developments (Oct. 2008), available at: http://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/finmkts/Documents/q4progress%20update.pdf.

73

On November 14, 2008, the Commission executed a Memorandum of Understanding with the
Board and the CFTC that established a framework for consultation and information sharing on
issues related to central counterparties for the OTC derivatives market. See
http://www.sec.gov/news/press/2008/2008-269.htm.

74

The Commission authorized five entities to clear CDS. See CDS clearing by ICE Clear Europe

dealer-to-non-dealer OTC CDS transactions were centrally cleared on a voluntary basis. 75 The
level of voluntary clearing in swaps and security-based swaps has steadily increased since that
time. Although the volume of interdealer CDS cleared to date is quite large, 76 many securitybased swap transactions are still ineligible for central clearing, and many transactions in securitybased swaps eligible for clearing at a CCP continue to settle bilaterally.
Voluntary clearing of security-based swaps in the United States is currently limited to
CDS products. Central clearing of security-based swaps began in March 2009 for index CDS
products, in December 2009 for single-name corporate CDS products, and in November 2011 for
single-name sovereign CDS products. At present, there is no central clearing in the United
States for security-based swaps that are not CDS products, such as those based on equity
securities. The level of clearing activity appears to have steadily increased as more CDS have
become eligible to be cleared. 77
4. Reporting Practices
The OTC derivatives markets have historically been largely opaque. 78 With respect to
CDS, for example, the Government Accountability Office found in 2009 that “comprehensive
and consistent data on the overall market have not been readily available,” that “authoritative
information about the actual size of the CDS market is generally not available,” and that
regulators currently are unable “to monitor activities across the market.” 79 The reporting of
75

76

Voluntary CCP clearing grew out of a series of meetings beginning in September 2005 hosted by
the Federal Reserve Bank of New York with major market participants and their domestic and
international supervisors for the purpose of discussing problems in the processing of CDS, and
related risk management and control issues. See
http://www.ny.frb.org/newsevents/news/markets/2005/an050915.html. In June 2008 the
attendees agreed to an agenda for improvement in the derivatives market infrastructure that
included “developing a central counterparty for credit default swaps that, with a robust risk
management regime, can help reduce systemic risk.” See
http://www.ny.frb.org/newsevents/news/markets/2008/ma080609.html; see also
https://www.theice.com/marketdata/reports/ReportCenter.shtml.
As of April 19, 2012, ICE Clear Credit had cleared approximately $15.6 trillion notional amount
of CDS contracts based on indices of securities and approximately $1.5 trillion notional amount
of CDS contracts based on individual reference entities or securities. As of April 19, 2012, ICE
Clear Europe had cleared approximately €7.2 trillion notional amount of CDS contracts based on
indices of securities and approximately €1.2 trillion notional amount of CDS contracts based on
individual reference entities or securities. See Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, 77

comprehensive OTC derivative transaction data to trade repositories is intended to address the
lack of transparency in this market, and as such it was one of the G20 regulatory reform
commitments previously discussed. 80
The first trade repositories were established in the mid-2000s. 81 The development of
trade repositories for different asset classes accelerated following the 2009 G20 commitment in
this area, and as legislative and regulatory requirements began to be put in place. As of the end
of the first quarter of 2013, fourteen FSB member jurisdictions had legislation in place either
requiring reporting of OTC derivatives contracts or authorizing regulators to implement such
regulations. 82 In addition, as of the date of publication of the FSB Progress Report April 2013,
eighteen trade repositories were either registered or in the process of becoming registered and
twelve were operational, meaning, typically, that they were at least accepting transaction reports
from more than one asset class. 83
Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, global trade repositories had been established for credit,
interest rate, and equity derivatives. 84 In addition, in June 2010, the OTC Derivatives

See note 35 and accompanying text, supra. See also SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307
(“Under the Dodd-Frank Act, SDRs are intended to play a key role in enhancing transparency in
the [security-based swap] market by retaining complete records of [security-based swap]
transactions, maintaining the integrity of those records, and providing effective access to those
records to relevant authorities and the public in line with their respective information needs. The
enhanced transparency provided by an SDR is important to help regulators and others monitor the
build-up and concentration of risk exposures in the [security-based swap] market. Without an
SDR, data on [security-based swap] transactions is dispersed and not readily available to
regulators and others.”).

Id. at 20-21, 63-65. Ten trade repositories were offering trade reporting on interest rate
derivatives transactions; eight were offering trade reporting on commodity derivative
transactions; seven were offering trade reporting on equity derivatives transactions; eight were
offering trade reporting on foreign exchange derivative transactions; and seven were offering
trade reporting on credit derivatives.

84

Pursuant to initiatives led by the OTC Derivatives Supervisors Group (“ODSG”), in 2009 the
largest OTC derivatives dealers at the global level committed to reporting all of their CDS trades
to a trade repository. At that time, a trade repository for credit derivatives was already in
existence and used by the industry. To promote the development of trade repositories for all
interest rate and equity derivatives, in 2008 and 2009 ISDA sought proposals for the creation of
central trade repositories for these asset classes. Two entities were selected to provide trade
repository functions for these asset classes. See FSB October 2010 Report at 44. The ODSG
originated in 2005, when the Federal Reserve Bank of New York (“New York Federal Reserve”)
hosted a meeting with representatives of major OTC derivatives market participants and their

35

Regulators’ Forum (“ODRF”) 85 developed indicative guidance for Warehouse Trust 86 aiming to
identify data that authorities would expect to request from Warehouse Trust to carry out their
mandates. 87
Public availability of trade repository data varies globally and has changed significantly
over time. For example, since October 2008, on a weekly basis, DTCC has published aggregated
data via its website. 88 More generally, in a recent FSB survey, all trade repositories that
responded stated that they provide or intend to provide, transaction data on OTC derivatives to
the public. In some cases and for some products, trading information is provided on a real-time
basis. Some trade repositories publicly disclose only aggregated, end-of-day information. 89
5. Trade Execution Practices
Unlike the markets for cash equity securities and listed options, the market for securitybased swaps currently is characterized generally by bilateral negotiation directly between two
counterparties in the OTC market and is largely decentralized; many instruments are individually
negotiated and often customized; and many security-based swaps are not centrally cleared. 90
The historical one-to-one nature of trade negotiation in security-based swaps has fostered various
types of trading venues and execution practices, ranging among the following:
domestic and international supervisors, including the Commission, in order to address the
emerging risks of inadequate infrastructure for the rapidly growing market in credit derivatives.
The ODSG is chaired by the New York Federal Reserve.
85

The ODRF, formed in January 2009, brings together representatives from central banks,
prudential supervisors, and securities and market regulators to discuss issues of common interest,
regarding OTC derivatives central counterparties and trade repositories. The ODRF’s scope and
focus include information sharing/needs and oversight co-ordination and co-operation.

86

The Warehouse Trust Company LLC (“Warehouse Trust”) today provides certain post-trade
processing services to DTCC-TIW. DTCC-TIW provides a centralized electronic trade database
for OTC credit derivatives contracts.

87

See FSB October 2010 Report at 63. Building on this work, CPSS and IOSCO have published a
consultation paper setting forth more comprehensive guidance regarding trade repositories more
broadly. The paper provides guidance to authorities that supervise trade repositories; regulators,
supervisors, resolution authorities, central banks, and other public-sector authorities (collectively,
“authorities”) that request OTC derivative data from trade repositories; and trade repositories.
This guidance concerns the types of data to which authorities will typically require access and
possible approaches to addressing potential constraints and concerns that may prevent effective
access to such data. See CPSS and IOSCO, Consultative Report on Authorities’ Access to Trade
Repository Data (April 2013), available at:

Bilateral negotiations
“Bilateral negotiation” refers to the execution practice whereby one party uses the
telephone, e-mail or other means of communication to directly contact a potential counterparty to
negotiate and execute a security-based swap. In bilateral negotiation and execution, only the two
parties to the transaction are aware of the terms of the negotiation and the final terms of the
agreement. 91
Single-dealer RFQ platforms
A single-dealer request for quote (“RFQ”) platform refers to an electronic trading
platform where a dealer may post indicative quotes for security-based swaps in various asset
classes that the dealer is willing to trade. Only the dealer’s approved customers have access to
the platform. When a customer wishes to transact in a security-based swap, the customer
requests an executable quote, the dealer provides one, and if the customer accepts the dealer’s
quote, the transaction is executed electronically. This type of platform generally provides
indicative quotes on a pricing screen, but only from one dealer to its customers. 92
Multi-dealer RFQ platforms
A multi-dealer RFQ electronic trading platform refers to a multi-dealer RFQ system
whereby a requester can send an RFQ to solicit quotes on a certain security-based swap from
multiple dealers at the same time. After the RFQ is submitted, the recipients have a prescribed
amount of time in which to respond to the RFQ with a quote. Responses to the RFQ are firm.
The requestor then has the opportunity to review the responses and accept the best quote. A
multi-dealer RFQ platform provides a certain amount of pricing information, depending on its
characteristics. 93
Central limit order books
A central limit order book system or similar system refers to a trading system in which
firm bids and offers are posted for all participants to see, with the identity of the parties withheld
until a transaction occurs. Bids and offers are then matched based on price-time priority or other
established parameters and trades are executed accordingly. The quotes on a limit order book
system are firm. In general, a limit order book system provides greater pricing information than
the three platforms described above because all participants can view bids and offers before

See id. at 10951.

93

For example, to the extent that a RFQ platform sets limits on the number of dealers to whom a
customer may send an RFQ, the customer’s pre-trade transparency is restricted to that number of
quotes it receives in response to its RFQ. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10952.

37

placing their bids and offers. 94 Currently, limit order books for the trading of security-based
swaps in the United States are utilized by inter-dealer brokers for dealer-to-dealer transactions.
Brokerage trading
“Brokerage trading” refers to an execution practice used by brokers to execute securitybased swaps on behalf of customers, often in larger sized transactions. In such a system, a
broker receives a request from a customer (which may be a dealer) who seeks to execute a
specific type of security-based swap. The broker then interacts with other customers (which may
also be dealers) to fill the request and execute the transaction. This model often is used by
dealers that seek to transact with other dealers through the use of an interdealer broker as an
intermediary. In this model, participants may or may not be able to see bids and offers of other
participants. 95
These various trading venues and execution practices provide different degrees of pretrade pricing information and different levels of access. The Commission currently does not
have sufficient information with respect to the volume of security-based swap transactions
executed across these different trading venues and execution practices to evaluate the individual
impact of such venues and practices on pricing information available in the security-based swap
market.
6. Broad Economic Considerations of Cross-Border Security-Based Swaps 96
Our primary economic considerations for promulgating rules and interpretations
regarding the application of Title VII to cross-border activities include the potential risks of
security-based swaps to the U.S. financial system 97 that could affect financial stability, the level
of transparency and counterparty protection in the security-based swap market, the costs to
market participants, and the impact of such rules and interpretations on liquidity, efficiency, and
competition in the market. Unlike most other securities transactions, a security-based swap gives
rise to ongoing obligations between transaction counterparties during the life of the transaction.
This means that each counterparty to the transaction undertakes the obligation to perform the
security-based swap in accordance with its terms and bears the counterparty credit risk and
market risk until the transaction is terminated. 98 The cross-border rules ultimately adopted by
94

See Section XV, infra (providing more detailed commentary on the economic effects of the
proposed rules, including supporting citations).

97

The Commission generally understands the “U.S. financial system” to include the U.S. banking
system and the U.S. financial markets, including the U.S. security-based swap market, the
traditional securities markets (e.g., the debt and equity markets), and the markets for other
financial activities (e.g., lending).

the Commission could materially impact the economic effects of the final Title VII regulatory
requirements.
(a) Major Economic Considerations
In determining how Title VII requirements should apply to persons and transactions in
the cross-border context, the Commission is aware of the potentially significant trade-offs
inherent in our policy decisions. For example, it is possible that counterparties excluded from
the Title VII regulatory framework would not, among other things, receive the same level of
counterparty protection or impartial access to trading venues and information as those included
in the Title VII regulatory framework. However, it is also possible that market participants
excluded from the Title VII regulatory framework would face lower regulatory burdens and
lower compliance costs associated with their security-based swap activity. Further, it is possible
that these trade-offs could alter the incentives for individuals to participate in the security-based
swap market, which may impact the overall market, affecting its liquidity, as well as its
efficiency and the competitive dynamics among participants. In addition, we also recognize that
regulators in other jurisdictions are currently engaged in implementing their own regulatory
reforms of the OTC derivatives markets and that our proposed application of Title VII to crossborder activities may affect the policy decisions of these other regulators as they seek to address
potential conflicts or duplication in the regulatory requirements that apply to market participants
under their authority. In proposing our rules and interpretations in this release, the Commission
has considered the benefits of the Title VII regulatory framework, including counterparty
protection and access to information, as well as the costs of compliance, taking into account the
potential impact of the rules and interpretations on liquidity, efficiency, and competition in the
security-based swap market.
Moreover, the costs and benefits of various Title VII substantive requirements may not be
the same for each individual market participant, depending on the role it plays, the market
function it performs, and the activity it engages in in the security-based swap market. For
example, Title VII requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants may impose significant costs on persons falling within the definitions of securitybased swap dealer and major security-based swap participant that are not borne by other market
participants. The costs of these requirements may provide economic incentive for some market
participants falling within the definitions of security-based swap dealer and major security-based
swap participant to restructure their security-based swap business to operate wholly outside of
the Title VII regulatory framework, exiting the security-based swap market in the United States
and not transacting with U.S. persons. Conversely, certain Title VII requirements may promote
financial stability and increase market participants’ confidence in entering into security-based
swap transactions.

terminate the mutual obligations of the parties,” unlike security-based swap transactions, which
often give rise to “an ongoing obligation to exchange cash flows over the life of the agreement”).

39

(b) Global Nature and Interconnectedness of the Security-Based Swap Market
In considering the proposed approach to the application of the Title VII requirements, the
Commission has been informed by the analysis of current market activity described in this
release, 99 including the extent of cross-border trading activity in the security-based swap
market. 100 The security-based swap transactions between U.S.- and non-U.S. domiciled market
participants provide conduits of risk into the U.S. financial system, which could affect the safety
and soundness of the U.S. financial system. Similarly, such transactions also provide conduits
for liquidity into the U.S. financial system. As a consequence, changes to incentives or costs that
result from the application of U.S. regulatory requirements may have effects on the liquidity of
the global market, as well as its efficiency and competitive dynamics.
With respect to conduits of risk, one area of particular concern in the current securitybased swap market is the risks that arise when a large market participant becomes financially
distressed, including the potential for sequential counterparty failure. A default by one or more
security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants could produce spillovers
or contagion by reducing the willingness and/or ability of market participants to extend credit to
each other, and thus could substantially reduce liquidity and valuations for particular types of
financial instruments. 101
The experience of American International Group, Inc. (“AIG”), a Delaware corporation
based in New York, and its subsidiary, AIG Financial Products Corp. (“AIG FP”), a Delaware
corporation based in Connecticut, during and after the 2008 financial crisis both illustrates
spillovers and contagion arising from security-based swap transactions and demonstrates how
cross-border transactions could contribute to the destabilization of the U.S. financial system if
the security-based swap market were not adequately regulated. 102 AIG FP sold extensive

100

For example, review of the DTCC-TIW single-name CDS transactions executed in 2011 reveals
that approximately 49% of the U.S. single-name CDS transactions were between one U.S.domiciled counterparty and one foreign-domiciled counterparty, and 44% of such transactions
were between two foreign-domiciled counterparties. See Section II.A.1, supra, and Section
XV.B.2(d), infra.

102

More generally, the Lehman Brothers Holding Inc. bankruptcy offers an example of how risk can
spread across affiliated entities of multinational financial institutions. See Lehman Brothers
International (Europe) in Administration, Joint Administrators’ Progress Report for the Period 15
September 2008 to 14 March 2009 (Apr. 14, 2009), available at:
http://www.pwc.co.uk/assets/pdf/lbie-progress-report-140409.pdf (“The global nature of the
Lehman business with highly integrated, trading and non-trading relationships across the group
led to a complex series of inter-company positions being outstanding at the date of
Administration. There are over 300 debtor and creditor balances between LBIE and its affiliates
representing $10.5B of receivables and $11.0B of payables as at 15 September 2008.”).

amounts of credit protection in the form of CDS in the years leading up to the crisis, 103 largely
on the strength of AIG’s AAA rating; AIG FP’s obligations were guaranteed by its parent
AIG. 104 AIG FP’s CDS business reflected the global nature of the security-based swap market
because, although both AIG and AIG FP were headquartered in the United States, much of AIG
FP’s CDS business was run out of its London office, 105 and AIG FP sold credit protection to
counterparties both within the United States and around the world. 106
As the subprime mortgage market in the United States collapsed, the ongoing obligations
borne by AIG FP and, through its guarantees, its parent AIG, arising from AIG FP’s CDS
transactions produced losses that threatened to overwhelm both AIG FP and AIG. The Federal
Reserve Bank of New York established a credit facility to prevent AIG from collapsing. These
funds were later supplemented by financial support from the U.S. Treasury and the Federal
Reserve, resulting in over $180 billion in financial assistance. 107
As we discuss in more detail below, security-based swap market regulators need to take
into account the spillover and contagion effect of security-based swap risk to avoid
overburdening the financial system. One way to mitigate the spillover effect of a firm failure is
to impose capital standards that take into account the security-based swap risk the firm
undertakes while allowing flexibility in how it conducts security-based swap business. 108 At the
same time, the Commission is mindful that the application of Title VII prudential requirements
such as capital and margin impose costs on market participants that could provide economic
incentives to restructure or separate their security-based swap activity according to geographical
or jurisdictional regions, or to engage in less security-based swap activity, which may reduce the
liquidity or efficiency of the overall market. 109

There are circumstances where risk generated by security-based swaps may reside in the
United States while conduits of such risk (e.g., security-based swap transactions or persons
engaged in security-based swap transactions) could take place or reside outside the United States
or outside the scope of application of the Title VII requirements. In these instances, the
Commission has considered the nature of the risk, the magnitude of the risk, and the existence of
other financial regulations, such as regulation of systemically important financial institutions in
Title I and Title II of the Dodd Frank Act and banking regulations.
The Commission is mindful that the same interconnectedness in the security-based swap
market that may provide conduits for risk also may mean that changes to incentives or costs
caused by the application of U.S. regulatory requirements may have effects on the liquidity of
the global market, as well as its efficiency and competitive dynamics. As described below in
Section XV.C, there are a myriad of paths for liquidity as well as risk to move throughout the
financial system in this interconnected market. In addition, differences in regulatory
requirements between the United States and non-U.S. jurisdictions may also impact markets by
changing the competitive dynamics currently at play in the interconnected global market. For
example, as articulated in Section XV.C, some potential responses by market participants to the
proposed rules and interpretations in this release may result in lessened competition in the
security-based swap market within the United States. Among other considerations, some entities
may determine that the compliance costs arising from the requirements of Title VII warrant
exiting the security-based swap market in the United States and not transacting with U.S.
persons. These exits could result in higher spreads and affect the ability and willingness of end
users to engage in security-based swaps.
(c) Central Clearing
Many of the bilateral counterparty credit risks associated with security-based swaps can
be mitigated by central clearing. Central clearing of security-based swaps provides a mechanism
for market participants to engage in security-based swap activity without having to assess the
creditworthiness of each counterparty. Clearing of security-based swaps shifts the counterparty
risk from individual counterparties to CCPs whose members collectively share the default risk of
all members. 110 Central clearing also requires consistent application of mark-to-market pricing
and margin requirements, which standardizes the settling of payment or collateral delivery
resulting from market movements and minimizes the risk of clearing member defaults. 111
110

Counterparty Risk?” Stanford University, Working Paper (2010), available at:

However, central clearing may also pose risk to financial systems. Because a CCP
necessarily concentrates a large number of otherwise bilateral contracts into a single location, a
CCP could itself become systemically important. 112 While a loss by any single member in
excess of its margin posted with the CCP is likely to be absorbed by the CCP’s risk capital
structure, correlated losses among many members, such as those which occurred among many
asset classes during the 2008 financial crisis, could diminish the effectiveness of the risk
mutualization structure of a CCP. Its failure could create financial instability through its
members if the members, as residual obligors to the default related losses are unable to absorb
the resulting financial impact. Such an outcome could lead to failure among CCP member
counterparties, particularly when obligations are sizable, which may be the case if the members
are themselves systemically important.
Certain aspects of Title VII are intended to reduce the risk of CCP failure by promoting
sound risk management practices among registered clearing agencies, while also providing open
access to market participants. 113 Sound risk management practices are important among both
domestic and foreign CCPs, given the global nature of CCP membership. 114 When a CCP in the
United States has significant number of foreign members, the CCP and its U.S.-domiciled
members would be exposed to the foreign members. Similarly, when U.S.-domiciled entities are
members of foreign domiciled CCPs, U.S. exposure to a foreign institution is created that may be
systemically important.
(d) Security-Based Swap Data Reporting
Certain Title VII requirements are designed to increase market transparency for
regulators and among security-based swap market participants. Requirements of regulatory
reporting are designed to provide regulators with a broad view of the market and help monitor
pockets of risk that might not otherwise be observed by market participants with an incomplete
view of the market. Separately, requirements of post-trade reporting of prices in real-time are
intended to promote price discovery and lower the trading costs by lessening the information
112

The Financial Stability Oversight Council (“FSOC”) can designate a CCP as systemically
important under Section 804 of the Dodd-Frank Act. See, e.g., Craig Pirrong, “Mutualization of
Default Risk, Fungibility, and Moral Hazard: The Economics of Default Risk Sharing in Cleared
and Bilateral Markets,” University of Houston, Working Paper (2010), available at:
http://business.nd.edu/uploadedFiles/Academic_Centers/Study_of_Financial_Regulation/pdf_and
_documents/clearing_moral_hazard_1.pdf (“[c]learing of OTC derivatives has been touted as an
essential component of reforms designed to prevent a repeat of the financial crisis. A back-tobasics analysis of the economics of clearing suggests that such claims are overstated, and that
traditional OTC mechanisms may be more efficient for some instruments and some
counterparties.”).

Based on the analysis of the member positions at ICE Clear Credit in the United States by the
staff in the Division of Risk, Strategy and Financial Innovation, approximately half of the
positions at ICE Clear Credit in the United States are held by foreign-domiciled dealing entities.

advantage afforded certain OTC market participants with the largest order flow. Allowing all
market participants access to more information about transactions’ prices and sizes should create
a more level playing field and may promote the efficiency of exchange or SEF trading of
security-based swaps. In particular, as in other security markets, quoted bids and offers should
form and adjust according to the reporting of executed trades. At the same time, however, we
recognize that increased post-trade transparency also could impact the liquidity of, and
competition in, the security-based swap market. 115 For example, market participants may be less
willing to provide liquidity for large, potentially market-moving trades if the implementation of
the Title VII public dissemination requirements reveals private information about future hedging
and inventory needs.
The increased transparency caused by the Title VII reporting requirements could be
diminished if consistent reporting requirements are not applied to transactions across various
jurisdictions and information regarding security-based swaps taking place in the global market is
not shared among jurisdictions. For instance, the aggregate exposures created by a particular
security-based swap or class of security-based swaps may only be partially observed if securitybased swap transactions span multiple jurisdictions. As a result any single regulator may not
have a complete view of the security-based swap risks and may underestimate such risks.
Separately, if some regulatory regimes do not require, or provide for less informative, post-trade
reporting rules, then certain transactions may gravitate to these jurisdictions so that market
participants can escape reporting their transaction prices. In both instances the increased
transparency contemplated by the Title VII reporting requirements may be diluted.
B. Scope of Title VII’s Application to Cross-Border Security-Based Swap Activity
Congress has given the Commission authority in Title VII to implement a security-based
swap regulatory framework. In the statutory definitions and registration requirements for market
intermediaries and participants (i.e., security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants) and security-based swap infrastructures (i.e., SDRs, security-based swap clearing
agencies, and SB SEFs), Congress has identified the types of security-based swap activity that
triggers Title VII registration and regulatory requirements relevant to such persons or the
application of Title VII transaction-level requirements.
We recognize that applying Title VII to persons and transactions that fall within the
statutory definitions or requirements may subject some persons based outside the United States,
or some transactions arising from activity that occurs in part inside and in part outside the United
States, to the various provisions of Title VII. At the same time, however, the global nature of the
security-based swap market and the characteristics of the risk associated with security-based
swap activity suggest that applying Title VII only to the conduct of persons located within the
United States or to security-based swap activity occurring entirely within the United States
would exclude from regulation a significant proportion of security-based swap activity that

115

See Section XV.C, infra (discussing the effects of our proposed cross-border approach on
competition, efficiency, and capital formation).

44

occurs in part inside and in part outside the United States. 116 Our proposed approach is intended
to strike a reasonable balance in light of the authority provided by Congress, the structure of the
security-based swap market, and the transfer of risk within that market. Accordingly, among
other things, our proposed approach does not impose Title VII requirements on persons whose
relevant security-based swap activity occurs entirely outside the United States and thus likely
does not raise the types of concerns in the U.S. financial system that would warrant application
of Title VII.
Commenters have raised concerns about the application of Title VII to security-based
swap activity in the cross-border context and specifically about the possibility that the
Commission may apply our security-based swap regulations to “extraterritorial” conduct. In this
subsection, we discuss commenters’ views regarding the applicability of Title VII to crossborder security-based swap activity, explain our proposed approach to determining whether the
relevant security-based swap activity takes place, in whole or in part, within the United States,
and interpret what it means for a person to “transact a business in security-based swaps without
the jurisdiction of the United States” as set forth in Section 30(c) of the Exchange Act (“Section
30(c)”). 117 In subsequent sections of the release, we discuss in more detail our proposed
application of Title VII to cross-border security-based swap activity.
1. Commenters’ Views
Commenters generally expressed the view that Section 30(c) restricts the Commission’s
authority to apply Title VII to “extraterritorial” conduct and thus, that the Commission follow a
territorial approach in applying Title VII to cross-border security-based swap activity. One
commenter interpreted Section 30(c) as prescribing a strictly territorial approach to the
application of Title VII, arguing that this section codifies the territorial approach that we have
historically taken in our existing securities regulations. 118 Several commenters argued that a
narrow interpretation of the “extraterritorial” reach of Title VII was consistent with both
Commission precedent 119 and the Supreme Court’s decision in Morrison v. National Australia
Bank. 120

116

See Section II.A, supra. We preliminarily believe that many of the circumstances of concern also
would create the opportunity for evasion of the Dodd-Frank Act’s regulatory regime. See, e.g.,
note 558, infra.

15 U.S.C. 78dd(c).

118

See Cleary Letter IV at 33-36; see also SIFMA Letter I at 5, 22; Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 6
(suggesting that Section 30(c) permits “extraterritorial” application of Title VII only to prevent
“efforts to evade” statutory requirements).

119

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 11 (stating that the Commission has “plainly stated that
it uses a territorial approach in applying the broker-dealer requirements to international
operations”).

130 S.Ct. 2869 (2010). See, e.g., Jones Day Letter at 7-8 (suggesting that the jurisdictional limits
of Dodd-Frank Act Sections 722 and 772 be interpreted narrowly in a manner consistent with the

45

Based on this interpretation of Section 30(c), commenters generally argued that Title VII
does not give the Commission authority to regulate entities that transact a business in securitybased swaps outside the United States. 121 Some commenters suggested that non-U.S. entities
(including affiliates of U.S. persons) that conduct business entirely with counterparties outside
the United States should not be required to register as swap or security-based swap dealers or
comply with Title VII. 122 Some of these commenters also urged the Commission not to subject
foreign branches and affiliates of U.S. banks to Title VII registration requirements to the extent
that they transact solely with foreign persons. 123 Some commenters urged that, even within a
single entity, only those branches, departments, or divisions that engage in business within the
United States should be required to register. 124
Commenters generally took the view that Section 30(c) does not permit the Commission
to apply Title VII to transactions occurring outside the United States. Accordingly, commenters
suggested that Section 30(c) restricts the Commission’s ability to apply Title VII requirements to
the foreign business of entities that are required to register with the Commission. 125 For
example, one commenter interpreted Section 30(c) to prohibit application of Title VII to any of a

Morrison decision); Cleary Letter IV at 33-6 (arguing against an extraterritorial application of
Title VII); SIFMA Letter I at 5-6; ISDA Letter I at 11.
121

See, e.g., Jones Day Letter at 7-8; Cleary Letter IV at 33-6; Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 10-11;
SIFMA Letter I at 5-6; ISDA Letter I at 11.

122

See SIFMA Letter I at 4; see also ISDA Letter I at 11 (recommending that designation as a dealer
should not be triggered by transactions entered into with foreign affiliates or branches of a U.S.
bank or with foreign entities whose obligations are guaranteed by a U.S. person, or by legacy
positions with U.S. counterparties); Davis Polk Letter II at 5-6 (stating that a foreign entity
engaged in swaps exclusively with foreign counterparties is “‘without the jurisdiction of the
United States’”). Similarly, one commenter recommended that transactions between two foreign
entities should be excluded from calculations of substantial position for purposes of the major
participant definition. Canadian MAVs Letter at 7-8.

123

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 7 (stating that a territorial interpretation of Section 30(c)
prevented the Commission from imposing Title VII requirements on the U.S. banks’ “Non-U.S.
Operations,” defined to include both foreign affiliates or subsidiaries and foreign branches of
these banks).

124

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 12; see also id. at 26 (arguing that a non-U.S. branch or affiliate of a
U.S. entity should not be required to register as a dealer by virtue of its transactions with a nonU.S. person counterparty); ISDA Letter I at 11 (stating that a “branch, division or office of an
entity should be able to be designated as a Dealer without subjecting the whole entity to
regulation”).

125

See Cleary Letter IV at 11; see also SIFMA Letter I at 14 (suggesting that Section 30(c)
“provide[s] strong support” for not applying Title VII to transactions between a registered foreign
swap dealer and non-U.S. persons); ISDA Letter I at 11 (recommending that no Title VII
requirements should apply to transactions between a non-U.S. entity registered as a dealer and its
non-U.S. person counterparties).

46

person’s “activity” or “business” outside the United States, even if that person otherwise
transacts a business in security-based swaps within the jurisdiction of the United States. 126
Similarly, some commenters suggested that Section 30(c) prohibits the application of
Title VII to transactions involving the foreign affiliates of U.S. persons, on the basis that such
transactions occur “without the jurisdiction of the United States” when no U.S. person is a
counterparty to the trade. 127 One commenter explained that, because such transactions involve
parties outside the United States and occur outside the United States, they are “removed from the
stream of U.S. commerce.” 128
Commenters also generally recommended a narrower interpretation of the language in
Section 30(c) permitting the application of Title VII regulations to persons transacting a business
in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States to the extent that they are
doing so in contravention of rules the Commission has prescribed as “necessary or appropriate to
prevent the evasion of any provision of [the Exchange Act that was added by the Dodd-Frank
Act].” Under this view, Section 30(c) permits “extraterritorial” application of Title VII only to
entities that have themselves engaged in willful or intentional evasion. 129 These commenters
argued that the longstanding use of foreign branches and affiliates by security-based swap
market entities demonstrates that these types of business structures are not evasive and,
therefore, do not fall within the exception to the limits on the applicability of Title VII as set
forth in Section 30(c). 130
2. Scope of Application of Title VII in the Cross-Border Context
(a) Overview and General Approach
Section 772(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act amends Section 30 of the Exchange Act to provide
that “[n]o provision of [Title VII] . . . shall apply to any person insofar as such person transacts a
business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless that
business is transacted in contravention of rules prescribed to prevent evasion of Title VII. 131 In
so amending Section 30 of the Exchange Act, Congress directly appropriated nearly identical
language defining the scope of the Exchange Act’s application that appears in subsection (b) of
126

See Cleary Letter IV at 12.

127

See SIFMA Letter I at 5-6; see also ISDA Letter I at 11 (suggesting that dealer-related
requirements of Title VII should not apply to business with non-U.S. person counterparties,
including foreign affiliates and branches of U.S. persons).

128

See Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 9.

129

See, e.g., id. at 9-10 (suggesting that “extraterritorial” application of Title VII requires an “intent
to evade” Title VII).

See Section 30(c) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78dd(c), added by Section 772(b) of the DoddFrank Act.

47

Section 30 of the Exchange Act, 132 indicating that Congress intended the territorial application of
Title VII to entities and transactions in the security-based swap market to follow similar
principles to those applicable to the securities market under the Exchange Act. 133
In light of this similar language, commenters have urged us to follow a territorial
approach in applying Title VII to cross-border security-based swap activity. 134 We preliminarily
agree that a territorial approach, if properly tailored to the characteristics of the security-based
swap market, should help ensure that our regulatory framework focuses on security-based swap
activity that is most likely to raise the concerns that Congress intended to address in Title VII,
including the effects of security-based swap activity on the financial stability of the United
States, on the transparency of the U.S. financial system, and on the protection of counterparties.
We differ from commenters, however, in our understanding of what a territorial approach
means in the context of a global security-based swap market. As noted above, some commenters
suggested that the security-based swap activity of foreign branches and affiliates of U.S. persons
with non-U.S. persons occurs outside the United States and has only an indirect connection with
the United States and that, therefore, subjecting transactions resulting from that activity to Title
VII would involve extraterritorial application of the statute. 135 Although we recognize that some
of the security-based swap activity involving these foreign branches and affiliates occur outside
the United States, we believe that a properly tailored territorial approach should look to both the
full range of activities described in the statutory text as well as to the concerns that Congress
intended Title VII to address in determining whether the relevant activity, considered in its
entirety, occurs at least in part within the United States. 136
As noted above, security-based swap transactions differ from most traditional securities
transactions in that they give rise to an ongoing obligation between the counterparties to the
trade: the counterparties bear the risks that result from those transactions for the duration of the
transactions. 137 The Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, in part, to address the risks to the financial
132

Section 30(b) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78dd(b), provides that the Exchange Act and
related rules “shall not apply to any person insofar as he transacts a business in securities without
the jurisdiction of the United States,” unless that business is transacted in contravention of rules
prescribed as necessary or appropriate to prevent evasion of the Exchange Act.

133

See, e.g., Commodity Futures Trading Comm’n v. Schor, 478 U.S. 833, 846 (1986) (holding that
“when Congress revisits a statute giving rise to a longstanding administrative interpretation
without pertinent change, the ‘congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency's interpretation
is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress’”).

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 33-37.

stability of the United States posed by entities bearing such risks, and a territorial approach to the
application of Title VII should be consistent with achieving these statutory purposes. A
territorial approach to the application of Title VII that excluded from the application of Title VII
any activity conducted by the foreign operations of a U.S. person where they do business only
with non-U.S. counterparties located outside the United States would likely fail to achieve the
financial stability goals of Title VII, as such an approach would not account for the securitybased swap risks that may be borne by entities located within the United States whose foreign
operations solicit, negotiate, or execute transactions outside the United States. In addition, it is
not clear that a different territorial approach that focused solely on the location of the entity
bearing the risk (and disregarded whether certain relevant activity, including execution of the
transaction, occurred within the United States) would adequately address the Dodd-Frank Act’s
concern with promoting transparency in the U.S. financial system and protecting counterparties,
concerns that are likely to be raised by the solicitation, negotiation, or execution within the
United States, even if the risk arising from those security-based swaps transactions is borne by
entities outside the United States. For example, some transactions characterized by commenters
as occurring outside the United States, even with non-U.S. persons, are entered into by persons
located within the United States and would appear to raise the same types of risk concerns as
transactions occurring wholly within the United States.
Similarly, the Commission preliminarily believes that a territorial approach should be
informed by the text of the statutory provision that imposes the registration or other regulatory
requirement. 138 Some commenters suggested, for instance, that a territorial approach would
necessarily exclude certain foreign operations of U.S. persons from registration as security-based
swap dealers so long as they did not enter into security-based swap transactions with
counterparties located within the United States. 139 However, in this instance, these commenters
did not show how their suggested approach relates to the statutory definition of security-based
swap dealer or to the rules and interpretation adopted by the Commission and the CFTC to
further define “security-based swap dealer” in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release,
including our discussion of conduct that is indicative of dealing activity. 140 In our preliminary
view, we should identify the activity that the statutory provision regulates before reaching a
determination of whether relevant activity is occurring within the United States. 141 Only after
we identify the activity that the statutory provision regulates would we then be able to determine
whether the conduct at issue involves activity that the statutory provision regulates and whether
this conduct occurs within the United States. To the extent that conduct involving activity that
the statutory provision regulates occurs within the United States, application of Title VII to that
conduct would be consistent with a territorial approach.

Act to determine what conduct was relevant in determining whether the statute was being applied

(b) Territorial Approach to Application of Title VII Security-Based Swap Dealer
Registration Requirements
We discuss our application of this approach with respect to each of the major Title VII
registration categories and requirements in connection with reporting, public dissemination,
clearing, and trade execution for security-based swaps in further detail in the sections below, 142
but for sake of illustration, we provide a brief overview of our territorial approach as it applies to
the security-based swap dealer definition.
Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act 143 defines security-based swap dealer as a person
that engages in any of the following types of activity:
(i) holding oneself out as a dealer in security-based swaps,
(ii) making a market in security-based swaps,
(iii) regularly entering into security-based swaps with counterparties as an ordinary
course of business for one’s own account,
(iv) engaging in any activity causing oneself to be commonly known in the trade as a
dealer in security-based swaps. 144
We have further interpreted this definition by jointly adopting interpretive guidance with the
CFTC that identifies the types of activity that is relevant in determining whether a person is a
security-based swap dealer. 145 In this interpretive guidance, we have identified indicia of
security-based swap dealing activity to include the following activities:
•

providing liquidity to market professionals or other persons in connection with
security-based swaps,

•

seeking to profit by providing liquidity in connection with security-based swaps,

•

providing advice in connection with security-based swaps or structuring securitybased swaps,

•

having a regular clientele and actively soliciting clients,

•

using inter-dealer brokers, and

•

acting as a market maker on an organized security-based swap exchange or trading
system. 146

As the foregoing list of relevant activities illustrates, both the statutory text and our
interpretation of that text include within the security-based swap dealer definition a range of
activities. The broad scope of activities listed above identifies various characteristics of dealing
activity. Given the risks associated with dealing activity that the dealer definition and associated
regulatory framework in Title VII are intended to address, we preliminarily believe that a
territorial approach consistent with these statutory purposes should consider whether the entity
performs any of these indicia of dealing activity within the United States (even if some of these
indicia also arise in activity conducted outside the United States). This type of analysis appears
to us more consistent with the statutory text and with the Supreme Court’s approach to statutory
analysis in its decision in Morrison than an approach that excludes from jurisdiction certain
foreign operations of U.S. persons transacting with foreign counterparties. We also believe that
our proposed approach would better help ensure that our regulatory framework achieves the
various purposes of security-based swap dealer regulation under Title VII, while avoiding
application of security-based swap dealer registration to persons whose dealing activity is
unlikely to raise the types of dealer-specific risks that Title VII dealer registration was intended
to address because it occurs entirely outside the United States. 147
Under our proposed territorial approach to the security-based swap dealer definition, as
explained further below, we would require persons resident or organized in the United States, or
with their principal place of business in the United States, to count all of their dealing
transactions toward their de minimis threshold, including transactions that arise from dealing

146

Id.

147

Under our proposed approach to the application of the de minimis threshold in the cross-border
context, non-U.S. persons that engage in dealing activity with U.S. persons or otherwise within
the United States at levels below the de minimis threshold generally would also not be required to
register as security-based swap dealers. Such entities are engaged in dealing activity within the
United States, and their dealing activity within the United States may raise certain concerns
addressed by Title VII. However, we preliminarily believe that, to the extent that this dealing
activity remains at levels below the de minimis threshold, they should be treated similarly to a
U.S. person that engages in dealing activity at levels below the de minimis threshold. See Section
III.B.4, infra. Like U.S. entities engaged in dealing activity, they may be required to register
under the aggregation requirements the Commission and the CFTC adopted in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30631;
17 CFR § 240.3a71-2(a)(1). Under the aggregation requirements we propose below, even entities
with security-based swap dealing activity at levels below the de minimis threshold may be
required to register if the total security-based swap dealing activity of affiliates under common
control (excluding the activity of any registered affiliates that have independent operations)
exceeds the de minimis threshold. See Section III.B.8, infra.

activity that occurs in part outside the United States (for example, because it is negotiated and
executed through that person’s foreign branch or office). 148
An interpretation of Section 30(c) that advances the view that security-based swap
activity conducted by a U.S. person through a foreign branch constitutes activity “without the
jurisdiction of the United States” or that a transaction arising from such activity constitutes
“transacting a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States” for
purposes of Section 30(c) may not fully account for the statutory definition of “security-based
swap dealer,” the purposes of Title VII, or the global nature of the security-based swap market.
It does not account for the entire range of activities performed by entities active in the securitybased swap market, including security-based swap dealers, and the relevance of such activities to
the statutory definitions and requirements, given the purposes of Title VII, and it would leave
unaddressed significant levels of activity that poses precisely the sorts of risks that Title VII was
intended to address.
In our preliminary view, to the extent that a U.S. person engages in dealing activity
through a foreign operation that is part of the U.S. legal person (such as a foreign branch or
office), relevant activity for purposes of the security-based swap dealer definition occurs, at least
in part, within the United States because we believe it is the U.S. entity as a whole, and not just
the foreign branch or office, that is holding itself out as a dealer and making a market in securitybased swaps. Moreover, it is necessarily the U.S. person as a whole that is seeking to profit by
providing liquidity and engaging in market-making in security-based swaps, and it is the
financial resources of the entire entity that enable it to provide liquidity and engage in marketmaking in connection with security-based swaps. Its dealing counterparties will look to the
entire U.S. person, and not just the foreign branch or office, for performance on the transaction.
The entire U.S. person assumes, and stands behind, the obligations arising from the resulting
agreement. For these reasons, to the extent that a dealer resides or is organized, or has its
principal place of business, within the United States, we believe that it cannot hold itself out as a
security-based swap dealer, even through a foreign branch, as anything other than a single
person, given that it generally could not operate as a dealer absent the financial and other
resources of the entire U.S. person. Its dealing activity with all of its counterparties, including
dealing activity conducted through its foreign branch or office, is best characterized as occurring,
at least in part, within the United States and should therefore be counted toward the entity’s de
minimis threshold.
More generally, we preliminarily believe that transactions that create ongoing obligations
that are borne by a U.S. person are properly described as directly occurring within the United
States, particularly given Title VII’s focus on, among other things, addressing risks to the
financial stability of the United States. 149 Indeed, the history of AIG FP confirms that such
transactions of U.S. persons can pose risks to the U.S. financial system even if they are
148

See Section III.B.4, infra.

149

As we discuss below, such activity would include providing guarantees for a foreign entity’s
security-based swap transactions. See Section II.B.2(d), infra.

52

conducted through foreign operations. The nature of such risks, and their role in the financial
crisis and in the enactment of Title VII, suggest that the statutory framework established by
Congress and the objectives of Title VII may require a broader analysis than excluding
transactions involving U.S. persons from the application of Title VII solely because they are
conducted through operations outside the United States, while others by the same U.S. persons
occur within the United States. 150
However, we preliminarily believe that non-U.S. persons engaged in dealing activity
would be required to count toward their de minimis thresholds only transactions arising from
their dealing activity with U.S. persons 151 or dealing activity otherwise conducted within the
United States. In addition, to the extent that a non-U.S. person engages in security-based swap
dealing activity within the United States, we preliminarily believe that such dealing activity
should be counted toward the non-U.S. person’s de minimis threshold regardless of whether its
counterparties are U.S. persons. 152 This view is consistent with the fact that such security-based
swap activity raises the types of concerns that the Dodd-Frank Act was intended to address.
We preliminarily believe that a non-U.S. person not engaged in any security-based swap
activity within the United States (or engaged only at levels below the de minimis threshold) is
unlikely to pose the types of concerns within the U.S. financial system that Title VII dealer
regulation was intended to address. 153 Thus, under our proposed approach, a non-U.S. person
that engages in dealing activity entirely outside the United States (i.e., does not enter into
transactions with a U.S. person or otherwise conduct any part of its dealing activity within the
United States) would not be required to register as a security-based swap dealer. 154
(c) Application of Other Title VII Requirements to Registered Entities
We are proposing to apply the Title VII requirements associated with registration
(including, among others, capital and margin requirements and external business conduct
150

However, for reasons explained below, the Commission is not proposing to subject the foreign
operations of U.S. persons to certain of the requirements in Title VII. See, e.g., Sections III.B.7,
III.B.9, VIII.C, IX.C.3(a), and X.B.3(a), infra.

151

However, for reasons explained below, the Commission is not proposing to require non-U.S.
persons to include transactions with the foreign branches of U.S. banks in their de minimis
calculations. See Section III.B.7, infra.

152

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30617-18.

153

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section III.B.4, infra. Of
course, the transactions of an entity engaged in security-based swap dealing activity within the
United States at levels below the de minimis threshold or in security-based swap activity within
the United States that is not dealing activity may be subject to other Title VII requirements, as
discussed below, or other provisions of the federal securities laws.

154

This proposed approach to the application of Title VII security-based swap dealer registration
requirements is not intended to limit or address the cross-border reach or extraterritorial
application of the antifraud or other provisions of the federal securities laws.

53

requirements 155) to the activities of registered entities to the extent we have determined that
doing so advances the purposes of Title VII. 156 Although some commenters suggested that a
territorial approach would prohibit the Commission from applying Title VII to the foreign
security-based swap activities of even registered entities, such an interpretation of the application
of Title VII to registered entities is difficult to reconcile with the statutory language describing
the requirements applicable to registered security-based swap dealers, with the text of Section
30(c), 157 or with the purposes of Title VII and the nature of risks in the security-based swap
market as described above. We have long taken the view that an entity that has registered with
the Commission subjects itself to the entire regulatory system governing such registered
entities. 158
(d) Application of Title VII Regulatory Requirements to Transactions of Foreign
Entities Receiving Guarantees from U.S. Persons
We also are proposing to apply certain Title VII transaction-level requirements (e.g.,
mandatory clearing, reporting and dissemination, and mandatory trade execution of securitybased swaps) to certain transactions involving one or more non-U.S. persons whose performance
under the security-based swaps is guaranteed by a U.S. person. We discuss the statutory basis
for applying specific Title VII requirements to such transactions in the relevant substantive
155

See Section 15F of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10.

156

See, e.g., Sections III.C.3 and 4, infra (discussing requirements applicable to security-based swap
dealers).

157

Section 30(c) prohibits the application of the Exchange Act only with respect to those persons
that “transact[] a business in security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States.”
Because only security-based swap entities that transact a business in security-based swaps within
the United States would be required to register under the approach proposed in this release,
registered entities are not persons that “transact[] a business in security-based swaps without the
jurisdiction of the United States.”

54

discussions below. 159 In this subsection, we briefly explain why we believe that a territorial
approach that is consistent with the purposes and text of the Dodd-Frank Act supports the
application of Title VII to such transactions.
In a security-based swap transaction between two non-U.S. persons where the
performance of at least one side of the transaction is guaranteed by a U.S. person, the guarantee
gives the guaranteed entity’s counterparty direct recourse to the U.S. person for performance of
obligations owed by the guaranteed entity under the security-based swap, 160 and the U.S.
guarantor exposes itself to the security-based swap risk as if it were a direct counterparty to the
security-based swap through the security-based swap activity engaged in by the guaranteed
entity. As a result, the guarantee creates risk to the U.S. financial system and counterparties
(including U.S. guarantors) to the same degree as if the transaction were entered into directly by
a U.S. person. In addition, in many cases, the counterparty would not enter into the transaction
(or would not do so on the same terms) with the guaranteed entity, and the guaranteed entity
would not be able to engage in any security-based swaps, absent the presence of the guarantee.
Given that the guarantee is provided by a U.S. person and poses risks to the U.S. financial
system, and considering the reliance by both the guaranteed entity and its counterparty on the
creditworthiness of the guarantor in the course of engaging in security-based swap transactions
and for the duration of the security-based swap, we preliminarily believe that a transaction
entered into by a non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap is
guaranteed by a U.S. person is within the United States by virtue of the involvement of the U.S.
guarantor in the security-based swap. Therefore, we preliminarily believe that subjecting such
transactions to Title VII is consistent with our territorial approach.
(e) Regulations Necessary or Appropriate to Prevent Evasion of Title VII
As noted above, several commenters expressed the view that Section 30(c) of the
Exchange Act restricts the Commission’s authority to apply amendments made to the Exchange
Act by Title VII to “extraterritorial” conduct. Section 30(c) provides the Commission with the
express authority to prescribe rules and regulations for persons that transact a business in
security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States to the extent the Commission
determines that doing so is necessary or appropriate to prevent evasion. Some commenters have
expressed the view that this authority extends to “extraterritorial” activity only when such
159

See Sections VIII - XI, infra.

160

In discussing the application of the major participant tests to guaranteed positions in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the Commission and the CFTC noted that an entity’s
security-based swap positions are attributed to a parent, other affiliate, or guarantor for purposes
of the major participant analysis to the extent that the counterparties to those positions have
recourse to that parent, other affiliate, or guarantor in connection with the position. Positions are
not attributed in the absence of recourse. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR
at 30689. As a result, the term “guarantee” as used in this release refers to a contractual
agreement pursuant to which one party to a security-based swap transaction has recourse to its
counterparty’s parent, other affiliate, or guarantor with respect to the counterparty’s obligations
owed under the transaction.

55

activity is intended to evade Title VII or to conceal a domestic violation of Title VII, suggesting
that Section 30(c) prohibits application of Title VII to transactions by foreign affiliates or
operations established for a legitimate business purpose, as the existence of such a purpose is
evidence that the conduct is not intended to be evasive. 161
While recognizing the concerns expressed by commenters, the Commission preliminarily
believes that Section 30(c) does not require the Commission to find actual evasion in order to
invoke our authority to reach activity “without the jurisdiction of the United States.” Section
30(c) also does not require that every particular application of Title VII to security-based swap
activity “without the jurisdiction of the United States” address only business that is transacted in
a way that evades Title VII. Section 30(c) authorizes the Commission to apply Title VII to
persons transacting a business “without the jurisdiction of the United States” if they violate rules
that the Commission has prescribed as “necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any
provision” of Title VII. The focus of this provision is not whether such rules impose Title VII
requirements only on entities engaged in evasive activity but whether the rules are generally
“necessary or appropriate” to prevent evasion of Title VII. In other words, Section 30(c) permits
the Commission to impose prophylactic rules intended to prevent possible evasion, even if they
affect both evasive and non-evasive conduct. Thus, under our preliminary proposed
interpretation of Section 30(c), the statute permits us to prescribe such rules to conduct without
the jurisdiction of the United States, even if those rules would also apply to a market participant
that has been transacting business through a pre-existing market structure such as a foreign
branch or guaranteed foreign affiliate established for valid business purposes, provided the
proposed rule or interpretation is designed to prevent possible evasive conduct. 162
C. Principles Guiding Proposed Approach to Applying Title VII in the Cross-Border Context
In considering how to apply Title VII in the cross-border context, the Commission has
been mindful of the global nature of the security-based swap market and the types of risks
created by security-based swap activity to the U.S. financial system and market participants, as
well as the needs of a well-functioning security-based swap market. 163 We also have been
guided by the purpose of the Dodd-Frank Act 164 and the applicable requirements of the
Exchange Act, including the following:
161

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 5-6, 7, 18; Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 6-7.

162

We preliminarily believe that the proposed rules or interpretations set forth in this release are not
being applied to persons who are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the
jurisdiction of the United States,” within the meaning of Section 30(c). See Section II.B.2(a),
supra. However, as noted below, the Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposed
rules or interpretations are necessary or appropriate to help prevent the evasion of the provisions
of the Exchange Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act and prophylactically will help
ensure that the particular purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act addressed by the rule or interpretation
are not undermined. See, e.g., note 558, infra.

Anti-Evasion—The Dodd-Frank Act amends the Exchange Act to provide the

At times these principles reinforce one another; at other times they compete with each
other. For instance, attempts to regulate risk posed to the United States may, depending on what
is proposed, make it more costly for U.S.-based firms to conduct security-based swap business,
particularly in foreign markets, compared to foreign firms, or could make foreign firms less
willing to deal with U.S. persons. On the other hand, attempts to provide U.S. persons greater
access to foreign security-based swap markets may, depending on what is proposed, fail to
appropriately address the risk posed to the United States from transactions conducted outside the
United States or create opportunities for market participants to evade the application of Title VII,
particularly until such time as global initiatives to regulate the derivatives markets are fully
enacted and implemented.
Balancing these sometimes competing principles is complicated by the fact that Title VII
imposes a new regulatory regime on a marketplace that already exists as a functioning, global
market. Title VII establishes reforms that will have implications for entities that compete
internationally in the global security-based swap market. As we have formulated our proposal,
we have generally sought, in accordance with the statutory factors described above, to avoid
creating opportunities for regulatory arbitrage or evasion or the potential for duplicative or
conflicting regulations. We also have considered the needs for a well-functioning security-based
swap market and for avoiding disruption that may reduce liquidity, competition, efficiency,
transparency, or stability in the security-based swap market.
D. Conclusion
Consistent with the principles and requirements outlined above, we are proposing to
structure our implementation of Title VII around an approach that focuses on identifying market
participants whose presence or activity within the United States or activity involving market
participants within the United States may give rise to the types of risk to the U.S. financial
system and counterparties that Title VII seeks to address, as described more fully below in the
subsequent sections of the release.

171

For example, subjecting non-U.S. persons to Title VII may prompt a foreign jurisdiction to
respond by subjecting U.S. persons to the foreign jurisdiction’s regulatory regime. However,
substituted compliance of the type proposed in this release or other mechanisms may address
potential conflicts or duplication arising from overlapping regulatory requirements.

III.

Security-Based Swap Dealers

A. Introduction
Among the market participants subject to regulation under Title VII as a result of their
security-based swap activities are security-based swap dealers. 173 As discussed above, a
“security-based swap dealer” generally is defined as any person that (i) holds itself out as a
dealer in security-based swaps; (ii) makes a market in security-based swaps; (iii) regularly enters
into security-based swaps with counterparties as an ordinary course of business for its own
account; or (iv) engages in any activity causing the person to be commonly known in the trade as
a dealer or market maker in security-based swaps. 174 The Commission, jointly with the CFTC,
issued final rules and interpretive guidance to further define the term security-based swap
dealer, 175 including rules implementing the de minimis exception. 176 As part of these final rules
and interpretive guidance, the Commission stated that the relevant statutory provisions suggest
that, rather than focusing solely on the risk these entities pose to the financial markets, we should
interpret the “security-based swap dealer definition in a way that identifies those persons for
which regulation is warranted either: (i) [d]ue to the nature of their interactions with
counterparties; or (ii) to promote market stability and transparency, in light of the role those
persons occupy within the security-based swap markets.” 177 Security-based swap dealers are
subject to a comprehensive regulatory regime under Title VII. The statutory provisions added to
the Exchange Act by Title VII are intended to provide for financial responsibility associated with
security-based swap dealers’ activities (e.g., the ability to satisfy obligations and the protection
of counterparties’ funds and assets), and other counterparty protections, as well as market
stability and transparency. 178
By its terms, application of the security-based swap dealer definition set forth in
Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act 179 does not depend on whether a security-based swap

See Section 764(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, codified as Section 15F of the Exchange Act, 15
U.S.C. 78o-10. See also Section IV, infra (discussing major security-based swap participants).

174

See Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71), as added by Section 761(a) of
the Dodd-Frank Act; see also Section II.B.2(b), supra.

175

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30596; 17 CFR § 240.3a71-1.

176

Section 3(a)(71)(D) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)(D), provides that “[t]he
Commission shall exempt from designation as a security-based swap dealer an entity that engages
in a de minimis quantity of security-based swap dealing in connection with transactions with or
on behalf of its customers. The Commission shall promulgate regulations to establish factors
with respect to the making of this determination to exempt.” This provision is implemented in
Rule 3a71-2 under the Exchange Act (17 CFR § 240.3a71-2), as discussed in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30626-43.

dealer or its counterparty is a U.S. person. 180 Rather, the security-based swap dealer definition
encompasses persons engaged in security-based swap dealing activities without regard to the
geographic location or legal residence of either the dealing person or such person’s
counterparties. The Commission did not provide guidance on the application of the securitybased swap dealer definition to non-U.S. persons or to U.S. persons that conduct dealing
activities in the cross-border context in either our proposed or final rules. 181 As discussed
above 182 and as further discussed below, market participants, foreign regulators, and other
interested parties have raised concerns regarding, among other things, the application of Title VII
to non-U.S. persons that engage in security-based swap dealing activity and U.S. persons who
conduct dealing activities “outside the United States.” 183
The rules and interpretations described below represent the Commission’s proposed
approach to applying the security-based swap dealer definition to non-U.S. persons and to U.S.
persons who conduct dealing activities in the cross-border context in light of the principles
discussed above. 184 Our proposal reflects a particular balancing of these principles, informed by,
among other things, the particular nature of the security-based swap market, 185 the structure of
security-based swap dealing activity, 186 and our experience in applying the federal securities
laws in the cross-border context in the past. 187 We recognize that other approaches are possible
to achieve the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act, in whole or in part. Accordingly, we invite
comment regarding all aspects of the proposal described below, and each proposed rule and
interpretation contained therein, including potential alternative approaches. Data and comment
from market participants and other interested parties regarding the likely effect of each proposed
rule and interpretation and potential alternative approaches will be particularly useful to the
Commission in evaluating possible modifications to the proposal.
B. Registration Requirement
1. Introduction
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, which was adopted jointly with the
CFTC, the Commission set forth a de minimis threshold of security-based swap dealing that

takes into account the notional amount of security-based swap positions connected with a
person’s security-based swap dealing activity over the prior 12 months. 188 When a person
engages in security-based swap dealing in connection with transactions above that threshold,
such person meets the definition of a security-based swap dealer under Section 3(a)(71) of the
Exchange Act, 189 and the rules and regulations thereunder, 190 and is required to register as a
security-based swap dealer with the Commission pursuant to Section 15F(a)(1) of the Exchange
Act. 191
The de minimis exception in Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act is silent on its
application to the cross-border security-based swap dealing activity of U.S. persons and non-U.S.
persons, and the Commission did not address this issue in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release. 192 Without additional Commission guidance, it would be unclear how persons would
be required to calculate the notional amount of their security-based swaps for purposes of the de
minimis exception based on their global book of security-based swap dealing activity. In
addition, as discussed below, commenters have raised questions regarding how the de minimis
threshold should be applied in the cross-border context, expressing concern that, among other
things, if a non-U.S. person were required to register as a security-based swap dealer with the
Commission because its security-based swap dealing activity exceeded the de minimis threshold,
188

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30626-43. The de minimis threshold
was adopted by the Commission in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release to implement
a statutory exclusion from the security-based swap dealer definition found in Section 3(a)(71)(D)
of the Exchange Act. See note 176, supra. The de minimis threshold is defined in terms of a
notional amount of security-based swap positions connected with dealing activity in which a
person engages over the course of the immediately preceding 12 months. An entity engaged in
security-based swap dealing activity in connection with security-based swap transactions with or
on behalf of its customers below the de minimis threshold amount is exempt from designation as
a security-based swap dealer. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30626.

Section 15F(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person to act
as a security-based swap dealer unless the person is registered as a security-based swap dealer
with the Commission.” 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(a)(1). A person that engages in security-based swap
dealing activity in connection with transactions with or on behalf of customers in excess of the de
minimis threshold falls within the security-based swap dealer definition, and such person must
register as a security-based swap dealer pursuant to Section 15F(a)(1). By contrast, persons that
fall within the statutory definitions of a broker and dealer in Sections 3(a)(4) and (5) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4) and (a)(5), are required to register with the Commission only
if they make use of the “mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to effect
any transactions in, or to induce or attempt to induce the purchase or sale of, any security.…”

it might be subject to duplicative and potentially conflicting requirements by the Commission
and a foreign jurisdiction. 193
Under the Commission’s proposal, as described more fully in the following subsections
of this release, a non-U.S. person 194 would be required to register as a security-based swap dealer
with the Commission pursuant to Section 15F(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 195 if the notional
amount of security-based swap positions connected with its security-based swap dealing
activity196 with U.S. persons (other than with foreign branches of U.S. banks) 197 or otherwise
conducted within the United States 198 exceeds the de minimis threshold in the security-based
swap dealer definition. 199 Thus, a non-U.S. person with a global security-based swap dealing
business, but whose positions connected with its security-based swap dealing activity with U.S
persons (other than with foreign branches of U.S. banks) or otherwise conducted within the
United States fall below the de minimis threshold, would not be required to register with the
Commission as a security-based swap dealer. 200 A U.S. person, by contrast, would be required
to count all of its security-based swap transactions (including transactions conducted through a
foreign branch), 201 conducted in a dealing capacity, toward the de minimis threshold to
determine whether it would be required to register as a security-based swap dealer with the
Commission pursuant to Section 15F(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. 202
As further discussed below, however, we are not proposing to require a non-U.S. person
engaged in security-based swap dealing activity to count a transaction with a non-U.S. person

conducted outside the United States toward its de minimis threshold, even if its performance (or
the performance of its counterparty) on the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S.
person. 203 In addition, in conformity with the position that the Commissions took in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 204 we are not proposing to require cross-border
security-based swap transactions between majority-owned affiliates to be considered when
determining whether a person is a security-based swap dealer. 205
In the following subsections, we first briefly discuss the Commission’s approach to the
registration of foreign brokers and dealers, as background, and the views of commenters on the
application of Title VII to cross-border activities, particularly as such views relate to securitybased swap dealing activity. Then we propose a rule regarding the application of the de minimis
exception to cross-border security-based swap dealing activity. 206 In order to give further
definition to this proposed rule, we are proposing rules defining a number of relevant terms,
including “U.S. person” 207 and “transaction conducted within the United States.” 208 We also are
proposing a rule excluding from a non-U.S. person’s de minimis calculation security-based swap
transactions entered into, in a dealing capacity, with a foreign branch of a U.S. bank. 209 In
addition, we are proposing a rule providing an exception from the aggregation requirement, in
the context of the security-based swap dealer definition, for affiliated groups with a registered

See Section III.B.8, infra. However, such U.S. guarantor may become a major security-based
swap participant by virtue of the guarantee it extends on the performance of the obligations under
the transaction. See Section IV.C.2, infra. In addition, a security-based swap entered into by a
non-U.S. person whose performance under such security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S.
person would be required to be reported and, in certain cases, publicly disseminated, under reproposed Regulation SBSR. See Section VIII.C, infra. Such security-based swap also may be
subject to the clearing and trade execution requirements in Title VII. See Sections IX and X,

requesting comment on the treatment of inter-affiliate and guaranteed transactions in the crossborder context for purposes of the de minimis threshold. 211
2. Background Discussion Regarding the Registration of Foreign Brokers and
Dealers
Under the Commission’s traditional approach to the registration of brokers and dealers
under the Exchange Act, registration and other requirements generally are triggered by a broker
or dealer physically operating in the United States, even if such activities are directed only to
non-U.S. persons outside the United States. 212 The Commission’s territorial approach also
generally requires broker-dealer registration by foreign brokers or dealers that, from outside the
United States, induce or attempt to induce securities transactions by persons within the United
States. 213 By contrast, the Commission has not required foreign entities to register as brokerdealers if they conduct their “sales activities” entirely outside the United States. 214
In addition to our territorial approach to registration of broker-dealers under the
Exchange Act, the Commission traditionally has taken an “entity” approach to the application of
regulation to registered broker-dealers. 215 Pursuant to this approach, we have not limited the
210

Proposed Rule 3a71-4 under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section III.B.8, infra.

211

See Section III.B.8, infra.

212

See Rule 15a-6 Adopting Release, 54 FR at 30016-17 (“As a policy matter, the Commission now
uses a territorial approach in applying the broker-dealer registration requirements to the
international operations of broker-dealers. Under this approach, all broker-dealers physically
operating within the United States that effect, induce, or attempt to induce any securities
transactions would be required to register as broker-dealers with the Commission, even if these
activities were directed only to foreign investors outside the United States.”); see also Proposed
Amendments to Rule 15a-6, 73 FR at 39182 (“Under this [territorial] approach, broker-dealers
located outside the United States that induce or attempt to induce securities transactions with
persons in the United States are required to register with the Commission, unless an exemption
applies”).

213

See Rule 15a-6 Adopting Release, 54 FR at 30016 (“[E]ven if section 30(b) [of the Exchange
Act] were read to incorporate a territorial approach, the Commission does not believe that section
30(b) would exempt from broker-dealer registration the activities suggested by the commenters.
In particular, directed selling efforts to U.S. investors in the United States hardly could be
considered activities not traversing the U.S. territorial limits. A broker-dealer operating outside
the physical boundaries of the United States, but using the U.S. mails, wires, or telephone lines to
trade securities with U.S. persons located in this country, would not be, in the words of section
30(b), ‘transact[ing] a business in securities without the jurisdiction of the United States.’”).

214

See Rule 15a-6 Adopting Release, 54 FR at 30016 (citing Exchange Act Release No. 25801, 53
FR at 23646 n.9, and accompanying text).

215

See Rule 15a-6 Adopting Release, 54 FR at 30017 (“Also, the Commission uses an entity
approach with respect to registered broker-dealers”); see also Proposed Amendments to Rule 15a6, 73 FR at 39182 (“Because this territorial approach applies on an entity level, not a branch

65

application of the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder, solely to the transactions
of such entities that result in the registration requirement. Instead, we have taken the position
that a registered broker-dealer is generally subject to registration and consequent substantive
requirements with respect to all of its securities activity, including the activity of its branches and
offices, regardless of whether the activity occurs in the United States or with U.S. persons. 216
For instance, under this approach, if a foreign broker-dealer is required to register with the
Commission as a result of conducting securities activity through a branch in the United States,
the registration requirements and the regulatory system governing U.S. broker-dealers, including
capital, margin, and recordkeeping requirements, would apply to the entire foreign broker-dealer
entity, including its head office, not just the U.S. branch. 217 By contrast, the Commission
traditionally has not extended our regulatory oversight of broker-dealers to the activities of their
corporate parents, subsidiaries, or other affiliates. 218
The Commission’s approach to registration and regulation of foreign broker-dealers thus
extends Commission oversight to the global activities of non-U.S.-based securities market
intermediaries that are registered broker-dealers because of their securities activities with U.S.
persons or that physically operate within the United States. 219 In recognition of the
internationalization of securities markets, however, the Commission has used available
exemptive authority to tailor rules and regulations to the specific circumstances of foreign
markets and market participants. For example, we used our exemptive authority under Section
15(a)(2) of the Exchange Act to adopt Rule 15a-6 under the Exchange Act (“Rule 15a-6”), 220
which provides limited exemptions from registration to foreign brokers or dealers engaging in
securities transactions, or offering to engage in securities transactions, within the United States
or with U.S. persons, subject to certain conditions. 221

level, if a foreign broker-dealer establishes a branch in the United States, broker-dealer
registration requirements would extend to the entire foreign broker-dealer entity.”).
216

As noted above, this is consistent with the approach we have taken in other contexts under the
federal securities laws. See note 158, supra.

217

See Rule 15a-6 Adopting Release, 54 FR at 30017.

218

See id. (“If the foreign broker-dealer establishes an affiliate in the United States, however, only
the affiliate must be registered as a broker-dealer; the foreign broker-dealer parent would not be
required to register.”); see also Proposed Amendments to Rule 15a-6, 73 FR at 39182. As
discussed in Section III.B.89, infra, this is consistent with the approach that the Commission is
proposing to take in the context of security-based swap dealer registration.

See Rule 15a-6 Adopting Release, 54 FR 30013. As discussed below, some commenters have
suggested that the Commission use an approach that would be modeled after the approach the
Commission has applied to foreign broker-dealers in Rule 15a-6 to address issues related to crossborder security-based swap transactions and foreign security-based swap dealers.

3. Comment Summary
(a) Market Participants
As noted above, various commenters expressed concerns about the “extraterritorial”
application of Title VII, and many of these commenters expressed particular concerns about the
possible extraterritorial application of security-based swap dealer regulation and registration
requirements. 222 In addition to concerns described above regarding the application of Title VII
to cross-border security-based swap activity, 223 commenters noted that the derivatives industry
functions in a global market and that new regulations pose the potential to disrupt this market if
they do not take into account the nature of the industry and the appropriate extraterritorial reach
of the regulations. 224 A consistent theme in many of these comment letters was the importance
of taking into account the principles of international comity in limiting the extraterritorial reach
of the proposed rules, including entering into coordination agreements with our foreign
regulatory counterparts on the jurisdictional reach of U.S. and foreign derivatives rules. 225
For example, a number of commenters recommended that the Commission take a
territorial approach in determining when a person engaging in security-based swap dealing

II, IIB Letter, ISDA Letter I, Japanese Banks Letter, JFSA Letter I, Newedge Letter, Rabobank
Letter, Société Générale Letter I, SIFMA Letter, Société Générale Letter II, Sullivan & Cromwell
Letter, and TCX Letter.

223

See Section II.B, supra.

224

See Section II.B, supra; see also ISDA Letter I at 17 (urging that the new regulations be
implemented so as to not distort the current global derivatives market that functions “within a
relatively level international playing field,” and noting that to address concerns related to
competition and conflicts between various regulators and regulations “[i]t is imperative that U.S.
and non-U.S. regulators must coordinate requirements to avoid unintended impediments to, and
fragmentation of, the derivatives markets”).

225

See, e.g., Davis Polk Letter II at 12 (recommending that in implementing Title VII regulations,
“the Commissions and the Federal Reserve should also give effect to the general jurisdictional
limits specified in Sections 722 and 772 of the Dodd-Frank Act in a manner that is consistent
with the principle of international comity evident in the statute and general legal principles
governing statutory construction pertaining to extraterritorial and international matters”); Société
Générale Letter I at 8, 11 (recommending U.S. and foreign counterparts to work toward a
memorandum of understanding on the jurisdictional reach of U.S. and EU derivatives rules and
warning that without cooperation between the U.S. and foreign regulators the result could be
“regulatory retaliation” whereby “the [s]waps market could devolve into regulatory chaos,
thereby increasing systemic risk”); Newedge Letter at 10-12 (expressing concern that requiring
foreign firms to register as swaps dealers or major swap participants in the U.S. “could result in
foreign regulators taking retaliatory action against U.S. firms engaging in swap activities with
non-U.S. persons domiciled within their physical borders” and that any regulation of foreign
firms not physically present in the United States that are already subject to foreign regulations is
unnecessary and would violate principles of international comity).

activity would be required to register with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer,
generally recommending registration of an entity for its security-based swaps dealing activity
from within the United States or with regard to its dealings with U.S. counterparties. 226 Several
commenters further suggested that a non-U.S. person’s de minimis amount of swap activities
with U.S. persons should not trigger security-based swap dealer registration. 227 Some
commenters expressed the view that the Commission’s cross-border framework should seek to
avoid imposing duplicative regulation and unnecessary cost on entities that are already regulated
in a foreign jurisdiction. 228 Some commenters have suggested that the Commission use an
approach that would be modeled after the approach the Commission has applied to foreign
226

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 11 (“The SEC has, in the past, plainly stated that it uses
a territorial approach in applying broker-dealer registration requirements to international
operations. Only those broker-dealers who induce, or attempt to induce, securities transactions
with persons in the United States would be required to register.”); MFA Letter II at 15-16
(commenting that the proposed security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap
participant rules do not appear to encompass trading outside of the U.S. between non-U.S. entities
or non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. entities, and adding that the rules also should not capture the nonU.S. affiliates of U.S. investment managers that advise offshore funds, or non-U.S.-domiciled
funds that have U.S. investment managers but trade in swaps referencing non-U.S. securities or
on a non-U.S. market, considering that foreign regulators will have jurisdiction over the non-U.S.
activities of U.S. entities); IIB Letter at 9 (urging the Commission to adopt an interpretation that a
“reference to a U.S. underlier or reference entity in a swap conducted outside the U.S. [is not] a
sufficient connection to the U.S. to subject either counterparty to U.S. Swap Dealer registration
requirements”); Newedge Letter at 2 (suggesting that foreign entities engaging in swaps
transactions “with US persons should not be required to register as swaps dealers or major swaps
participants in the US to the extent they are not physically located in the US and are subject to a
comparable regulatory regime”).

227

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 2, 8 (acknowledging that a foreign entity’s swaps
transactions with U.S. persons in excess of the de minimis amount, “if otherwise covered by the
definitions, [should] be required to register” as a swaps entity, but suggesting that swaps activities
with U.S. persons within “any de minimis amount authorized by the final rules and in transactions
with their U.S. affiliates for purposes of risk management” should not trigger swaps entity
registration); TCX Letter at 6 (“We are concerned that, should TCX become subject to swap
dealer registration notwithstanding the arguments presented above, the de minimis exception as
proposed in the [Intermediary Definitions Proposing Release] has been drafted too narrowly to be
of any practical use to TCXIM or to any other similarly-situated offshore entity with limited US
swaps business. In particular, we urge the Commission to clarify that an offshore entity’s swaps
with US counterparties, excluding non-US subsidiaries of US entities, must be counted when
determining if the de minimis exemption is available.”).

228

See, e.g., IIB Letter at 7 (suggesting that the “Commissions should establish a framework for
cross-border swap activities that preserves and leverages the strengths of existing market
practices and home country supervision and regulation” and “avoid a framework that is
duplicative, inefficient (for supervisors and market participants) and would result in unrealistic
extraterritorial supervisory responsibilities for the Commissions and potential fragmentation of
the derivatives markets”).

68

broker-dealers in Rule 15a-6 to address issues related to cross-border security-based swap
transactions and foreign security-based swap dealers. 229
For purposes of analyzing the appropriate definition of U.S. person in the security-based
swap dealer context, several commenters suggested that the Commission look to rules adopted
under the Securities Act and adopt a definition of U.S. person based on Regulation S under the
Securities Act (“Regulation S”). 230 Some commenters stated the view that under Regulation S,
only affiliates or branches located within the United States would be considered U.S. persons. 231
Some commenters argued that a foreign affiliate of a U.S. person and non-U.S. branches of a
U.S. bank should be treated as non-U.S. persons and, depending on their dealing activity, not be
required to register as security-based swap dealers because such entities may not have direct and
significant connection with, or effect on, U.S. commerce. 232 One commenter further argued that
a non-U.S. affiliate of a U.S. person, in its insolvency, is subject to separate resolution from its
parent, and thus should be treated as a non-U.S. entity. 233
Several commenters stated that a foreign branch or office of a U.S. person also should be
treated as a non-U.S. person, despite the fact that, as a few commenters acknowledged, foreign
branches of U.S. banks are not separate legal entities from their U.S. head office and typically
are not separately capitalized, although in some cases they may be subject to certain local capital
229

See, e.g., Davis Polk Letter I at 11 n.17 (“This model is similar to the mode of operation
permitted by Rule 15a-6 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, pursuant to which foreign
broker-dealers interface with U.S. customers under arrangements with affiliated or non-affiliated
broker-dealers without themselves registering as broker-dealers in the U.S.”); Cleary Letter IV at
22 (“Accordingly, as one alternative, we suggest that the Commissions adopt an approach that is
modeled on the Commissions’ existing regimes, permitting non-U.S. swap dealers to transact
with U.S. persons without registering in the U.S. if those transactions are intermediated by a U.S.registered swap dealer. This would be consistent with the approach adopted by the SEC under
Rule 15a-6 and prior interpretative precedents with respect to non-U.S. securities dealers.”).

230

See 17 CFR § 230.901(k). See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 2, 6-9; Davis Polk Letter I at note 6.

231

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 7 (stating that “Regulation S does not include as a ‘U.S. person’ the
non-U.S. branch or affiliate of a U.S. or non-U.S. person; only affiliates or branches located in the
U.S. are covered”); SIFMA Letter at 5 (stating that (“It is noteworthy that the Regulation S
definition of U.S. person does not include non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. persons or non-U.S.
branches of a U.S. bank….”).

232

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 2-3, 6-9 (arguing against the extraterritorial application
to foreign affiliates of a U.S. person, stating that when a foreign entity’s “counterparty to a
transaction is a non-U.S. affiliate of a U.S. person,” the transactions are “removed from the U.S.
stream of commerce. As a result, there is no ‘direct’ effect on U.S. commerce and it is highly
unlikely that the transactions would have any significant effect on U.S. commerce”); ISDA Letter
I at 11 (stating that “Non-U.S. entities (including non-U.S. affiliates and branches of U.S. banks)
should not be required to register as Dealers where they are conducting business with non-U.S.
counterparties.”).

233

See Cleary Letter IV at 7 (“The non-U.S. affiliate of a U.S. person is, in its own insolvency or
that of its parent, typically subject to separate resolution from its parent and other affiliates”).

or reserve maintenance requirements. 234 Several commenters suggested that broker-dealer
registration, not security-based swap dealer registration, may be more appropriate for a U.S.
branch, agency, or affiliate that acts as an agent of a non-U.S. person for security-based swaps
transactions. 235
Several commenters acknowledged concerns that persons may seek to book transactions
through non-U.S. branches or subsidiaries in an effort to evade the requirements of Title VII. 236
These commenters, however, urged that the Commissions not seek to address the potential for
evasion through an overbroad definition of a security-based swap dealer, noting that there are
legitimate business reasons for conducting security-based swap transactions with non-U.S.
persons through non-U.S. operations. 237
234

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 7 (arguing that “[a]lthough bank branches are not usually separately
capitalized,” they should not be considered U.S. persons because their operations are subject to
separate local licensing, examination, and books and records requirements); SIFMA Letter I at 15
n.37 (“We acknowledge that Title VII capital requirements cannot be applied at the branch-level
and, therefore, must be applied at the bank level.”); Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 16 (remarking
that “foreign branches have long been allowed to engage in a wider range of activities than are
their U.S. head offices and have benefitted from the presumption against applying U.S. law
extraterritorially” despite the fact that “foreign branches of U.S. banks are not corporate entities
separate and apart from their bank parents”).

235

See, e.g., IIB Letter at 10 (suggesting that a U.S.-based person who acts as an agent for a nonU.S. person in soliciting or negotiating security-based swap transactions with counterparties
located outside of the U.S. should register as a broker-dealer); Rabobank Letter at 3
(recommending that U.S. affiliates who help to arrange swaps transactions with U.S. persons
should “register as futures commissions merchants or introducing brokers, broker-dealers, or
swap dealers depending upon their respective roles in soliciting transactions, receiving customer
margin, performing delegated compliance functions, effecting transactions as an agent on
exchanges and swap execution facilities and in OTC markets, or clearing customer transactions”);
cf. Newedge Letter at 1-2 (asserting that broker-dealers and foreign entities subject to comparable
regulations who “engage principally in customer [security-based] swap facilitation activities”
should not be subject to security-based swap dealer and major security-based swaps participant
registration requirements because they already are “subject to stringent rules relating to capital,
risk, margin and other requirements by virtue of their registration status”; and alternatively,
suggesting that registrants who “execute swaps solely in response to customer orders and that
hedge each such transactions individually . . . should be exempt since, among other things, their
trading poses little or no risk to themselves, their customers or the markets generally.”).

236

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 10 (“We understand the concerns that the Commission
may have that persons would seek to book transactions through non-U.S. branches or subsidiaries
in order to evade the requirements of the CEA or Exchange Act.”).

237

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 9-10 (expressing understanding for the Commissions’
evasion concerns, but noting that U.S. companies have legitimate business reasons for
establishing their non-U.S. operations, including requirements in some foreign jurisdictions that
only local banks and local branches of foreign banks may engage in swap activities); Cleary

(b) Foreign Regulators
Foreign regulators have reached out to the Commission through correspondence and
bilateral and multilateral discussions to better understand the approach being considered by the
Commission, to express concern about the potential impact of potential approaches on their
markets, and to seek regulatory coordination. 238 One of the principal concerns of foreign
regulators is that the Commission would require foreign entities to register with the Commission
and subject them to regulatory requirements that are duplicative of, or potentially conflict with,
the requirements imposed by their home country or host country. 239 In their view, the
Commission’s application of Title VII requirements to foreign entities in jurisdictions that
commit to developing or have developed similar OTC derivatives regulations would fail to
acknowledge, under general principles of international comity, the effectiveness, suitability, and
scope of foreign regulatory regimes and place undue regulatory burdens on foreign entities that
conduct security-based swap business with U.S. persons. 240
Such concerns from foreign regulators include comments that U.S. regulators should not
ask financial institutions domiciled in their jurisdictions to register as security-based swap
dealers because this would create undesirable redundancies for those financial institutions that
are already regulated in the foreign jurisdiction. 241 Certain foreign regulators also argued that
the Commission should not regulate foreign subsidiaries of U.S. security-based swap dealers
because these entities would already be regulated by a foreign regulator. 242 Some foreign
and stating that the Commissions “should not adopt an extraterritorial regulatory framework
premised on the assumption that activities conducted outside the U.S. will be undertaken for the
purpose of evasion”).
238

4. Application of the De Minimis Exception to Cross-Border Security-Based Swap
Dealing Activity
The Commission recognizes the concerns raised by commenters regarding the potential
for imposing inconsistent or conflicting requirements on security-based swap dealers with global
operations, as well as their desire that the Commission take into account the principles of
international comity when applying Title VII to cross-border dealing activity. After considering
the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act and the scope of the provisions of Title VII covering securitybased swap dealers, in light of the global nature of the security-based swap market, the various
structures of dealing operations, and the views of commenters, the Commission is proposing an
approach to the application of the Title VII registration requirement to cross-border securitybased swap dealing activity that focuses on whether dealing conduct occurs with U.S. persons or
otherwise occurs within the United States.
Specifically, as explained below, the Commission is proposing to require a non-U.S.
person engaged in security-based swap dealing activity to register with the Commission as a
security-based swap dealer pursuant to Section 15F(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 244 if the notional
amount of security-based swap transactions connected with its dealing activity with U.S. persons
(other than with foreign branches of U.S. banks) 245 or otherwise conducted within the United
States 246 exceeds the de minimis threshold in the security-based swap dealer definition. 247 A
U.S. person engaged in security-based swap dealing activity would be required to count all
security-based swap transactions connected with its dealing activity toward the de minimis
threshold, including transactions conducted through a foreign branch. 248

entities should indeed be proportionate and take into [account] equivalent requirements in their
home jurisdiction.”).
243

See, e.g., BaFIN Letter at 1 (“Without questioning the registration of foreign banks, I suppose
that such registration will be limited to activities in relation with US counterparties and/or clients
and will not involve similar obligations to foreign banks as a whole”).

(a) Meaning of the Term “Person” in the Security-Based Swap Dealer Definition
As a preliminary matter, we note that, as the Commission discussed in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, the term “person” as used in the security-based swap dealer
definition should be interpreted to refer to a particular legal person. 249 Accordingly, a trading
desk, department, office, branch, or other discrete business unit that is not a separately organized
legal person would not be viewed as a security-based swap dealer (regardless of where located);
rather, the legal person of which it is a part would be the security-based swap dealer. 250
Similarly, the term “person” in the Commission’s rules implementing the de minimis exception
should be interpreted to refer to a particular legal person. 251
Thus, the security-based swap dealer definition would apply to the particular legal person
performing the dealing activity, even if that person’s dealing activity is limited to a trading desk
or discrete business unit. 252 The presumption is that a person who falls within the security-based
swap dealer definition is a dealer with regard to all of its security-based swap activities. 253 As a
249

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30624. Section 3(a)(9) of the Exchange
Act defines “person” as “a natural person, company, government, or political subdivision,
agency, or instrumentality of a government.” 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(9); see also proposed Rule 3a713(a)(7) under the Exchange Act (defining “U.S. person”), as discussed in Section III.B.5, infra.

250

This approach is consistent with the Commission’s discussion in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release regarding the entity-level designation of security-based swap dealers. 77 FR at
30624. It also generally is consistent with the Commission’s traditional entity approach to the
registration of broker-dealers, as discussed in Section III.B.2, supra.

251

See 17 CFR § 240.3a71-2; proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act.

252

Within an affiliated group of companies, only those legal persons that engage in dealing activities
will be designated as dealers; that designation will not be imputed to other non-dealer affiliates or
to the group as a whole. A single affiliate group may have multiple swap or security-based swap
dealers. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30624-25. But see Section
III.B.8, infra (discussing aggregation).

253

The definition of security-based swap dealer provides that a person may be designated as a
security-based swap dealer for a single type or class or category of security-based swaps or
activity, and not others. See Section 3(a)(71)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(71)(B); 17
CFR § 240.3a71-1(c) (“A person that is a security-based swap dealer in general shall be deemed
to be a security-based swap dealer with respect to each security-based swap it enters into,
regardless of the type, class, or category of the security-based swap or the person’s activities in
connection with the security-based swap, unless the Commission limits the person’s designation
as a security-based swap dealer to specified types, classes, or categories of security-based swaps
or specified activities of the person in connection with security-based swaps.”). See note 588,
infra.
Although the Commission is not proposing to designate non-U.S. persons as security-based swap
dealers in a limited capacity, the Commission’s proposed approach would limit the application of
certain transaction-level requirements to the “U.S. Business” of foreign security-based swap
dealers. See Section III.C.4, infra.

73

result, a legal person with a branch, agency, or office that is engaged in dealing activity in
connection with transactions above the de minimis threshold would be required to register as a
security-based swap dealer, even if the legal person’s dealing activity were limited to such
branch, agency, or office. By contrast, each affiliate of a security-based swap dealer would need
to separately consider whether it falls within the de minimis exception if that affiliate engages in
security-based swap dealing activity. 254
(b) Proposed Rule
We are proposing a rule identifying the types of security-based swap transactions that
should be included in a person’s calculation of the notional amount of security-based swap
transactions connected with dealing activity for purposes of determining whether the de minimis
exception excludes that dealer from the security-based swap dealer definition. 255 The proposed
rule confirms that all of a U.S. person’s security-based swap transactions conducted in a dealing
capacity would count toward its de minimis threshold, wherever those transactions are solicited,
negotiated, executed, or booked. 256 Although we recognize that some commenters have
suggested that the Commission should not require U.S. persons to include positions connected
with dealing activity conducted through foreign branches in calculating the amount of their
dealing activity, 257 we are not proposing to adopt this approach. The security-based swap
dealing activity of a foreign branch is activity of the U.S. legal person regardless of the role
played by the foreign branch or the location of the security-based swap dealing activity. We
believe that any dealing activity undertaken by a U.S. person occurs at least in part within the
United States and therefore warrants application of Title VII, regardless of where particular
dealing activity in connection with the transactions is conducted. 258 The security-based swap

See Section III.B.8, infra (discussing inter-affiliate transactions), and Section III.B.8, infra
(discussing aggregation).

255

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act. Appendix B to this release contains a table
that identifies whether a potential security-based swap dealer would be required to count a
transaction with a specific type of counterparty toward its de minimis threshold. The table in
Appendix B is only a summary of the rules and interpretations proposed in this release that is
provided for ease of reference; it does not supersede, and should be read in conjunction with, the
proposed rules and interpretations.

256

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act. As noted above, as used in this release,
“security-based swap dealing,” “security-based swap dealing activity,” “dealing activity,” and
related concepts have the meanings described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release,
77 FR 30596, unless otherwise indicated in this release. Such dealing activity is normally carried
out through interactions with counterparties or potential counterparties, which includes
solicitation, negotiation, or execution of a security-based swap.

257

See, e.g., Sullivan and Cromwell Letter, at 9-11.

258

See notes 231 and 234, supra. As noted in Section II.A.3 above, the security-based swap
transactions of U.S. persons, wherever entered into, give rise to ongoing obligations that may
affect the financial stability of the United States and thus present the type of risk that Title VII
was intended to address.

74

dealing activity of a U.S. person creates risk to the U.S. person and to the U.S. financial system,
because the risk of such transactions ultimately is borne by the U.S. person, even if the
transactions in connection with that dealing activity are conducted in part outside the United
States, and because the U.S. person is part of the U.S. financial system. 259 To achieve the
purposes of Title VII, including the reduction of systemic risk, we preliminarily believe that U.S.
persons that engage in security-based swap dealing activity through foreign branches should be
subject to the regulatory framework for dealers established by Congress in Title VII, even if they
deal exclusively with non-U.S. persons.
By contrast, a non-U.S. person would be required to consider only the security-based
swap transactions connected with its dealing activity with U.S. persons (other than foreign
branches of U.S. banks) 260 or otherwise conducted within the United States 261 for purposes of the
de minimis exception.262 Under this proposed approach, a non-U.S. person would be required to
calculate its security-based swap position for purposes of the de minimis threshold by adding
together the notional amount of transactions connected with dealing activity with U.S. persons
(other than foreign branches of U.S. banks) 263 or otherwise conducted within the United
States. 264 As a result, a foreign entity with a global security-based swap dealing business, but
259

These risk concerns may be greater for uncleared security-based swap than for cleared securitybased swaps where the U.S. person would not retain the credit risk of its counterparty; however,
cleared security-based swaps still represent an importation of risk into the U.S. financial system
when entered into by U.S. persons because in the context of cleared security-based swaps, the
U.S. persons would be exposed to the credit, financial, and operational risks of the clearing
agency.

260

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act (defining “U.S. person”), as discussed in
Section III.B.5; proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(1) under the Exchange Act (defining “foreign branch”),
as discussed in Section III.B.7, infra.

261

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act (defining “transaction conducted within the
United States”), as discussed in Section III.B.6, infra. Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(9) under the
Exchange Act defines “United States” as “the United States of America, its territories and
possessions, any States of the United States, and the District of Columbia.” The proposed
definition of “United States” is consistent with the definition of that term in other contexts in the
federal securities laws. See, e.g., 17 CFR § 230.902(l); 17 CFR § 240.15a-6(b)(6).

262

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act.

263

See Section III.B.7, infra (discussing the exception from the de minimis threshold for transactions
by foreign dealers with foreign branches of U.S. banks).

264

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act. For purposes of the de minimis
threshold, the U.S. person-status of a non-U.S. person’s counterparty would be relevant only at
the time of a transaction that arises out of the non-U.S. person’s dealing activity. Any change in a
counterparty’s U.S. person status after the transaction is executed would not affect that
transaction’s treatment for purposes of the de minimis exception, though it would affect the
treatment of any subsequent dealing transactions with that counterparty. See also Product
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 48286 (“If the material terms of a Title VII instrument
are amended or modified during its life based on an exercise of discretion and not through

75

whose transactions connected with its dealing activity with U.S. persons (other than foreign
branches of U.S. banks) or otherwise conducted within the United States fall under the de
minimis threshold, would not fall within the security-based swap dealer definition and, therefore,
would not be required to register as a security-based swap dealer. 265
This approach to the de minimis exception for non-U.S. persons engaged in cross-border
dealing activity preliminarily appears to us to focus appropriately on a non-U.S. person’s
security-based swap dealing activity in the United States. In addition, this proposed approach,
when combined with our broader approach to the registration and regulation of foreign securitybased swap dealers, appears to us to appropriately focus our oversight on those non-U.S. persons
engaged in security-based swap dealing activities that most directly impact the U.S. securitybased swap market and U.S. financial system and that, therefore, warrant the application of the
provisions of Title VII covering security-based swap dealers. 266
The Commission is not proposing, as some commenters have suggested, an approach
modeled on Rule 15a-6(a)(3), which would permit non-U.S. persons to conduct security-based
swap dealing activity with U.S. persons without registering with the Commission if such dealing
activity were intermediated by a registered security-based swap dealer. 267 The Commission
preliminarily believes that such an approach would not address the risk to the U.S. financial
predetermined criteria or a predetermined self-executing formula, the Commissions view the
amended or modified Title VII instrument as a new Title VII instrument”).
265

See 17 CFR § 240.3a71-2(a). The Commission notes that, to the extent that a non-U.S. person
does not conduct dealing activity within the United States or with U.S. persons (or to the extent
that the volume of positions connected with such dealing activity does not exceed the de minimis
threshold discussed below), it would not be required to register with the Commission as a
security-based swap dealer under Section 15F(a)(1) of the Exchange Act regardless of the volume
of non-dealing security-based swap transactions it has within the United States or with U.S.
persons. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30631. Such an entity still
would be subject to the major security-based swap participant thresholds with respect to its nondealing security-based swap transactions. However, once a non-U.S. person’s transactions with
U.S. persons (other than foreign branches of U.S. banks) or otherwise conducted within the
United States involve dealing activity that exceeds the de minimis threshold, that person would be
required to register as a security-based swap dealer and would be subject to the statutory
requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers for all of its security-based swap
transactions. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30645.

266

The Commission understands that entities such as foreign central banks, international financial
institutions, multilateral development banks, and sovereign wealth funds (“SWFs”) (together,
“foreign public sector financial institutions” or “FPSFIs”) rarely enter into security-based swap
transactions in a dealing capacity. As such, we believe that the proposed approach outlined in
this release would sufficiently address the dealer registration concerns of these entities. The
Commission is soliciting comment on whether our proposal sufficiently addresses the concerns of
FPSFIs and whether our understanding of the security-based swap activity of such entities is
accurate. See also Section III.B.5(b)iv, infra (discussing international organizations).

76

system by dealing activity of non-U.S. persons within the United States or with U.S. persons. As
a dealer, the non-U.S. person would be the party to the security-based swap transaction and,
therefore, the party that bears the financial risk of such transaction and whose financial integrity
is of primary concern to the Commission. This concern is heightened by the fact, noted above,
that, unlike most other securities transactions, security-based swap transactions give rise to
ongoing obligations between the transaction counterparties. 268 Under the alternative suggested,
the important financial responsibility requirements that Title VII imposes on security-based swap
dealers would not apply to the non-U.S. person with respect to that transaction. Instead, the
intermediating registered security-based swap dealer would be subject to the financial
responsibility rules with respect to the transaction, but since it would not be a party to, and would
not bear the financial risk of, the security-based swap transaction, it would not bear the ongoing
financial risk of such transaction. As a result, the financial responsibility requirements imposed
on the intermediating dealer would not address the dealing risk posed by the non-U.S. person in
this context. 269
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed rule regarding the
application of the de minimis exception to U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons, including the
following:
•

Should the proposed rule limit the de minimis test to the notional amount of a U.S.
person’s positions connected with its dealing activity involving transactions with
other U.S. persons or otherwise conducted within the United States? For example,
should the proposed rule be altered to provide that U.S. banks would not include the
notional amount of transactions connected with the dealing activity of their foreign
branches in the de minimis calculation, rather than counting these transactions against
the de minimis threshold as required under the proposed approach? Why or why not?

•

Should the proposed rule require non-U.S. persons to count transactions with the
foreign branches of U.S. banks towards their de minimis calculations? Why or why
not?

•

Should the proposed rule follow an approach modeled on Rule 15a-6(a)(3), which
would permit non-U.S. persons to conduct security-based swap dealing activity
within the United States without registering with the Commission if those

268

See Section II.A.3, supra.

269

The Commission also is not proposing a dealer-to-dealer exception modeled on Rule 15a6(a)(4)(i) (providing that a foreign broker or dealer shall be exempt from the registration
requirements of Section 15(a)(l) or 15B(a)(l) of the Exchange Act to the extent that the foreign
broker or dealer effects transactions in securities with or for, or induces or attempts to induce the
purchase or sale of any security by “[a] registered broker or dealer, whether the registered broker
or dealer is acting as principal for its own account or as agent for others, or a bank acting in a
broker or dealer capacity as permitted by U.S. law”).

77

transactions were intermediated by a registered U.S. security-based swap dealer? If
so, what compliance obligations, if any, should the unregistered non-U.S. person be
subject to? What obligations should the U.S. security-based swap dealer be subject to
with respect to such intermediated transactions, particularly with respect to capital,
margin, and segregation requirements? How would this approach deal with risk
concerns, especially with any security-based swaps not subject to clearing?

270

•

Should the proposed rule follow an approach modeled on Rule 15a-6(a)(4)(i), which
would permit non-U.S. persons to conduct security-based swap dealing activity
within the United States without registering with the Commission if those
transactions were with a registered U.S. security-based swap dealer? If so, what
conditions, if any, should the Commission impose on such an exception?

•

Should non-U.S. persons acting in a dealing capacity be required to count transactions
entered into with registered security-based swap dealers toward their de minimis
threshold? Why or why not? If non-U.S. persons are not required to count securitybased swap transactions, conducted in a dealing capacity, with registered securitybased swap dealers, should U.S. persons be required to count security-based swap
transactions, conducted in a dealing capacity, with registered security-based swap
dealers? If not, why not? If so, why?

•

The CFTC has proposed an interpretation that would require a non-U.S. person to
consider the aggregate notional value of its swap dealing transactions (or any swap
dealing transactions of its affiliates under common control) where the non-U.S.
person’s obligations are guaranteed by a U.S. person. 270 Should the proposed rule
require a non-U.S. person whose security-based swap transactions are guaranteed by
a U.S. person to count all of its security-based swap dealing transactions that are
guaranteed by a U.S. person toward the de minimis threshold, even if they are not
entered into with U.S. persons or otherwise conducted within the United States?

•

Should the proposed rule require counting against the de minimis threshold the
notional amount of a non-U.S. person’s transactions entered into in its dealing
capacity within the United States or with a U.S. person? Should a non-U.S. person be
required instead to aggregate the total worldwide notional amount of its securitybased swap transactions entered into in a dealing capacity, regardless of the
geographic location of the dealing activity or the counterparty’s status as a U.S.
person if it engages in any dealing transactions with U.S. persons? Why or why not?

•

What circumstances, if any, would justify requiring a non-U.S. person to register with
the Commission if its dealing activity arising from its transactions with non-U.S.
persons outside the United States would exceed the de minimis threshold if it had
been conducted within the United States or with U.S. persons but the non-U.S. person

See CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR at 41221.

78

enters into transactions within the United States or with U.S. persons solely in a nondealing capacity?
•

What circumstances would justify following a different territorial approach that
would treat transactions connected with the dealing activity conducted by a U.S.
person through its foreign locations with non-U.S. persons as outside the United
States and not required to be counted against such U.S. person’s de minimis
threshold?

•

Does the Commission’s proposed approach adequately address the concerns of
FPSFIs? Is our understanding of the security-based swap activity of FPSFIs
accurate? If not, please explain.

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to apply the de minimis
exception in the cross-border context? How would the proposed application of the de
minimis exception to U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons affect the competitiveness of
U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States as well as in foreign
jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market participants at a
competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed
approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please explain. What
other measures should the Commission consider to implement the de minimis
exception? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects of
alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?
5. Proposed Definition of “U.S. Person”
(a) Introduction

The proposed rule defining “U.S. person” would identify a person’s status as a U.S.
person for purposes of applying the calculation for the de minimis exception in the cross-border
context. 271 The proposed definition of U.S. person generally follows an approach to defining
U.S. person similar to that used by the Commission in other contexts. 272 Specifically, the
proposed rule would define U.S. person to mean any of the following:
271

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act. The definition of “U.S. person” also is used
in other proposed rules and interpretive guidance discussed below. See Sections IV - XI, infra.

272

See, e.g., Regulation S Adopting Release, 55 FR at 18308 (“The Regulation adopted today is
based on a territorial approach to Section 5 of the Securities Act.”). Although the proposed rule
generally follows the same approach as Regulation S, the Commission preliminarily believes that
it is necessary to depart from Regulation S in certain respects. See Section III.B.10, infra
(comparing the proposed definition of “U.S.” person with the definition of “U.S. person” in
Regulation S). Notably, neither the Exchange Act nor Rule 15a-6 contains a definition of U.S.
person.
The proposed definition of U.S. person is similar to the definition of U.S. person that the CFTC
staff provided its October 12, 2012 no-action letter. See Time-Limited No-Action Relief: Swaps

79

•

Any natural person resident in the United States;

•

Any partnership, corporation, trust, or other legal person organized or incorporated
under the laws of the United States 273 or having its principal place of business in the
United States; or

•

Any account (whether discretionary or non-discretionary) of a U.S. person. 274

The proposed rule also would provide that the term “U.S. person” would not include the
following international organizations: the International Monetary Fund (“IMF”), the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank,
the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the United Nations, and their
agencies and pension plans, and any other similar international organizations, their agencies and
pension plans. 275
We preliminarily believe that the proposed definition of U.S. person would achieve three
objectives necessary to effective application of Title VII in the cross-border context. First, it
would identify those types of individuals or entities that, by virtue of their location within the
United States or their legal or other relationship with the United States, are likely to impact the
U.S. market even if they transact with security-based swap dealers that are not U.S. persons. 276
Second, it would identify those types of individuals or entities that, by virtue of their location
within the United States or their legal or other relationship with the United States, are part of the
U.S. security-based swap market and should receive the protections of Title VII. Third, it would
permit us to identify dealing entities that most likely would be active in the U.S. security-based
swap market and whose dealing activity most likely would pose a risk to the U.S. financial
system by virtue of their counterparties’ resident or domicile status.

Final CFTC Cross-Border Exemptive Order, 78 FR at 862 (indicating that for purposes of its
temporary conditional relief the CFTC is taking a similar approach to the U.S. person definition
as that set forth in the October 12, 2012 no-action letter).
273

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(9) under the Exchange Act defines “United States” as “the United
States of America, its territories and possessions, any States of the United States, and the District
of Columbia.”

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7)(i) under the Exchange Act.

275

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7)(ii) under the Exchange Act.

276

As noted in Section II.A.3 above, the security-based swap transactions of U.S. persons give rise
to ongoing liability that is borne by a person located within the United States and thus are likely
to pose the types of financial stability risks to U.S. financial system that Title VII was intended to
address. The security-based swap activity of U.S. persons occurs, at least in part, within the
United States.

80

Because of the nature of the risks posed by security-based swaps, which are borne by the
entire corporate entity even if the transaction is entered into by a specific trading desk, office, or
branch of such entity, consistent with the Commission’s approach to the meaning of “person” in
the security-based swap dealer definition, as discussed above, we are proposing to define the
term “U.S. person” to include the entire entity, including its branches and offices that may be
located in a foreign jurisdiction. 277 Thus, under this approach, the term “U.S. person” would be
interpreted to include any foreign trading desk, office, or branch of an entity that is organized
under U.S. law or whose principal place of business is located in the United States. 278
(b) Discussion
i.

Natural Persons

Under the proposed rule, any natural person resident in the United States would be a U.S.
person, regardless of that individual’s citizenship status. 279 Individuals resident abroad, on the
other hand, would not be treated as U.S. persons, even if they possess U.S. citizenship. 280 We
preliminarily believe that natural persons residing within the United States who engage in
security-based swap transactions may raise the types of concerns intended to be addressed by
Title VII, including those related to transparency and customer protection. 281 We also note that
this approach is generally consistent with the approach we have taken in prior rulemakings
relating to the cross-border application of certain similar regulatory requirements. 282 Moreover,
any risk to such person arising from its security-based swap activity may manifest itself most
directly within the United States, where a significant portion of its commercial and legal
relationships exist because that is where its residency is (unlike a U.S. citizen resident abroad).
ii.

Corporations, Organizations, Trusts, and Other Legal Persons

Under the proposed rule, any partnership, corporation, trust, or other legal person
organized or incorporated under the laws of the United States 283 or having as its principal place
of business in the United States would be a U.S. person. 284 We have previously looked to an

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7)(i)(A) under the Exchange Act.

280

This proposed approach to treating natural persons as U.S. persons based on residency, rather
than citizenship, differs from the proposed approach to legal entities, such as partnerships and
corporations, discussed below.

entity’s place of organization or incorporation to determine whether it is a U.S. person in
adopting rules under the federal securities laws, 285 and we preliminarily believe that it is also
appropriate to do so in the context of Title VII. We preliminarily believe that the decision of a
corporation, trustee, or other entity to organize under the laws of the United States indicates a
degree of involvement in the U.S. economy or legal system that warrants ensuring that its
security-based swap activity is subject to the requirements of Title VII. 286
Similarly, we believe that the proposed definition should ensure that Title VII applies to
entities that are organized or incorporated in a jurisdiction outside the United States if they have
their principal place of business in the United States. 287 Any risk to such entities arising from
their security-based swap activity is likely to manifest itself most directly within the United
States, where a significant portion of their commercial and legal relationships would be likely to
exist. Moreover, focusing exclusively on whether an entity is organized or incorporated in the
United States could encourage some entities that are currently organized or incorporated in the
United States to incorporate in a non-U.S. jurisdiction to avoid the costs of complying with Title
VII while maintaining their principal place of business—and thus in all likelihood, the risks
arising from their security-based swap transactions—within the United States. To prevent this
possibility, we are proposing to define “U.S. person” to include entities that are organized or
incorporated abroad but have their principal place of business within the United States. 288
An entity’s status as a U.S. person under the proposed rule would be determined at the
legal entity-level and thus apply to the entire legal entity, including any foreign operations that
are part of the U.S. legal entity. 289 Consistent with this entity-level approach, a foreign branch,
285

See Regulation S Adopting Release, 55 FR at 18316.

286

Under this prong of the proposed rule, “special entities,” as defined in Section 15F(h)(2)(C) of the
Exchange Act, would be U.S. persons because they are legal persons organized under the laws of
the United States. Section 15F(h)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act defines the term “special entity” as
“(i) a Federal agency; (ii) a State, State agency, city, county, municipality, or other political
subdivision of a State; (iii) any employee benefit plan, as defined in Section 3 of the Employee
Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1002; (iv) any governmental plan, as defined
in Section 3 of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, 29 U.S.C. 1002; or (v)
any endowment, including an endowment that is an organization described in Section 501(c)(3)
of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986.” 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(2)(C).

287

For example, a business may be incorporated under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction but
nonetheless have its business operations, including its home office, in the United States.

288

As discussed in Section III.B.6 below, the Commission also is proposing to require non-U.S.
persons that conduct security-based swap transactions within the United States, in a dealing
capacity, to count such transactions toward their de minimis threshold. In addition, the
Commission is proposing to subject security-based swap transactions that are conducted within
the United States to certain transaction-level requirements in Title VII in connection with
reporting and dissemination, clearing, and trade execution. See Sections VIII - X, infra.

289

In principle, Regulation S looks to the location of the branch rather than the jurisdiction in which
the entity is organized or incorporated in determining whether the branch is a U.S. person. See 17
CFR §§ 230.902(k)(1)(v) and (2)(v). Thus, under Regulation S, the foreign branch of a U.S. bank

82

agency, or office of a U.S. person would be treated as a U.S. person under the proposed
definition. 290 As the Commission noted in proposing Regulation SBSR, “[b]ecause a branch or
office has no separate legal existence under corporate law, the branch or office would be an
integral part of the U.S. person itself.” 291 In other words, because a branch or office is merely an
extension of the head office, not a separately incorporated or organized legal entity, we
preliminarily believe that it lacks the legal independence to be considered a non-U.S. person for
purposes of Title VII if its head office is a U.S. person. We preliminarily believe a wholesale
exclusion from the requirements of Title VII for a foreign branch, agency, or office of a U.S.
person is not warranted with respect to its security-based swap transactions because the legal
obligations and economic risks associated with the transactions directly affect a U.S. person, of
which the branch, agency, or office is merely a part.
Under the proposed definition, the status of an entity as a U.S. person would have no
bearing on whether separately incorporated or organized legal entities in its affiliated corporate
group are U.S. persons. Accordingly, a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. person would not be a U.S.
person by virtue of its relationship with its U.S. parent. Similarly, a foreign entity with a U.S.
subsidiary would not be a U.S. person simply by virtue of its relationship with its U.S.
subsidiary. 292 The Commission preliminarily believes that it is appropriate to treat each affiliate
separately because of the distinct legal status of each of the affiliates. 293
iii.

Accounts of U.S. Persons

Consistent with the proposed definition’s focus on the location of the person bearing the
actual risk arising from the security-based swap transaction, the proposed definition of U.S.
person would include any accounts (whether discretionary or not) of U.S. persons. 294 Such
accounts would be U.S. persons regardless of whether the entity at which the account is held or
maintained is a U.S. person. Conversely, accounts of non-U.S. persons would not be U.S.
persons solely because they are held by a U.S. financial institution or other entity that is itself a

is not treated as a U.S. person while the U.S. branch of a foreign bank is treated as a U.S. person.
Under subsection (a)(7)(ii) of proposed Rule 3a71-3 under the Exchange Act, the foreign branch
of a U.S. bank would be treated as part of a U.S. person. See Section III.B.10, infra (discussing
the proposed definition of “U.S. person” with the definition of “U.S. person” in Regulation S).
290

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act.

291

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75240 (“The Commission intends for this
proposed definition [of U.S. person] to include branches and offices of U.S. persons”). The
Commission is re-proposing Regulation SBSR in this release, including its definition of U.S.
person. See Section VIII, infra.

See Section III.B.8, infra.

83

U.S. person. 295 In our view, the purposes of Title VII require that its provisions apply to the
person that actually bears the risks arising from the security-based swap transaction. 296 For this
reason, we preliminarily believe that the status of accounts, wherever located, should turn on
whether any owner of the account is itself a U.S. person, 297 and not on the status of the fiduciary
or other person managing the account, the discretionary or non-discretionary nature of the
account, or the status of the entity at which the account is held or maintained. 298 Thus any
account of a U.S. person would be a U.S. person for purposes of Title VII.
iv.

International Organizations

In addition to identifying the persons that fall within the U.S. person definition, the
proposed rule also provides a list of specific international organizations that do not fall within
such definition. 299 This list includes “the International Monetary Fund, the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Asian
Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the United Nations, and their agencies and
pension plans, and any other similar international organizations, their agencies and pension
plans.” 300 Although these organizations may have headquarters in the United States, the
Commission preliminarily believes that most of their membership and financial activity are
outside the United States. Thus, based on the nature of these entities as international

295

An account of a non-U.S. person and, therefore, not a “U.S. person” under proposed Rule 3a713(a)(7) under the Exchange Act, may nevertheless engage in “transactions conducted within the
United States,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act. For example,
if a non-U.S. person executes a security-based swap from an office located in the United States
that security-based swap would be a “transaction conducted within the United States” even
though neither party would be a “U.S. person.” Similarly, if a non-U.S. person solicits a
counterparty within the United States to enter into a security-based swap transaction, that
transaction would be a “transaction conducted within the United States,” regardless of whether
both counterparties were non-U.S. persons. See Section III.B.6, infra.

296

The same approach would apply to an account of a partnership, corporation, trust, or other legal
person (e.g., a fund or a special-purpose investment vehicle) to enter into a security-based swap.
If the partnership, corporation, trust, or other legal person were a U.S. person, the account would
be a U.S. person.

297

For purposes of this definition, the term “account” includes both discretionary accounts and nondiscretionary accounts. See proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7)(i)(C) under the Exchange Act.

298

This proposed approach is consistent with the treatment of managed accounts in the context of the
major security-based swap participant definition, whereby the swap or security-based swap
positions in client accounts managed by asset managers or investment advisers are not attributed
to such entities for purposes of the major participant definitions, but rather are attributed to the
beneficial owners of such positions based on where the risk associated with those positions
ultimately lies. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30690.

organizations the Commission is proposing not to treat them as U.S. persons for purposes of
Title VII. 301
(c) Conclusion
In short, by following a territorial approach, the Commission preliminarily believes that
the proposed definition of U.S. person describes the types of individuals and entities residing,
organized, or conducting business within the United States, and the types of accounts that should
be designated as U.S. persons for purposes of the proposed rule regarding application of the de
minimis exception to security-based swap dealers. 302
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed definition of “U.S.
person,” including the following:
•

Does the proposed definition of “U.S. person” appropriately address the concerns of
security-based swap dealer regulation under Title VII?

•

Does the proposed definition appropriately identify all individuals or entities that
should be designated as U.S. persons? Is the proposed definition too narrow or too
broad? Why? Do the proposed criteria for determining whether an entity is a U.S.
person effectively describe the types of counterparties that are relevant to identifying
the transactions a security-based swap dealer must count when calculating its de
minimis threshold for purposes of determining whether it is required to register as a
security-based swap dealer and comply with the requirements of Title VII? Does the
proposed definition appropriately identify the types of entities that should be entitled
to the protections afforded to counterparties of security-based swap dealers under
Title VII?

•

Does the proposed definition appropriately treat natural persons residing in the United
States as U.S. persons? Should certain categories of persons residing in the United
States be excluded from the definition of U.S. person? Should certain categories of
persons (such as U.S. citizens or permanent residents) residing abroad be included in
the definition of U.S. person? Please explain why excluding or including particular
categories of natural persons would be consistent with and further the objectives of
dealer regulation under Title VII.

301

Regulation S also specifies that these international organizations are not considered U.S. persons,
but Regulation S also considers affiliates of such organizations to be non-U.S. persons. See 17
CFR § 230.902(k)(2)(vi). The Commission is soliciting comment on whether affiliates of such
organizations should be treated as non-U.S. persons under proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the
Exchange Act. Currently, under the proposed rule, an affiliate of one of these international
organizations would have to separately consider its U.S. person-status.

302

As discussed below, the proposed definition is used in other proposed rules and interpretive
guidance in the release. See Sections IV - XI, infra.

•

Is the proposed approach to the U.S. person status of natural persons based on
residency, rather than citizenship, appropriate? In particular, is the proposed
approach to natural persons, which differs from the proposed approach to legal
entities, such as partnerships and corporations, appropriate in light of the fact that, as
the Commission understands, natural persons rarely enter into security-based swaps?

•

Does incorporation or organization under the laws of the United States appropriately
define the types of entities (both for-profit and non-profit) that should be treated as
U.S. persons under Title VII? Is it appropriate to define an entity as a U.S. person if
it has its principal place of business in the United States, even if it is incorporated or
organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction? Why or why not?

•

Does the proposed rule adequately address the risk of evasion or avoidance of Title
VII requirements? Are there entities incorporated or organized under foreign law that
should be defined as a U.S. person under the proposed rule that are not currently so
defined? For example, should an entity incorporated or organized under foreign law
but whose security-based swap transactions are guaranteed by a U.S. person be
defined as a U.S. person? Why or why not? Should a foreign entity that conducts
security-based swap dealing activity predominantly with U.S. persons or within the
United States be defined as a U.S. person? If so, why?

•

Is it appropriate to determine the U.S. person status of a corporation or organization
on an entity-wide basis? Why or why not? Should foreign branches, offices, or
agencies of U.S. persons be U.S. persons? Why or why not? What distinguishes
transactions mediated or entered into by a foreign branch of a U.S. bank from
transactions entered into by the head office of such U.S. bank for purposes of Title
VII regulation?

•

What, if any, competitive concerns would be raised by defining foreign branches,
offices, or agencies of U.S. persons as non-U.S. persons? Please explain the
mechanism of any competitive effects. For example, would particular business
structures become unworkable under this approach and what would be the relevant
impact? If so, please explain possible alternatives and their relative competitiveness.

•

Should the proposed rule include within the definition of U.S. person foreign
affiliates of U.S. persons? Should other factors be taken into account in determining
the status of such affiliated entities, such as, for example, whether performance on the
security-based swap obligations of the foreign entity is guaranteed by a U.S. affiliate?
Should a foreign entity with performance on its security-based swap obligations
guaranteed by a U.S. affiliate, where such foreign entity’s security-based swap
dealing activity is conducted predominantly or exclusively with non-U.S. persons, be
included within the definition of U.S. person? Why or why not?

•

Should a foreign branch of a U.S. parent, including a foreign branch of a U.S. bank,
be included in the definition of “U.S. person” for all purposes under Title VII? Why
or why not?

Should a majority-owned subsidiary of a U.S. parent, regardless of whether the
subsidiary has financial guarantees from the U.S. parent, be included in the definition
of “U.S. person” for purposes of Title VII? Why or why not?

•

Should an account of one U.S. person and one or more non-U.S. persons be treated as
a U.S. person? Should the Commission instead establish a de minimis threshold
amount or otherwise allows some U.S. person ownership without triggering U.S.
person status for the account? If so, how?

The CFTC has proposed a definition of U.S. person that would include a legal entity
that is directly or indirectly majority-owned by one or more U.S. persons and in
which such person(s) bears unlimited responsibility for the obligations and liabilities
of the legal entity (other than a limited liability company or limited liability
partnership where partners have limited liability). 303 Should the Commission adopt a
similar approach? If so, why? How should majority ownership be determined? Is
majority ownership the appropriate test? If not, should some other percentage test be
used (e.g., 25% or some other measure of control)? Are there operational or other
difficulties in implementing such an approach?

•

Should entities, whatever their place of domicile, that guarantee the performance of
U.S. person counterparties to security-based swaps themselves be deemed U.S.
persons? Why or why not? How would treating such indirect counterparties to
security-based swaps as U.S. persons affect the application of Title VII rules?

•

Is the proposed definition’s focus on the status of the person bearing the actual risk in
the transaction (e.g., looking at the status of the account owner rather than the person
with authority to direct the investment decisions) appropriate in determining whether
the person is a U.S. person?

•

The CFTC has proposed a definition of U.S. person that would include any pension
plan for the employees, officers or principals of a legal entity with its principal place
of business inside the United States. Should the Commission adopt a similar
approach? If so, what categories of entities would or would not be U.S. persons when
compared to the Commission’s proposed approach? How is including or excluding
such entities, as applicable, from the definition of U.S. person consistent with and in
furtherance of the objectives of Title VII?

•

Does the proposed rule appropriately address the treatment of certain international
organizations with respect to the definition of U.S. person? Should any or all of the
organizations specifically identified in the proposed rule be treated as U.S. persons?
If so, why? Are there other similarly situated international organizations that should
also be explicitly excluded from the U.S. person definition? Should the affiliates of

Should the proposed definition expressly exclude from the definition of U.S. person
any other entity or category of entities? If so, which ones and why?

The CFTC has proposed a definition of U.S. person that would include any
commodity pool, pooled account, or collective investment vehicle (whether or not it

definition that includes any investment fund, commodity pool, pooled account, or
collective investment vehicle of which a majority ownership is held by one or more
U.S. persons, even if such entity is not incorporated or organized under the laws of
the United States, or does not have its principal place of business in the United
States? If so, why and how should majority ownership be determined? Is majority
ownership the appropriate test? If not, should some other percentage test be used
(e.g., 25% or some other measure of control)? Are there operational or other
difficulties in implementing such an approach?

•

The CFTC has proposed a definition of U.S. person that would include any

Advisers Act”)? If so, why?

Commission define it?
6. Proposed Definition of “Transaction Conducted Within the United States”
We are proposing a definition of “transaction conducted within the United States” to
identify security-based swap transactions that involve activities in the United States that the
Commission preliminarily believes would warrant requiring a non-U.S. person to count such
transactions toward its de minimis threshold in the security-based swap dealer definition. 307
Under the proposed rule, “transaction conducted within the United States” would be defined to
mean any “security-based swap transaction that is solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked
within the United States, by or on behalf of either counterparty to the transaction, regardless of
the location, domicile, or residence status of either counterparty to the transaction.” 308 It would
not, however, include a transaction conducted through a foreign branch of a U.S. bank, for
reasons discussed below. 309
As noted above, dealing activity is normally carried out through interactions with
counterparties or potential counterparties that include solicitation, negotiation, execution, or
booking of a security-based swap. 310 Engaging in any of these activities within the United
States, as part of dealing activity, would involve a level of involvement in a security-based swap
306

This focus would be generally consistent with the focus of the definition of “principal office and
place of business” in the Investment Advisers Act, where it is defined as “the executive office of
the investment adviser from which the officers, partners, or managers of the investment adviser
direct, control, and coordinate the activities of the investment adviser.” 17 CFR § 275.222-1(b).

307

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act. The proposed definition of “transaction
conducted within the United States” also is used in other places in the release in the context of our
proposed application of Title VII requirements in the cross-border context. See Sections VIII - X,
infra. The proposed definition of “transaction conducted within the United States,” and related
discussion in this release, is not intended to apply outside of the scope of the proposals set forth in
this release, unless otherwise indicated. Accordingly, it thus does not affect other rights or
obligations of parties under the Exchange Act or the federal securities laws generally.

308

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5)(i) under the Exchange Act. The use of the term “counterparty” in the
proposed rule is intended to refer to the direct counterparty to the security-based swap
transaction, not a party that provides a guarantee on the performance of the direct counterparty to
the transaction. See Section VIII.A, infra (distinguishing between direct and indirect
counterparties).

309

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii) under the Exchange Act. See proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4) under
the Exchange Act (defining “transaction conducted through a foreign branch”), as discussed in
Section III.B.7, infra.

310

See Section II.B.2(b), supra. More generally, solicitation, negotiation, execution, and booking are
activities that represent key stages in a potential or completed security-based swap transaction.
As discussed below, transactions conducted within the United States, regardless of whether in a
dealing or non-dealing capacity, would generally be subject to requirements relating to reporting
and dissemination, clearing, and trade execution. See Sections VIII - X, infra.

89

transaction that the Commission believes should require such transaction to count toward a
potential security-based swap dealer’s de minimis threshold. The proposed rule, therefore, is
designed to identify for market participants the key aspects of a security-based swap transaction
that the Commission believes should trigger security-based swap dealer registration
requirements.
By contrast, we are not proposing to include either submitting a transaction for clearing
in the United States or reporting a transaction to an SDR in the United States as activity that
would cause a transaction to be conducted within the United States under the proposed rule, nor
are we proposing to treat activities related to collateral management (e.g., exchange of margin
payments) that may occur in the United States or involve U.S. banks or custodians as activity
conducted within the United States for these purposes. We recognize that submission of a
transaction for clearing to a CCP located in the United States poses risk to the U.S. financial
system, and collateral management plays a vital role in an entity’s financial responsibility
program and risk management. However, we preliminarily believe that none of these activities,
by themselves, involves activities conducted between a potential dealer and its counterparty that
may be characterized as dealing activity, although clearing and collateral management services
may be offered in conjunction with dealing activity.
Under the rule adopted by the Commission, jointly with the CFTC, a potential securitybased swap dealer is required to consider the security-based swap positions “connected with” the
dealing activity in which the potential dealer—or any other entity controlling, controlled by or
under common control with the potential dealer—engages over the course of the immediately
preceding 12 months (or following the effective date of final rules implementing Section
3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68), if that period is less than 12 months). 311 By
incorporating the definition of a “transaction conducted within the United States” into the
proposed rule applying the de minimis exception in the cross-border context, 312 the Commission
is proposing that non-U.S. persons engaged in cross-border dealing activity include in their de
minimis calculations any security-based swap transaction that is connected with 313 an entity’s
dealing activity with another non-U.S. person if a U.S. branch or office of either counterparty, or
an associated person 314 of either counterparty—including any affiliate and any associated person
of any affiliate, or a third party agent, located within the United States—is directly involved in
the transaction. Thus, a non-U.S. person engaged in security-based swap dealing activity would
be required to count toward its de minimis threshold any dealing transaction entered into with
another non-U.S. person that was conducted in the United States, whether the transaction falls
311

See 17 CFR § 240.3a71-2(a)(1).

312

See proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act.

313

The de minimis exception threshold is computed based on the notional amount of an entity’s
security-based swap positions, connected with its dealing activity, not transactions that are merely
solicited. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30630.

314

See Section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(70) (defining “person associated with
a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant”); see also note 472, infra.

90

within the “conducted within the United States” definition through such non-U.S. person’s own
activity (or that of an agent within the United States), or that of its non-U.S. person counterparty
(or such counterparty’s agent). 315 Similarly, if any transaction connected with a non-U.S.
person’s dealing activity is executed within the United States, the non-U.S. person would be
required to count that transaction toward its de minimis threshold. 316
We recognize that many of a non-U.S. person’s transactions conducted within the United
States that arise out of its dealing activity may also be transactions with U.S. persons, and thus
would already be counted for purposes of the de minimis threshold. However, requiring nonU.S. persons to include in their de minimis calculations only transactions with U.S. person
counterparties would enable such persons to engage in significant amounts of security-based
swap dealing activity within the United States without Commission oversight as a security-based
swap dealer, so long as the dealing activity were limited to non-U.S. persons. 317 This would be
the case if the potential dealer operated out of a branch, office, or affiliate, or utilized a thirdparty agent acting on its behalf within the United States, or merely directed its dealing activity to
non-U.S. persons that themselves operate out of the United States, either through branches,
office, or affiliates, or by utilizing third party agents. 318 The Commission preliminarily does not
believe that this would be consistent with the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act, which is
intended, in part, to promote accountability and transparency in the U.S. security-based swap
market. 319
First, we preliminarily believe that when a non-U.S. person engages in dealing activity
with another non-U.S. person from within the United States either through an agent, branch, or
office, or otherwise engages in security-based swap dealing activity within the United States
(such as by soliciting persons within the United States from outside the United States), the
solicitation, negotiation, or execution activity that occurs within the United States constitutes
dealing activity that is described by the security-based swap dealer definition. 320 This is the case
even where such transaction is ultimately booked by the two non-U.S. entities outside the United
States. Second, most market participants, including non-U.S. persons, entering into a securitybased swap transaction with a security-based swap dealer, particularly through personnel located
in the United States, could reasonably expect to be entitled to the customer protections of Title
315

See Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act.

316

See id.

317

Depending on the nature of the activity and the person located in the United States engaging in
the activity, such person may need to register with the Commission as a broker-dealer under
Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o(a)(1).

318

The Commission is not distinguishing, for purposes of the proposed rule, whether a potential
dealer or its counterparty is operating out of a branch, an office, an affiliate, or utilizes a thirdparty agent to act on its behalf. We are, however, soliciting comment on whether there is a basis
for drawing distinctions in this area and look forward to receiving commenters’ views.

VII because of Title VII’s role in setting the standards for the U.S. security-based swap market
and the market participant’s decision to engage in a transaction within that market. 321 Given the
Commission’s responsibility in Title VII to regulate the U.S. security-based swap market, as well
as reasonable market expectations and the risk of creating confusion among market
participants, 322 we preliminarily do not believe that it is appropriate to diverge from our
traditional approach to the regulation of broker-dealers by establishing a regulatory regime for
the security-based swap market that would allow non-U.S. persons to engage in unregulated
dealing activity within the United States, either when it acts through U.S. branches, office, or
agents or it solicits, negotiates, or executes transactions with non-U.S. persons that themselves
are operating out of the United States.
Moreover, suppose non-U.S. persons were not required to register when engaging in
security-based swap dealing activity within the United States with other non-U.S. persons. NonU.S. persons seeking to negotiate security-based swap transactions using personnel in the United
States may choose to enter into security-based swap transactions with such unregistered non-U.S.
persons rather than with a U.S. person to avoid the application of Title VII. In this way,
customers may choose to forego the protections of Title VII in order to achieve potential cost
savings. This could limit the access of U.S. persons engaged in dealing activity within the
United States to non-U.S. persons, as well as more generally limiting the ability of U.S. persons
to access liquidity in the security-based swap market. Accordingly, the Commission is
proposing that a non-U.S. person would be required to count its security-based swap transactions
conducted within the United States (as well as its transactions with U.S. persons) that arise out of
its dealing activity to determine whether the notional amount of its dealing transactions exceeds
the de minimis threshold. This would have the effect of subjecting both non-U.S. persons
engaged in dealing activity within the United States and U.S. persons engaged in dealing activity
within the United States to the same set of rules, thus providing their counterparties the same set
of protections.
321

The Commission previously has noted the role that the location of the dealer plays in setting
expectations regarding the legal protections available in transactions with that dealer. See Rule
15a-6 Adopting Release, 54 FR at 30017 (noting that a U.S. citizen residing abroad who seeks out
transactions with foreign broker-dealers would not generally expect U.S. securities laws to apply
to the transaction); Regulation S Adopting Release, 55 FR at 18310 (noting the expectation that a
buyer outside the United States who purchases securities offered outside the United States is
aware that “the transaction is not subject to registration under the Securities Act”). See also
Cleary Letter IV at 17 (“As both Commissions have consistently recognized in the past, the nonU.S. counterparty in . . . transactions [with a non-U.S. branch or affiliate of a U.S. person]
conducted abroad have no expectation of protection under U.S. law”); Davis Polk Letter II at 20
(“Finally, the non-U.S. counterparty would not reasonably expect the swap [with a foreign bank
swap dealer] to be subject to Title VII’s requirements”).

Protection and Corporate Valuation,” Journal of Finance, Vol. 57, No. 3 (2002) (discussing the
effect of customer protection on prices).

Finally, although the proposed rule reflects the importance of ensuring that neither nonU.S. person counterparty is engaged in the relevant activities within the United States for
purposes of this definition, we also recognize the operational difficulties that could arise in
investigating the activities of a counterparty to ensure compliance with the rule. As a result, we
are preliminarily proposing to allow parties to rely on a representation received from a
counterparty indicating that a given transaction “is not solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked
within the United States by or on behalf of such counterparty.” 323 A party may rely on such a
representation by its counterparty unless the party knows that the representation is not
accurate. 324 The Commission preliminarily believes that this would address whatever
operational difficulties parties may have in determining whether or not their counterparty is
conducting a transaction within the United States.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed rule regarding
registration by non-U.S persons who engage in dealing activity within the United States,
including the following:
•

Should non-U.S. persons be required to register by virtue of engaging in securitybased swap dealing activity within the United States, even if none of this dealing
activity is directed to, or otherwise involves, U.S. persons? Why or why not?

•

Does the proposed approach appropriately impose the dealer registration requirement
on non-U.S. persons based on their dealing activities conducted within the United
States? Should a non-U.S. person be required to register as a security-based swap
dealer if it enters into, or offers to enter into, security-based swap transactions that are
transactions conducted within the United States if such non-U.S. person’s dealing
activity is limited to its foreign business? What about if the non-U.S. person engages

reasonable belief standard with respect to transactions conducted within the United States
between non-U.S. person counterparties due to the fact that this definition applies to both
counterparties to a transaction, thus each counterparty has an incentive to ensure the accuracy of
its representation. In addition, the proposed “actual knowledge” standard and related discussion
in this release are not intended to apply outside the scope of the proposals set forth in this
release. Accordingly, it does not affect the standard for reliance on representations with respect
to other rights or obligations of persons under the Exchange Act or the federal securities law

non-dealing capacity?
•

What, if any, market-transparency or counterparty-protection issues would be likely
to arise if non-U.S. persons were not required to register if they engaged in dealing
activity solely with non-U.S. persons from within the United States?

•

What, if any, competition issues would be likely to arise if non-U.S. persons were not
required to register if they engaged in dealing activity solely with non-U.S. persons
from within the United States?

•

Is the proposed approach toward determining whether dealing activity is conducted
within the United States appropriate? Does the proposed rule identify appropriate
factors in determining whether a transaction has been conducted within the United
States? If not, what factors should be modified, removed, or added?

•

Is the proposed identification of activities appropriate in the context of determining
whether a security-based swap is a transaction conducted within the United States? If
not, which activities should the Commission consider as key evidence of a transaction
that is conducted within the United States?

•

Is direct participation by a branch, agency, office, or associated person, including any
affiliate and any associated person of any affiliate, within the United States an
appropriate element for identifying whether a security-based swap transaction is a
transaction conducted within the United States? Are there functions routinely
performed by these entities that should not trigger a registration requirement, even if
performed within the United States?

•

Is the direct participation of a third-party agent an appropriate element for identifying
whether a security-based swap transaction is a transaction conducted within the
United States? If not, why not?

•

From an operational perspective, what, if any, changes to policies and procedures
would be required to identify transactions conducted within the United States under
the proposed approach? What changes would be required, for example, to monitor
circumstances that would prevent a party from relying on representations?

•

Does the proposed rule appropriately identify the range of security-based swap
activities (i.e., solicitation, negotiation, execution, and booking) that should be
considered in determining whether dealing activity is conducted within the United
States? If not, what activities should be excluded or included? Why?

•

Should a transaction entered into by a non-U.S. person in its capacity as a dealer be
treated as dealing activity conducted within the United States if it is executed on an
SB SEF, submitted to an SDR, or cleared by a security-based swap clearing agency
physically located within the United States, even if no other activity related to the
transaction were conducted within the United States?
94

•

Should the Commission allow parties to rely on representations from their
counterparties regarding compliance with the definition of “transaction conducted
within the United States”? Are there alternatives to relying on representations to
ensure compliance? Should parties be required to exercise reasonable standards of
care and due diligence?

•

Is the standard used for the proposed ability to rely on a representation appropriate?
Should another standard of knowledge be used? If so, what standard would be more
appropriate for this purpose?

•

The CFTC has proposed an interpretation that does not consider whether swap
dealing activity is conducted inside or outside the United States when determining
whether the de minimis threshold is met. 325 Should the Commission adopt this
approach? If yes, please address the effect of both approaches on customer
protection, market transparency, competition, and capital formation in the U.S.
security-based swap market.

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to determining whether
dealing activity occurred within the United States? How would the proposed
approach affect the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in
the United States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach
place any market participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so,
please explain. Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on
competition? If so, please explain. What other measures should the Commission
consider to implement the proposed approach? What would be the market impacts
and competitiveness effects of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this
release?
7. Proposed Treatment of Transactions with Foreign Branches of U.S. Banks

As noted above, under the proposed rule, a non-U.S. person would not be required to
count toward the de minimis threshold in the security-based swap dealer definition its
transactions with the foreign branch of a U.S. bank. 326 For purposes of this proposed approach,
325

See CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR at 41219-20.

326

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act. Section 716 of the Dodd-Frank Act
(commonly known as the “Push-Out Rule”) prohibits the provision of certain types of “Federal
assistance” to certain swap and security-based swap dealers and major swap and security-based
swap participants referred to as “swaps entities,” subject to certain exceptions. In addition,
Section 619 of the Dodd-Frank Act (commonly referred to as the “Volcker Rule”) adds a new
Section 13 to the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956 (“BHC Act”) (to be codified at 12 U.S.C.
1851) that generally prohibits any banking entity from engaging in proprietary trading or from
acquiring or retaining an ownership interest in, sponsoring, or having certain relationships with a
hedge fund or private equity fund (“covered fund”), subject to certain exemptions. See
Prohibitions and Restrictions on Proprietary Trading and Certain Interests in, and Relationships
With, Hedge Funds and Private Equity Funds, Exchange Act Release No. 66057 (Oct. 12, 2011),

95

and as described more fully below, “foreign branch” would be defined as any branch of a U.S.
bank if:
•

The branch is located outside the United States;

•

The branch operates for valid business reasons; and

•

The branch is engaged in the business of banking and is subject to substantive
banking regulation in the jurisdiction where located. 327

We preliminarily believe that these factors are appropriate for determining which entities fall
within the definition of a foreign branch for purposes of this proposed approach due to their
focus on the physical location of the branch and the nature of the branch’s business and
regulation in a foreign jurisdiction. Requiring the branch to be located outside the United States
is consistent with the goal of the proposed rule, which is to identify security-based swap activity
that is not conducted within the United States. Requiring the branch to be operated for valid
business purposes and to be engaged in the business of banking and subject to substantive
banking regulation in a foreign jurisdiction is intended to help ensure that U.S. banks are not able
to take advantage of the proposed rule by setting up offshore operations to evade the application
of Title VII.
In order for a transaction to be a “transaction conducted through a foreign branch,” and
therefore excluded from a non-U.S. person’s de minimis threshold calculation, 328 the foreign
branch must be the named counterparty to the transaction 329 and the transaction must not be
solicited, negotiated, or executed by a person within the United States on behalf of the foreign
branch or its counterparty. 330 To the extent that the transaction is conducted within the United
States, as described in the immediately preceding section (whether on behalf of the U.S. bank to
which the branch belongs or of the foreign counterparty), the non-U.S. person would be required
76 FR 68846 (Nov. 7, 2011). Both the Push-Out Rule and the Volcker Rule will potentially limit
the ability of U.S. banks to conduct security-based swap activity.
327

Proposed Rule 3a-71-3(a)(1) under the Exchange Act. We are not proposing to include
“agencies” within the definition of “foreign branch” as such term is used in connection with our
treatment of transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks. We recognize that Regulation S
groups agencies and branches together in defining the term U.S. person. See 17 CFR §§
230.902(k)(1)(v), (2)(v). However, as discussed in Section III.B.10 below, although certain
aspects of Regulation S may be useful in the context of security-based swaps, Title VII and
Regulation S are tailored to serve different objectives. In particular, the common treatment of
agencies and branches under Regulation S does not compel us to similarly group agencies and
branches for purposes of our treatment of transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks given
the fact that the term “agency” does not have any operative meaning with respect to the foreign
operations of U.S. banks.

to count such transaction arising out of its dealing activity toward its de minimis threshold for
purposes of determining whether it is required to register as a security-based swap dealer. 331
We believe that counting transactions with a foreign branch toward the de minimis
threshold would be consistent with the view that a foreign branch of a U.S. bank is part of a U.S.
person within the proposed definition. 332 We also recognize that such transactions pose risk to
the U.S. financial system. At the same time, however, we believe that imposing registration
requirements on non-U.S. persons solely by virtue of their transactions with foreign branches of
U.S. banks could limit the access of U.S. banks to non-U.S. counterparties when they conduct
their foreign security-based swap dealing activity through foreign branches because non-U.S.
persons may not be willing to enter into transactions with them in order to avoid being required
to register as a security-based swap dealer. 333 We have preliminary concluded that not requiring
such transactions to be counted toward the foreign counterparty’s de minimis threshold for
purposes of the security-based swap dealer registration requirement would minimize this
disparate treatment while ensuring that transactions involving foreign branches of U.S. banks
remain subject to certain Title VII requirements (as described below). 334
Finally, although the proposed rule reflects the importance of ensuring that neither
counterparty is operating from within the United States for purposes of conducting a transaction
through a foreign branch, we also recognize the operational difficulties that could arise in
investigating the activities of a counterparty to ensure compliance with the rule. As a result, we
are proposing to allow parties to rely on a representation received from a counterparty indicating
that “no person within the United States is directly involved in soliciting, negotiating, executing,
or booking” a given transaction on behalf of the counterparty. 335 A party may rely on such a
representation by its counterparty unless the party knows that the representation is not accurate.
The Commission preliminarily believes that this would address whatever operational difficulties

See, e.g., Sullivan and Cromwell Letter at 14 (“The jurisdictional scope of the swaps entity
definitions is critical to the ability of U.S. banking organizations to maintain their competitive
position in foreign marketplaces. Imposing the regulatory regime of Title VII on their Non-U.S.
Operations would place them at a disadvantage to their foreign bank competitors because the
Non-U.S. Operations would be subject to an additional regulatory regime which their foreign
competitors would not.”); Cleary IV at 7 (“Subjecting such non-U.S. branches and affiliates to
U.S. requirements could effectively preclude them from, or significantly increase the cost of,
managing their risk in the local financial markets, since local financial institutions may be
required to comply with Dodd-Frank to provide those services”).

334

See Section III.C, infra. Provided the transaction is not a transaction conducted within the United
States under proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act, the Commission also is not
proposing to require non-U.S. persons to count transactions with a non-U.S. person toward their
de minimis threshold even if the non-U.S. person’s performance on the security-based swap is
guaranteed by a U.S. person. See Section III.B.9, infra.

Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed treatment of
transactions with foreign branches of U.S. persons for purposes of the de minimis exception,
including the following:
•

Would the proposed approach reduce the effectiveness of customer protections or any
other provisions of Title VII? If so, how should these concerns be balanced against
the competitiveness concerns identified as part of the rationale behind the proposed
approach?

•

Does the proposed approach appropriately address the potential for disparate
competitive impacts related to the application of the de minimis exception to dealers
operating out of foreign branches? If not, how might the Commission more
effectively address these concerns?

•

Does the proposed approach provide an advantage to U.S. banks engaging in securitybased swap dealing activity through foreign branches? Are there competitiveness
concerns raised by this approach for entities (either banks or nonbanks) that do not
utilize the branch model? Are there competitiveness concerns for non-U.S. persons,
including non-U.S. persons whose performance under security-based swaps is
guaranteed by a U.S. person? If so, what are they?

•

Should the Commission allow parties to rely on representations from their
counterparties regarding compliance with the definition of “transaction conducted
through a foreign branch”? Should the Commission separately allow parties to rely
on representations from their counterparties regarding status under the “foreign
branch” definition?

•

Is the standard used for the proposed ability to rely on a representation appropriate?
Should another standard of knowledge be used? If so, what standard would be more
appropriate for this purpose?

•

Should the definition of a “foreign branch” be broadened to include “agencies” of
U.S. banks in addition to branches? If so, what rationale justifies the inclusion of
agencies? In particular, what are the similarities (or differences) in the legal status
and regulatory treatment of the foreign branches and foreign agencies of U.S. banks
that would warrant similar treatment? How do foreign agencies of U.S. banks differ
from foreign offices of U.S. persons that are not banks?

•

How might the proposed approach to the foreign branches of U.S. banks be impacted
by the Volcker Rule and the Push-Out Rule? How might security-based swap dealers
alter their business practices in response to the Volcker Rule and the Push-Out Rule?
98

Should the proposed approach to the foreign branches of U.S. banks be altered to
account for these changes to business practice?
•

What would be the market impact of the proposed treatment of transactions with
foreign branches of U.S. banks? How would the proposed approach affect the
competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States
as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market
participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain.
Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please
explain. What other measures should the Commission consider to implement the
proposed approach? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects
of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?
8. Proposed Rule Regarding Aggregation of Affiliate Positions

One key issue related to our proposed approach to the de minimis exception, both in the
cross-border context and domestically, is the aggregation of transactions connected with the
dealing activity of an affiliate. In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the
Commission and the CFTC jointly stated that the notional thresholds in the de minimis exception
encompass swap and security-based swap dealing positions entered into by an affiliate
controlling, controlled by, or under common control with the person at issue. 336 The
Commission and the CFTC further noted that for these purposes, control would be interpreted to
mean the possession, direct or indirect, of the power to direct or cause the direction of the
management and policies of a person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by
contract or otherwise. 337 This aggregation of affiliate positions was deemed necessary to prevent
persons from avoiding dealer regulation by dividing up dealing activity in excess of the notional
thresholds among multiple affiliates. 338
The Commission is proposing a rule that would describe how this aggregation
requirement would apply to U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons engaged in cross-border securitybased swap dealing activity, as well as to U.S. persons engaged in purely domestic
transactions. 339 As set forth in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the affiliate
aggregation principle requires that a person aggregate the entire security-based swap dealing
activity of any of its affiliates, without distinguishing whether the dealing positions are entered
into by U.S. person affiliates or non-U.S. person affiliates, and without distinguishing whether
the dealing positions are entered into with U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons. 340 The proposed
336

Commission intended to address the application of the aggregation principle to non-U.S. persons
in a separate release); 17 CFR § 240.3a71-2(a)(1).

99

rule takes an approach that generally is consistent with the affiliate aggregation interpretive
guidance jointly adopted by the Commission and the CFTC to require a person to aggregate all
of the security-based swap dealing positions entered into by its U.S. person affiliates, 341 except
that it excludes from such aggregation the positions of an affiliate that is a registered securitybased swap dealer, under certain conditions. 342 The proposed rule also provides that such
aggregation must include any security-based swap transactions of such person’s non-U.S. person
affiliates that would be required to be counted by such affiliates toward their respective de
minimis thresholds in accordance with the proposed approach described above (i.e., a non-U.S.
person affiliate would be required to calculate its security-based swap transactions connected
with dealing activity conducted with U.S. persons (other than foreign branches of U.S. banks) or
otherwise conducted within the United States). 343
The proposed rule similarly provides that the affiliate aggregation principle also would
apply to non-U.S. persons that engage in transactions in a dealing capacity with U.S. persons
(other than foreign branches of U.S. banks) or otherwise within the United States. In
determining whether its dealing activity exceeds the de minimis threshold, a non-U.S. person
must aggregate the amount of its own transactions connected with its dealing activity with U.S.
persons (other than foreign branches) or otherwise conducted within the United States with the
amount of any security-based swap transactions connected with the dealing activity conducted by
its affiliates, whether U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons, that such affiliates would be required to
count toward their respective de minimis thresholds in accordance with the proposed approach
described above 344 (other than the transactions of affiliates that are registered security-based
swap dealers). 345 Transactions of affiliates that are themselves non-U.S. persons with other nonU.S. persons (or foreign branches of U.S. banks) outside the United States would not need to be
aggregated for purposes of the de minimis exception. 346
Thus, the Commission’s proposal would require aggregation of the amount of dealing
transactions of all affiliates, both U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons, other than registered
security-based swap dealers. We believe that the Commission’s proposed approach implements
the de minimis exception in a manner that is consistent with the Dodd-Frank Act’s focus on the
341

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act. The proposed rule also clarifies that only
a person directly engaged in dealing activity that is required to be counted toward such person’s
de minimis threshold would be required to aggregate the dealing activity of its affiliates.

Proposed Rule 3a71-4 under the Exchange Act.

343

See Section III.B.4(b), supra; see also proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act.

See Section III.B.4(b), supra. A U.S. person affiliate would be required to calculate all of its
security-based swap transactions connected with its dealing activity and a non-U.S.-person
affiliate would be required to calculate its security-based swap transactions connected with its
dealing activity with U.S. persons (other than foreign branches of U.S. banks) or otherwise
conducted within the United States.

U.S. security-based swap market. 347 The proposed approach reflects the fact that all of a U.S.
affiliate’s security-based swap dealing transactions impact the U.S. financial system, regardless
of whether such entity’s counterparties are located in the United States or abroad. The same is
not true of non-U.S. affiliates, however, because the security-based swap transactions entered
into by a non-U.S. affiliate with other non-U.S. persons outside the United States would not
impact the U.S. financial system to the same extent as transactions with U.S. persons. Thus,
because the statutory focus is on the U.S. security-based swap market, we preliminarily believe it
is appropriate to distinguish between U.S. and non-U.S. affiliates based on the disparate impact
of their security-based swap dealing transactions on the U.S. financial system when determining
which dealing transactions should be aggregated for purposes of the de minimis threshold. This
further suggests that we should aggregate the dealing positions of both U.S. and non-U.S. person
affiliates that are not already registered security-based swap dealers, in accordance with the rule
and guidance described in the following paragraph regarding aggregation of the positions of
registered dealers, with the goal of capturing all dealing transactions that warrant imposing
dealer registration and regulation 348 and minimizing the opportunity for a person to evasively
engage in large amounts of dealing activity. 349 As a result, where the aggregate security-based
swap dealing activity of an affiliated group, calculated as described above, exceeds the de
minimis threshold, then each affiliate within such group that engages in the security-based swap
dealing activity included in such aggregation calculation would be required to register with the
Commission as a security-based swap dealer, subject to the exception described below.
The Commission also is proposing a rule to address the affiliate aggregation of dealing
positions for purposes of the de minimis threshold where one or more affiliates within a
corporate group are registered with the Commission as security-based swap dealers. 350 Under
the proposed approach, a person calculating the amount of its security-based swap positions for
purposes of the de minimis threshold would not need to include in such calculation the securitybased swap transactions of an affiliate controlling, controlled by, or under common control with
the person if such affiliate is registered with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer. 351
The application of this proposed rule would be limited to circumstances where a person’s
security-based swap activities are operationally independent from those of its registered securitybased swap dealer affiliate. For purposes of this proposed rule, the security-based swap activities
of two affiliates would be considered operationally independent if the two affiliated persons
maintained separate sales and trading functions, operations (including separate back offices), and
risk management with respect to any security-based swap dealing activity conducted by either
affiliate that is required to be counted against their respective de minimis thresholds. If any of
these functions were jointly administered by the two affiliates, or were managed at a central
location within the affiliates’ corporate group (e.g., at the entity serving as the central booking

entity) with respect to any security-based swap dealing activity conducted by either affiliate that
is required to be counted against their respective de minimis thresholds, then an unregistered
person would not be able to exclude the security-based swap dealing activities of its registered
security-based swap dealer affiliate under the proposed rule.
Absent the proposed exclusion of the dealing positions of a registered security-based
swap dealer affiliate in the proposed rule, any affiliate of a registered security-based swap dealer
that engaged in security-based swap dealing activity with U.S. persons or within the United
States would be required to aggregate the dealing positions of the registered security-based swap
dealer with its own dealing positions for purposes of the de minimis threshold. Given that a
registered security-based swap dealer would presumably conduct relevant security-based swap
dealing positions in excess of the de minimis threshold over the course of the immediately
preceding 12 months, all persons affiliated with a registered security-based swap dealer that
engaged in any level of security-based swap dealing activity that is required to be counted
against the de minimis threshold would necessarily be required to register with the Commission
as security-based swap dealers because of the affiliate aggregation principle. We preliminarily
do not believe that this outcome would be consistent with the statutory purpose of the de minimis
exception, because it would prevent all affiliates of a registered dealer from taking advantage of
the exception, even those engaged in a minimal amount of dealing activity relevant to Title VII
dealer registration and regulation. We also do not believe that this scenario raises the concerns
about evasion that underlie the de minimis affiliate aggregation rule jointly adopted by the
Commission and the CFTC in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, given that this
proposed rule would apply only where a corporate group already included a registered dealer
subject to Commission oversight, and the dealing positions of all commonly controlled
unregistered affiliates in the corporate group would still be aggregated for purposes of the de
minimis threshold. 352 For these reasons, we believe that it is appropriate not to include the
security-based swap dealing positions of registered security-based swap dealers in the de
minimis calculations of their commonly controlled affiliates provided that their security-based
swap dealing activities that are relevant to the de minimis calculation are operationally
independent of the registered security-based swap dealer affiliates.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed rule regarding the
aggregation of affiliate positions, including the following:

352

•

Should the Commission permit affiliated persons to exclude the security-based swap
dealing positions of affiliated registered security-based swap dealers from their de
minimis calculations, as proposed? Why or why not?

•

Would permitting affiliated entities to exclude the security-based swap dealing
positions of registered security-based swap dealers from their de minimis calculations

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30631.

102

undermine any of the Title VII protections associated with security-based swap dealer
registration and regulation? If so, please explain. Should the Commission further
explain what “operationally independent” means? If so, what should the Commission
consider?
•

Should the Commission permit affiliated entities to exclude the security-based swap
dealing positions of operationally independent affiliates from their de minimis
calculations, even if such affiliates are not registered security-based swap dealers?

•

The CFTC has adopted temporary conditional relief that would permit a non-U.S.
person to exclude from its de minimis calculation the security-based swap dealing
positions of an affiliated non-U.S. person that is registered as a swap dealer and not
guaranteed by a U.S. person with respect to its swap obligations. 353 Should the
Commission adopt a similar interpretation to permit a non-U.S. person (but not a U.S.
person) to exclude the dealing positions of its affiliated registered non-U.S. securitybased swap dealer (but not the dealing positions of its affiliated registered U.S.
security-based swap dealer)? Should the Commission condition such exclusion on
the affiliated registered security-based swap dealer not being guaranteed by a U.S.
person? If so, please describe the likely economic effects of providing different
exclusions from the affiliate aggregation principle for U.S. and non-U.S. securitybased swap dealers and how the Commission should best address them.

•

The CFTC has also proposed an interpretation that would permit non-U.S. persons
engaged in dealing activity with U.S. persons to aggregate the notional amounts of
security-based swap dealing transactions by their non-U.S. affiliates separately from
any dealing activity performed by their U.S. affiliates. 354 Should the Commission
adopt a similar approach? If so, please explain how this approach is consistent with
the de minimis threshold and the rationale provided for the affiliate aggregation
principle in the Intermediaries Definitions Adopting Release. In addition, please
describe the likely economic effects of providing an effectively higher de minimis
threshold for corporate groups that engage in dealing activity with U.S. persons or
within the United States through affiliates located in the United States and in foreign
jurisdictions.

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to aggregation of affiliate
positions? How would the proposed approach affect the competitiveness of U.S.
entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States as well as in foreign
jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market participants at a
competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed

other measures should the Commission consider to implement the proposed
approach? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects of
alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?
9. Treatment of Inter-Affiliate and Guaranteed Transactions
Consistent with the approach taken in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the
Commission is proposing that cross-border security-based swap transactions between majorityowned affiliates would not need to be considered when determining whether a person is a
security-based swap dealer. 355 Thus, a non-U.S. person engaged in dealing activity outside the
United States would not be required to register as a security-based swap dealer simply by virtue
of entering into security-based swap transactions with its majority-owned U.S. affiliate, even if
such inter-affiliate security-based swaps were back-to-back transactions (i.e., the foreign
subsidiary was acting as a “conduit” for the U.S. person). Similarly, a U.S. person would not be
required to register as a security-based swap dealer as a result of back-to-back transactions with a
non-U.S. person subsidiary that acts as a conduit for such U.S. person. 356 Instead, as proposed,
there must be an independent basis for requiring a person to register as a security-based swap
dealer that is unrelated to its inter-affiliate transactions. 357
Furthermore, the Commission is proposing not to require a non-U.S. person that receives
a guarantee from a U.S. person of its performance on security-based swaps with non-U.S.
persons outside the United States to count its dealing transactions with those non-U.S. persons
toward the de minimis threshold as a U.S. person would be required to do. 358 We believe that
the primary risk related to these transactions is the risk posed to the United States via the
guarantee from a U.S. person, not the dealing activity occurring between two non-U.S. persons
355

See 17 CFR § 240.3a71-1(d), as discussed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77
FR at 30624-25. For the purposes of this rule, which was adopted in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, counterparties are considered majority-owned affiliates if one party directly or
indirectly owns a majority interest in the other, or if a third party directly or indirectly owns a
majority interest in both, based on the right to vote or direct the vote of a majority of a class of
voting securities of an entity, the power to sell or direct the sale of a majority of a class of voting
securities of an entity, or the right to receive upon dissolution or the contribution of a majority of
the capital of a partnership. See 17 CFR § 240.3a71-1(d)(2).

356

This approach differs from the treatment of conduit entities in the CFTC Cross-Border Proposal.
Under the CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, a U.S. entity may be required to register as a swap
dealer as a result of its inter-affiliate swap transactions with an affiliated foreign dealer if the
foreign dealer is acting as a conduit by transferring swaps to the U.S. entity through back-to-back
transactions. See CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR at 41222.

357

Proposed Rule 3a71-4 under the Exchange Act.

358

This approach differs from the treatment of guaranteed entities in the CFTC Cross-Border
Proposal. Under the CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, a non-U.S. person that receives a guarantee
from a U.S. person would be required to count all of its swap dealing transactions against the de
minimis threshold. See CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR at 41221.

104

outside the United States. As a result, we do not believe that the risk posed by the existence of
the U.S. guarantee would be better addressed through requiring non-U.S. persons receiving such
guarantees to register with the Commission as security-based swap dealers. One way that the
accumulation of risk resulting from security-based swap positions is addressed in Title VII is
through the major security-based swap participant registration category. We preliminarily
believe that the risk associated with guarantees by U.S. persons of the performance on securitybased swap obligations of non-U.S. persons may be best addressed through the application of
principles of attribution in the major security-based swap participant definition described in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 359 We preliminarily believe that use of the major
security-based swap participant definition to address the risks posed to the United States as a
result of guarantees by U.S. persons effectively deals with the specific regulatory concerns posed
by the risks these guarantees present to the U.S. financial system and is consistent with the
regulatory framework set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act. 360
The Commission also is proposing not to require a foreign dealer to count security-based
swap transactions with non-U.S. persons that receive guarantees from U.S. persons toward the de
minimis threshold. The Commission notes that, in many respects, the risk created for U.S.
persons and the U.S. financial system in these transactions is the same as the risk posed if the
U.S. person who provides the guarantee had entered into transactions directly with non-U.S.
persons. The U.S. guarantor would be held responsible to settle those obligations, thus
maintaining similar liability as though the U.S. person had entered into security-based swap
transactions directly with a non-U.S person. The Commission preliminarily believes that the risk
posed to the U.S. markets by non-U.S. persons engaged in dealing activity with non-U.S. persons
outside the United States whose performance under security-based swaps is guaranteed by a U.S.
person can be best addressed through the major security-based swap participant definition and
requirements applicable to major security-based swap participants, as the risks to the United
States appear to arise only from the resulting positions and not the dealing activity as such.
Finally, as discussed below, the Commission is proposing to subject a security-based
swap transaction between two non-U.S. persons where at least one of the persons receives a
guarantee on the performance of its obligations from a U.S. person to the regulatory reporting
requirement (but not, in some cases, to real-time public reporting). 361 If the proposed approach
is adopted, the Commission would gain an understanding of market developments in this area as
a result of the proposed de minimis exception.

Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed treatment of interaffiliate and guaranteed transactions, including the following:

362

•

Should the Commission revise our proposed approach to inter-affiliate transactions to
require those transactions to be considered when determining whether a person is a
security-based swap dealer? If so, why?

•

If the Commission determines not to exclude inter-affiliate transactions from securitybased swap dealing activity in the cross-border context, how could such a decision be
reconciled with the exclusion for inter-affiliate transactions provided in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release? Should the Commission and the CFTC
jointly reconsider the approach to inter-affiliate transactions provided in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release?

•

Should the Commission require the registration of non-U.S. dealers that receive
guarantees on the performance of their security-based swap obligations from U.S.
persons based on their transactions with non-U.S. persons as well as U.S. persons?
Why or why not? Should the U.S. guarantor be viewed as engaging indirectly in
dealing activity through its affiliate and, therefore, required to register as a securitybased swap dealer if the security-based swap transactions in connection with its
dealing activity exceed the de minimis threshold? Should there be a concern that the
U.S. guarantor is using the non-US affiliate to evade the requirements of Title VII?

•

Does the proposed approach to guarantees effectively address concerns related to the
risk posed to the U.S. financial system resulting from guarantees by U.S. persons of
security-based swap dealing activity by non-U.S. persons?

•

Are there competitiveness concerns related to the proposed approach to guarantees
with regard to U.S. entities that engage in non-U.S. security-based swap dealing
activity through business models that do not rely on guarantees of non-U.S. persons,
such as those that operate through foreign branches?

•

The CFTC has proposed an interpretation that would subject an entity that operates a
“central booking system” where swaps are booked into a single legal entity, to any
applicable swap dealer registration requirement as if it had entered into such swaps
directly, irrespective of whether such entity is a U.S. person or whether the booking
entity is a counterparty to the swap or enters into the swap indirectly through a backto-back swap or other arrangement with its affiliate or subsidiary. 362 Should the
Commission adopt a similar approach? If so, please describe how such a decision
could be reconciled with the exclusion for inter-affiliate transactions provided in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release.

See CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR at 41221-22.

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to inter-affiliate and
guaranteed transactions? How would the application of the proposed approach affect
the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United
States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any
market participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain.
Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please
explain. What other measures should the Commission consider to implement the
proposed approach? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects
of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?
10. Comparison with Definition of “U.S. Person” in Regulation S

In proposing an entity-based approach to the definition of a U.S. person, we have
declined to follow the suggestions by some commenters that we adopt the definition of “U.S.
person” used in Regulation S, which among other things expressly excludes from the definition
of “U.S. person” agencies or branches of U.S. persons located outside the United States. 363
Although we recognize that the Regulation S definition of U.S. person has the advantage of
familiarity for many market participants, Regulation S addresses specific policy concerns that are
different from those addressed by Title VII. 364 Specifically, the definition of U.S. person in
Regulation S was adopted in the context of providing an “issuer safe harbor” from the
registration requirements of Section 5 of the Securities Act, which was intended “to ensure that
the [unregistered] securities offered [abroad] come to rest offshore.” 365 In that context,
providing a safe harbor based in part on the location of the person, branch, or office making the
investment decision is consistent with the goals of that regulatory framework, which include
protecting the integrity of the registration requirements applicable to securities publicly offered
363

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 2 (“The Agencies should adopt a consistent definition of ‘U.S.
person’ based on SEC Regulation S for purposes of analyzing whether a transaction involving
one or more such persons may be subject to the provisions of Dodd-Frank.”); Davis Polk I at 6
n.6 (“We propose that the term ‘U.S. counterparty’ be defined in the same way as the term ‘U.S.
person’ in Rule 902(k) of the SEC’s Regulation S under the Securities Act, 17 CFR § 230.902(k).
This established definition is familiar to countless financial market professionals. Following the
‘U.S. person’ definition in Regulation S, rather than creating an entirely new definition, would
avoid confusion and also provide consistency of application and legal certainty for a financial
institution that offers a security and a swap to the same customer, which is common.”); SIFMA
Letter I at 5 (“To determine whether a party to a swap is a ‘U.S. person,’ the Commissions should
rely on the existing definition of that term contained in Rule 902(k) of the SEC’s Regulation S.
This established, workable definition is familiar to regulators and market participants alike, and
would provide legal certainty. It is noteworthy that the Regulation S definition of U.S. person
does not include non-U.S. affiliates of U.S. persons or non-U.S. branches of a U.S. bank and
generally excludes collective investment vehicles established outside the United States with U.S.
investors.”) (footnotes omitted); see also Section III.B.5(c), supra.

Regulation S Adopting Release, 55 FR at 18307.

107

in the United States under the Securities Act. The Regulation S definition of “U.S. person”
reflects this policy judgment.
We preliminarily believe that the definition of U.S. person in Title VII should encompass,
for example, not only a person that has its place of residence or legal organization within the
United States, but also its principal place of business within the United States, as the securitybased swap activities of such entities are likely to manifest themselves most directly within the
United States, where the majority of their commercial, legal, and financial relationships would be
likely to exist because that is where their business principally occurs. 366
Similarly, we preliminarily believe that the definition of U.S. person in Title VII should
include accounts of a U.S. person, regardless of whether the account is a discretionary account or
is held by a dealer or other person that is not resident in the United States, because the U.S.
person bears the direct risk of transactions in the account, regardless of where the investment
decision is made. 367 Moreover, we are proposing that an entity’s U.S.-person status would apply
to the entity as a whole, since the risks related to the concerns of Title VII are borne by the entire
entity and not just by the specific business unit (or branch or office) engaged in security-based
swap activity. 368 With its exclusions for certain foreign branches and agencies of U.S. persons
from the definition of “U.S. person,” Regulation S would not address the entity-wide nature of
the risks that Title VII seeks to address. 369
The Commission preliminarily believes that adopting the definition of “U.S. person” in
Regulation S without significant modifications would not achieve the goals of Title VII. As
discussed above, we are instead proposing a definition of U.S. person that focuses primarily on
the location of the person bearing the direct risk of the transaction. Regulation S, with its focus
on the person making the investment decision (rather than the person actually bearing the risk),
would not necessarily capture the entity that actually bears the risks arising from security-based
swap transactions that Title VII seeks to address. 370

See Section III.B.5(a), supra.

369

Under Regulation S, the foreign branch of a U.S. bank is not treated as a U.S. person while the
U.S. branch of a foreign bank is treated as a U.S. person. By contrast, under proposed Rule 3a713(a)(7)(i)(B) under the Exchange Act, the foreign branch of a U.S. bank would be treated as part
of a U.S. person while the U.S. branch of a foreign bank would be treated as a non-U.S. person.

370

Rather than creating a U.S. person definition specifically tailored to Title VII, the Commission
could have proposed a modified version of Regulation S. However, significantly modifying the
definition of “U.S. person” in Regulation S to accommodate the objectives of Title VII would
largely eliminate the benefits associated with adopting a consistent and well-established
regulatory standard.

108

In light of the specific objectives of Title VII, the Commission preliminarily believes that
a definition of U.S. person specifically tailored to the regulatory objectives it is meant to serve,
as described above, is appropriate. 371
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed definition of U.S.
person, including the following:
•

Should the Commission adopt the definition of U.S. person in Regulation S? If so,
how should the Commission reconcile the objectives of Title VII with the objectives
that Regulation S is meant to serve?

•

Should the Commission include all U.S. citizens in the definition of U.S. person,
regardless of a person’s residence or domicile?

•

Should the Commission include within the definition of U.S. person entities and
accounts where the discretion to enter into security-based swaps resides with a U.S.
person? To what extent would this approach produce a result that differs from the
current approach reflected in the proposed rule and the definitions of “security-based
swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant”?

C. Regulation of Security-Based Swap Dealers in Title VII
1. Introduction
To help address the potential effects of registration, and attendant regulatory
requirements, on foreign security-based swap dealers 372 with global security-based swap
371

See Section III.B.3(b)(4), infra. The Commission notes that it took a different approach to the
definition of U.S. person and activity in the United States in connection with the Commission’s
exemption from registration for foreign private advisers. See Exemptions for Advisers to Venture
Capital Funds, Private Fund Advisers With Less Than $150 Million in Assets Under
Management, and Foreign Private Advisers, Advisers Act Release No 3222, 76 FR 39646 (July 6,
2011) (the “Foreign Private Adviser Exemption”). The Foreign Private Adviser Exemption
defines certain terms in the statutory definition of “foreign private adviser” (added by Section 402
of the Dodd-Frank Act and codified at section 202(a)(30) of the Investment Advisers Act) by
incorporating the definition of a “U.S. person” and “United States” under Regulation S. As
discussed in this subsection, the Commission preliminarily believes that it would be inappropriate
to follow the approach in Regulation S in its entirety with respect to the cross-border regulation of
security-based swaps, although it may be appropriate in the context of the Foreign Private
Adviser Exemption given the similar policy objectives with Regulation S.

372

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(8) under the Exchange Act defines “U.S. security-based swap dealer” as
a security-based swap dealer, as defined in Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(71), and the rules and regulations thereunder, that is a U.S. person, as defined in proposed
Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act. Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(3) under the Exchange Act
defines “foreign security-based swap dealer” as a security-based swap dealer, as defined in

109

businesses and U.S. security-based swap dealers 373 that engage in security-based swap dealing
activity through foreign branches that also may be subject to registration or regulation in foreign
jurisdictions, the Commission is proposing not to apply the external business conduct standards
and segregation requirements in Title VII to the Foreign Business 374 of such registered foreign
security-based swap dealers and registered U.S. security-based swap dealers that engage in
dealing activity through foreign branches with non-U.S. persons and foreign branches of U.S.
banks. 375 In addition, while we are not proposing a rule to limit the application of entity-level
requirements in Title VII to foreign security-based swap dealers, we are proposing to establish a
policy and procedural framework under which the Commission would permit substituted
compliance in some circumstances by registered foreign security-based swap dealers with certain
Title VII requirements specifically applicable to security-based swap dealers. 376
In the following sections, we discuss the views of commenters, describe the transactionlevel and entity-level requirements specifically applicable to security-based swap dealers in Title
VII, and discuss the proposed application of transaction-level and entity-level requirements to
registered security-based swap dealers in the cross-border context.
2. Comment Summary
Various foreign dealers expressed their views about the application of the Dodd-Frank
Act requirements to their derivatives businesses. A number of them expressed concern that if the
Commission applies security-based swap dealer regulations, not only to entities conducting
business from within the United States, but also to foreign-domiciled entities, it could effectively
prevent foreign dealers from, among other things, managing their global security-based swap
business out of a centralized booking entity (i.e., the entity that acts as principal—the named
counterparty—to a security-based swap transaction), which they maintain has many advantages
for foreign dealers and their clients, including more efficient counterparty netting, greater
Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, that is not a U.S.
security-based swap dealer.
373

See note 372, supra.

374

As discussed below, proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(2) under the Exchange Act defines “Foreign
Business” as meaning the security-based swap transactions of foreign security-based swap dealers
and U.S. security-based swap dealers “other than the U.S. Business of such entities.” “U.S.
Business” is defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(6) under the Exchange Act, with respect to a
foreign security-based swap dealer, as (i) any transaction entered into, or offered to be entered
into, by or on behalf of such foreign security-based swap dealer, with a U.S. person (other than
with a foreign branch); or (ii) any transaction conducted within the United States; and, with
respect to a U.S. security-based swap dealer, as any transaction by or on behalf of such U.S.
security-based swap dealer, wherever entered into or offered to be entered into, other than a
transaction conducted through a foreign branch, as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4), with a
non-U.S. person or another foreign branch. See Section III.C.4, infra.

transparency, greater financial counterparty financial strength, and operational efficiencies. 377
One commenter cautioned that if the regulations lead foreign dealers to create “fragmented
booking structures” to avoid duplicative and conflicting regulatory regimes, it could harm U.S.
consumers through increased transaction costs with foreign dealers. 378
Many commenters suggested that to preserve a registration framework that would allow
foreign dealers to continue to book their global security-based swap business out of a central
non-U.S. entity, the Commission should use our limited designation authority under the DoddFrank Act’s swap dealer definition to designate and regulate only specific activities and
particular branches or agencies of foreign banks that transact with U.S. customers, without
subjecting the whole entity or its other branches to regulation. 379
In addition, various commenters suggested a variety of operational models through which
foreign dealers could operate in the U.S. security-based swap market, generally premising the
proposed registration and regulatory regime on the notion that home country supervision should
apply to entity-level regulations (e.g., capital, risk management, and conflicts of interest), while
Title VII transaction-level regulations should apply only to security-based swaps involving a
U.S. counterparty. 380 A number of commenters emphasized that transaction-level requirements
377

See, e.g., Société Générale Letter I at 3 (“Overall, the advantages of carrying out Swap
transactions in and with a foreign bank with a consolidated booking structure help control risk
significantly . . . . We believe it would be sensible for the Commissions to craft regulations that
do not discourage foreign banks such as SG from registering as Swap Dealers.”); Davis Polk
Letter I at 2, 5 (“We believe operating and managing a global swaps business out of a single
booking entity presents many advantages from the perspective of foreign banks, customers and
supervisors.”).

378

See ISDA Letter I at 10 (warning that “U.S. counterparties will . . . face increased costs and
decreased liquidity if U.S. regulation forces non-U.S. SDs to create fragmented booking
structures to avoid duplicative and conflicting regulatory regimes”).

379

See, e.g., IIB Letter at 11 (pointing out that Section 3(a)(71) of the Exchange Act, as amended by
the Dodd-Frank Act, provides for limited designation as a security-based swap dealer “for a
single type or single class … of activities, and not for other types, classes, of … activities,” and
recommending that the Commissions designate as a Swap Dealer only the particular U.S. or nonU.S. branch or agency of the foreign bank involved in the execution of swaps with U.S.
customers”); Rabobank Letter at 2 (recommending that to preserve “the benefits of the
centralized booking model, a non-U.S. branch of a foreign bank should register as a swap dealer
solely with respect to its swap dealing activities with U.S. persons. Under this scenario, Title
VII’s transaction-level rules would apply only to the non-U.S. branch’s swap dealing activities
with U.S. persons and would not apply to its other activities or to the swap activities of other parts
of the foreign bank”).

380

See, e.g., Davis Polk Letter II at 4-20 (recommending reliance on comprehensive home country
requirements such as capital, margin, conflicts of interest, risk management, and limited
recordkeeping requirements for entity-level regulations if certain standards are met, and
recommending the application of Title VII transaction-level rules to a swap dealer’s swap dealing
activities with U.S. persons).

111

should not apply to security-based swaps entered into between foreign counterparties. 381 Other
commenters remarked that if the Commission regulates both the U.S.-facing business (i.e.,
transactions with U.S. persons) and the foreign-facing business (i.e., transactions with non-U.S.
persons) of U.S. security-based swap dealers, but only the U.S.-facing business of foreign
security-based swap dealers, then U.S. firms would be at a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis
their foreign counterparts with respect to transactions with foreign counterparties. 382
Several commenters further expressed concern that a requirement for foreign persons to
register with the Commission as security-based swap dealers could be particularly problematic in
the case of capital requirements, where foreign security-based swap dealers already would be
subject to their home country’s prudential requirements. These commenters favored deferring to
foreign regulators the regulation and supervision of entity-level requirements when a foreign
security-based swap dealer is subject to comprehensive and comparable home country
regulation. 383 One commenter recommended a comparability standard whereby the Federal
Reserve and the Commission determine comparability even when a home country regulator does
not require margin for non-cleared security-based swaps, if the home country’s capital regime
takes into account functionally equivalent capital charges. 384 Several commenters recommended
that, for monitoring purposes, U.S. regulators could rely on information-sharing arrangements
with home regulators regarding foreign swap transactions and activities. 385 A few commenters
381

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 14-15 (asserting that subjecting foreign entities to
transaction-level requirements on foreign transactions would likely lead to a competitive
disadvantage, because other foreign “banking organizations that are not so burdened by such dual
and potentially conflicting requirements would be able to provide a wider range of services…,
which may cause customers to migrate away from” those foreign operations, which would limit
their ability to manage, transfer, and reduce systemic risk).

382

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter I at 11 (remarking that “U.S. swap dealers also may be at a competitive
disadvantage relative to non-U.S. entities if U.S. swap dealers must comply with U.S. rules when
dealing with a non-U.S. counterparty in a jurisdiction that does not have similar rules, for
example, if the foreign rules do not mandate margin requirements for non-cleared swaps”).

383

See, e.g., Financial Services Roundtable Letter at 25 (suggesting that the Commissions should
defer to foreign prudential regulators with regard to entity-level requirements such as capital and
margin, when they are deemed consistent with U.S. standards); Davis Polk Letter I at 3-4
(emphasizing the importance of relying on home country regulation for entity-level rules such as
capital, margin, conflicts of interest, risk management, and limited recordkeeping requirements).

384

See Davis Polk Letter II at 13-15 (recommending a comparability standard that “focuses on the
similarities in regulatory objectives as opposed to identity of technical rules,” whereby the
Federal Reserve, as the prudential regulator, could determine comparability even when a home
country regulator does not require margin for non-cleared swaps, if “the capital regime in such
home country is determined to take account appropriately of unmargined or undermargined swaps
by imposing additional capital charges”).

385

See, e.g., Davis Polk Letter I at 9 (stating that “[w]here information is required from the foreign
bank swap dealer, U.S. regulators should seek to rely upon regulatory examinations by home
country regulators, and information sharing arrangements”).

112

argued that U.S. regulators should not have examination authority over foreign swap transactions
and activities located outside the United States, and suggested that the Commissions obtain any
necessary information about U.S. swap transactions and activities from U.S. affiliates of the
foreign security-based swap dealer. 386
3. Title VII Requirements Applicable to Security-Based Swap Dealers
Certain Title VII requirements specifically applicable to security-based swap dealers
apply at a transaction level, that is, to security-based swap transactions with specific
counterparties. Examples of transaction-level requirements in Title VII principally include
requirements relating to external business conduct standards such as the requirement that a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant verify that any counterparty
meets the eligibility standards for an eligible contract participant 387 and requirements relating to
segregation of assets held as collateral in security-based swap transactions. 388 Other
requirements apply to security-based swap dealers at an entity level, that is, to the dealing entity
as a whole. Examples of entity-level requirements include, among others, requirements relating
to capital, 389 risk management procedures, 390 recordkeeping and reporting, 391 supervision, 392 and
designation of a chief compliance officer. 393 Some requirements can be considered both entitylevel and transaction-level requirements. For instance, the margin requirement in Section 15F(e)
of the Exchange Act can be considered both an entity-level requirement because margin affects
the financial soundness of an entity and a transaction-level requirement because margin
calculation is based on particular transactions (i.e., an entity calculates margin based on the
market value of specific transactions or on a portfolio basis). 394
386

See, e.g., Société Générale Letter I at 12 (recommending that a foreign dealer based outside the
U.S. with no U.S. nexus “should be ‘ring-fenced’ and outside the scope of the Commissions’
examination and regulatory authority,” but allowing for a limited examination of a foreign bank’s
U.S. facing business concerning its clearing, trade execution, and capital rules, through its U.S.
domiciled agent who “would facilitate this examination by making all necessary information
available directly to the Commissions”).

Section 15F(h)(1), which address fraud, supervision and adherence to position limits, apply at the
entity level.

113

Below, we describe in more detail various transaction-level and entity-level requirements
in Title VII applicable to security-based swap dealers. 395
(a) Transaction-Level Requirements
In general, transaction-level requirements primarily focus on protecting counterparties by
requiring security-based swap dealers to, among other things, provide certain disclosures to
counterparties, adhere to certain standards of business conduct, and segregate customer funds,
securities, and other assets. The following briefly describes the most significant transaction-level
requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers in Title VII.
i.

External Business Conduct Standards

Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to adopt rules specifying
external business conduct standards for security-based swap dealers in their dealings with
counterparties, 396 including counterparties that are “special entities.” 397 Congress granted the
Commission broad authority to promulgate business conduct requirements, as the Commission
determines to be appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors or otherwise in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 398

procedures relating to security-based swaps in Section 15F(j)(5) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78o-10(j)(5), is transactional in the sense that potential conflicts of interest relate to particular
security-based swap transactions. At the same time, however, it also is an entity-level
requirement because implementing such systems and procedures would require, among other
things, a security-based swap dealer to establish structural and institutional safeguards to wall off
the activities of persons within the firm relating to research or analysis of the price or market for
any security-based swap. See External Business Conduct Standards Proposing Release, 76 FR at
42420.
395

For purposes of this discussion, we are addressing only requirements applicable to security-based
swap dealers in Sections 3E and 15F of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-5 and 78o-10, and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Title VII requirements relating to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination, clearing, and trade execution are discussed in Sections VIII - X below.

396

Section 15F(h)(6) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(6), directs the Commission to
prescribe rules governing external business conduct standards for security-based swap dealers.
Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h), also generally authorizes and requires
the Commission to adopt rules for major security-based swap participants. See Section IV, infra.

397

Section 15F(h)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(2)(C). See note 286, supra.

398

See Section 15F(h)(3)(D) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(3)(D) (“[b]usiness conduct
requirements adopted by the Commission shall establish such other standards and requirements as
the Commission may determine are appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of
investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of this Act”). See also Section
15F(h)(1)(D) of the Exchange Act (requiring that security-based swap dealers to comply as well
with “such business conduct standards . . . as may be prescribed by the Commission by rule or
regulation that relate to . . . such other matters as the Commission determines to be appropriate”).

114

These standards, as described in Section 15F(h)(3) of the Exchange Act, must require
security-based swap dealers to: (i) verify that a counterparty meets the eligibility standards for
an ECP; (ii) disclose to the counterparty material information about the security-based swap,
including material risks and characteristics of the security-based swap, and material incentives
and conflicts of interest of the security-based swap dealer in connection with the security-based
swap; and (iii) provide the counterparty with information concerning the daily mark for the
security-based swap. Section 15F(h)(3) also directs the Commission to establish a duty for
security-based swap dealers to communicate information in a fair and balanced manner based on
principles of fair dealing and good faith.
In addition, Section 15F(h)(4) of the Exchange Act requires that a security-based swap
dealer that “acts as an advisor to a special entity” must act in the “best interests” of the special
entity and undertake “reasonable efforts to obtain such information as is necessary to make a
reasonable determination” that a recommended security-based swap is in the best interests of the
special entity. 399 Section 15F(h)(5) requires that security-based swap dealers that enter into, or
offer to enter into, security-based swaps with a special entity comply with any duty established
by the Commission that requires a security-based swap dealer to have a “reasonable basis” for
believing that a special entity has an “independent representative” that meets certain criteria and
undertakes a duty to act in the “best interests” of the special entity.
The Commission has proposed Rules 15Fh-1 through 15Fh-6 under the Exchange Act to
implement the business conduct requirements described above. 400 In addition to external
business conduct standards expressly addressed by Title VII, the Commission has proposed
certain other business conduct requirements for security-based swap dealers that the Commission
preliminarily believed would further the principles that underlie the Dodd-Frank Act. These
rules would, among other things, impose certain “know your counterparty” and suitability
obligations on security-based swap dealers, as well as restrict security-based swap dealers from
engaging in certain “pay to play” activities. 401
ii.

Segregation of Assets

Segregation requirements are designed to identify and protect customer property held by
a security-based swap dealer as collateral in order to facilitate the prompt return of the property
to customers or counterparties in a liquidation proceeding of such security-based swap dealer. 402
Segregation not only protects counterparties who are customers of a security-based swap dealer
but also facilitates orderly liquidation of a security-based swap dealer and minimizes the

disruption to and impact on the U.S. security-based swap market and the U.S. financial system
overall caused by insolvency and liquidation of a security-based swap dealer.
Section 3E of the Exchange Act provides the Commission with rulemaking authority to
prescribe segregation requirements for securities-based swap dealers that receive assets from,
for, or on behalf of a counterparty to margin, guarantee, or secure a security-based swap
transaction. 403 Section 3E(c) provides the Commission with rulemaking authority to prescribe
how any margin received by a security-based swap dealer with respect to cleared security-based
swap transactions may be maintained, accounted for, treated and dealt with by the security-based
swap dealer. 404 In addition, Section 3E(g) extended the customer protections of the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code to counterparties of a security-based swap dealer with respect to cleared
security-based swaps, and with respect to non-cleared security-based swaps, if there is a
customer protection requirement under Section 15(c)(3) or a segregation requirement prescribed
by the Commission. 405 The Commission has proposed Rule 18a-4 under the Exchange Act to
establish segregation requirements for security-based swap dealers with respect to both cleared
and non-cleared security-based swap transactions. 406 The provisions of proposed Rule 18a-4
were modeled on the broker-dealer customer protection rule and take into account the
characteristics of security-based swaps. 407
(b) Entity-Level Requirements
Entity-level requirements in Title VII primarily address concerns relating to the securitybased swap dealer as a whole, with a particular focus on safety and soundness of the entity to
reduce systemic risk in the U.S. financial system. 408 The most significant entity-level
requirements, as discussed below, are capital and margin requirements. Certain other entitylevel requirements relate to the capital and margin requirements because, at their core, they relate
to how the firm identifies and manages its risk exposure arising from its activities (e.g., risk
management requirements). Given their functions, these entity-level requirements would be

For example, Section 15F(e)(3) of the Exchange Act provides that the requirements relating to
capital and margin imposed by the Commission pursuant to Section 15F(e)(2) shall help ensure
the safety and soundness of the security-based swap dealer and be appropriate for the risk
associated with the non-cleared security-based swaps held as a security-based swap dealer in
order “[t]o offset the greater risk to the security-based swap dealer . . . and the financial system
arising from the use of security-based swaps that are not cleared.”

116

applied under our proposal on a firm-wide basis to address risks to the security-based swap
dealer as a whole.
i.

Capital

The Commission is required to establish minimum requirements relating to capital for
security-based swap dealers for which there is not a prudential regulator (“nonbank securitybased swap dealers”). 409 The prudential regulators are required to establish requirements relating
to capital for bank security-based swap dealers. 410 Some security-based swap dealers may also
be registered as swap dealers with the CFTC. The CFTC is required to establish capital
requirements for nonbank swap dealers. 411 The prudential regulators are required to establish
capital requirements for bank swap dealers. 412
The objective of the Commission’s proposed capital rule for security-based swap dealers
is the same as the Commission’s capital rule for broker-dealers; specifically, to ensure that the
entity maintains at all times sufficient liquid assets to (i) promptly satisfy its liabilities—the
claims of customers, creditors, and other security-based swap dealers, and (ii) provide a cushion
of liquid assets in excess of liabilities to cover potential market, credit, and other risks. 413
As noted above, the Commission’s proposed capital rules focus on the liquid assets of a
nonbank security-based swap dealer available to satisfy its liabilities or cover its risks in a
liquidation scenario. This focus on liquid assets would distinguish the Commission’s capital
rules applicable to security-based swap dealers from those applicable to banks, which generally
include a more permissive list of assets that may be taken into account for purposes of capital
calculations. 414 The difference in approach between the capital rules applicable to nonbank

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, 77 FR at 70218 (“[T]he capital and
other financial responsibility requirements for broker-dealers generally provide a reasonable
template for crafting the corresponding requirements for nonbank [security-based swap dealers].
For example, among other considerations, the objectives of capital standards for both types of
entities are similar.”).

414

See, e.g., Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (“BCBS”), Basel III: International
framework for liquidity risk measurement, standards and monitoring for banks (Dec. 2010)
(“Basel III”), available at: http://www.bis.org/publ/bcbs188.pdf.

117

dealers and bank dealers is supported by certain operational, policy, and legal differences
between nonbank security-based swap dealers and bank security-based swap dealers. 415
Notably, existing capital standards for banks and broker-dealers reflect, in part, differences in
their funding models and access to certain types of financial support, and we expect that those
same differences also will exist between bank security-based swap dealers and nonbank securitybased swap dealers. For example, banks obtain funding through customer deposits and can
generally obtain liquidity through the Federal Reserve’s discount window to meet their
obligations, 416 whereas broker-dealers and nonbank security-based swap dealers cannot. 417 Thus
all of a nonbank entity’s counterparty obligations must be met through the nonbank entity’s own
liquid assets. For these reasons, the Commission’s proposed capital standard for nonbank
security-based swap dealers is a net liquid assets test modeled on the broker-dealer capital
standard in Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act. 418
ii.

Margin

Margin may be viewed as an entity-level requirement given its effect on the financial
soundness of an entity, as well as a transaction-level requirement due to the fact that margin is
calculated based on particular transactions and positions. Although margin is calculated based
on individual transactions, the cumulative effect of collecting margin from counterparties is to
protect an entity from the default of its counterparties. Given the emphasis placed on the
financial soundness of security-based swap dealers in Title VII, 419 we believe that margin should
be treated as an entity-level requirement for purposes of implementing Title VII in the crossborder context.
415

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, 77 FR at 70218. In this release, the
Commission discussed the operational, policy, and legal differences between banks and nonbank
entities for distinguishing the Commission’s capital rules from those applicable to bank securitybased swap dealers.

416

Depository institutions that maintain transaction accounts or non-personal time deposits subject to
reserve requirements are eligible to borrow funds from the Federal Reserve’s discount window,
such as commercial banks, thrift institutions, and U.S. branches and agencies of foreign banks.
See Regulation D, 12 CFR § 204.

417

Under the segregation requirements in Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act and proposed Rule
18a-4 under the Exchange Act, broker-dealers and security-based swap dealers are not permitted
to rehypothecate customer assets to finance their business activity. Thus, they cannot use
customer assets as a source of funding, whereas banks are in the business of investing customer
deposits (subject to banking regulations).

418

Id.

419

See, e.g., Section 15F(e)(3)(A)(i) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(e)(3)(A)(i) (stating that
Title VII’s capital and margin requirements are intended to “help ensure the safety and soundness
of the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant”). In setting capital
and margin requirements for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants, the Commission’s goal is to help ensure the safety and soundness of these entities
because of their connection to the U.S. financial system.

118

We recognize that this approach differs from the approach to margin proposed by the
CFTC in its cross-border guidance, which focused on the transaction-by-transaction nature of
margin and thus treated it as a transaction-level requirement. 420 However, we preliminarily
believe that treating margin as an entity-level requirement is consistent with the role margin
plays as part of an integrated program of financial responsibility requirements, along with the
capital standards and segregation requirements, that are intended to enhance the financial
integrity of security-based swap dealers. 421 The margin requirements proposed by the
Commission are intended to work in tandem with the capital requirements to strengthen the
financial system by reducing the potential for default to an acceptable level and limiting the
amount of leverage that can be employed by security-based swap dealers and other market
participants. 422 For example, the capital requirements proposed by the Commission take into
account whether a security-based swap is cleared or non-cleared, the amount of margin collateral
imposed by registered clearing agencies with respect to cleared security-based swaps, and the
circumstances where non-cleared security-based swaps are excepted from the margin collection
requirements imposed by the Commission, and would impose a capital charge in certain cases
for uncollateralized or insufficiently collateralized exposures arising from cleared or non-cleared
security-based swaps in order to account for the counterparty default risk that is not adequately
addressed by margin collateral. 423 We preliminarily do not believe that margin would effectively
fulfill its purpose as part of a comprehensive financial responsibility program for non-bank
security-based swap dealers if the Commission were to treat margin solely as a transaction-level
requirement.
The division of regulatory responsibilities related to margin requirements in Title VII
mirrors that of the capital requirements discussed above. As with capital, the Commission is
required to establish minimum requirements relating to initial and variation margin on all
security-based swaps that are not cleared by a registered clearing agency for nonbank securitybased swap dealers. 424 The prudential regulators are required to establish requirements relating
to margin for bank security-based swap dealers. 425 Security-based swap dealers that are also
registered as swap dealers with the CFTC also would be subject to CFTC requirements for
nonbank swap dealers with respect to initial and variation margin requirements on all swaps that
are not cleared by a registered derivatives clearing organization. 426

Dealers and Major Swap Participants, 76 FR 23732 (Apr. 28, 2011) (“CFTC Margin Proposal”).

119

The objective of the margin requirements for security-based swap dealers is to offset the
greater risk to the security-based swap dealer and the financial system arising from the use of
security-based swaps that are not cleared. 427 Margin serves as a buffer in the event a
counterparty fails to meet an obligation to the security-based swap dealer and the security-based
swap dealer must liquidate the assets posted by the counterparty to satisfy the obligation. 428
More generally, under Title VII, the Commission is specifically required to set both capital and
margin requirements for nonbank security-based swap dealers that (i) help ensure the safety and
soundness of the nonbank security-based swap dealer and (ii) are appropriate for the risk
associated with the non-cleared swaps held as a security-based swap dealer. 429
Pursuant to Section 15F(e) of the Exchange Act, the Commission has proposed Rule 18a3 to establish margin requirements for nonbank security-based swap dealers with respect to noncleared security-based swaps. 430 Proposed Rule 18a-3 is based on the margin rules applicable to
broker-dealers. 431 The goal of modeling proposed Rule 18a-3 on the broker-dealer margin rules
is to promote consistency with existing rules and to facilitate the portfolio margining of securitybased swaps with other types of securities. 432 Proposed Rule 18a-3 is intended to form part of
an integrated program of financial responsibility requirements, along with the proposed capital
and segregation standards. 433
The Commission preliminarily believes that it is necessary to treat margin as an entitylevel requirement applicable to all of a dealer’s security-based swap transactions in order to
effectively address the Dodd-Frank Act requirements for setting margin. We preliminarily
believe that treating margin solely as a transaction-level requirement, and applying margin
requirements differently to a security-based swap dealer’s U.S. Business and Foreign
The CFTC also has adopted segregation requirements for cleared swaps and proposed segregation
requirements for non-cleared swaps. See Protection of Cleared Swaps Customer Contracts and

Business, 434 would not adequately further the goals of using margin to ensure the safety and
soundness of security-based swap dealers because it could result in security-based swap dealers
with global businesses collecting significantly less collateral than would otherwise be required to
the extent that they are not required by local law to collect margin from their counterparties.
Further, separately applying margin in this way would force those counterparties entering into
transactions that constitute the U.S. Business of a dealer to bear a greater burden in ensuring the
safety and soundness of such dealer than counterparties that are part of the dealer’s Foreign
Business. 435 We thus preliminarily believe that it is appropriate to treat margin as an entity-level
requirement applicable to the security-based swap transactions of registered security-based swap
dealers regardless of the location of their counterparties. As noted below, the Commission is
soliciting comment on this approach.
iii.

Risk Management

Registered security-based swap dealers are required to establish robust and professional
risk management systems adequate for managing their day-to-day business. 436 The Commission
has proposed that nonbank security-based swap dealers would be required to comply with
existing Rule 15c3-4 under the Exchange Act. 437 This rule, originally adopted for OTC
derivative dealers, requires firms subject to its provisions to establish, document, and maintain a
comprehensive system of internal risk management controls to assist in managing the risks
associated with its business activities, including market, credit, leverage, liquidity, legal, and
operational risks. 438 These various risks arise from both the U.S. Business and Foreign Business
of a global security-based swap dealer. A risk management system limited in scope to cover
only one type of business, or limited to certain security-based swap transactions, would not
effectively control the risks undertaken by a security-based swap dealer because the risks
stemming from business outside the scope of such risk management system could still negatively
impact the dealer. As a result, we preliminarily believe that it is necessary to treat risk
434

See proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(2) under the Exchange Act (defining “Foreign Business”).

435

Although we do not believe that it is appropriate to distinguish between the geographic locations
of counterparties when applying the margin requirement, we recognize that it may be appropriate,
in certain circumstances, to distinguish between types of counterparties in applying margin based
on such factors as the risk they pose to dealers and the policy goal of promoting liquidity in
dealers. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, 77 FR at 70265-68 (proposing
to exclude both transactions with commercial end users and those with other dealers from certain
margin requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers).

CFR § 240.15c3–4; Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, 77 FR at 70250-51.
The Commission has not proposed rules relating to risk management for bank security-based
swap dealers.

management requirements as entity-level requirements in order to place risk controls over the
entire security-based swap business, thus effectively addressing the Dodd-Frank Act
requirements for managing risk within security-based swap dealers.
Rule 15c3-4 identifies a number of qualitative factors that would need to be a part of the
risk management controls of a nonbank security-based swap dealer. For example, a nonbank
security-based swap dealer would need to have a risk control unit that reports directly to senior
management and is independent from business trading units, and it would be required to separate
duties between personnel responsible for entering into a transaction and those responsible for
recording the transaction in the books and records of the firm. 439 In addition, the Commission is
authorized to adopt rules governing documentation standards of security-based swap dealers for
timely and accurate confirmation, processing, netting, documentation, and valuation of securitybased swaps. 440 Pursuant to this authority, the Commission has proposed rules regarding trade
acknowledgement and verification related to security-based swap transactions. 441
iv.

Recordkeeping and Reporting

Registered nonbank security-based swap dealers are required to keep books and records
in such form and manner and for such period as may be prescribed by the Commission by rule or
regulation; registered bank security-based swap dealers are required to keep books and records of
all activities related to their “business as a security-based swap dealer” in such form and manner
and for such period as may be prescribed by the Commission.442 Registered security-based swap
dealers also are required to make such reports as are required by the Commission regarding the
transactions and positions, and financial condition of the registrant. 443
In addition, security-based swap dealers are required to maintain daily trading records of
the security-based swaps they enter into. 444 Security-based swap dealers also are required to
disclose to the Commission and the prudential regulators information concerning: (i) terms and
conditions of their security-based swaps; (ii) security-based swap trading operations,
mechanisms, and practices; (iii) financial integrity protections relating to security-based swaps;
and (iv) other information relevant to their trading in security-based swaps. 445
Each of these types of records is an important part of the Commission’s oversight of our
registrants because it provides the Commission with vital information regarding such entities. If

the Commission’s information were limited in scope to cover only one type of business, or
limited to only certain security-based swap activities, the Commission would not be able to
effectively regulate our registered security-based swap dealers because it would not have a full
picture of the business of such registrants. As a result, we preliminarily believe that it is
necessary to treat recordkeeping and reporting as entity-level requirements in order to provide
the Commission with the information necessary to regulate registered security-based swap
dealers and thus effectively address the Dodd-Frank Act requirements for maintaining books and
records.
The Commission has not yet proposed rules regarding the recordkeeping and reporting
requirements under Section 15F of the Exchange Act and solicits comment regarding the
application of recordkeeping and reporting requirements in the cross-border context.
v.

Internal System and Controls

Security-based swap dealers are required to establish and enforce systems and procedures
to obtain any information that is necessary to perform any of the functions that are required
under Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act 446 and to provide this information to the Commission,
or the responsible prudential regulator, upon request. 447 The Commission has proposed a rule
that would require a registered security-based swap dealer to establish policies and procedures
that are reasonably designed to comply with its responsibilities under Section 15F(j) of the
Exchange Act. 448
Many of the functions required under Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act are entity-level
in nature (e.g., risk management procedures 449 and conflicts of interest 450). As a result, we
preliminarily believe that the requirement to establish and enforce systems and procedures to
obtain any information that is necessary to perform these functions cannot be effectively
implemented unless it also is treated as an entity-level requirement, or else it would not cover the
full scope of the requirements under Section 15F(j) of the Exchange Act to which it applies.
446

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j). These functions include monitoring of applicable position limits under
Section 15F(j)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j)(1); establishment of risk management
procedures under Section 15F(j)(2) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j)(2); disclosure of
general information to the Commission and prudential regulators under Section 15F(j)(3) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j)(3); establishment of policies and procedures to avoid conflicts
of interest under Section 15F(j)(5) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j)(5); and avoidance of
any actions that result in an unreasonable restraint of trade or place any material anticompetitive
burden on trading or clearing under Section 15F(j)(6) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o10(j)(6).

vi.

Diligent Supervision

The Commission is authorized under the Dodd-Frank Act to adopt rules requiring diligent
supervision of the business of security-based swap dealers. 451 The Commission has proposed a
rule that would establish supervisory obligations and that would incorporate principles from
Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act and existing SRO rules. 452 Among other things, under
proposed Rule 15Fh-3(h), a security-based swap dealer would be required to establish, maintain,
and enforce a system to supervise, and would be required to supervise diligently, its business and
its associated persons, with a view to preventing violations of applicable federal securities laws,
and the rules and regulations thereunder, relating to its business as a security-based swap
dealer. 453 The rule proposed by the Commission also would establish certain minimum
requirements relating to the supervisory systems that are prescriptive in nature, that is, they
would impose specific obligations on security-based swap dealers. 454
As previously noted, the purpose of diligent supervision requirements is to prevent
violations of applicable federal securities laws, and the rules and regulations thereunder, relating
to an entity’s business as a security-based swap dealer. An entity’s business as a security-based
swap dealer is not limited to either its Foreign Business or its U.S. Business, but rather is
comprised of its entire global security-based swap dealing activity. As a result, we preliminarily
believe that it is necessary to treat diligent supervision as an entity-level requirement applicable
to all of a dealer’s security-based swap transactions in order to effectively address the DoddFrank Act requirements for diligent supervision. We believe that treating diligent supervision
solely as a transaction-level requirement, and applying supervisory requirements differently to a
security-based swap dealer’s U.S. Business and Foreign Business, would not further the DoddFrank Act goal of establishing effective supervisory systems for security-based swap dealers.
vii.

Conflicts of Interest

Section 15F(j)(5) of the Exchange Act requires security-based swap dealers to implement
conflict-of-interest systems and procedures. Such policies and procedures must establish
structural and institutional safeguards to ensure that the activities of any person within the firm
relating to research or analysis of the price or market for any security-based swap, or acting in
the role of providing clearing activities, or making determinations as to accepting clearing
customers are separated by appropriate informational partitions within the firm from the review,
pressure, or oversight of persons whose involvement in pricing, trading, or clearing activities
might potentially bias their judgment or supervision, and contravene the core principles of open
451

See Section 15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(1)(B).

access and the business conduct standards addressed in Title VII. 455 The Commission has
proposed a rule that would require a security-based swap dealer to establish policies and
procedures that are reasonably designed to comply with its responsibilities under Section
15F(j)(5). 456
The Commission preliminarily believes that it is necessary to treat conflicts of interest as
an entity-level requirement applicable to all of a dealer’s security-based swap transactions in
order to effectively address the Dodd-Frank Act requirements for setting systems and procedures
to prevent conflicts of interest from biasing the judgment or supervision of security-based swap
dealers. We believe that treating conflicts of interest solely as a transaction-level requirement,
and applying the required structural and institutional safeguards differently to a security-based
swap dealer’s U.S. Business and Foreign Business, would not further the goals of preventing
conflicts of interest from influencing the security-based swap dealing activities of registered
security-based swap dealers because such safeguards would only be in place for a portion of a
security-based swap dealer’s activities.
viii.

Chief Compliance Officer

Registered security-based swap dealers are required to designate a chief compliance
officer who reports directly to the board of directors or to the senior officer of the security-based
swap dealer. 457 The chief compliance officer’s responsibilities include reviewing and ensuring
compliance of the security-based swap dealer with applicable requirements in the Exchange Act,
and the rules and regulations thereunder, resolution of conflicts of interest, administration of
business conduct policies and procedures, and establishment of procedures for the remediation of
noncompliance issues. 458 The chief compliance officer also is required to prepare and sign a
report that contains a description of the security-based swap dealer’s compliance with applicable
requirements in the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, and each of the
security-based swap dealer’s policies and procedures. 459 The Commission has proposed a rule to
implement these statutory requirements relating to the designation and functions of a chief
compliance officer. 460
As noted above, part of the chief compliance officer’s responsibilities, under the
proposed rule, include establishing, maintaining, and reviewing policies and procedures
455

See Section 15F(j)(5) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(j)(5), as discussed in the External

reasonably designed to ensure compliance with applicable requirements in the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. 461 Many of Title VII requirements, such as those applicable
to security-based swap dealers that are described in this section, apply at the entity level. As a
result, we preliminarily believe that it is necessary to treat the chief compliance officer as an
entity-level requirement applicable to all of a dealer’s security-based swap business in order to
effectively address the Dodd-Frank Act requirements for the chief compliance officer. We
believe that treating the chief compliance officer solely as a transaction-level requirement, and
applying the chief compliance officer requirements differently to a security-based swap dealer’s
U.S. Business and Foreign Business, would be unworkable given the chief compliance officer’s
oversight responsibilities over entity-level requirements and thus would not further the goals of
establishing the chief compliance officer role for security-based swap dealers.
ix.

Inspection and Examination

Registered bank and nonbank security-based swap dealers are obligated to keep their
books and records required pursuant to Commission rules and regulations open to inspection and
examination by any representative of the Commission. 462 The Commission has proposed a rule
that would require, among other things, “nonresident security-based swap dealers” that are
required to register with the Commission to appoint and identify to the Commission an agent in
the United States (other than the Commission or a Commission member, official, or employee)
for service of process. 463 In addition, the proposed rule would require that a nonresident
security-based swap dealer certify that the firm can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission
with prompt access to its books and records and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite
inspection and examination by the Commission. 464 The proposed rule also would require that
the nonresident security-based swap dealer provide the Commission with an opinion of counsel
concurring that the firm can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt access to

461

See Proposed Rule 15Fk-1(b)(2) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in the External Business
Conduct Standards Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42435-36.

462

See Section 15F(f)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(f)(1)(C). Registered bank
security-based swap dealers are only required to keep the books and records associated with the
activities related to their security-based swap dealing business, as prescribed by the Commission,
and to make these books and records available for inspection by any representative of the
Commission. See id.

Release, 76 FR at 65799. For a description of the term “nonresident security-based swap dealer”

differs from the definition of the term “foreign security-based swap dealer” as proposed in this
release, see note 579 above.

Release, 76 FR at 65800.

its books and records and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by
the Commission.465
In proposing this rule, the Commission stated that it preliminarily believed that the
nonresident security-based swap certification and supporting opinion of counsel were important
to confirm that each registered nonresident security-based swap dealer has taken the necessary
steps to be in the position to provide the Commission with prompt access to its books and
records and to be subject to inspection and examination by the Commission. 466 To effectively
fulfill our regulatory oversight responsibilities with respect to nonresident security-based swap
dealers registered with it, the Commission stated that it must have access to those entities’
records and the ability to examine them. The Commission recognized, however, that certain
foreign jurisdictions may have laws that complicate the ability of financial institutions, such as
nonresident security-based swap dealers located in their jurisdictions, to share and/or transfer
certain information including personal financial data of individuals that the financial institutions
come to possess from third persons (e.g., personal data relating to the identity of market
participants or their customers). 467 The Commission further stated that the required certification
and opinion of counsel regarding the nonresident security-based swap dealer’s ability to provide
prompt access to books and records and to be subject to inspection and examination would allow
the Commission to better evaluate a nonresident security-based swap dealer’s ability to meet the
requirements of registration and ongoing supervision. 468
The Commission’s inspection and examination authority is vital to our oversight of
registered security-based swap dealers. If the Commission’s inspection and examination were
limited in scope to cover only one type of business, or limited to only certain security-based
swap activities, the Commission would not be able to effectively regulate our registered securitybased swap dealers because it would not have a full picture of the business of such registrants.
As a result, we preliminarily believe that it is necessary to treat inspection and examination
requirements as entity-level in order to provide the Commission with the information and access
necessary to regulate registered security-based swap dealers.
x.

Licensing Requirements and Statutory Disqualification

The Commission has not proposed any licensing requirements for associated persons of
registered security-based swap dealers, that are specifically related to their security-based swap
dealing activities. However, the Commission has proposed a rule that would require securitybased swap dealers (and major security-based swap participants) to certify that no person
associated with such entities who effects or is involved in effecting security-based swaps on their
behalf is subject to statutory disqualification, as defined in Section 3(a)(39) of the Exchange

Release, 76 FR at 65799-801.

Act. 469 This proposed rule relates to paragraph (b)(6) of Section 15F of the Exchange Act, 470
which generally prohibits security-based swap dealers (and major security-based swap
participants) from permitting any of their associated persons 471 who are subject to a “statutory
disqualification” to effect or be involved in effecting 472 security-based swaps on behalf of such
entities if the security-based swap dealer (or major security-based swap participant) knew, or in
the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of the statutory disqualification. 473
The Commission preliminarily believes that it is necessary to treat requirements related to
licensing and statutory disqualification as entity-level requirements applicable to all of a dealer’s
security-based swap business in order to effectively address the Exchange Act’s statutory
disqualification provision. We believe that treating licensing requirements and statutory
disqualification solely as transaction-level requirements, and applying the statutory
disqualification differently to a security-based swap dealer’s U.S. Business and Foreign
Business, would not further the goals of preventing statutorily disqualified persons from
effecting security-based swaps on behalf of registered security-based swap dealers because such
disqualifications would only be in place for a portion of a security-based swap dealer’s activities.

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(b)(6).

471

Section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(70), generally defines the term “person
associated with” a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant (“SBS
Entity”) to include: (i) any partner, officer, director, or branch manager of an SBS Entity (or any
person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions); (ii) any person directly or
indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with an SBS Entity; or (iii) any
employee of an SBS Entity. However, it generally excludes persons whose functions are solely
clerical or ministerial.

472

As stated in the Registration Proposing Release, “[t]he Commission believes that associated
persons ‘involved in effecting’ security-based swaps would include, but not be limited to, persons
involved in drafting and negotiating master agreements and confirmations, persons
recommending security-based swap transactions to counterparties, persons on a trading desk
actively involved in effecting security-based swap transactions, persons pricing security-based
swap positions and managing collateral for the [security-based swap dealer or major securitybased swap participant], and persons assuring that the [security-based swap dealer’s or major
security-based swap participant’s] security-based swap business operates in compliance with
applicable regulations. In short, the term would encompass persons engaged in functions
necessary to facilitate the [security-based swap dealer’s or major security-based swap
participant’s] security-based swap business.” Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65795

4. Application of Certain Transaction-Level Requirements 474
(a) Proposed Rule
The Commission is proposing a rule that would provide that a registered foreign securitybased swap dealer and a foreign branch of a registered U.S. security-based swap dealer, with
respect to their Foreign Business, shall not be subject to the requirements relating to external
business conduct standards described in Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act, 475 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, other than the rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission
pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B). 476
The proposed rule would define “Foreign Business” as security-based swap transactions
entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on behalf of a foreign security-based swap dealer
or a U.S. security-based swap dealer that do not include its U.S. Business. 477 The proposed rule
would define “U.S. Business” as:
•

With respect to a foreign security-based swap dealer, (i) any transaction entered into,
or offered to be entered into, by or on behalf of such foreign security-based swap
dealer, with a U.S. person (other than with a foreign branch), or (ii) any transaction
conducted within the United States; 478 and

•

With respect to a U.S. security-based swap dealer, any transaction by or on behalf of
such U.S. security-based swap dealer, wherever entered into or offered to be entered
into, other than a transaction conducted through a foreign branch with a non-U.S.
person or another foreign branch. 479

474

For purposes of this discussion, we are addressing only requirements applicable to security-based
swap dealers in Sections 3E and 15F of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-5 and 78o-10, and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Title VII requirements relating to reporting and dissemination,
clearing, and trade execution are discussed in Sections VIII - X, infra.

475

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h).

476

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(c) under the Exchange Act. The approach under the proposed rule does
not affect applicability of the general antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws to the
activity of a foreign security-based swap dealer. See Section XII, infra.

477

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(2) under the Exchange Act.

478

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(6) under the Exchange Act. A person that meets the security-based
swap dealer definition is a dealer with regard to all of its security-based swap activities, not just
its dealing activities. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30645.
Accordingly, a foreign security-based swap dealer’s U.S. Business would not be limited only to
transactions arising from its dealing activity, but rather would include all types of security-based
swap activity.

479

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(6) under the Exchange Act.

129

Whether the activity occurred within the United States or with a U.S. person for purposes of
identifying whether security-based swap transactions are part of a U.S. Business or Foreign
Business would turn on the same factors used to determine whether a foreign security-based
swap dealer is engaging in dealing activity within the United States or with U.S. persons, as
discussed above. 480 The proposed rule provides that a U.S. security-based swap dealer would be
considered to have conducted a security-based swap transaction through a foreign branch if:
•

The foreign branch is the counterparty to such security-based swap transaction; and

•

No person within the United States is directly involved in soliciting, negotiating, or
executing the security-based swap transaction on behalf of the foreign branch or its
counterparty. 481

As discussed above, 482 the proposed rule would define “foreign branch” as any branch of a U.S.
bank if:
•

The branch is located outside the United States;

•

The branch operates for valid business reasons; and

•

The branch is engaged in the business of banking and is subject to substantive
banking regulation in the jurisdiction where located. 483

All other requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, would apply to both U.S. and foreign security-based swap dealers registered with the
Commission, although the Commission is proposing to establish a policy and procedural
framework under which it would consider permitting substituted compliance for foreign securitybased swap dealers (but not for U.S. security-based swap dealers that conduct dealing activity
through foreign branches) under certain circumstances, as discussed below. 484
The Commission also is proposing a rule that would provide that a foreign security-based
swap dealer would not be required to comply with the segregation requirements set forth in
Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, with respect to

480

See Section III.B.6, supra (discussing the proposed definition of “transaction conducted within
the United States”).

481

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4) under the Exchange Act. See also proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5)(ii)

States” shall not include a transaction conducted through a foreign branch).

security-based transactions with non-U.S. person counterparties in certain circumstances. 485
Specifically, the Commission is proposing a rule that would provide the following:
•

(b) Discussion
i.

External Business Conduct Standards
a. Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealers

The Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate not to impose on foreign
security-based swap dealers the external business conduct standards in Section 15F(h) (other
than rules and requirements prescribed by the Commission pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B)) of
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, described in the proposed rule, 491
with respect to their Foreign Business, because these requirements relate primarily to customer
protection. The Dodd-Frank Act’s counterparty protection mandate focuses on the United States
and the U.S. markets. 492 In addition, we preliminarily believe that foreign counterparties
typically would not expect to receive the customer protections of Title VII when dealing with a
foreign security-based swap dealer outside the United States. At the same time, our proposed
487

Proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act.

approach would preserve customer protections for U.S. counterparties that would expect to
benefit from the protection afforded to them by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that requiring foreign security-based
swap dealers to comply with the external business conduct standards requirement with respect to
their security-based swap transactions conducted outside the United States with non-U.S. persons
(or with foreign branches of U.S. banks) would not advance this statutory purpose. Although
this approach represents a departure from the entity approach the Commission has traditionally
taken in the regulation of foreign broker-dealers, as discussed above, whereby the Commission
applies our regulations to the entire global business of a registered broker-dealer, we
preliminarily believe this departure is appropriate in the context of a global security-based swap
market in order to create a regulatory framework that provides effective protections for
counterparties that are U.S. persons while recognizing the role of foreign regulators in non-U.S.
markets.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that this approach addresses many of the
concerns raised by commenters, including foreign regulators, concerning the potential
application of Title VII to transactions between registered foreign security-based swap dealers
and non-U.S. counterparties. In addition, this approach is consistent with the reasonable
expectations of U.S. person counterparties, who would expect to receive the protection of
external business conduct standards and conflicts of interest requirements when dealing with a
foreign security-based swap dealer within the United States. 493
The Commission’s proposed approach to external business conduct standards would not
except foreign security-based swap dealers from the rules and requirements prescribed by the
Commission pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act with respect to their Foreign
Business. 494 Section 15F(h)(1)(B) requires security-based swap dealers to conform with such
business conduct standards relating to diligent supervision as the Commission shall prescribe. 495
The Commission preliminarily believes that it is not appropriate to except foreign security-based
swap dealers from compliance with such requirements. Because registered foreign securitybased swap dealers would be subject to a number of obligations under the federal securities laws
with respect to their security-based swap business, the Commission preliminarily believes that
having systems in place reasonably designed to ensure diligent supervision would be an
important aspect of their compliance with the federal securities laws. However, as discussed
below, the Commission is proposing to permit substituted compliance with the diligent
supervision requirement in Section 15F(h)(1)(B), and the rules and regulations thereunder, by
foreign security-based swap dealers. 496 The Commission preliminarily believes that foreign
security-based swap dealers subject to regulation in a foreign jurisdiction are very likely to be

requirements).

496

See Section XI.C, infra.

133

subject to diligent supervision requirements and to the extent that such requirements are
comparable to Commission requirements, we would consider permitting substituted compliance,
as discussed below. 497
The Commission is proposing to except foreign security-based swap dealers from
complying with the rules and regulations that the Commission may prescribe pursuant to Section
15F(h)(1)(A) or (C) of the Exchange Act. 498 Section 15F(h)(1)(A) requires security-based swap
dealers to conform with such business conduct standards relating to fraud, manipulation, and
other abusive practices involving security-based swaps (including security-based swaps that are
offered but not entered into) as prescribed by the Commission. Section 15F(h)(1)(C) requires
security-based swap dealers to adhere to rules and regulations prescribed by the Commission
with respect to applicable position limits. The Commission has not engaged in rulemaking
pursuant to these provisions. 499 If the Commission does propose rules pursuant to these
provisions in the future, the Commission would consider, at that time, whether it would be
appropriate to subject foreign security-based swap dealers to such requirements with respect to
their Foreign Business.
b. U.S. Security-Based Swap Dealers
The Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate not to subject U.S. securitybased swap dealers to the external business conduct standards in Section 15F(h) (other than
Section 15F(h)(1)(B)) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, as specified
in the proposed rule, with respect to security-based swap transactions conducted through their
foreign branches outside the United States with non-U.S. counterparties, because such
requirements relate primarily to customer protection requirements. The Dodd-Frank Act
generally is concerned with the protection of U.S. markets and participants in those markets. 500
Therefore, we preliminarily believe that subjecting U.S. security-based swap dealers to the Title
VII customer protection requirements with respect to their security-based swap transactions
conducted through their foreign branches outside the United States (even though the transactions
may pose risk to the U.S. financial system) with non-U.S. persons would produce little or no
benefit to U.S. market participants. Although this approach would represent a departure from the
497

See id.

498

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(1)(A) and (C).

499

Although the Commission has not proposed rules under Section 15F(h)(1)(A) of the Exchange
Act, the Commission has proposed new Rule 9j-1 under the Exchange Act, which is intended to
prevent fraud, manipulation, and deception in connection with the offer, purchase, or sale of any
security-based swap, the exercise of any right or performance of any obligation under a securitybased swap, or the avoidance of such exercise or performance. See Prohibition Against Fraud,
Manipulation, and Deception in Connection with Security-Based Swaps, Exchange Act Release
No. 63236 (Nov. 3, 2010), 75 FR 68560 (Nov. 8, 2010). The Commission’s view of its antifraud
enforcement authority in the cross-border context is described in further detail in Section XI
below.

500

See note 4, supra.

134

entity approach the Commission has traditionally taken in the regulation of broker-dealers,
whereby the Commission applies our regulations to the entire global business of a registered
broker-dealer, we preliminarily believe it is appropriate in the context of a global security-based
swap market in order to develop a national regulatory framework that provides effective
protections for counterparties who are U.S. persons while recognizing the role of foreign
regulators in non-U.S. markets.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that this approach would help address the
potential application of duplicative and conflicting regulatory requirements to security-based
swap transactions between the foreign branches of registered U.S. bank security-based swap
dealers and non-U.S. counterparties. In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes this
approach is consistent with the reasonable expectations of foreign counterparties, who would not
necessarily expect to receive the protections of Title VII when dealing with a foreign branch of a
U.S. bank outside the United States, even if it is registered as a security-based swap dealer with
the Commission.501
The purpose of the proposed provision defining when a security-based swap transaction
would be considered to have been conducted through a foreign branch is intended to prevent
U.S. security-based swap dealers from using the proposed rule to evade the application of Title
VII. 502 Requiring that the foreign branch be the named counterparty to the security-based swap
transaction and that no person within the United States be directly involved in soliciting,
negotiating, or executing the security-based swap transaction on behalf of the foreign branch or
its counterparty is intended to help ensure that the security-based swap transaction occurs outside
the United States, even though the Commission recognizes that the risk of the transaction would
ultimately be borne by the U.S. security-based swap dealer, of which the foreign branch is
merely a part. 503 The U.S. security-based swap dealer would still be subject to the entity-level
requirements described above intended to address the risk the transactions pose to the U.S.
financial system.
ii.

Segregation Requirements

The segregation requirements set forth in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and rules and
regulations thereunder, are closely tied to U.S. bankruptcy laws. 504 Subchapter III of Chapter 7,
Title 11 of the United States Code (the “stockbroker liquidation provisions”) 505 provides special
protections for “customers” of stockbrokers. Among other protections, “customers” share
501

See note 321, supra. The proposed definition of foreign branch is the same as discussed above.

ratably with other customers ahead of virtually all other creditors in the “customer property” held
by the failed stockbroker. 506 The Dodd-Frank Act contains provisions designed to ensure that
cash and securities held by a security-based swap dealer relating to security-based swaps will be
deemed customer property under the stockbroker liquidation provisions. 507 In particular, Section
3E(g) of the Exchange Act 508 provides, among other things, that a security-based swap shall be
considered to be a “security” as such term is used in section 101(53A)(B) 509 and the stockbroker
liquidation provisions. Section 3E(g) also provides that an account that holds a security-based
swap shall be considered to be a “securities account” as that term is defined in the stockbroker
liquidation provisions.510 In addition, Section 3E(g) provides that the terms “purchase” and
“sale” as defined in Sections 3(a)(13) and (14) of the Exchange Act, respectively, shall be
applied to the terms “purchase” and “sale” as used in the stockbroker liquidation provisions. 511
Finally, Section 3E(g) provides that the term “customer” as defined in the stockbroker
liquidation provisions excludes any person to the extent the person has a claim based on a noncleared security-based swap transaction except to the extent of any margin delivered to or by the
customer with respect to which there is a customer protection requirement under Section 15(c)(3)
of the Exchange Act or a segregation requirement. 512
The provisions of Section 3E(g) of the Exchange Act apply the customer protection
elements of the stockbroker liquidation provisions to cleared security-based swaps, including
506

See 11 U.S.C. 752.

509

See 11 U.S.C. 101(53A)(B). Section 101(53A) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code defines a
“stockbroker” to mean a person—(A) with respect to which there is a customer, as defined in
section 741, subchapter III of chapter 7, title 11, United States Code (the definition section of the
stockbroker liquidation provisions); and (B) that is engaged in the business of effecting
transactions in securities—(i) for the account of others; or (ii) with members of the general
public, from or for such person’s own account. See 11 U.S.C. 101(53A).

See 15 U.S.C. 78c-5(g) and 11 U.S.C. 741. There is not a definition of “securities account” in 11
U.S.C. 741. The term “securities account” is used in 11 U.S.C. 741(2) and (4) in defining the
terms “customer” and “customer property.”

511

See also 15 U.S.C. 78c-5(g) and 11 U.S.C. 741-753. Section 3(a)(13) of the Exchange Act, as
amended by Section 761(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act, defines the term “purchase” to mean, in the
case of security-based swaps, the execution, termination (prior to its scheduled maturity date),
assignment, exchange, or similar transfer or conveyance of, or extinguishing of rights or
obligations under, a security-based swap, as the context may require. See 15 U.S.C. 3(a)(13).
Section 3(a)(14) of the Exchange Act, as amended by Section 761(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act,
defines the term “sale” to mean, in the case of security-based swaps, the execution, termination
(prior to its scheduled maturity date), assignment, exchange, or similar transfer or conveyance of,
or extinguishing of rights or obligations under, a security-based swap, as the context may require.

related collateral, and, if subject to customer protection requirements under Section 15(c)(3) of
the Exchange Act or a segregation requirement prescribed by the Commission, to collateral
delivered as margin for non-cleared security-based swaps. 513 The Commission has proposed
Rule 18a-4(a)-(d) to establish segregation requirements for security-based swap dealers with
respect to cleared and non-cleared security-based swaps pursuant to Section 3E of the Exchange
Act and pursuant to Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act 514 with respect to security-based swap
dealers that are broker-dealers. 515
Specifically, proposed Rule 18a-4(b) requires a security-based swap dealer to promptly
obtain and thereafter maintain physical possession or control of all excess securities collateral
carried for the accounts of security-based swap customers. Such possession or control
requirement is designed to ensure the securities held for the accounts of security-based swap
customers are under the control of the security-based swap dealer and, therefore, readily
available to be returned to security-based swap customers. Proposed Rule 18a-4(c) requires a
security-based swap dealer to maintain a special account for the exclusive benefit of securitybased swap customers and have on deposit in that account at all times an amount of cash or
qualified securities determined by computing the net amount of credits owed to customers. 516
The objective of the possession or control and special account requirements in proposed Rule
18a-4 is to facilitate the prompt return of “customer property” to security-based swap customers
either before or during a liquidation proceeding if the firm fails. In the event of a failure of the
security-based swap dealer, customers would share the “customer property” ratably with other
customers and ahead of virtually all other creditors. 517 In addition, with respect to non-cleared
security-based swaps, proposed Rule 18a-4(d) requires a security-based swap dealer to provide
the notice required under Section 3E(f)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act 518 to a counterparty in writing
prior to the execution of the first non-cleared security-based swap transaction with such
counterparty. If a counterparty to a non-cleared security-based swap elects to segregate funds or
other property with a third-party custodian pursuant to Section 3E(f) of the Exchange Act or
elects not to require the omnibus segregation of funds or other property pursuant to proposed
Rule 18a-4(c), the security-based swap dealer must obtain an agreement from such counterparty
to subordinate all claims against the security-based swap dealer to the claims of security-based

70278-88, for detailed descriptions and discussions of the proposed segregation requirements for

swap customers of such security-based swap dealer. 519
As proposed in the Capital, Margin and Segregation Proposing Release, the segregation
requirements in proposed Rule 18a-4(a)-(d) do not distinguish between U.S. security-based swap
dealers and foreign security-based swap dealers or between U.S. person and non-U.S. person
security-based swap counterparties, and do not address application of the segregation
requirements in the cross-border context. The Commission preliminarily believes that the DoddFrank Act’s mandate to promote financial stability, improve accountability, and protect
counterparties focuses territorially on the United States and the U.S. security-based swap
market 520 and, therefore, is not proposing any changes with respect to U.S. security-based swap
dealers to the segregation requirements already proposed. 521 The Commission’s proposed
approach to application of segregation requirements to foreign security-based swap dealers
intends to protect U.S. person counterparties and minimize the impact of a failed security-based
swap dealer on the U.S. financial system generally and the U.S. security-based swap market in
particular.
a. Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealers
As stated above, Section 3E(g) extends the customer protection provided by the
stockbroker liquidation provisions of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code to cleared security-based swaps
and non-cleared security-based swaps in different ways. In addition, a foreign security-based
swap dealer may not be subject to the stockbroker liquidation provisions if it is a foreign bank
with a branch or agency in the United States. 522 Such foreign security-based swap dealer’s
519

See proposed Rules 18a-4(d)(1) and (d)(2)(i) and (ii) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in the
Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, 77 FR at 70287-88. If a non-cleared
security-based swap counterparty elects to segregate funds or other property with a third-party
custodian, the subordination agreement would be conditioned on the counterparty’s funds and
other property segregated at a third-party custodian not being included in the bankruptcy estate of
the security-based swap dealer. If the election is not effective in keeping the counterparty’s assets
bankruptcy remote, then the counterparty should be treated as a security-based swap customer
with a pro rata priority claim to customer property. See proposed Rule 18a-4(d)(2)(i) under the
Exchange Act. If a non-cleared security-based swap counterparty elects not to segregate any
assets at all, the security-based swap dealer would need to obtain an unconditional subordination
agreement from the counterparty that waives segregation altogether. See proposed Rule 18a4(d)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act.

520

See note 4, supra.

521

See proposed Rules 18a-4(a) - (d) under the Exchange Act and Section 3E of the Exchange Act,
15 U.S.C. 78c-5. See also the Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, 77 FR at
70278-88.

522

See Section 109(b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 109(b) (providing that a person may
be a debtor under chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code only if such person is not, among other
things, a bank or similar institution which is an insured bank as defined in Section 3(h) of the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, or a foreign bank that has a branch or agency (as defined in
Section 1(b) of the International Banking Act of 1978) in the United States).

138

insolvency and liquidation would be subject to banking regulations. 523 On the other hand, if a
foreign security-based swap dealer is not a foreign bank with a branch or agency in the United
States, it may be subject to the stockbroker liquidation provisions 524 in a stockbroker liquidation
proceeding in a U.S. bankruptcy court. Moreover, if a foreign security-based swap dealer is a
registered broker-dealer, it is a member of the Securities Investor Protection Corporation
(“SIPC”) 525 and is subject to segregation requirements under Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange
Act, 526 and rules and regulations thereunder. 527 Such a foreign security-based swap dealer would
be subject to the liquidation proceeding under the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (the
“SIPA”). 528 Therefore, we propose an approach that would apply the segregation requirements
to a foreign security-based swap dealer depending on whether it holds assets to secure cleared
security-based swap transactions or non-cleared security-based swap transactions and whether
such foreign security-based swap dealer is a registered broker-dealer, a foreign bank with a
branch or agency in the United States, or neither of the above. 529
523

See 12 U.S.C. 1821-25. Whereas insured deposit institutions would be resolved under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks would be resolved
under either relevant state statutes, in the case of uninsured state branches, or the International
Banking Act, in the case of uninsured federal branches.

524

See note 522, supra.

525

We recognize that a very limited number of registered foreign broker-dealers who do not conduct
securities business in the United States and do not hold U.S. person customers’ funds are not
members of SIPC.

526

527

See Rule 15c3-3 under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR § 240.15c3-3.

528

See 15 U.S.C. 78aaa et seq.

529

We preliminarily believe that the proposed approach with respect to the segregation requirements
set forth in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder, is not being
applied to persons who are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the
jurisdiction of the United States,” within the meaning of Section 30(c). See Section II.B.2(a),
supra. However, the Commission also preliminary believes that the proposed approach with
respect to the segregation requirements is necessary or appropriate to help prevent the evasion of
the particular provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act that are
being implemented by the proposed approach and prophylactically will help ensure that the
purposes of those provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are not undermined. See Section II.B.2(e),
supra; see also Section II.B.2(c), supra.
For example, if the segregation requirements do not apply to the entire business of a registered
foreign security-based swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer, or do not apply to assets
received from non-U.S. person customers to secure cleared security-based swaps by a registered
foreign security-based swap dealer that is not a registered broker-dealer (and is not a foreign bank
with a branch or agency in the United States) if such foreign security-based swap dealer also
receives assets from a U.S. person customer to secure clear security-based swaps, then U.S.
security-based swap dealers would have an incentive to evade the full application of the
segregation requirements by moving their operations outside the United States. In this event,

139

We recognize that a foreign security-based swap dealer may not be subject to the
stockbroker liquidation provisions and its insolvency or liquidation proceeding in the United
States may be administered under SIPA or banking regulations concurrently with other potential
insolvency proceedings outside the United States under applicable foreign insolvency laws.
Therefore, the effectiveness of the segregation requirements with respect to a foreign securitybased swap dealer in practice may depend on many factors, including the type and objectives of
the insolvency or liquidation proceeding and how the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, SIPA, banking
regulations and applicable foreign insolvency laws are interpreted by the U.S. bankruptcy court,
SIPC, Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and relevant foreign authorities.
b. Non-Cleared Security-Based Swaps
i. Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealer That Is a Registered
Broker-Dealer
With respect to non-cleared security-based swaps, the Commission proposes to apply
segregation requirements differently to foreign security-based swap dealers depending on
whether they also are registered broker-dealers. Specifically, the Commission proposes to
require a foreign security-based swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer to segregate
margin received from all counterparties to secure non-cleared security-based swap transactions,
in accordance with Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder. 530
If a foreign security-based swap dealer is a registered broker-dealer, it already would: (i)
be subject to the customer protection requirements under Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange
Act, 531 and rules and regulations thereunder, including Rule 15c3-3 if it carries customer
securities and cash; (ii) be required to maintain possession or control of customer securities and
maintain cash or qualified securities in a special reserve account if it carries customer securities
and cash; and (iii) if it is a member of SIPC, be liquidated in a formal proceeding under the

these security-based swap dealers could use the assets collected from the non-U.S. person
counterparties for their own business purposes, and the assets segregated (i.e., assets posted by
U.S. person customers) could be insufficient to satisfy the combined priority claims of both U.S.
person and non-U.S. person customers, potentially resulting in losses to U.S. person customers in
contravention of the purposes of the customer protection framework established by the DoddFrank Act. See discussions of application of the segregation requirements to a foreign securitybased swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer with respect to non-cleared security-based
swaps in Section III.C.4(b)ii.b.i, application of the segregation requirements to a foreign securitybased swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer with respect to cleared security-based swaps
in Section III.C.4(b)ii.c.i, and application of the segregation requirements to a foreign securitybased swap dealer that is not a registered broker-dealer and is not a foreign bank with a branch or
agency in the United States in Section III.C.4(b)ii.c.ii above.

SIPA. 532 Rule 15c3-3 under Section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act provides customer protection
and defines “customer” broadly to include any person from whom or on whose behalf a broker or
dealer has received or acquired or holds funds or securities for the account of that person. 533
Therefore, if a foreign security-based swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer receives
collateral from a non-cleared security-based swap counterparty, such counterparty would be a
“customer” and is afforded customer protection with respect to such collateral under Rule 15c33. As stated above, Section 3E(g) extends “customer” status to non-cleared security-based swap
counterparties to the extent of any margin delivered to or by the counterparties with respect to
which there is a customer protection requirement under Section 15(c)(3). 534 Therefore, noncleared security-based swap counterparties of a foreign security-based swap dealer that is a
registered broker-dealer are “customers” within the meaning of the stockbroker liquidation
provisions. 535
As such, if the Commission does not require a foreign security-based swap dealer that is a
registered broker-dealer to segregate all counterparties’ assets posted to secure non-cleared
security-based swaps, in a SIPA liquidation proceeding of such foreign security-based swap
dealer and broker-dealer, 536 the pool of assets segregated pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 and proposed
Rule 18a-4 may be insufficient to satisfy the combined claims of all customers, resulting in
losses to all customers. Therefore, the Commission proposes to subject a foreign security-based
swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer to the segregation requirements set forth in Section
3E of the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder, relating to assets received from all
counterparties held as collateral to secure non-cleared security-based swap transactions.

has a claim based on any … non-cleared security-based swap except to the extent of any margin
delivered to or by the customer with respect to which there is a customer protection requirement
under section 15(c)(3) or a segregation requirement.”).

535

A non-cleared security-based swap counterparty may waive its pro rata priority claim on
customer property with other customers by executing a conditional subordination agreement
pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-4(d)(i) under the Exchange Act to affirmatively elect individual
segregation, or by executing an unconditional subordination agreement pursuant to proposed Rule
18a-4(d)(ii) under the Exchange Act to affirmatively waive segregation altogether.

536

In very limited circumstances where a foreign security-based swap dealer that is a registered
broker-dealer is not a SIPC member, it would potentially be liquidated pursuant to the
stockbroker liquidation provisions in a U.S. bankruptcy court.

141

ii. Non-Cleared Security-Based Swaps—Foreign Security-Based
Swap Dealer That is Not a Registered Broker-Dealer
If a foreign security-based swap dealer is not a registered broker-dealer, its non-cleared
security-based swap counterparties would be “customers” under the stockbroker liquidation
provisions only to the extent that there is a segregation requirement prescribed by the
Commission.537 The Commission proposes to subject such foreign security-based swap dealer to
the segregation requirements set forth in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and rules and
regulations thereunder, solely with respect to non-cleared security-based swaps with U.S. person
counterparties. 538 This approach would provide U.S. person counterparties “customer” status
under the stockbroker liquidation provisions and their assets would be segregated for their
exclusive benefit. Non-U.S. person counterparties would not be “customers” and would not have
“customer” status with respect to the segregated assets. As stated above, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the objective of the Dodd-Frank Act is to protect U.S. counterparties
and to minimize disruption to the U.S. financial system caused by a security-based swap dealer’s
failure. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed approach would
achieve the benefit intended by the segregation requirements set forth in Section 3E of the
Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder.
The Commission recognizes that a foreign security-based swap dealer that is not a
broker-dealer but is a foreign bank with a branch or agency (as defined in Section 1(b) of the
International Banking Act of 1978) 539 in the United States may not be eligible to be liquidated
pursuant to the stockbroker liquidation provisions. 540 Such foreign security-based swap dealer’s
insolvency proceeding in the United States would be administered under banking regulations. 541
Nevertheless, the Commission preliminarily believes that imposing segregation requirements on
such foreign security-based swap dealer when it receives collateral from U.S. person
counterparties would reduce the likelihood of U.S. person counterparties incurring losses by
helping identify U.S. customers’ assets in an insolvency proceeding of such foreign securitybased swap dealer in the United States and would potentially minimize disruption to the U.S.
security-based swap market, thereby producing potential benefits to the U.S. financial system
and U.S. counterparties that are consistent with the objectives of the Dodd-Frank Act.

Federal Deposit Insurance Act, uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks would be resolved

Banking Act, in the case of uninsured federal branches.

142

c. Cleared Security-Based Swaps
In applying the segregation requirements to a foreign security-based swap dealer with
respect to cleared security-based swap transactions, the Commission also proposes to distinguish
among: (1) a foreign security-based swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer; (2) a foreign
security-based swap dealer that is not a registered broker-dealer and is not a foreign bank with a
branch or agency in the United States; and (3) a foreign security-based swap dealer that is a
foreign bank with a branch or agency in the United States. In the following paragraphs, we will
discuss how we propose to apply the segregation requirements to foreign security-based swap
dealers in each of these categories with respect to assets held by them as collateral to secure
cleared security-based swaps.
i. Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealer That Is a Registered
Broker-Dealer
The proposed rule would apply segregation requirements to a foreign security-based
swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer with respect to assets received from all
counterparties to secure cleared security-based swaps. 542 As stated above, Section 3E(g) of the
Exchange Act extends customer protection under the stockbroker liquidation provisions to all
cleared security-based swap counterparties and to all non-cleared security-based swap
counterparties, with respect to which there is a customer protection requirement under Section
15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act. 543 Therefore, all security-based swap counterparties of a foreign
security-based swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer are customers under the stockbroker
liquidation provisions.544 In the absence of a Commission requirement that a foreign securitybased swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer segregate all cleared security-based swap
counterparties’ collateral, if such an entity were liquidated pursuant to SIPA, the amount of
assets segregated could be less than the combined priority claims of all security-based swap
customers, potentially resulting in losses to customers. Therefore, the Commission proposes to
subject a foreign security-based swap dealer who is a registered broker-dealer to segregation
requirements set forth in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder,
with respect to assets received from all counterparties to secure cleared security-based swaps.

542

Proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act.

543

See Section III.C.4(b)ii.b, supra.

544

A non-cleared security-based swap counterparty would be a customer of a foreign security-based
swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer and have a pro rata priority claim to customer
property under the stockbroker liquidation provisions unless it affirmatively waives segregation
altogether by executing an unconditional subordination agreement pursuant to proposed Rule
18a-4(d)(ii) under the Exchange Act, or elects individual segregation pursuant to Section 3E(f) of
the Exchange Act by executing a conditional subordination agreement pursuant to proposed Rule
18a-4(d)(i) under the Exchange Act.

143

ii. Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealer That Is Not a Registered
Broker-Dealer and Is Not a Foreign Bank with Branch or
Agency in the United States
If a foreign security-based swap dealer is not a registered broker-dealer and is not a
foreign bank that has a branch or agency (as defined in Section 1(b) of the International Banking
Act of 1978) in the United States, such foreign security-based swap dealer may be eligible to be
a debtor under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and may therefore be subject to the
stockbroker liquidation provisions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. 545 As stated above, Section
3E(g) of the Exchange Act provides “customer” status to all counterparties to cleared securitybased swaps, making no distinction between U.S. customers or counterparties and non-U.S.
person customers or counterparties. 546 Therefore, in the case where such foreign security-based
swap dealer receives any assets from, for, or on behalf of a U.S. person customer to margin,
guarantee, or secure security-based swaps, if the Commission were to apply the segregation
requirements only to assets posted by U.S. person customers but not to assets posted by non-U.S.
person customers, in a stockbroker liquidation proceeding of such foreign security-based swap
dealer, the assets segregated (i.e., assets posted by U.S. person customers) could be insufficient
to satisfy the combined priority claims of both U.S person and non-U.S. person customers,
potentially resulting in losses to U.S. person customers. As stated above, the Commission
preliminarily believes that Section 3E intends to provide customer protection to U.S. person
counterparties and apply segregation requirements in a way that would protect the U.S. financial
system and counterparties in the United States. Therefore, the Commission proposes to apply
segregation requirements described in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, to a foreign security-based swap dealer that is not a registered brokerdealer and is not a foreign bank with a branch or agency in the United States with respect to
assets received from both U.S. person counterparties and non-U.S. person counterparties if such
foreign security-based swap dealer receives collateral from U.S. person counterparties to secure
security-based swaps. 547
iii. Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealer That is Not a Registered
Broker-Dealer and is a Foreign Bank with Branch or Agency in
the United States
Finally, if a foreign security-based swap dealer is not a registered broker-dealer and is a
foreign bank that has a branch or agency in the United States, it is not eligible to be a debtor
under Chapter 7 and will therefore not be subject to the stockbroker liquidation provisions of the
U.S. Bankruptcy Code 548 and its insolvency proceeding in the United States would be

545

See Section 109(b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 109(b).

546

See 15 U.S.C. 78c-5(g) and 11 U.S.C. 741(2).

548

See Section 109(b) of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. 109(b).

144

administered under banking regulations. 549 Consistent with the objective of protecting U.S.
person counterparties, the Commission is proposing that such foreign security-based swap dealer
shall be subject to the segregation requirements set forth in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and
the rules and regulations thereunder, with respect to any assets received from, for or on behalf of
a counterparty who is a U.S. person to margin, guarantee, or secure a cleared security-based
swap, but shall not be required to segregate assets received from, for or on behalf of all other
counterparties to margin, guarantee, or secure a cleared security-based swap. 550 The special
account maintained by the foreign security-based swap dealer shall be designated for the
exclusive benefit of U.S. person security-based swap customers. The Commission preliminarily
believes that imposing segregation requirements on such foreign security-based swap dealer
when it receives collateral from U.S. person counterparties would reduce the likelihood of U.S.
person counterparties incurring losses by helping identify U.S. customers’ assets in an
insolvency proceeding of such foreign security-based swap dealer in the United States and would
potentially minimize disruption to the U.S. security-based swap market, thereby producing
potential benefits to the U.S. financial system and U.S. counterparties that are consistent with the
objectives of the Dodd-Frank Act. For the same reason, the Commission preliminarily does not
believe that extending segregation requirements and customer protection to such foreign
security-based swap dealer’s transactions with non-U.S. persons would advance the purposes of
the Dodd-Frank Act.
d. Disclosure
In addition to the proposed rules described above relating to application of the
segregation requirements to foreign security-based swap dealers, the Commission also is
proposing to require foreign security-based swap dealers to make certain disclosures. 551 Since
the treatment of the special account under Sections 3E(b) and (g) or individually segregated
assets pursuant to Section 3E(f) of the Exchange Act in insolvency proceedings of a foreign
security-based swap dealer may vary depending on the status of the foreign security-based swap
dealer and the insolvency proceedings such foreign security-based swap dealer is subject to, the
Commission proposes to require a foreign security-based swap dealer to disclose to each
counterparty that is a U.S. person, prior to accepting any assets from, for, or on behalf of such
counterparty to margin, guarantee, or secure a security-based swap, the potential treatment of the
assets segregated by such foreign security-based swap dealer pursuant to Section 3E of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, in insolvency proceedings relating to
such foreign security-based swap dealer under U.S. bankruptcy law and applicable foreign
insolvency laws. Pursuant to this proposed rule, the Commission intends to require that a foreign
security-based swap dealer disclose whether it is subject to the segregation requirement set forth
549

See 12 U.S.C. 1821-25. Whereas insured deposit institutions would be resolved under the
Federal Deposit Insurance Act, uninsured U.S. branches of foreign banks would be resolved
under either relevant state statutes, in the case of uninsured state branches, or the International
Banking Act, in the case of uninsured federal branches.

550

Proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(2)(iii) under the Exchange Act.

551

Proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3) under the Exchange Act.

145

in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, with respect to the
assets collected from the U.S. person counterparty who will receive the disclosure, whether the
foreign security-based swap dealer could be subject to the stockbroker liquidation provisions in
the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, whether the segregated assets could be afforded customer property
treatment under the U.S. bankruptcy law, and any other relevant considerations that may affect
the treatment of the assets segregated under Section 3E of the Exchange Act in insolvency
proceedings of a foreign security-based swap dealer. 552 Since the proposed rule regarding
application of the segregation requirements in the cross-border context is designed to advance
the goals of protecting U.S. person counterparties, the Commission believes that such disclosure
would enhance U.S. person counterparty protection and the objectives that segregation
requirements intend to achieve in the context of cross-border security-based swap dealing.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed rule regarding the
application of transaction-level requirements relating to customer protection and segregation,
including the following:

552

•

What, if any, are the likely competitive effects, within the U.S. security-based swap
market and among U.S. security-based swap dealers, of the proposed approach for
foreign security-based swap dealers? Please describe the specific nature of any such
effects.

•

Should a foreign security-based swap dealer automatically be eligible for the
proposed approach by virtue of being a nonresident entity? Alternatively, should the
Commission consider other factors, such as the share of the foreign security-based
swap dealer’s business that constitutes U.S. Business, in determining how to apply
transaction-level requirements?

•

From an operational perspective, what types of internal controls would be necessary
to identify Foreign Business and U.S. Business and ensure that the foreign securitybased swap dealer complies with the external business conduct standards with respect
to its U.S. Business? Should U.S. Business be generally defined with reference to the
type of activity that, if performed in a dealing capacity, triggers the registration
requirement?

•

Does the proposed approach appropriately classify entity-level and transaction-level
requirements? Does it appropriately identify those transaction-level requirements that
relate to the operation of the security-based swap dealer on an entity level? If not,
please identify those requirements that should be classified differently and how doing
so is consistent with the goals of Title VII.

Proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3) under the Exchange Act

146

•

To what extent would foreign security-based swap dealers in various jurisdictions be
prohibited from complying, under local law, with the Commission’s requirements to
provide the Commission with prompt access to their books and records and to submit
to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission? If there are limitations,
what are they, and under what circumstances would they arise? Are there other
entity-level requirements that foreign security-based swap dealers would not be
permitted to comply with under local law? If so, what are they?

•

Should the external business conduct rules apply in transactions between a registered
non-U.S. security-based swap dealer and foreign branches of a U.S. bank?

•

Should the external business conduct rules apply in transactions between a registered
non-U.S. security-based swap dealer and non-U.S. persons with U.S. guarantees in
transactions outside the United States?

•

Does the proposed application of the business conduct standards in the cross-border
context appropriately implement the business conduct standards as described in
Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act?

•

As described above, the Commission does not, at this time, propose to apply the
business conduct standards in Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder (other than the rules and regulations relating to diligent
supervision prescribed by the Commission pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B)), to the
Foreign Business of registered security-based swap dealers. Should such standards
apply to the Foreign Business of registered security-based swap dealers? Would such
application of business conduct standards further the goals of Title VII of the DoddFrank Act?

•

Should the Commission apply rules and regulations pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(A)
of the Exchange Act relating to fraud, manipulation, and other abusive practices
involving security-based swaps (including security-based swaps that are offered but
not entered into) to the Foreign Business of registered foreign security-based swap
dealers?

•

Should the Commission apply rules and regulations pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(C)
of the Exchange Act relating to position limits to the Foreign Business of foreign
security-based swap dealers?

•

Should the proposed rule relating to conflicts of interest set forth in Section 15F(j)(5)
of the Exchange Act apply to both the U.S. Business and Foreign Business of
security-based swap dealers?

•

Does the proposed approach appropriately treat the rules and regulations prescribed
by the Commission relating to diligent supervision pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(B)
as entity-level requirements applicable to both the U.S. Business and the Foreign
Business of foreign security-based swap dealers? Why or why not?
147

553

•

Is it appropriate that the proposed rule does not apply future rules and regulations that
the Commission may prescribe pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act
relating to fraud, manipulation, and other abusive practices involving security-based
swaps (including security-based swaps that are offered but not entered into) to the
Foreign Business of foreign security-based swap dealers? Why or why not?

•

Is it appropriate that the proposed rule does not apply future rules and regulations that
the Commission may prescribe pursuant to Section 15F(h)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act
relating to position limits to the Foreign Business of foreign security-based swap
dealers? Why or why not?

•

Does the proposed approach appropriately treat the requirements relating to conflicts
of interest set forth in Section 15F(j)(5) of the Exchange Act as entity-level
requirements applicable to both the U.S. Business and Foreign Business of foreign
security-based swap dealers? If not, please identify any requirements that should not
be applied to a foreign security-based swap dealer and explain how such an approach
would be consistent with the goals of Title VII. Please identify what the costs or
operational challenges would be, if any, for a registered security-based swap dealer to
establish conflict-of-interest systems and procedures that would apply to its U.S.
Business but not its Foreign Business.

•

Does the proposed approach appropriately implement the requirements relating to
segregation of assets held as collateral in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and rules
and regulations thereunder, in light of various statuses of foreign security-based swap
dealers?

•

Should the Commission apply segregation requirements to a foreign security-based
swap dealer that is not subject to the stockbroker liquidation provisions in the U.S.
Bankruptcy Code? If not, what are the reasons for not applying segregation
requirements? If the segregation requirements do not apply, how would the objective
of customer protection be achieved?

•

Should the Commission adopt the disclosure requirement with respect to foreign
security-based swap dealers? Why or why not? Is the proposed disclosure
requirement feasible? What would the difficulties be in complying with the proposed
disclosure requirement?

•

The CFTC has proposed an interpretation that would effectively treat a non-U.S.
person whose obligations are guaranteed by a U.S. person as a U.S. person for
purposes of determining whether a swap between it and a non-U.S. swap dealer or
major swap participant would be subject to transaction-level requirements as
interpreted by the CFTC to include, without limitation, margin and segregation
requirements, reporting, clearing, and trade execution. 553 Should the Commission

See CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR at 41228-29.

148

adopt a similar approach? What would be the effects on efficiency, competition and
capital formation in the event that there are overlapping or duplicative requirements
across multiple jurisdictions?
•

In addition, the CFTC has proposed an interpretation that includes a description of a
“conduit affiliate” that includes: (1) a non-U.S. person that is majority-owned,
directly or indirectly, by a U.S. person where (2) the non-U.S. person regularly enters
into swaps with one or more U.S. affiliates or subsidiaries of the U.S. person, and (3)
the financial statements of the non-U.S. person are included in the consolidated
financial statements of the U.S. person. 554 Conduit affiliates would be subject to
transaction-level requirements as if they were U.S. persons. Should the Commission
consider a similar approach?

•

The CFTC’s proposed interpretation would subject foreign branches of U.S.-based
bank swap dealers and major swap participants to the CFTC’s entity-level
requirements and transaction-level requirements (other than external business conduct
standards for swaps with non-U.S. persons), provided that foreign branches would be
eligible for a limited exception in emerging markets where foreign regulations are not
comparable. 555 Should the Commission consider a similar approach? If so, please
explain how such an approach would be consistent with the goals of Title VII.

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to application of the
transaction-level requirements relating to customer protection and segregation? How
would the proposed application of transaction-level requirements affect the
competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States
as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market
participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain.
Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please
explain. What other measures should the Commission consider to implement the
transaction-level requirements? What would be the market impacts and
competitiveness effects of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this
release?
5. Application of Entity-Level Rules
(a) Introduction

As noted above, by their very nature, entity-level requirements apply to the operation of a
security-based swap dealer as a whole. The Commission recognizes that the capital, margin, and
other entity-level requirements that it adopts could have a substantial impact on international
commerce and the relative competitive position of intermediaries operating in various, or
multiple, jurisdictions. In particular, if these requirements are substantially more or less stringent
554

See id. at 41229.

555

See id. at 41230-31.

149

than corresponding requirements, if any, that apply to intermediaries operating in security-based
swap markets outside the United States, depending on how the rules are written, these
differences could impact the ability of firms based in the United States to participate in non-U.S.
markets, access to U.S. markets by foreign-based firms, and how and whether international firms
make use of global “booking entities” to centralize risks related to security-based swaps, among
other possible impacts. These issues have been the focus of numerous comments to the
Commission and other regulators, as discussed above, as well as Congressional inquiries and
other public dialogue.
(b) Proposed Approach
The Commission is not proposing to provide specific relief for foreign security-based
swap dealers from Title VII entity-level requirements, although, as discussed in Section XI
below, under a Commission substituted compliance determination, a foreign security-based swap
dealer would be able to satisfy relevant Title VII entity-level requirements by substituting
compliance with corresponding requirements under a foreign regulatory system. 556 The
Commission preliminarily believes that entity-level requirements are core requirements of the
Commission’s responsibility to ensure the safety and soundness of registered security-based
swap dealers. 557 The Commission preliminarily believes that it would not be consistent with this
mandate to provide a blanket exclusion to foreign security-based swap dealers from entity-level
requirements applicable to such entities. 558

556

See Section XI, infra.

557

See note 419, supra.

558

We preliminarily believe that the proposed approach with respect to entity-level requirements is
not being applied to persons who are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without
the jurisdiction of the United States,” within the meaning of Section 30(c) of the Exchange Act.
See Section II.B.2(a), supra. However, the Commission also preliminarily believes that the
proposed approach with respect to entity-level requirements is necessary or appropriate to help
prevent the evasion of the particular provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the
Dodd-Frank Act that are being implemented by the proposed approach and prophylactically will
help ensure that the purposes of those provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are not undermined. See
Section II.B.2(e), supra; see also Section II.B.2(c), supra.
For example, if entity-level requirements do not apply to the entire business of a registered
foreign security-based swap dealer, then U.S. security-based swap dealers would have an
incentive to evade the full application of the entity-level requirements by moving their operations
outside the United States. In this event, assuming the scope of the security-based swap dealers
dealing activity remained unchanged, the risk presented by the entity to its U.S. counterparties
and the U.S. financial system would remain unchanged. If, for instance, Title VII margin
requirements did not apply to the entire entity, these entities could accumulate risk through their
non-U.S. dealing activity and transmit that risk to U.S. counterparties in contravention of the
purposes of the financial responsibility framework established by the Dodd-Frank Act. See
Section III.C.3(b)ii, supra.

150

For example, capital requirements play an essential role in ensuring the safety and
soundness of security-based swap dealers. As discussed above, the Commission’s proposed
capital rules for nonbank security-based swap dealers are modeled on the net liquid assets test
found in the capital requirements applicable to broker-dealers. 559 We believe that this capital
standard is necessary to ensure the safety and soundness of nonbank security-based swap dealers,
and thus we are not proposing to exclude foreign nonbank security-based swap dealers from our
capital rules. In addition, we believe that the capital, margin, and other entity-level requirements
proposed and adopted by the Commission work together to provide a comprehensive regulatory
scheme that is vital for ensuring the safety and soundness of registered security-based swap
dealers, and that the benefits of Title VII’s entity-level requirements are equally important to
both foreign and U.S. dealers registered with the Commission. As a result, we are not proposing
to provide specific relief from individual entity-level requirements for foreign dealers.
We do, however, recognize the concerns raised by commenters regarding the application
of entity-level requirements to foreign security-based swap dealers. 560 We preliminarily believe
that these concerns are largely addressed through the Commission’s overall proposed approach
to substituted compliance in the context of Title VII, which is discussed in detail in Section XI
below. In general, the Commission is proposing a framework under which it may permit a
registered foreign security-based swap dealer (or class thereof) to satisfy the capital, margin, and
other requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder,
by complying with the corresponding requirements established by its foreign financial regulatory
authority, 561 subject to certain conditions. 562 We preliminarily believe that providing foreign
security-based swap dealers with the possibility of substituted compliance in this way will help
address concerns related to competitiveness and overlapping regulations related to entity-level

559

Section 3(a)(52) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(52), defines “foreign financial regulatory
authority” as “any (A) foreign securities authority, (B) other governmental body or foreign
equivalent of a self-regulatory organization empowered by a foreign government to administer or
enforce its laws relating to the regulation of fiduciaries, trusts, commercial lending, insurance,
trading in contracts of sale of a commodity for future delivery, or other instruments traded on or
subject to the rules of a contract market, board of trade, or foreign equivalent, or other financial
activities, or (C) membership organization a function of which is to regulate participation of its
members in activities listed above.” The term “foreign securities authority” is defined in Section
3(a)(50) of the Exchange Act as “any foreign government, or any governmental body or
regulatory organization empowered by a foreign government to administer or enforce its laws as
they relate to securities matters.”

requirements, while still ensuring that registered foreign security-based swap dealers are subject
to appropriate regulatory oversight.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed interpretive guidance
regarding the proposed provision of substituted compliance for certain requirements in Section
15F of the Exchange Act for foreign security-based swap dealers, including the following:

563

•

What types of conflicts might a foreign security-based swap dealer face if subjected
to capital requirements in more than one jurisdiction? In what situations would
compliance with more than one capital requirement be difficult or impossible?

•

Should the Commission provide specific relief to foreign security-based swap dealers
with respect to entity-level requirements? If so, please indicate the specific relief that
should be provided and the rationale for providing such relief.

•

Would the provision of relief from entity-level requirements undermine the
Commission’s efforts to set capital requirements to ensure the safety and soundness
of security-based swap dealers, as required by Section 15F(e)(2)(C) of the Exchange
Act? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission treat margin as an entity-level requirement or a transactionlevel requirement? If only a transaction-level requirement, why?

•

Should the Commission consider providing relief for foreign security-based swap
dealers from the statutory disqualification requirement in Section 15F(b)(6) of the
Exchange Act with respect to their transactions with non-U.S. persons? For example,
should the Commission permit associated persons of a foreign security-based swap
dealer that are subject to a statutory disqualification to conduct security-based swap
activity with non-U.S. persons outside the United States? If so, why?

•

The CFTC has proposed an interpretation that categorizes certain entity-level
requirements and transaction-level requirements differently when compared to the
Commission’s proposed approach. 563 For example, the CFTC has proposed
classifying margin requirements applicable to uncleared swaps as a transaction-level
requirement, where the Commission has proposed categorizing margin as an entitylevel requirement. Should the Commission adopt portions of the CFTC’s approach to
categorization? If so, which requirements should be re-categorized and why?

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to applying entity-level
requirements to registered foreign security-based swap dealers? How would the
proposed application of the entity-level requirements affect the competitiveness of
U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States as well as in foreign

See CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR at 41223-27.

152

jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market participants at a
competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed
approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please explain. What
other measures should the Commission consider to implement the entity-level
requirements? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects of
alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?
D. Intermediation
1. Introduction
Security-based swap dealers currently use a variety of business models and legal
structures to do business with customers in jurisdictions around the world. For instance, many
security-based swap dealers with global businesses use local personnel to provide security-based
swap services to customers in a particular jurisdiction while booking transactions originated from
multiple jurisdictions in a single entity (i.e., a centralized booking model). Some security-based
swap dealers also use unique organizational structures to provide local customers with access to
market or product specialists in other jurisdictions. As discussed below, commenters have
indicated that, in the U.S. market, these scenarios are particularly prevalent in the case of foreign
security-based swap dealers seeking access to U.S. customers or providing non-U.S. customers
with expertise from employees located in the United States. 564
In the following discussion, we briefly describe comments received regarding various
intermediation models. Throughout this release we use the term “intermediation” generally to
refer to origination activity (e.g., solicitation and negotiation of transactions) in connection with
a security-based swap transaction.
2. Comment Summary
Commenters stated that foreign security-based swap dealers use different types of
business models to service U.S. customers and provide their global customer base with
specialized information, while at the same time reducing both customer costs and entity risks
through centralized netting and risk management of their global security-based swap
businesses. 565 In support of these perceived benefits, commenters have urged the Commission
564

See, e.g., IIB Letter at 15 (“Perhaps more commonly, a foreign bank may transact in swaps as a
dealer with U.S. customers through a separate U.S. branch, agency, or affiliate that intermediates
the transactions as agent for the foreign bank. This is often because, to facilitate strong
relationships with U.S. customers, the personnel who solicit and negotiate with U.S. customers
and commit a foreign bank to swaps are located in the U.S.”).

565

See, e.g., IIB Letter at 6 (“Globally, there are a number of paradigms under which swap activity is
conducted. To achieve the benefits of reduced risk and increased liquidity and efficiency
associated with netting and margining on a portfolio basis, foreign banks (like their U.S. domestic
counterparts) typically seek to transact with swap counterparties globally, to the extent feasible,
through a single, highly creditworthy entity. In many cases, however, the personnel who have
relationships with U.S. customers or who manage the market risk of the foreign bank’s swap

153

not to apply Title VII to cross-border transactions in a way that would either prohibit or
disincentivize the existing security-based swap dealing business models of foreign security-based
swap dealers. 566
A number of commenters recommended that a foreign dealer that engages in securitybased swap transactions with U.S. counterparties, but only through U.S. registered swap or
security-based swap dealers, should not be subject to security-based swap dealer registration. 567
One commenter stated that in such situations, the Commission should either not require securitybased swap dealer registration of the non-U.S. security-based swap dealer at all, or require a
limited registration, whereby the non-U.S. security-based swap dealer would be subject to only
capital and related prudential requirements and be permitted to rely on comparable home country
regulation. 568 In situations where a foreign security-based swap dealer uses a U.S. domiciled
subsidiary or affiliate as its agent to solicit and negotiate the terms of security-based swap
transactions, several commenters suggested that the Commission allow for a bifurcated
portfolio are located regionally, outside the jurisdiction in which the foreign bank is domiciled.
In some cases, entities other than the foreign bank (such as a U.S. branch, agency, or affiliate)
transact with local customers in order to satisfy unique customer documentation, insolvency, tax,
regulatory, or other considerations.); Davis Polk Letter I at 2-3 (suggesting that “operating and
managing a global swaps business out of a single booking entity presents many advantages from
the perspective of foreign banks, customers and supervisors,” including reduction in system risk,
maximization of benefits of counterparty netting for customers, and consolidated supervision);
Cleary IV at 3-4 (stating that the represented firms “conduct their swap dealing businesses
through a variety of structures, based on multiple and in many cases interdependent legal,
strategic and business considerations that pre-date Dodd-Frank,” and urging the Commissions to
address a number of “common cross-border transaction structures”).
566

See, e.g., IIB Letter at 6-7 (“[T]he Commissions should establish a framework for cross-border
swap activities that preserves and leverages the strengths of existing market practices and home
country supervision and regulation.”); Cleary IV at 3-4 (urging the Commissions to give
consideration to a number of common cross-border transaction structures in deciding how to
implement Title VII).

567

See, e.g., Financial Services Roundtable Letter at 25 (suggesting that “entities that would meet
the definition of ‘swap dealer’ based on their non-US activity, but that act in the US only on an
intermediated basis through a regulated US swap dealer, should not be subject to US regulation”);
Davis Polk Letter II at 4, 7 (discussing reasons to exclude dealing activities with U.S.-registered
swap dealers, including because “a swap between a foreign dealer and a U.S. registered swap
dealer would be already subject to Title VII by the virtue of the latter’s involvement”).

568

See Cleary Letter IV at 3-4 (recommending that the Commission either adopt an approach similar
to the broker-dealer registration regime, “under which a non-U.S. swap dealer transacting with
U.S. persons . . . intermediated by an affiliated U.S.-registered swap dealer” would not have to
register as a swap dealer or a major swap participant, or adopt a limited registration approach
whereby “the non-U.S. swap dealer would be subject to U.S. swap dealer registration and
regulation solely with respect to the capital and related prudential requirements relevant to its
status as a swap counterparty, which requirements could be satisfied through compliance with
comparable home country requirements”).

154

registration and regulation framework allowing the foreign security-based swap dealer to comply
with Title VII’s requirements by registering both the foreign dealer and its agent in limited
capacities and allocating the compliance responsibilities between the two entities. 569 Other
commenters remarked that the foreign security-based swap dealer should remain ultimately
responsible for ensuring compliance with all the applicable Title VII requirements whether or not
the regulated activities were carried out by the foreign security-based swap dealer or its agent. 570
3. Discussion
The Commission is not at this time proposing any specific rules regarding security-based
swap dealing activities undertaken through intermediation. At the same time, we recognize the
importance of intermediation, particularly with respect to foreign security-based swap dealers
accessing U.S. customers or product specialists located in the United States. Based on the
Commission’s experience in the securities markets, we expect that many foreign security-based
swap dealers will operate within the U.S. market by utilizing their U.S. affiliates or other U.S.
entities as agents 571 in the United States, while booking transactions facilitated by such U.S.
569

See, e.g., Société Générale Letter I at 4-6 (suggesting a bifurcated registration model allowing
foreign banks to centrally book their U.S. swap and security-based swap business with a
registered “Foreign Swap Dealer” who is responsible for obligations associated with a booking
entity (e.g., complying with capital requirements), while complying with most of Title VII’s
regulations through a U.S. domiciled, registered “Non-Booking Swap Dealer”); and Davis Polk
Letter II at 4-22 (proposing two registration scenarios, including one that would require a foreign
bank to register with the Commission solely as a booking center for security-based swap
transactions, while a U.S. affiliate of a foreign bank would also register with the Commission,
and the foreign bank’s obligations under Title VII would be divided between the two registered
entities).

570

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 12 (recommending a limited designation registration whereby “the
branch, department or division of a registrant involved in the regulated swap activity should be
responsible for compliance with Dodd-Frank’s requirements,” but allowing for the outsourcing of
“performance (but not responsibility for due performance) of those requirements to a U.S.
affiliate that is registered as an introducing broker, futures commission merchant (“FCM”) and/or
securities broker-dealer”); Rabobank Letter at 3 (suggesting that “the non-U.S. branch registrant
would use one or more U.S. affiliates as agents in arranging swaps with U.S. persons and would
be permitted to delegate certain compliance functions to its U.S. affiliates, although such
delegation would not relieve the non-U.S. branch registrant of its ultimate compliance
responsibilities”).

571

The Commission previously proposed new Rule 15Fh-2(d), which would provide that the term
“security-based swap dealer” would include, where relevant, an “associated person” of the
security-based swap dealer. See External Business Conduct Standards Proposing Release, 76 FR
at 42402. Section 3(a)(70) of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 761(a)(6), defines the term
“person associated with a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant” as
“(i) any partner, officer, director, or branch manager of such security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant (or any person occupying a similar status or performing similar
functions); (ii) any person directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common
control with such security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant; or (iii)

155

personnel in a central booking entity located abroad. We preliminarily believe that the approach
proposed in this release for the cross-border regulation of security-based swap dealing activity
will not impede the use of these types of intermediation business models by foreign securitybased swap dealers. More specifically, we believe that the Commission’s proposed approach to
the application of transaction-level requirements related to Foreign Business 572 and proposed
framework for substituted compliance on entity-level requirements 573 should help to address
commenter concerns that a foreign security-based swap dealer engaging in Foreign Business
would be subject to potentially duplicative and conflicting transaction-level requirements in a
foreign jurisdiction with respect to its Foreign Business.
While the foreign security-based swap dealer would remain responsible for ensuring that
all relevant Title VII requirements applicable to a given security-based swap transaction are
fulfilled, the dealer and its agent(s) may choose to allocate the specific responsibilities such as
taking responsibility that all U.S. external business conduct requirements are complied with,
margin is collected and segregated, and required trading records are maintained and available, to
be undertaken by each entity depending on the intermediation model it adopts. 574
Further, although a foreign security-based swap dealer could use an entity that is not a
security-based swap dealer to act as its agent, the foreign security-based swap dealer would
nonetheless be responsible for ensuring compliance with all the requirements applicable to
security-based swap dealers under Title VII (and the federal securities laws) whether or not the

any employee of such security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.” The
term does not include, however, any person associated with a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant “whose functions are solely clerical or ministerial.” See id.
As the Commission noted, to the extent that a security-based swap dealer acts through, or by
means of, an associated person of that security-based swap dealer, the associated person must
comply as well with the applicable business conduct standards. See External Business Conduct
Standards Proposing Release, 76 FR at 42402-3. In support of this position, the Commission
cited Section 20(b) of the Exchange Act, which provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any
person, directly or indirectly, to do any act or thing which it would be unlawful for such person to
do under the provisions of this title or any rule or regulation thereunder through or by means of
any other person.”
572

See Section III.C.4, supra.

573

See Section III.C.5, supra, and Section XI, infra.

574

The agent, in these circumstances, would need to consider whether it separately would need to
register as a security-based swap dealer (if, for example, the agent acted as principal in a securitybased swap with the counterparty, and then entered into a back-to-back transaction with the
booking entity), a broker (e.g., by soliciting or negotiating the terms of security-based swap
transactions), or other regulated entity. Further, the allocation of functions between a foreign
security-based swap dealer and a U.S. agent would not affect the aggregation calculation for
determining whether the foreign security-based swap dealer exceeded the de minimis threshold.
See Section III.B.3(c), supra.

156

regulated activities were carried out by the foreign security-based swap dealer or its nonsecurity-based swap dealer agent. 575
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed approach to
intermediation. In addition, the Commission requests comment in response to the following
questions:
•

Should the Commission revise our proposed approach to address directly the
concerns of entities using the intermediation model to access the U.S. market? If so,
what type of approach should the Commission use to address these concerns
consistent with the protection of counterparties’ interests and the purposes of Title
VII?

•

Should the Commission adopt a model on intermediation similar to the approach laid
out in Rule 15a-6(a)(3) (17 CFR § 240.15a-6(a)(3)) governing foreign broker-dealers,
which would permit non-U.S. persons to conduct security-based swap dealing activity
within the United States without registering with the Commission if those
transactions were intermediated by a registered U.S. security-based swap dealer? If
so, how would it work in the security-based swap context, and how would it address
Title VII policy concerns?

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to intermediation? How
would the application of the proposed approach to intermediation affect the
competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States
as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market
participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain.
Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please
explain. What other measures should the Commission consider to implement the
proposed approach to intermediation? What would be the market impacts and
competitiveness effects of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this
release?

E. Registration Application Re-Proposal
1. Introduction
As discussed in Section XI.C below, the Commission is proposing a rule that would
create a framework under which the Commission would consider permitting a foreign securitybased swap dealer, where appropriate, to rely on a substituted compliance determination by the
Commission with respect to certain of the requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. 576 In discussing the application of this proposed framework
575

See note 574, supra.

576

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(c) under the Exchange Act.

157

below, the Commission indicated that certain entity-level requirements under Section 15F of the
Exchange Act may be candidates for substituted compliance determinations. 577
The Commission preliminarily believes that the most appropriate time for a foreign
security-based swap dealer to notify the Commission of its intention to avail itself of an existing
substituted compliance determination 578 would be at the time the foreign security-based swap
dealer files an application to register with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer. 579
As part of its application, the foreign security-based swap dealer would already be providing the
Commission with detailed information in support of its application. The intent of a foreign
security-based swap dealer to avail itself of a previously granted substituted compliance
determination would be relevant to the Commission’s review of such application because it
577

See Section III.C.5, supra.

578

The Commission is proposing to establish a separate process whereby foreign security-based
swap dealers may request that the Commission make a substituted compliance determination with
respect to a particular foreign jurisdiction. See Section XI, infra.

579

The Commission’s Registration Proposing Release does not use the term “foreign security-based
swap dealer,” but rather references a “nonresident security-based swap dealer.” Proposed Rule
15Fb2-4(a) under the Exchange Act defines the term “nonresident security-based swap dealer” as
a security-based swap dealer that is incorporated or organized any place that is not in the United
States or that has its principal place of business in any place not in the United States. See
Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65799-801.
The definition of “nonresident security-based swap dealer” in proposed Rule 15Fb2-4(a) is
similar to, but potentially broader than, the definition of “foreign security-based swap dealer” in
proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(3) under the Exchange Act because it uses “or” instead of “and” in the
definition. As a result, proposed Rule 15Fb2-4(a) would treat a U.S. corporation as a nonresident
person if its principal place of business were outside the United States, whereas proposed Rule
3a71-3(a)(3) would not treat such an entity as a U.S. security-based swap dealer and, therefore, it
would not be able to avail itself of substituted compliance determinations applicable to foreign
security-based swap dealers.
The Commission preliminarily believes that defining the term “foreign security-based swap
dealer” more narrowly for purposes of the proposals in this release is appropriate because
proposed Rule 15Fb2-4(a) uses the term “nonresident security-based swap dealer” only for
determining whether a nonresident security-based dealer would be required to appoint an agent
for service of process in the United States and provide assurance that the Commission would have
prompt access to books and records in the foreign jurisdiction. In proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(3), by
contrast, the definition of “foreign security-based swap dealer” would be used to determine who
would be eligible to take advantage of the proposed substituted compliance framework, as well as
how customer protection and segregation requirements would be applied. The Commission does
not believe that it is appropriate to treat an entity as a foreign security-based swap dealer for these
purposes if its principal place of business were outside the United States but it were incorporated
in the United States, because of its connection to the U.S. security-based swap market.
Nonetheless, the Commission would still want the assurances required of a “nonresident securitybased swap dealer” described above, even if the dealer is incorporated in the United States but
has a principal place of business outside the United States.

158

would impact how the Commission will conduct oversight of the security-based swap dealer. In
addition, if a security-based swap dealer determines, after it registered with the Commission, that
it intends to rely on a substituted compliance determination, proposed Rule 15Fb2-3 would
require that it promptly update its application. 580
Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate to require foreign
security-based swap dealers to provide additional information in their applications for
registration as security-based swap dealers, as described below.
The Commission previously proposed Form SBSE, Form SBSE-A, and Form SBSE-BD
for the purpose of registering security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants. 581 All of these forms are generally based on Form BD, which is the consolidated
form used by broker-dealers to register with the Commission, states, and SROs. 582 Forms SBSEA and SBSE-BD are shorter forms that have been modified to provide a more streamlined
application process for entities that are registered or registering with the CFTC or registered or
registering with the Commission as a broker-dealer. 583 Each of these forms is designed to be
used to gather information concerning a registrant’s business operations to facilitate the
Commission’s initial registration decisions, as well as ongoing examination and monitoring of
registration.” 584 While the Commission received four comments on the Registration Proposing
Release, only one specifically expressed views on the Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE-BD. 585
2. Discussion
To address the Commission’s proposed rule regarding substituted compliance, the
Commission is re-proposing Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE-BD to add two questions to Form
SBSE and Form SBSE-A, add one question to all three Forms, and to modify Schedule F to all
the Forms. In addition, we are proposing one new instruction to the Forms, which is unrelated

585

See SIFMA Letter II. SIFMA indicated that it appreciated “the Commission’s attempts to
minimize registration burdens by aligning its proposed registration requirements for SBSDs and
MSBSPs with those the CFTC is proposing for swap dealers and major swap participants as well
as by creating a streamlined registration process for entities already registered with the
Commission or the CFTC,” and was “generally pleased that the Commission elected to make its
existing broker-dealer registration forms the basis for its proposed registration requirements for
SBSDs and MSBSPs” because “[m]arket participants are familiar with these requirements and
may, in some cases, be registering broker-dealers as SBSDs.” However, SIFMA did object to
“several of the required disclosures on proposed Form SBSE,” which are substantially similar to
disclosures required on Form BD, which it claimed would “impose significant burdens on
registrants.”

159

to substituted compliance, to clarify that if an application is not filed properly or completely, it
may be delayed or rejected. 586 Key differences from the originally proposed forms are discussed
more fully below. The Commission is not proposing to modify or eliminate any of the other
Forms, or any of the rules, proposed in the Registration Proposing Release.
Re-proposed Forms SBSE and SBSE-A would include two new questions, question 3
(which has three parts) and question 6. 587 The new question 3.A. would ask whether an
applicant is a foreign security-based swap dealer that intends to work with the Commission and
its primary regulator to have the Commission determine whether the requirements of its primary
regulator’s regulatory system are comparable to the Commission’s, or avail itself of a substituted
compliance determination previously granted by the Commission with respect to the
requirements of Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. If the
applicant responds in the affirmative to either part of the question, new question 3.B. would
require that the applicant identify the foreign financial regulatory authority that serves as the
applicant’s primary regulator and for which the Commission has made, or may make, a
substituted compliance determination. If the applicant indicates that it is relying on a previously
granted substituted compliance determination, new question 3.C. would require the applicant to
describe how it satisfies any conditions the Commission may have placed on the use of such
substituted compliance determination. New question 3 would elicit basic information from an
applicant to inform the Commission with respect to its intent to rely upon a substituted
compliance determination.
New question 6 would ask whether the applicant is a U.S. branch of a non-resident entity.
If the applicant responds in the affirmative, the applicant would need to identify the non-resident
entity and its location. This question would provide the Commission with information regarding
whether the firm would be subject to the rules of the foreign regulator or the rules of one of the
U.S. banking regulators, which would, in turn, elicit which rules may be applicable to the entity’s
U.S. security-based swap business.
Re-proposed Forms SBSE and SBSE-A would also include new question 17, which
would be identified as new question 15 in re-proposed Form SBSE-BD. This new question
would ask if the applicant is registered with or subject to the jurisdiction of a foreign financial
regulatory authority. If the applicant answered this question in the affirmative, it would be
directed to provide additional information on Schedule F as discussed below. This question
would apply to all applicants, not just foreign security-based swap applicants, and would provide
the Commission with information regarding other regulatory schemes that may be applicable to
an applicant.
586

See Instruction B.1.b. on Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE-BD.

587

The Commission is not proposing to add these questions to the Form SBSE-BD, because that
form is only applicable to entities that are already registered as broker-dealers. These firms
would not be eligible to rely on a substituted compliance determination because the substituted
compliance determination only is with respect to the requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange
Act, not the requirements in the Exchange Act to which registered broker-dealers are subject.

160

The proposed revisions to Schedule F would divide Schedule F into two sections.
Section I would include the full text of the originally proposed Schedule F. Section II would
elicit additional information regarding foreign regulators with which the applicant may be
registered or that otherwise have jurisdiction over the applicant.
The Commission preliminarily believes that modifying Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and
SBSE-BD (including the changes to Schedule F), as described above, would be appropriate
because it would provide foreign security-based swap dealers with a convenient and costeffective way of informing the Commission of their intention to rely on or seek a substituted
compliance determination, as discussed above. In addition, we believe these modifications to
our original proposal would provide the Commission with additional information necessary to
make a determination as to whether it is appropriate to grant or institute proceedings to deny
registration to a person applying to become a non-resident security-based swap dealer.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed modifications and
additions to proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A and SBSE-BD (including the proposed changes to
Schedule F). The Commission also specifically requests comment on the following:
•

Please explain whether Form SBSE and Form SBSE-A are the appropriate places to
identify whether an entity is intending to rely on a substituted compliance
determination. If not, please explain why and what other method of notifying the
Commission might be appropriate as well as when such notification to the
Commission should be required to be made.

•

Please explain whether Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE-BD (and Schedule F) are
the appropriate places to identify whether an entity is subject to oversight by a foreign
regulator, and if so, which regulators. If so, why? If not, why not?

•

Should any additional questions be added to Form SBSE to elicit information related
to a registrant’s reliance on a substituted compliance determination?

•

Should any additional questions be added to Form SBSE-A to elicit information
related to a registrant’s reliance on a substituted compliance determination?

•

Should Form SBSE-BD also be modified to include any of the additional questions
the Commission is proposing to include in re-proposed Form SBSE or Form SBSEA? If so, which questions and why?

•

The Commission previously indicated in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release that it would consider applications for limited purpose designations from the
major security-based swap participant and security-based swap dealer definitions

161

under Rules 3a67-1(b) and 3a71-1(c) under the Exchange Act, respectively, 588 and
requested comment on this topic in the Registration Proposing Release. 589 Since that
time, we have adopted and proposed, both jointly with the CFTC and individually,
various rules that further clarify the regulations that will be applicable to securitybased swap dealers, 590 and today we propose a substituted compliance framework to
potentially address the concerns of foreign security-based swap dealers. Given these
developments, are there any situations addressed by previous comments where
limited registration designation would no longer be appropriate? Are there any
situations, addressed by previous comments or otherwise, where a limited registration
designation may be appropriate for security-based swap dealers? If so, in what
situations would a limited registration designation be warranted, and how should the
registration forms be amended to facilitate such limited registration? If not, why not?

588

As we noted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30643-46 and 30696-97,
the Commission will consider limited designation applications on an individual basis through
analysis of the unique circumstances of each applicant, given that the types of entities that engage
in security-based swap transactions are diverse and their organization and activities are varied.
Any particular limited designation application will be analyzed in light of the unique
circumstances presented by the applicant, and must demonstrate full compliance with the
requirements that apply to the type, class, or category of security-based swap, or the activities
involving security-based swaps, that fall within the security-based swap dealer or major securitybased swap participant designation. A key challenge that any applicant for a limited purpose
designation will face is the need to demonstrate that the applicant can comply with the statutory
and regulatory requirements applicable to security-based swap dealers or major security-based
swap participants while subject to a limited designation. Regardless of the type of limited
designation being requested, the Commission will not designate a person as a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant in a limited capacity unless it can demonstrate
that it can fully comply with the applicable requirements.

See Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65795. The Commission received one comment on
this topic, from SIFMA (see note 585, supra). SIFMA indicated that it “SIFMA strongly believes
that the Commission should allow for limited SBSD or MSBSP registration along a number of
dimensions.” For instance, SIFMA suggested that the Commission allow entities to separately
register individual trading desks, allow an entity to register as an SBSD in one class or type of
security-based swap but not another (e.g., “an entity that acts as a dealer in single-name credit
default swaps but not total return swaps on single securities should be able to register as an SBSD
in the former but not the latter”), and “allow entities to register as an SBSD or MSBSP for their
activities with U.S. persons, keeping activities with non-U.S. persons outside the scope of
registration and related regulation.”

IV.

Major Security-Based Swap Participants

A. Introduction
Title VII defines a new type of entity regulated by the Commission, the “major securitybased swap participant.” 591 The statutory definition of major security-based swap participant
encompasses persons whose security-based swap activities do not cause them to be dealers, but
nonetheless could pose a high degree of risk to the U.S. financial system generally. 592 This term
was further defined in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, focusing on the potential
market impact and risks associated with a person’s security-based swap positions.593 In this
respect, the major security-based swap participant definition differs from the security-based swap
dealer definition, which generally focuses on a person’s activities and how it holds itself out to
the market. The amount or significance of those activities is relevant only in the context of the
de minimis exception.594 As a result, we believe that the cross-border issues that are raised by
the definition of major security-based swap participant differ from those raised by the definition
of security-based swap dealer. The application of the major security-based swap participant
definition to cross-border activities was not addressed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release. 595

591

See Section 3(a)(67) of Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67), as added by Section 761(a) of the
Dodd-Frank Act.

592

As discussed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the tests of the major securitybased swap participant definition use terms—particularly “systemically important,” “significantly
impact the financial system” or “create substantial counterparty exposure”—that denote a focus
on entities that pose a high degree of risk through their security-based swap activities. See
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30661 n.761. In addition, the link between
the major participant definitions and risk was highlighted during the congressional debate on the
statute. See 156 Cong. Rec. S5907 (daily ed. July 15, 2010).

593

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30661. Under Rule 3a67-1 under the
Exchange Act, 17 CFR § 240.3a67-1, a major security-based swap participant is any entity that
maintains security-based swap positions exceeding one of the following three thresholds: (1) $1
billion current uncollateralized exposure or $2 billion combined current uncollateralized exposure
and potential future exposure in a major category of security-based swaps (excluding certain
hedging positions); (2) $2 billion current uncollateralized exposure or $4 billion combined current
uncollateralized exposure and potential future exposure in all security-based swaps; or (3) highly
leveraged financial entities with $1 billion current uncollateralized exposure or $2 billion
combined current uncollateralized exposure and potential future exposure in a major category of
security-based swaps. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30751-54.

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30661.

595

The Commission indicated that the cross-border application of the major security-based swap
participant definition would be addressed in a separate release. See Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30692 n.1181.

B. Comment Summary
A variety of commenters provided their views on the application of the major securitybased swap participant definition and its related thresholds in the cross-border context, generally
suggesting that the major participant tests focus on the systemic risk that an entity’s swap
transactions poses to the U.S. market. 596 Commenters further suggested that major securitybased swap participant threshold calculations should exclude security-based swap transactions
that do not involve a U.S. counterparty. 597 Several FPSFIs further requested specific exclusions
from the major security-based swap participant definition, suggesting that as a matter of comity,
swap transactions involving foreign central banks as a counterparty, 598 international financial
institutions, and/or foreign SWFs should be excluded from the major participant definitions. 599
Certain entities managed or controlled by foreign governments also have asked for
exemptions or exclusions from Commission registration or the Dodd-Frank Act’s substantive
requirements. For example, SWFs commented that they believe SWFs should be excluded from
the definition of major security-based swap participant and thus the related regulatory
596

See, e.g., Financial Services Roundtable Letter at 25 (stating that “non-US entities should not be
subject to regulation as major participants unless their activities in US markets exceed the
relevant thresholds, even if their aggregate global activity would exceed those thresholds” and
warning that “the regulatory burden is sufficiently high that such entities may choose to exit the
US markets, or deny US market participants access to non-US markets, rather than submit to
regulation”); APG Asset Management Letter at 4 (recommending that the thresholds be amended
to exclude from the computations the outward credit exposures of the computing party to nonU.S. persons, and supporting the CFTC’s statement in its proposed registration release that the
major participant analysis should be focused on an entity’s activities with U.S. counterparties or
using U.S. mails or instrumentalities); and AIMA Letter at 4-5 (suggesting that in the case of
managed funds, only U.S. funds or funds otherwise regulated in the U.S. should be subject to
potential major participant designation).

597

See, e.g., Jones Day Letter at 7-8 (recommending that “[f]oreign swap transactions not involving
a U.S. counterparty, i.e., between two foreign counterparties[,] are more appropriately the
province of the supervisory authorities in the relevant non-U.S. jurisdiction and should, therefore,
be excluded from calculations of substantial swap positions”); Milbank Tweed Letter at 3
(“Clearly, the thresholds should not be applied to a non-U.S. participant's transactions with all of
its counterparties. Equally, all transactions with U.S. counterparties can reasonably be included.
To take account of transactions with non-U.S. counterparties that might meet the ‘direct and
significant connection’ standard, we suggest the Commissions consider including only those
transactions by a potential non-U.S. major swap participant that are with non-U.S. registered
swap dealers or non-U.S. registered major swap participants.”).

For this purpose, we consider the Bank for International Settlements, in which the Federal
Reserve and foreign central banks are members, to be a foreign central bank. See

their agencies); KfW letter at 8 (FPSFIs); World Bank Group Letter II at 1-2 (multilateral

obligations. 600 These entities argued that the Commission should not subject SWFs to
registration requirements based on principles of international comity and cooperation and noted
that SWFs are typically subject to comparable home country supervision that would render SEC
regulation largely duplicative. They also argued that excluding SWFs from the major securitybased swap participant definition would not increase systemic risks given that SWFs make longterm investments across diverse asset classes, use swaps or security-based swaps to hedge
portfolio risks rather than generate returns, and are more likely to ensure that risk management
measures are in place because of SWFs’ heightened concerns regarding reputational risk. 601
Another entity, which operates with an explicit government guarantee of its swap and
security-based swap obligations, argued that it should be excluded from the major participant
definition due to its lack of risk to the market resulting from this government support. 602
C. Proposed Approach
In light of the comments received on the application of the major security-based swap
participant definition in the cross-border context and the principles discussed above, 603 the
Commission is proposing a rule and interpretive guidance regarding the application of the major
security-based swap participant definition to cross-border activities.
1. In General
The Commission is proposing a rule under which a U.S. person would consider all
security-based swap transactions entered into by it, while a non-U.S. person would consider only
transactions entered into with U.S. persons, 604 when determining whether the person falls within
the major security-based swap participant definition. 605 Under this proposed approach, a nonU.S. person would calculate its security-based swap positions under the three prongs of the major
security-based swap participant definition 606 based solely on its transactions with U.S. persons
(including foreign branches of U.S. banks). All security-based swap transactions by a non-U.S.
person with other non-U.S. person counterparties, regardless of whether they are conducted

600

See China Investment Letter at 2-4 (further explaining that exempting SWFs from the definition
of MSBSP would not result in reduced transparency, given that the SWF would still have to
comply with a number of other Dodd-Frank Act requirements) and GIC Letter at 2, 5-6.

601

See Section II.C, supra.

604

Proposed Rule 3a67-10(a)(2) under the Exchange Act (defining the term “U.S. person” by crossreference to the definition of U.S. person in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act,
as discussed in Section III.B.5, supra).

605

165

within the United States or whether the non-U.S. person counterparties are guaranteed by a U.S.
person, would be excluded from the major security-based swap participant analysis.
The proposed rule would use the same definition of “U.S. person” as proposed in the
context of foreign security-based swap dealer registration. 607 As previously discussed, this
definition generally follows a territorial approach to defining U.S. person. 608 The proposed
approach to the U.S. person definition is intended to identify individuals or legal persons that, by
virtue of their location within the United States or their legal or other relationship with the
United States, are likely to impact the U.S. financial market and the U.S. financial system. 609
Therefore, we preliminarily believe that requiring a non-U.S. person to take into account its
security-based swap positions with U.S. persons, as proposed to be defined, for purposes of the
major security-based swap participant definition would provide an appropriate indication of the
degree of default risk posed by such non-U.S. person’s security-based swap positions to the U.S.
financial system, which we view as the focus of the major security-based swap participant
definition. 610 Consistent with the rules further defining the definition of major security-based
swap participant adopted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, such risk to the U.S.
financial system would be measured by calculating such non-U.S. person’s aggregate outward
exposures 611 to U.S. persons (that is, what such non-U.S. person owes, or potentially could owe,
on its security-based swaps with U.S. persons). 612 If such non-U.S. person’s aggregate outward

610

See Section 3(a)(67) of Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67). In particular, one of the thresholds
of the statutory definition of major security-based swap participant focuses on the serious adverse
effects on the financial stability of the U.S. banking system or financial markets as a result of
substantial counterparty exposure created by a person’s security-based swap positions. See
Section 3(a)(67)(A)(ii)(II) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67)(A)(ii)(II). In addition,
Section 3(a)(67)(B) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to define the term “substantial
position” in Sections 3(a)(67)(A)(ii)(I) and (III) of the Exchange Act at the threshold that the
Commission determines to be prudent for the effective monitoring, management, and oversight of
entities that are systemically important or can significantly impact the financial system of the
United States. See Section 3(a)(67)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(67)(B).

611

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30666-71; Rules 3a67-3(b) and (c)
under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR § 240.3a67-3(b) and (c).

612

The determination of whether a security-based swap transaction must be included in a non-U.S.
person’s major security-based swap participant calculation is based on the U.S. person status of
the non-U.S. person’s counterparty to such transaction, regardless of whether the counterparty is a
security-based swap dealer, end user, CCP, or other market participant. For example, where a
non-U.S. person enters into a security-based swap transaction with a security-based swap dealer,
and that transaction is submitted for clearing and novated from the dealer to a CCP, the non-U.S.
person would look to the U.S. person status of the CCP that became its counterparty as a result of

166

exposures to U.S. persons exceed one of the thresholds set forth in the rules further defining
“major security-based swap participant,” 613 the non-U.S. person would be required to register as
a major security-based swap participant.
Given the focus of the major security-based swap participant definition on the degree of
risk to the U.S. financial system, 614 the Commission preliminarily believes that the location in
which security-based swap transactions are conducted is not relevant to the calculation of a
person’s security-based swap positions for purposes of determining such person’s status as a
major security-based swap participant. Such an approach would differ from the approach we are
proposing with respect to the security-based swap dealer definition, where we would count
transactions connected with security-based swap dealing activity conducted within the United
States toward a potential security-based swap dealer’s de minimis threshold even if the
transactions were with non-U.S. persons. 615 This difference in approach is driven by the
different focuses of the statutory definitions of the terms security-based swap dealer and major
security-based swap participant. While the statutory major security-based swap participant
definition is focused specifically on risk, 616 the statutory security-based swap dealer definition is
focused on, in addition to risk, the nature of the activities undertaken by an entity, its interactions
with counterparties, and its role within the security-based swap market. 617 These different
statutory emphases lead us to treat major security-based swap participants differently from
security-based swap dealers with respect to whether activities conducted within the United States
should be counted toward their respective thresholds.
In addition, as stated above, the U.S. person definition applies to the entire entity,
including its branches and offices that may be located in a foreign jurisdiction. 618 Therefore,
under the proposed approach, a non-U.S. person would need to include its security-based swap
transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks when calculating its security-based swap
positions for purposes of the major security-based swap participant definition.
Some commenters on the CFTC Cross-Border Proposal have suggested that a non-U.S.
person should be allowed to exclude swap transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks for
purposes of determining whether it is a major swap participant because otherwise non-U.S.
persons would have a strong incentive to limit or even stop trading with U.S. banks that operate
such novation when determining whether the transaction must be included in such non-U.S.
person’s major security-based swap participant calculation.

outside the United States via foreign branches. 619 We are mindful of these concerns. However,
because foreign branches are not separate legal persons, 620 the Commission believes that the
potential losses that a U.S. bank would suffer due to a non-U.S. person counterparty’s default,
and the potential impact on the U.S. banking system and the U.S. financial system generally,
would not differ depending on whether the non-U.S. person counterparty entered into the
security-based swap with the home office of the U.S. bank or with a foreign branch of the U.S.
bank. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is appropriate to require a nonU.S. person to include its security-based swap transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks
for purposes of determining its major security-based swap participant status.
By contrast, the Commission preliminarily believes that a non-U.S. person (the “potential
non-U.S. person major security-based swap participant”) does not need to include its securitybased swap transactions with non-U.S. person counterparties in determining whether it is a major
security-based swap participant. As stated above, the focus of the major security-based swap
participant definition is on the degree of risk posed by a person’s security-based swap positions
to the U.S. financial system. 621 In the case of transactions with non-U.S. person counterparties,
the risk that a potential non-U.S. person major security-based swap participant will not pay what
it owes (or potentially could owe) under its security-based swaps to its non-U.S. counterparties is
not transmitted directly and fully to the U.S. financial system in the way that such risk would be
transmitted if the potential non-U.S. person major security-based swap participant engaged in
security-based swap transactions with U.S. person counterparties. Instead, the non-U.S. person
counterparties bear the direct and full risk of loss. 622 We recognize that there may be indirect
spillover effects related to the security-based swap positions arising from the activity conducted
by a potential non-U.S. person major security-based swap participant and a non-U.S. person
counterparty (e.g., a U.S. person that has an ownership interest in such a non-U.S. person
counterparty would potentially face losses on the value of its investment in such a non-U.S.
person counterparty due to failure of the potential non-U.S. person major security-based swap
participant), but the Commission preliminarily believes that the major security-based swap
participant tests do not need to address the potential indirect spillover risk to the U.S. financial
system from foreign investments by U.S. persons in non-U.S. persons, or other non-securitybased swap activities by U.S. persons with non-U.S. persons. 623
619

See, e.g., Citigroup Letter at 3.

620

See Section III.B.5, supra.

621

See note 610, supra.

622

This is the case even if the non-U.S. person counterparties’ obligations under the security-based
swaps with the potential non-U.S. person major security-based swap participant are guaranteed by
a U.S. person. As discussed in more detail below, the Commission proposes to address the risk
posed by a non-U.S. person’s security-based swap positions guaranteed by a U.S. person to the
U.S. financial system through its treatment of guarantees for purposes of the major security-based
swap participant definition. See Section IV.C.2(a), infra

623

The Commission preliminarily believes that such risk is more appropriately addressed under
Titles I and II of the Dodd-Frank Act.

168

The Commission recognizes that this proposed approach results in different treatment of
U.S. and non-U.S. persons under the major security-based swap participant definition (i.e., a
non-U.S. person would consider its security-based swap transactions with only U.S. persons,
while a U.S. person would consider all of its security-based swap transactions). However, the
Commission preliminarily believes that this approach is appropriate in light of the focus in the
major security-based swap participant definition on the U.S. financial system. More specifically,
the need for separate analysis of U.S. and non-U.S. entities results from the fact that all of a U.S.
person’s security-based swap transactions are part of and create risk to the U.S. financial system,
regardless of whether such entity’s counterparties are U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons. The
same is not true of non-U.S. persons, however, because the security-based swap transactions
entered into by a non-U.S. person with other non-U.S. persons are not fundamentally part of the
U.S. financial system, while such non-U.S. person’s security-based swap transactions with U.S.
persons would directly impact the U.S. financial system. Thus, we preliminarily believe that the
statutory major security-based swap participant definition’s focus on the U.S. financial system,
justifies treating U.S. and non-U.S. persons differently for purposes of the major participant
analysis based on the disparate impacts of their security-based swap transactions on the U.S.
financial system.
We recognize that a non-U.S. person’s transactions with other non-U.S. person
counterparties could still have an impact on the U.S. financial system, including where those
transactions threatened the financial integrity of a non-U.S. person counterparty and such person
had significant security-based swap positions with U.S. persons. However, the amount of risk
the non-U.S. person poses to the U.S. financial system would most directly stem from the size of
its direct positions with U.S. persons. As a result, the Commission preliminarily believes it is
appropriate to limit the international application of the major security-based swap participant
definition to a non-U.S. person’s security-based swaps entered into with U.S. persons.
2. Guarantees
The application of the major security-based swap participant definition to security-based
swap positions guaranteed by a parent, other affiliate, or guarantor raises unique issues in the
cross-border context. These issues were not addressed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release. 624
As a general principle, the Commission and the CFTC did note in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release that an entity’s security-based swap positions are attributed to a
parent, other affiliate, or guarantor for purposes of the major participant analysis to the extent
624

In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the Commissions stated they intended to
address guarantees provided to non-U.S. entities, and guarantees by non-U.S. holding companies,
in separate releases. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689 n.1134. In
this release, we are not altering the interpretive approach with respect to the attribution of
guarantees that was adopted by the Commissions in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release, but rather we are proposing an interpretive approach that would apply the principles
adopted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release in the cross-border context.

169

that the counterparties to those positions have recourse to that parent, other affiliate, or guarantor
in connection with the position. 625 Positions are not attributed in the absence of recourse. 626 The
Commission and the CFTC further stated that attribution of these positions for purposes of the
major participant definitions is intended to reflect the risk focus of the major participant
definitions by providing that entities will be regulated as major participants when they pose a
high level of risk in connection with the swap and security-based swap positions they guarantee.
The application of these general principles in the cross-border context is discussed below,
including the attribution of guaranteed security-based swap positions to U.S. persons and nonU.S. persons, respectively, when they provide guarantees on performance of the security-based
swap obligations of other persons, the limited circumstances where attribution of guaranteed
security-based swap positions is not required, and operational compliance.
(a) Guarantees Provided by U.S. Persons to Non-U.S. Persons
One cross-border issue that arises from the general approach to guarantees set forth in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release is how the attribution of guarantees for purposes of
the major security-based swap participant definition would apply to a guarantee provided by a
U.S. person for performance on the obligations of a non-U.S. person, such as a U.S. holding
company providing a guarantee on the obligations of a foreign subsidiary. As noted in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the attribution of guaranteed positions for purposes
of the major participant definitions is intended to reflect the risk that a guarantor might pose to,
and the systemic impact of such risk may impose on, the U.S. financial system as a result of the
guarantees that it provides. 627 The Commission preliminarily believes that these risk concerns
are the same when U.S. persons act as guarantors for foreign persons regardless of whether the
underlying security-based swap transactions that they guarantee are entered into with U.S.
persons or non-U.S. persons, given that the risk borne by the U.S. person guarantor would not be
impacted by the status of the guaranteed non-U.S. person’s counterparty as either a U.S. person
or non-U.S. person. As a result, the Commission is proposing that, other than in the limited
circumstances described below, 628 all security-based swaps entered into by a non-U.S. person
and guaranteed by a U.S. person be attributed to such U.S. person guarantor for purposes of
determining such U.S. person guarantor’s major security-based swap participant status,

1132 on that page.

626

See id. As indicated in note 160 above, the term “guarantee” as used in this release refers to a
contractual agreement pursuant to which one party to a security-based swap transaction has
recourse to its counterparty’s parent, other affiliate, or guarantor with respect to the
counterparty’s obligations owed under the transaction.

security-based swap positions to the guarantor would not apply).

170

regardless of whether the underlying transaction was entered into with a U.S. person
counterparty or non-U.S. person counterparty. 629
(b) Guarantees Provided by Non-U.S. Persons to U.S. Persons and Guarantees
Provided by Non-U.S. Persons to Non-U.S. Persons
Another cross-border issue related to the Commission’s approach to the attribution of
guarantees is how guarantees provided by non-U.S. persons are treated for purposes of the major
security-based swap participant definition. As previously noted, the statutory major securitybased swap participant definition’s focus on the accumulation of security-based swap risk by
non-U.S. persons is primarily centered on the impact such risk could have on the U.S. financial
system. 630 Where a non-U.S. person provides a guarantee on performance of the security-based
swap obligations of a U.S. person (e.g., a non-U.S. holding company providing a guarantee on
performance of the obligations owed by its U.S. subsidiary under security-based swaps entered
into by the U.S. subsidiary), the counterparties of such U.S. person would be taking the credit
risk of the non-U.S. person guarantor as well as the U.S. person. If the non-U.S. person
guarantor defaults, the full amount of risk accumulated under the guaranteed U.S. person’s
security-based swap positions would impact the U.S. financial system. As a result, subject to the
limited circumstances described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 631 a non-U.S.
person providing a guarantee on performance of the security-based swap obligations of a U.S.
person would attribute to itself all of the U.S. person’s security-based swap positions that are
guaranteed by the non-U.S. person guarantor for purposes of determining the non-U.S. person
guarantor’s major security-based swap participant status. 632
By contrast, where a non-U.S. person provides a guarantee on performance of the
security-based swap obligations of another non-U.S. person (e.g., a non-U.S. holding company
629

In all circumstances where a U.S. person guarantor is required to attribute to itself all securitybased swap transactions entered into by the guaranteed non-U.S. person, the guaranteed non-U.S.
person would still be required to consider those security-based swap transactions that it enters
into with U.S. person counterparties for purposes of determining whether it is a major securitybased swap participant pursuant to the proposed Rule 3a67-10(c)(2) under the Exchange Act. See
Section IV.C.1, supra (discussing proposed Rule 3a67-10(c) under the Exchange Act). Once the
guaranteed non-U.S. person becomes a major security-based swap participant and registers with
the Commission, the U.S. guarantor would no longer be required to attribute to itself the securitybased swap positions entered into by the guaranteed non-U.S. person. See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689. This same result would also occur where a
guaranteed non-U.S. person becomes subject to capital regulation by the Commission or the
CFTC (e.g., a registered major swap participant, swap dealer, security-based swap dealer, futures
commission merchant, or broker-dealer). See id.

providing a guarantee on performance of the obligations owed by its non-U.S. subsidiary under
security-based swaps entered into by the non-U.S. subsidiary), the ultimate counterparty credit
risk associated with the transaction would generally reside outside of the United States with the
non-U.S. guarantor. In this scenario, the potential impact on the U.S. financial system would be
limited to transactions entered into by the guaranteed non-U.S. person with U.S. person
counterparties. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that, other than in the limited
circumstances described below, 633 where a non-U.S. person guarantees performance on the
security-based swap transactions of another non-U.S. person, the non-U.S. guarantor need only
attribute to itself such guaranteed security-based swap transactions entered into with U.S. person
counterparties for purposes of determining its major security-based swap participant status. 634
(c) Limited Circumstances Where Attribution of Guaranteed Security-Based
Swap Positions Does Not Apply
In addition to setting forth general principles regarding the attribution of guaranteed swap
or security-based swap positions to the guarantor for the major participant definitions, the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release also provided interpretive guidance related to the
limited circumstances under which attribution of guaranteed swap or security-based swap
positions is not required. 635 Specifically, it stated that even in the presence of a guarantee, it is
not necessary to attribute a person’s swap or security-based swap positions to a parent or other
guarantor if the person already is subject to capital regulation by the Commission or the CFTC
(i.e., swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants, major security-based
swap participants, FCMs, and broker-dealers) or if the person is a U.S. entity regulated as a bank
in the United States. 636 In providing this interpretive guidance, the Commission and the CFTC
explained that the positions of those regulated entities already will be subject to capital and other

633

See Section IV.C.2(c), infra (discussing the limited circumstances where attribution of guaranteed
security-based swap positions of a non-U.S. person to the guarantor would not apply).

634

Where a non-U.S. person guarantor is required to attribute to itself the security-based swap
positions entered into by a non-U.S. person that are guaranteed by the first non-U.S. person, the
guaranteed non-U.S. person also would be required to consider all security-based swap
transactions entered into by itself with U.S. person counterparties for purposes of determining its
major security-based swap participant status in accordance with proposed Rule 3a67-10(c)(2)
under the Exchange Act. See Section IV.C.1, supra (discussing proposed Rule 3a67-10(c) under
the Exchange Act). Once the guaranteed non-U.S. person becomes a major security-based swap
participant and registers with the Commission, the non-U.S. guarantor would no longer be
required to attribute to itself the security-based swap positions entered into by the guaranteed
non-U.S. person. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689.

635

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689.

636

Id. This interpretive guidance applies to both U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons that are subject
to registration and regulation in the enumerated categories.

172

requirements, making it unnecessary to separately address, via major participant regulations, the
risks associated with guarantees of those positions of a regulated entity. 637
The Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release did not address the application of the
interpretive guidance regarding attribution of guaranteed positions where a guarantee is provided
to support a non-U.S. person’s performance on the obligations under security-based swaps in the
cross-border context. The Commission preliminarily believes that the interpretation jointly
adopted by the Commission and the CFTC in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release
regarding security-based swap positions of a person subject to capital regulation by the CFTC or
the Commission should equally apply to a non-U.S. person whose security-based swap positions
are guaranteed by another person. Therefore, the Commission is proposing to interpret that it is
not necessary to attribute a non-U.S. person’s security-based swap positions to a parent or other
guarantor if such non-U.S. person already is subject to capital regulation by the Commission or
the CFTC (i.e., swap dealers, security-based swap dealers, major swap participants, major
security-based swap participants, FCMs and broker-dealers).
In addition, in the cross-border context and with respect to a non-U.S. person, if such
non-U.S. person is not subject to capital regulation by the Commission or the CFTC, consistent
with the rationale for the approach to attribution of security-based swap positions of a person that
is a U.S. entity regulated as a bank in the United States, it would not be necessary to attribute
such non-U.S. person’s security-based swap positions to its guarantor if such non-U.S. person is
subject to capital standards that are consistent with the capital standards such non-U.S. person
would have been subject to if such non-U.S. person were a bank subject to the prudential
regulators’ capital regulation. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is not
necessary to attribute such non-U.S. person’s security-based swap positions to its guarantor for
purposes of determining the guarantor’s major security-based swap participant status, if such
non-U.S. person is subject to capital standards adopted by its home country supervisor that are
consistent in all respects with the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (the “Basel Accord”). 638 This proposed approach also is consistent with the capital
standards proposed by the prudential regulators for a foreign bank that is a swap dealer, major
swap participant, security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, which
require such foreign bank to comply with regulatory capital rules already made applicable to
such foreign bank as part of the existing prudential regulatory regime. 639 The Commission
637

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689.

638

This is consistent with the capital standards of the prudential regulators with respect to foreign
banks that are bank holding companies subject to the Federal Reserve Board of Governors’
supervision. See § 225.2(r)(3) of the Regulation Y (“For purposes of determining whether a
foreign banking organization qualifies under paragraph (r)(1) of this section: (A) A foreign
banking organization whose home country supervisor…has adopted capital standards consistent
in all respects with the Capital Accord of the Basle Committee on Banking Supervision (Basle
Accord) may calculate its capital ratios under the home country standard….”), 12 CFR
§225.2(r)(3).

639

See Prudential Regulator Margin and Capital Proposal, 76 FR at 27582 (“The proposed rule
generally requires a covered swap entity to comply with regulatory capital rules already made

173

preliminarily believes that security-based swap positions of a non-U.S. person subject to foreign
regulatory capital requirements consistent with the Basel Accord would be subject to risk-based
capital requirements that take into account the unique risks (including the credit risk, market risk,
and other risks) arising from security-based swap transactions, in such a way as to make it
unnecessary to separately address, via major security-based swap participant regulation, the risks
associated with guarantees of those security-based swap positions.
(d) Operational Compliance
Finally, the Commission believes that it is necessary to provide interpretive guidance
regarding operational compliance and the special issues that may result from the attribution of
security-based swap positions to a parent or guarantor. As the Commission and the CFTC noted
in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, these include issues regarding the application
of the transaction-focused requirements applicable to registered major participants (e.g., certain
requirements related to trading records and transaction confirmations), given that the entity that
is the direct counterparty to the swap or security-based swap may be better positioned to comply
with those requirements. 640 In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the Commission
and the CFTC stated that “an entity that becomes a major participant by virtue of swaps or
security-based swaps directly entered into by others must be responsible for compliance with all
applicable major participant requirements with respect to those swaps or security-based swaps
(and must be liable for failures to comply), but may delegate operational compliance with
transaction-focused requirements to entities that directly are party to the transactions. The entity
that is the major participant, however, cannot delegate compliance duties with the entity-level
requirements applicable to major participants (e.g., requirements related to registration and
capital).” 641
The Commission preliminarily believes that the same approach should apply in the crossborder context when the guarantor and the guaranteed person are located in different
jurisdictions (e.g., U.S. holding companies that act as guarantors of the security-based swap
obligations of their non-U.S. dealing subsidiaries). In each case, the major security-based swap
participant may delegate compliance duties for transaction-focused requirements to the entities
that are counterparties to the transactions, but the major security-based swap participant would
remain responsible for ensuring that the Title VII requirements applicable to such transactions
are fulfilled. However, major security-based swap participants must comply with all relevant
entity-level requirements themselves that are not transaction-focused, such as registration and
capital. Entity-level requirements that have a transaction focus, such as margin, may be
delegated to the guaranteed entities that directly are party to the transactions. However, the
applicable to that covered swap entity as part of its prudential regulatory regime. . . . In the case
of a foreign bank or the U.S. branch or agency of a foreign bank, the capital rules that are made
applicable to such covered entity pursuant to § 225.2(r)(3) of the Board’s Regulation Y, 12 CFR §
225.2(r)(3)…”).

major security-based swap participants would remain responsible for ensuring compliance with
these requirements.
3. Foreign Public Sector Financial Institutions (FPSFIs)
The proposed approach to the cross-border application of the major security-based swap
participant definition described above provides a general framework for applying the definition
to non-U.S. persons. That framework does not separately address questions raised by
commenters regarding how the major security-based swap participant definition applies to
FPSFIs. Specifically, some commenters requested explicit exclusions from the major securitybased swap participant definition for these types of entities. 642
We note that FPSFIs encompass a wide range of institutions and organizations, ranging
from divisions of foreign central banks, to international financial institutions established under
treaties, to multilateral development banks formed, owned, and controlled by sovereign
members, to sovereign wealth funds and other investment corporations owned by foreign
governments. Some FPSFIs’ obligations are guaranteed or backed by foreign governments;
others may not be. The purposes and activities of these institutions and organizations vary. For
example, some FPSFIs (such as the Bank for International Settlements) provide banking services
to foreign central banks who are their members. Some FPSFIs provide credits and grants to
promote economic development in developing countries (e.g., multilateral development banks)
or distribute funds of regional recovery programs to promote regional economies (e.g., KfW for
the European Recovery Program). Other FPSFIs conduct investment activities around the world
and their exclusive customers are the foreign governments to which they are linked. Depending
on their purposes and activities, FPSFIs may engage in different types of swaps or security-based
swaps to various degrees, although the Commission is not aware of data reflecting the nature and
amount of such transactions across the FPSFI population. One commenter stated that it enters
into swaps to manage interest rates and foreign exchange risks but does not use swaps to
generate returns. 643
Several commenters requested that FPSFIs be excluded from the major security-based
swap participant definition. They provided various reasons and basis to support their requests.
Some FPSFIs commented that they are subject to exceptionally high risk controls and have
extremely strong capital bases and therefore pose no risk to systemic stability. 644 Others argued
that they already are subject to comparable or comprehensive substantive regulation of their
respective governments in their home countries and therefore, subjecting them to the major
security-based swap participant regulation would create regulatory duplication or conflicts. 645
642

See note 599, supra.

development banks use derivatives in their development operations, or do so only on a limited
basis.” See World Bank Letter II at 1 n.1.

See BIS Letter II at 3 and World Bank Letter I at 7.

645

See GIC Letter at 3-4 and KfW Letter at 3 and 8.

175

One FPSFI argued that it only conducts swap activities with dealers, which would be regulated
under Title VII, and therefore it is not necessary to subject it to duplicative regulation and
supervision. 646 Another FPSFI, which operates with an explicit government guarantee of its
swap and security-based swap obligations, argued that it should be excluded from the major
participant definition due to its lack of risk to the market resulting from this government
support. 647 Intergovernmental organizations, such as multilateral development banks, argued
that multilateral development institutions are never subject to national regulations and their
privileges and immunities should be fully respected. 648
After considering the concerns of these commenters, we recognize that FPSFIs raise
unique and complex issues because of the diversity of the special purposes they are serving, their
differing governance structures and sources of financial strength, and their supranational,
intergovernmental, or sovereign nature. The Commission also recognizes that we have received
relatively little information from commenters regarding the types, levels, and natures of securitybased swap activity that FPSFIs regularly engage in (although some information has been
received regarding their swap transactions) and that, consequently, the Commission has
comparatively little basis on which to understand their roles in the security-based swap markets
and, as appropriate, exclude them from the major security-based swap participant definition.
Therefore, we are not proposing to specifically address the treatment of FPSFIs at this time.
Instead, we are soliciting comment to help determine the basis on which it may be appropriate to
exclude FPSFIs from the proposed rule regarding application of the major security-based swap
participant definition to non-U.S. persons. In particular, we invite public comment regarding the
types, levels, and nature of the security-based swap activity that various types of FPSFIs may
engage in on a regular basis, the roles of FPSFIs in the security-based swap market, the
mitigating factors and reasons that FPSFIs may not pose systemic risk as a result of their
security-based swap activity, and whether it would be more appropriate for the Commission to
address FPSFI concerns on an individual basis. We also request considerations, information, and
data regarding potential definitions of a FPSFI for purposes of the major security-based swap
definition. Responses that are supported by empirical data and analysis are encouraged in
assisting the Commission in considering whether excluding FPSFIs from the definition of the
major security-based swap participant is warranted.

D. Title VII Requirements Applicable to Major Security-Based Swap Participants
1. Transaction-Level Requirements Related to Customer Protection
(a) Overview
As previously noted, the Dodd-Frank Act is generally concerned with the protection of
the U.S. financial system and counterparties in the U.S. security-based swap market. 649 This
general principle is particularly relevant to the customer protection, including segregation,
requirements in Title VII, which are focused on the protection of the counterparties or customers
of security-based swap dealers. As a result, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is not
necessary to the objective of Title VII to subject foreign major security-based swap participants
to certain of the customer protection requirements in Title VII with respect to their transactions
with non-U.S. persons. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing rules that would identify
specific transaction-level requirements that would not apply to foreign major security-based
swap participants with respect to their transactions with non-U.S. persons.
(b) Proposed Rules
The proposed rules would provide that foreign major security-based swap participants
would not be subject, solely with respect to their transactions with non-U.S. persons, to certain of
the transaction-level requirements that apply to major security-based swap participants. 650
Specifically, under the proposed rules registered foreign major security-based swap participants
would not have to comply with business conduct standards as described in Section 15F(h) of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, other than the rules and regulations
prescribed by the Commission relating to diligent supervision pursuant to Section
15F(h)(1)(B) 651 and the rules and regulations thereunder, with respect to their transactions with
non-U.S. persons. 652 In addition, under the proposed rules, registered foreign major securitybased swap participants that are not registered broker-dealers would not have to comply with
requirements related to the segregation of assets held as collateral in Section 3E of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to their transactions with non-U.S.
persons. 653
Our rationale for this proposed approach to the application of transaction-level
requirements for foreign major security-based swap participants is substantially the same as that

649

See note 4, supra.

650

Proposed Rule 3a67-10(b) and proposed Rule 18a-4(f) under the Exchange Act.

651

15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(1)(B).

652

See Section III.C.3(a)(i), supra. As discussed previously, Section 15F(h)(1)(B) requires securitybased swap dealers to conform with such business conduct standards relating to diligent
supervision as the Commission shall prescribe.

653

See proposed Rule 18a-4(f) under the Exchange Act.

177

discussed previously in the context of foreign security-based swap dealers. 654 This rationale
includes our belief that applying these customer protections and segregation requirements to
security-based swap transactions with non-U.S. persons outside the United States would not
advance the objectives of Title VII to protect the U.S. financial system or U.S. counterparties.
At the same time, this approach would preserve customer protections for U.S. person
counterparties who would expect to benefit from the protections afforded by Title VII.
2. Entity-Level Requirements
Entity-level requirements in Title VII primarily address concerns relating to the major
security-based swap participant as a whole, with a particular focus on safety and soundness of
the entity to reduce systemic risk in the U.S. financial system. The most significant entity-level
requirements are capital and margin requirements. Because these requirements address the
financial, operational, and business integrity of the entity engaged in security-based swap
activity, the Commission preliminarily believes that a registered foreign major security-based
swap participant should be required to adhere to these standards. As noted above, other
requirements that the Commission believes should apply at the entity, rather than the
transactional, level include, but are not limited to, risk management procedures, books and
records requirements, conflicts of interest systems and procedures, and designation of a chief
compliance officer. 655 These entity-level requirements ensure the safety and soundness of the
entire registrant and are thus distinguishable from the transaction-level requirements discussed
above, which apply to transactions with individual counterparties and thus may be applied
differently based on the U.S. person status of a counterparty.
3. Substituted Compliance
The Commission is not proposing, at this time, to establish a policy and procedural
framework under which we would consider permitting compliance by a foreign major securitybased swap participant with comparable regulatory requirements in a foreign jurisdiction to
substitute for compliance with requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations

654

See generally Section III.C.4(b), supra. In addition, all “nonresident major security-based swap
participants,” as defined in proposed Rule 15Fb2-4(a) under the Exchange Act, would be
required: (1) to appoint and identify to the Commission an agent in the United States (other than
the Commission or a Commission member, official or employee) for service of process; (2) to
certify that the firm can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt access to its
books and records and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the
Commission; and (3) to provide the Commission with an opinion of counsel concurring that the
firm can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt access to its books and records
and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. See
proposed Rule 15Fb2-4(b) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in the Registration Proposing
Release, 76 FR 65799-801.

655

See Section III.C.3(b), supra.

178

thereunder, applicable to major security-based swap participants, as it is proposing to do for
foreign security-based swap dealers. 656
Unlike foreign security-based swap dealers whose primary businesses are in securities,
security-based swaps, swaps, banking and other financial and investment banking activities, the
non-U.S. persons that may need to register as nonbank major security-based swap participants
may engage in a diverse range of business activities different from, and broader than, the
activities conducted by broker-dealers or security-based swap dealers (otherwise they may be
required to register as a security-based swap dealer and/or broker-dealer) or the activities
conducted by banks. For example, as stated in the Capital, Margin and Segregation Proposing
Release, persons that may need to register as nonbank major security-based swap participants
may engage in commercial activities that require them to have substantial fixed assets to support
manufacturing and/or result in them having significant assets comprised of unsecured
receivables. 657 Therefore, it is not clear what types of entity-level regulatory oversight, if any,
especially with respect to capital and margin, a foreign major security-based swap participant
would be subject to in the foreign regulatory system.
Accordingly, in light of the limited information currently available to us regarding what
types of foreign entities may become major security-base swap participants, if any, and the
foreign regulation of such entities, we are not, at this time, proposing to extend the proposed
policy and procedural framework for substituted compliance to foreign major-security-based
swap participants. Nevertheless, we will continue to consider the appropriateness of permitting
substituted compliance for major security-based swap participants in light of comments received
on this proposal and market developments more generally and will consider what further steps to
take, if any, at adoption. In this regard, we request considerations, information, and data
regarding potential foreign major security-based swap participants. Responses that are supported
by empirical data and analysis are encouraged in assisting the Commission in considering
whether permitting substituted compliance by foreign major security-based swap participants
would be warranted.
Request for Comment
The proposed rules and interpretations regarding the application of the major securitybased swap participant definition and transaction-level and entity-level requirements to
registered major security-based swap participants discussed above represent the Commission’s
preliminary views. The Commission seeks comment on the proposed rules and interpretations in
all aspects. Interested persons are encouraged to provide supporting data and analysis and, when
appropriate, suggest modifications to proposed rule text and interpretations. Responses that are
supported by data and analysis provide great assistance to the Commission in considering the
practicality and effectiveness of the proposed application as well as considering the benefits and

656

657

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, 77 FR at 70315.

179

costs of proposed requirements. In addition, the Commission seeks comment on the following
specific questions:
•

Should the major security-based swap participant definition focus only on a non-U.S.
person’s security-based swap transactions entered into with U.S. persons, or should
the major security-based swap participant definition incorporate some or all of a nonU.S. person’s other security-based swap transactions? Which transactions? For
example, should a non-U.S. person include security-based swap transactions with
non-U.S. person counterparties guaranteed by U.S. persons in such non-U.S. person’s
major security-based swap participant calculation? Why or why not?

•

Should the proposed approach toward determining whether a non-U.S. person should
count its security-based swap transactions that are cleared through CCPs be adopted?
Why or why not? Should the Commission adopt a different approach to the treatment
of security-based swap transactions cleared through CCPs for purposes of the crossborder application of the major security-based swap participant test? If so, how
should cleared transactions be treated for purposes of the cross-border application of
the major security-based swap participant test?

•

Should a non-U.S. person be permitted to exclude its security-based swap
transactions entered into with foreign branches of U.S. banks from the calculation for
purposes of determining whether it is a major security-based swap participant? Why?
If a non-U.S. person’s security-based swaps with foreign branches of U.S. banks are
not required to be considered in determining such non-U.S. person’s major securitybased swap participant status, how should the risk (in terms of outward exposures)
that such non-U.S. person poses to U.S. banks be addressed?

•

Should the Commission permit a non-U.S. person to exclude from its major securitybased swap participant calculations its security-based swap positions arising from
transactions with the foreign branches of U.S. banks if such non-U.S. person is
subject to capital standards adopted by its home country supervisor that are consistent
in all respect with the Basel Accord? Are there other conditions or standards the
Commission should consider that a non-U.S. person may satisfy or comply with that
should allow a non-U.S. person to exclude its security-based swap positions arising
from transactions with foreign branches of U.S. banks from its major security-based
swap participant calculation?

•

Are there competitiveness concerns related to the proposed different treatment of U.S.
persons and non-U.S. persons for purposes of calculating their status under the major
security-based swap participant definition? If so, what are these concerns, and how
should they be addressed?

•

Should the proposed approach towards the attribution of security-based swap
positions guaranteed by U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons be altered? What
justifications would support an alternate approach?
180

•

Should the Commission adopt the proposed approach to the attribution of guaranteed
security-based swap positions whereby the positions of guaranteed entities subject to
capital standards adopted by its home country supervisor that are consistent in all
respects with the Basel Accord would not need to be attributed? Is Basel Accord
capital standard an appropriate standard for determining whether it is not necessary to
attribute guaranteed security-based swap positions to a guarantor, or should another
standard be used? Is this proposed standard clear, or is additional guidance
necessary? In addition to the proposed capital standard, should the Commission’s
approach to the attribution of guaranteed security-based swap positions also include a
requirement that the guaranteed entities be subject to effective capital oversight by its
home country supervisor as determined by the Commission in order not to attribute
the guaranteed security-based swap positions to the guarantor?

•

Are there FPSFIs that would fall within the definition of major security-based swap
participant based on the proposed rules and interpretive guidance? If so, should the
Commission provide relief to such FPSFIs? If so, what type of relief, what types of
entities should be eligible for such relief, and what factors would justify such relief?
Would it be more appropriate for the Commission to address these concerns on an
individual basis?

•

Should the Commission adopt the proposed approach to the application of certain
customer protection requirements and segregation requirements to foreign major
security-based swap participants with respect to their transactions with non-U.S.
persons? If so, are there other transaction-level requirements that should be included
within this proposed approach?

•

Should substituted compliance be provided to foreign major security-based swap
participants with respect to entity-level requirements? Transaction-level
requirements? If so, how should the Commission make such a determination? In
particular, what standard should be used for determining whether existing regulation
merits a substituted compliance determination?

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to major security-based
swap participants? How would the application of the proposed approach affect the
competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States
as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market
participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain.
Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please
explain. What other measures should the Commission consider to implement the
proposed approach to major security-based swap participants? What would be the
market impacts and competitiveness effects of alternatives to the proposed approach
discussed in this release?

Security-Based Swap Clearing Agencies

A. Introduction
Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act adds a number of provisions to the Exchange Act
relating to the registration and regulation of clearing agencies that provide clearance and
settlement services for security-based swaps. 658 Such provisions augment the Commission’s
existing authority to register and regulate clearing agencies in Section 17A of the Exchange
Act. 659 In particular, Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 763(b) of the
Dodd-Frank Act, requires clearing agencies that use interstate commerce to perform the
functions of a clearing agency with respect to security-based swaps to register with the
Commission. 660 Section 17A(k) of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 763(b) of the DoddFrank Act, provides the Commission with authority to exempt a security-based swap clearing
agency from registration if the Commission determines that the clearing agency is subject to
comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the CFTC or the appropriate
government authorities in the home country of the clearing agency. 661 The Dodd-Frank Act also
added provisions to Section 17A of the Exchange Act relating to voluntary clearing agency
registration and the establishment of clearing agency standards. 662 Finally, Section 17A(j)
requires the Commission to adopt rules governing persons that are registered as clearing agencies
for security-based swaps. 663
Because of the global nature of the security-based swap market, the Commission
recognizes that there may be some uncertainty regarding when a foreign security-based swap
clearing agency 664 that provides central counterparty (“CCP”) services 665 for security-based

to Section 17A of the Exchange Act. The subsection (g) added by Section 763(b) of the DoddFrank Act is the focus of the discussion in this section.

15 U.S.C. 78q-1(k). The exemptive authority contained in Section 17A(k) of the Exchange Act
only pertains to clearing agencies that would be required to register under Section 17A of the
Exchange Act for the clearing of security-based swaps. It does not alter the Commission’s
existing exemptive authority found in Section 17A(b)(1) and Section 36 of the Exchange Act.

Section 17A(h) of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 763(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, permits
a person, in certain cases, to voluntarily register as a clearing agency with the Commission. 15
U.S.C. 78q-1(h). Section 17A(i) of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 763(b) of the DoddFrank Act, requires security-based swap clearing agencies to comply with standards established
by the Commission. 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(i).

663

15 U.S.C. 78q-1(j).

664

In using the terms “foreign” and “non-resident” in connection with a security-based swap clearing
agency, the Commission means a security-based swap clearing agency that is not a U.S. person,
as that term is defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in
Section III.B.5, supra. In this regard, the Commission notes that legal persons that have their

182

swaps would be required to register with the Commission as a clearing agency. Accordingly, we
are proposing interpretive guidance regarding the application of the registration requirement in
Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act for security-based swap clearing agencies that act as
CCPs.666 We also address our exemptive authority under Section 17A(k) to exempt a foreign
security-based swap clearing agency from the registration requirement in Section 17A(g). 667 In
addition, we discuss the potential application of alternative standards to certain foreign clearing
agency registrants.
The proposed interpretation discussed below represents the Commission’s preliminary
views regarding the application of the registration requirement in Section 17A(g) for securitybased swap clearing agencies acting as CCPs in the cross-border context. Our proposal reflects a
balancing of the principles described above, including, in particular, the goal of the Dodd-Frank
Act to address the risk to the U.S. financial system. 668 We recognize, however, that the proposed

principal place of business in the United States would be considered “U.S. persons” under the
proposed definition regardless of their place of incorporation or organization. See proposed Rule
3a71-3(a)(7)(i)(B) under the Exchange Act.
665

As discussed more fully below, generally speaking, a CCP is an entity that interposes itself
between the counterparties to a securities transaction. See 17 CFR § 240.17Ad-22(a)(1).

666

In this section, the Commission is proposing interpretive guidance only regarding the registration
requirement in Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act as it applies to clearing agencies that provide
CCP services. The Commission is not addressing the registration requirement in Section 17A(b)
of the Exchange Act, which was unchanged by the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission also is not
addressing the registration of clearing agencies that provide other types of services for securitybased swaps and other securities. Elsewhere, the Commission has provided a temporary
exemption from the clearing agency registration requirements to clearing agencies that provide
non-CCP types of clearance and settlement services for security-based swaps. See Order
Pursuant to Section 36 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Granting Temporary Exemptions
from Clearing Agency Registration Requirements under Section 17A(b) of the Exchange Act for
Entities Providing Certain Clearing Services for Security-Based Swaps, Exchange Act Release
No. 64796 (July 1, 2011). Accordingly, the Commission expects to address clearing agencies that
provide non-CCP services in a future release.

667

The Commission also has adopted final rules to exempt transactions by CCPs in security-based
swaps from all provisions of the Securities Act, other than the anti-fraud provisions in Section
17(a), as well as from Exchange Act registration requirements and provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act. See Exemptions for Security-Based Swaps issued by Certain Clearing Agencies,
Securities Act Release No. 9308 (Mar. 30, 2012), 77 FR 20536 (Apr. 5, 2012). The exemption is
conditioned on the CCP being registered or exempt from registration with the Commission, on
the determination that the security-based swap is required to be cleared or that the CCP is
permitted to clear it pursuant to its rules, that the security-based swap is sold only to an ECP, and
that certain information be made available to a counterparty or to the public.

668

See Section II.C, supra. In addition, as noted above, to promote effective and consistent global
regulation of swaps and security-based swaps, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commission and
the CFTC to consult and coordinate with foreign regulatory authorities on the “establishment of

183

interpretation represents one of a number of possible alternative approaches in applying Title VII
in the cross-border context. Accordingly, the Commission invites comment regarding all aspects
of the proposal discussed below, including potential alternative approaches. Responses that are
supported by data and analysis provide great assistance to the Commission in considering the
practicality and effectiveness of the proposed application as well as considering the benefits and
costs of proposed requirements.
B. Proposed Title VII Approach
1. Clearing Agency Registration
Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act, entitled “Registration Requirement,” provides that
“[i]t shall be unlawful for a clearing agency, unless registered with the Commission, directly or
indirectly to make use of the mails or any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to
perform the functions of a clearing agency with respect to a security-based swap.” 669 The
Commission preliminarily believes that Title VII was intended to apply to clearing agencies that
perform clearing agency functions within the United States, regardless of their principal place of
business or their place of incorporation or organization. 670 For reasons discussed below, the
proposed interpretive guidance would provide that a security-based swap clearing agency
performs the functions of a CCP within the United States if it has a U.S. person as a member.
(a) Clearing Agencies Acting as CCPs
Clearing agencies are broadly defined under the Exchange Act and undertake a variety of
functions. 671 One such function is to act as a CCP, 672 which is an entity that interposes itself
consistent international standards” with respect to the regulation of swaps and security-based
swaps. Pub. L. No. 111-203 § 752(a).
669

15 U.S.C. 78q-1(g).

670

See Section II.B, supra.

671

Section 3(a)(23)(A) of the Exchange defines the term “clearing agency” to mean any person who:
(i) acts as an intermediary in making payments or deliveries or both in connection with
transactions in securities; (ii) provides facilities for comparison of data respecting the terms of
settlement of securities transactions, to reduce the number of settlements of securities
transactions, or for the allocation of securities settlement responsibilities; (iii) acts as a custodian
of securities in connection with a system for the central handling of securities whereby all
securities of a particular class or series of any issuer deposited within the system are treated as
fungible and may be transferred, loaned, or pledged by bookkeeping entry, without physical
delivery of securities certificates (such as a securities depository); or (iv) otherwise permits or
facilitates the settlement of securities transactions or the hypothecation or lending of securities
without physical delivery of securities certificates (such as a securities depository). 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(23)(A).

672

See Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, 77 FR at 66221 n.17 (“[a]n entity that acts as a
CCP for securities transactions is a clearing agency as defined in the Exchange Act and is
required to register with the Commission”).

184

between the counterparties to a securities transaction. For example, when a security-based swap
contract between two counterparties that are members of a CCP is executed and submitted for
clearing, it is typically replaced by two new contracts—separate contracts between the CCP and
each of the two original counterparties. At that point, the original counterparties are no longer
counterparties to each other. Instead, each acquires the CCP as its counterparty, and the CCP
assumes the counterparty credit risk of each of the original counterparties that are members of
the CCP. Structured and operated appropriately, CCPs may improve the management of
counterparty risk and may provide additional benefits such as multilateral netting of trades. 673
Although technology and risk management practices frequently change and vary from
CCP to CCP, the following are some of the functions performed by the subset of clearing
agencies that are CCPs: 674
•

the extinguishing of a security-based swap contract between two counterparties and
the associated novation of it with two new contracts between the CCP and each of the
two original counterparties;

•

the assumption of counterparty credit risk of members of the CCP through the
novated security-based swap contracts;

•

the calculation and collection of initial and variation margin during the life of the
security-based swap contract;

•

the determination of settlement obligations under a security-based swap contract;

•

the determination of a default under a security-based swap contract;

•

the collection of funds from members for contributions to a clearing fund;

•

the implementation of a loss-sharing arrangement among members to respond to a
member insolvency or default; and

•

the multilateral netting of trades. 675

673

See id.

674

The Commission does not believe that the opening and maintenance of bank accounts or
investment accounts in the United States by a CCP that are not directly accessible by members of
a security-based swap clearing agency constitutes the performance of functions of a CCP for
these purposes. See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 39643 (Feb. 11, 1998), 63 FR 8232, 8234
(Feb. 18, 1998) (discussing a foreign unregistered clearing agency’s use of a U.S. depository,
which did not in and of itself trigger the registration requirement). In addition, the Commission
does not believe that the use of U.S.-based persons to perform services on behalf of a CCP in the
ordinary course of business that do not involve clearing agency functions (e.g., financial
guaranties, banking services, or payroll operations) constitutes the performance of functions of a
clearing agency.

185

In performing these functions, CCPs help facilitate over-the-counter trading, and trading
on exchanges and other platforms, through the assumption of counterparty risk by the CCP from
the original counterparties. During times of market stress, a CCP would mitigate the potential
for a market participant’s failure to be transmitted to other market participants, and would
increase transparency of the risks borne by its members, as well as confidence of the market
participants in the performance of their transactions. 676
Furthermore, the agreements among members and between members and a CCP play a
key role in the CCP’s performance of the functions of a clearing agency. The Exchange Act
permits clearing agencies to deny membership if a person does not meet a clearing agency’s
financial responsibility, operational capacity, experience and competence standards. 677 In a
scenario where risk is mutualized under loss-sharing arrangements, the strength of the CCP
hinges upon the strength of its members. The legal arrangements between a CCP and its
members are of significant importance to the operational resilience of the CCP itself.
(b) Proposed Interpretive Guidance
The Commission is proposing interpretive guidance that a security-based swap clearing
agency performing the functions of a CCP within the United States would be required to register
pursuant to Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act. 678 In our preliminary view, a foreign securitybased swap clearing agency that provides CCP services, as described above, to a member that is
a U.S. person for security-based swaps would be performing the functions of a CCP within the
United States and, therefore, would be required to register pursuant to Section 17A(g) of the
Exchange Act. The Commission preliminarily believes that such an approach is consistent with
the Dodd-Frank Act’s goal of reducing systemic risk in the U.S. financial system. 679 Foreign
675

See, e.g., CDS Clearing Exemption Orders, note 74, supra.

676

See Report of the Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs regarding The
Restoring American Financial Stability Act of 2010, S. Rep. No. 111-176 at 31 (stating that by
“mandating the use of central clearinghouses, institutions would become much less
interconnected, mitigating risk and increasing transparency.”). At the same time, concentrating
risk from several counterparties into a CCP could actually introduce risks through the prospect of
moral hazard, such as if the costs of imprudent decisions by one clearing member were shifted to
other clearing members or to the general public through bail-out of a CCP. See, e.g., Craig
Pirrong, “Mutualization of Default Risk, Fungibility, and Moral Hazard: The Economics of
Default Risk Sharing in Cleared and Bilateral Markets,” University of Houston, Working Paper
(2010), available at:
http://business.nd.edu/uploadedFiles/Academic_Centers/Study_of_Financial_Regulation/pdf_and
_documents/clearing_moral_hazard_1.pdf. Such cost-shifting mechanisms might induce
members to take on more risk than they otherwise would in a bilateral setting.

677

See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(b)(4); see also 17 CFR § 240.17Ad-22(d)(2) (requiring registered
clearing agencies to establish, implement, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures
reasonably designed to require participants to meet certain operational capacity standards).

678

15 U.S.C. 78q-1.

679

See note 4, supra.

186

security-based swap clearing agencies that provide CCP services to U.S. members could pose a
risk to the United States due to the risk mutualization among members of these clearing
agencies. 680 Further, the more complete information about relationships between security-based
swap market participants that registration would provide to regulators and the marketplace may
help reduce the risk of crises. 681 Accordingly, to address the risk to the U.S. financial system
posed by foreign security-based swap clearing agencies with U.S. members, the Commission
preliminarily is proposing to require foreign security-based swap clearing agencies that provide
CCP services to U.S. members to register pursuant to Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act.
The Commission anticipates, however, that some U.S. persons may choose to clear
transactions at a foreign security-based swap clearing agency on an indirect basis through a
correspondent clearing arrangement with a non-U.S. member of the clearing agency. 682 We
preliminarily do not believe that such a correspondent clearing arrangement of a U.S. person
with a non-U.S. person member alone would cause the foreign security-based swap clearing
agency to be required to register with the Commission because the clearing agency’s business is
conducted directly with its member firms, which in this example would be located outside of the
United States. Correspondent clearing arrangements do not pose the same type of direct risk to
the U.S. financial system that foreign security-based swap clearing agencies with U.S. members
pose because customers, unlike clearing agency members, do not take mutual responsibility for
the obligations of the clearing agency. 683
2. Exemption from Registration under Section 17A(k)
Section 17A(k) of the Exchange Act, as added by Section 763(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act,
provides that the Commission may grant a conditional or unconditional exemption from clearing
agency registration for the clearing of security-based swaps if the Commission determines that

680

See, e.g., Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, 77 FR at 66267 (stating that “[a]ll
clearing agencies that act as CCPs in the United States collect contributions from their members
to guaranty funds or clearing funds for the mutualization of losses under extreme but plausible
market scenarios”).

681

See note 676, supra.

682

Traditionally, the Commission has required registration (or an exemption from registration) as a
clearing agency if a foreign clearing agency provides services for U.S. securities directly to U.S.
persons. The Commission has not viewed intermediated access by U.S. persons to a foreign
clearing agency’s services (for example, through a foreign broker) as sufficiently direct to trigger
registration requirements. See Proposed Amendments to Rule 15a-6, 73 FR at 39198
(summarizing the Commission’s position taken in past exemptive orders).

683

As noted above, the interpretation proposed here applies solely to the registration requirement in
Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act with respect to clearing agencies that provide CCP services
for security-based swaps; it does not change the Commission’s interpretation of Section 17A(b)
of the Exchange Act. See note 666, supra.

187

the clearing agency is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the
CFTC or the appropriate government authorities in the home country of the clearing agency. 684
The Commission preliminarily believes that it may be appropriate to consider an
exemption as an alternative to registration in circumstances where the clearing agency is subject
to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by appropriate government authorities
in the home country of the clearing agency, and the nature of the clearing agency’s activities and
performance of functions within the United States suggest that registration is not necessary to
achieve the Commission’s regulatory objectives. Exemptions that are carefully targeted could
help to improve clearing agency supervision overall by allowing the Commission to devote
resources most efficiently where U.S. interests are more directly implicated, while reducing
duplication of efforts in areas where its interests are aligned with those of other regulators.
Section 17A(k) further provides that any such exemption may be subject to appropriate
conditions that may include, but are not limited to, requiring the clearing agency to be available
for inspection by the Commission and to make available all information requested by the
Commission.685
The Commission is not at this point specifying how such determinations might be made.
The Commission notes that market structure and clearing agency supervision and regulation vary
in other jurisdictions, and these variances in combination would affect the Commission’s ability
to make a determination under Section 17A(k) of the Exchange Act in a particular case, as well
as the conditions that would be applied to any exemption. In addition to these factors,
differences among individual clearing agencies on matters such as organizational governance,
rules for members, and risk management procedures would inform individual exemption
determinations.
3. Application of Alternative Standards to Certain Registrants
In addition, the Commission may consider, as an alternative to an exemption from
registration, proposing rules that are specific to foreign-based CCPs that are registered with the
Commission under Section 17A(g). We believe that this approach is contemplated by Section
17A(i) of the Exchange Act, which permits the Commission to adopt rules for registered CCPs
that clear security-based swaps and conform our regulatory standards and supervisory practices
to reflect evolving United States and international standards. 686 This approach may be
684

15 U.S.C. 78q-1(k).

685

Id.

686

Specifically, Section 17A(i) of the Exchange Act, entitled “Standards for Clearing Agencies
Clearing Security-Based Swap Transactions”: (i) requires registered clearing agencies that clear
security-based swaps to comply with such standards that the Commission may establish by rule;
(ii) contemplates that the Commission may conform such standards or its oversight practices to
reflect evolving United States and international standards; and (iii) except where the Commission
determines otherwise by rule or regulation, confirms that a clearing agency shall have reasonable
discretion in establishing the manner in which it complies with any such standards. 15 U.S.C.
78q-1(i).

188

particularly appropriate where the Commission determines not to grant a general exemption from
registration under Section 17A(k) of the Exchange Act, based on consideration of the factors
described above, but where consistency with some regulatory standards suggests that a targeted
regulatory approach may be warranted.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed interpretation,
including the following:
•

Should performing the functions of a CCP for only one U.S. person member of the
CCP warrant requiring a foreign security-based swap clearing agency to register with
the Commission? If not, why not? Further, are there other kinds of activities in the
United States or outside the United States that would warrant requiring a CCP to be
registered? If so, what are they?

•

To what extent might the proposed approach create incentives for foreign CCPs to
restrict access to U.S. person members? Please explain.

•

Are there any other circumstances where a foreign security-based swap CCP should
be required to register with the Commission? For example, is there a circumstance
where a CCP that has no U.S. members but clears security-based swaps with a U.S.
security as an underlying security should be required to register with the Commission
as a clearing agency? Similarly, is there a circumstance where a CCP that has no
U.S. members and does not conduct activities within the United States but that clears
security-based swaps for the U.S. customers of its members should be required to
register with the Commission as a clearing agency? Would the provision of omnibus
or individual segregation of U.S. customer funds affect this analysis? Why or why
not? Should a security-based swap CCP that relies on a financial guaranty of a U.S.
person in allowing a non-U.S. person to become a member be required to register
with the Commission? If not, why not?

•

How will Commission registration of, exemption from registration for, or
promulgation of alternative standards applicable to registered foreign security-based
swap CCPs affect the central clearing of security-based swaps? How would it affect
the management of counterparty credit risk? How would it affect systemic risk?
What impact would it have on the continued development of the global security-based
swap market?

•

What factors should the Commission consider in determining whether a foreign
security-based swap CCP is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and
regulation by appropriate government authorities in the home country of the CCP?
What level of similarity should be required in order for a home country supervision
and regulatory framework to be considered comparable and comprehensive when
compared to that of the United States?
189

687

•

How should the Commission determine the home country of a CCP for purposes of
Section 17A(k) of the Exchange Act? Should it be the country in which the CCP is
incorporated or organized or the country in which it conducts the principal amount of
its clearance and settlement activities?

•

What other facts and circumstances should the Commission review in determining
whether an exemption may be granted under Exchange Act Section 17A(k)? What
terms and conditions should be required in connection with an exemption from
registration? For example, should the Commission consider whether a jurisdiction
has implemented any international standards, such as the CPSS-IOSCO Principles for
Financial Market Infrastructures in its regulatory framework? 687 In addition, should
the existence of a cooperative agreement with the home country be a factor?

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to the registration of
foreign CCPs? How would the application of the proposed approach affect the
competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States
as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market
participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain.
Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please
explain. What other measures should the Commission consider to implement the
proposed approach? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects
of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?

Principles”), available at: http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss101a.pdf.

Security-Based Swap Data Repositories

A. Introduction
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, SDRs are intended to play a key role in enhancing
transparency in the security-based swap market by retaining complete records of security-based
swap transactions, maintaining the integrity of those records, and providing effective access to
those records to relevant authorities and the public consistent with their respective information
needs. 688 Title VII provides the Commission with authority to adopt rules governing SDRs. 689
Using this authority, the Commission has proposed rules governing the SDR registration process,
duties, and core principles, including duties related to data maintenance and access by relevant
authorities and those seeking to use the SDR’s repository services. 690
As noted above, the security-based swap market is global in scope and transactions often
involve counterparties in different jurisdictions. 691 The Commission recognizes that, as a result,
there may be uncertainty regarding the application of Section 13(n) of the Exchange Act 692 and
the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, “SDR Requirements”). 693 In addition, the
Commission is concerned that an overly broad application of the SDR Requirements may
unnecessarily restrict global regulators’ access to, and sharing of, security-based swap data in
various jurisdictions and present difficulties in enhancing transparency in the global securitybased swap market. 694 To address these concerns, and as explained more fully below, the
Commission is proposing to limit the application of the SDR Requirements to certain persons
that perform the functions of an SDR, including proposing a new rule to provide non-U.S.
persons performing the functions of an SDR within the United States with exemptive relief from
the SDR Requirements. In addition, to facilitate relevant authorities’ access to security-based
swap data collected and maintained by Commission-registered SDRs, the Commission is
proposing interpretive guidance to specify how SDRs may comply with the notification
requirement set forth in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 695 and previously proposed
Rule 13n-4(b)(9) thereunder. The Commission also is specifying how the Commission proposes

to determine whether a relevant authority is appropriate for purposes of receiving security-based
swap data from an SDR. In addition, the Commission is proposing a new rule to provide SDRs
with exemptive relief from the indemnification requirement set forth in Section 13(n)(5)(H)(ii) of
the Exchange Act 696 and previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(10) thereunder.
In formulating this proposal, the Commission has sought to balance the policy
considerations discussed above 697 and the particular concerns related to security-based swap
reporting discussed below. The Commission recognizes that other approaches may exist in
achieving the mandate of the Dodd-Frank Act, in whole or in part. Accordingly, the
Commission invites comment regarding all aspects of the proposal described below, including
potential alternative approaches. Data and comment from market participants and other
interested parties regarding the likely effect of the Commission’s proposed rules and
interpretative guidance as well as potential alternative approaches will be particularly useful to
the Commission in evaluating possible modifications to the proposal.
B. Application of the SDR Requirements in the Cross-Border Context
1. Introduction
Section 3(a)(75) of the Exchange Act defines a “security-based swap data repository” to
mean “any person that collects and maintains information or records with respect to transactions
or positions in, or the terms and conditions of, security-based swaps entered into by third parties
for the purpose of providing a centralized recordkeeping facility for security-based swaps.” 698
Section 13(n)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that “[i]t shall be unlawful for any person, unless
registered with the Commission, directly or indirectly, to make use of the mails or any means or
instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of a security-based swap data
repository.” 699
Although the Commission has previously proposed a rule governing the registration
process for SDRs, 700 which includes requirements for “non-resident security-based swap data
repositor[ies],” 701 the Commission has not explicitly explained under what circumstances in the
696

States; (ii) [i]n the case of a corporation, one incorporated in or having its principal place of
business in any place not in the United States; or (iii) [i]n the case of a partnership or other

cross-border context would a person performing the functions of an SDR be required to register
with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(n)(1) of the Exchange Act 702 and previously
proposed Rule 13n-1 thereunder, and to comply with the other SDR Requirements. 703 As
discussed further below, the Commission is proposing interpretative guidance to discuss such
circumstances and a new rule to provide exemptive relief from the SDR Requirements.
2. Comment Summary
The Commission received several comment letters concerning the registration and
regulation of SDRs in the cross-border context. As a general matter, commenters suggested that
the Commission should apply principles of international comity. 704
In addition, two commenters expressed concerns about the potential impact of duplicative
registration requirements imposed on SDRs. 705 Specifically, one of these commenters remarked
that the Commission’s previously proposed rules governing SDRs “would seem to force a nonresident SDR to be subject to multiple regimes and to the jurisdiction of several authorities” and
that the SDR Proposing Release made no “reference to equivalency of regulatory regimes or
cooperation with the authorities of the country of establishment of the non-resident SDRs.” 706
not in the United States.” Proposed Rule 13n-1(g) under the Exchange Act would require any
non-resident SDR applying for registration with the Commission to certify and provide an
opinion of counsel that it can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt access to
its books and records and submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission.

In addition to the SDR Requirements, the Commission has proposed, and is re-proposing in this
release, Regulation SBSR, which, if adopted as re-proposed, would impose certain obligations on
SDRs registered with the Commission. See Section VIII, infra. In a separate proposal relating to
implementation of Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act (adding Exchange Act Section
13(n)(5)(E), 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(E)), the Commission has proposed rules that would require
SDRs registered with the Commission to collect data related to monitoring the compliance and
frequency of end-user clearing exemption claims. See End-User Exception Proposing Release,
75 FR 79992. Because these proposed rules and regulations, on their face, apply only to
Commission-registered SDRs, the Commission preliminarily believes that these requirements, if
adopted as proposed, would not apply to unregistered SDRs, including those that avail themselves
of the SDR Exemption, discussed below.

704

See DTCC Letter III at 3 (urging the Commission, in its regulation of SDRs, to aim for regulatory
comity); Davis Polk Letter I at 7 (recommending that the Commission work with foreign
authorities to permit SDRs in all major jurisdictions to register with the appropriate regulators in
each jurisdiction); see also Société Générale Letter I at 2 (suggesting that the Commission
consider international comity and public policy goals of derivatives regulation to limit its
regulation of swap business); ISDA/SIFMA Letter I at 18 (“The Commission should consult with
foreign regulators before establishing the extra-territorial scope of the rules promulgated under
Title VII.”).

To address this concern, the commenter suggested that the Commission adopt a regime under
which foreign SDRs would be deemed to comply with the SDR Requirements if the laws and
regulations of the relevant foreign jurisdiction were equivalent to those of the Commission and
an MOU has been entered into between the Commission and the relevant foreign authority. 707
The commenter noted that the recommended “regime would have the following advantages: (i)
facilitating cooperation among authorities from different jurisdictions; (ii) ensuring the mutual
recognition of [SDRs]; and (iii) establishing convergent regulatory and supervisory regimes
which is necessary in a global market such as the OTC derivatives one.” 708
Recognizing that some SDRs would function solely outside of the United States and,
therefore, would be regulated by an authority in another jurisdiction, commenters suggested
possible approaches to the SDR registration regime. One commenter, for example, believed that
“a non-U.S. SDR should not be subject to U.S. registration so long as it collects and maintains
information from outside the U.S., even if such information is collected from non-U.S. swap
dealer or [major security-based swap participant] registrants.” 709 Another commenter supported
“cross-registration” of SDRs, whereby SDRs in all major jurisdictions may register with the
appropriate regulators in each jurisdiction. 710
3. Proposed Approach
In light of the concerns raised by commenters and the policy considerations discussed
above, the Commission is proposing (i) interpretive guidance regarding the application of the
SDR Requirements to U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR; and (ii) interpretive
guidance regarding the application of the SDR Requirements to non-U.S. persons that perform
the functions of an SDR within the United States and a new rule providing exemptive relief from
the SDR Requirements for such non-U.S. persons, subject to a condition.
711

(a) U.S. Persons Performing SDR Functions Are Required to Register with the
Commission
Consistent with the approach taken elsewhere in this release, 712 the Commission
preliminarily believes that any U.S. person 713 that performs the functions of an SDR 714 would be

required to register with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(n)(1) of the Exchange Act 715
and previously proposed Rule 13n-1 thereunder. The Commission preliminarily believes that
requiring U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR to register with the Commission and
comply with the SDR Requirements, as well as other requirements applicable to SDRs registered
with the Commission,716 is necessary to achieve the policy objectives of Title VII. 717 Requiring
U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR to be operated in a manner consistent with the
Title VII regulatory framework and subject to the Commission’s oversight, would, among other
things, help ensure that relevant authorities are able to monitor the build-up and concentration of
risk exposure in the security-based swap market, reduce operational risk in that market, and
increase operational efficiency. 718 As the Commission noted in the SDR Proposing Release,
SDRs themselves are subject to certain operational risks that may impede the ability of SDRs to
meet these goals, 719 and the Title VII regulatory framework is intended to address these risks.

713

Under this proposed interpretation, the term “U.S. person” would have the same meaning as set
forth in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section III.B.5,
supra. As a practical matter, the Commission preliminarily believes that all non-resident SDRs
would likely be non-U.S. persons given the similar distinguishing factors in the definitions of
“non-resident security-based swap data repository” and “non-U.S. person.”

714

Generally speaking, the Commission preliminarily believes that the “functions of a security-based
swap data repository” include, at a minimum, the core services or functions that are embedded in
the statutory definition of a “security-based swap data repository.” See Section 3(a)(75) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(75), as added by Section 761(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act (defining
“security-based swap data repository” to mean “any person that collects and maintains
information or records with respect to transactions or positions in, or the terms and conditions of,
security-based swaps entered into by third parties for the purpose of providing a centralized
recordkeeping facility for security-based swaps”).

is important to help regulators and others monitor the build-up and concentration of risk
exposures in the [security-based swap] market . . . . In addition, SDRs have the potential to
reduce operational risk and enhance operational efficiency in the [security-based swap] market.”).

719

See id. (“The inability of an SDR to protect the accuracy and integrity of the data that it maintains
or the inability of an SDR to make such data available to regulators, market participants, and
others in a timely manner could have a significant negative impact on the [security-based swap]
market. Failure to maintain privacy of such data could lead to market abuse and subsequent loss
of liquidity.”).

195

(b) Interpretive Guidance and Exemption for Non-U.S. Persons That Perform the
Functions of an SDR Within the United States
In the context of the cross-border reporting of security-based swap data, the Commission
recognizes that some uncertainty may arise regarding when the SDR Requirements, and other
requirements applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission,720 apply to non-U.S. persons
that perform the functions of an SDR. The Commission preliminarily believes that a non-U.S.
person that performs the functions of an SDR within the United States would be required to
register with the Commission, absent an exemption. 721
In order to provide legal certainty to market participants and address concerns raised by
commenters, and consistent with the proposed interpretive guidance discussed above, the
Commission is proposing, pursuant to our authority under Section 36 of the Exchange Act, 722 an
exemption from the SDR Requirements for non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an
SDR within the United States, subject to a condition. Specifically, the Commission is proposing
Rule 13n-12 (“SDR Exemption”), which states as follows: “A non-U.S. person 723 that performs
the functions of a security-based swap data repository within the United States shall be exempt
from the registration and other requirements set forth in Section 13(n) of the [Exchange] Act . . .
and the rules and regulations thereunder, provided that each regulator with supervisory authority
over such non-U.S. person has entered into a supervisory and enforcement memorandum of
understanding (‘MOU’) or other arrangement with the Commission that addresses the
confidentiality of data collected and maintained by such non-U.S. person, access by the
Commission to such data, and any other matters determined by the Commission.” 724

720

See note 703, supra.

721

See Section 13(n)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(1), as added by Section 763(i) of the
Dodd-Frank Act (requiring persons that, directly or indirectly, make use of the mails or any
means or instrumentality of interstate commerce to perform the functions of an SDR, to register
with the Commission). The Commission recognizes that some non-U.S. persons that perform the
functions of an SDR may do so entirely outside the United States and thus are not required to
register with the Commission.

722

Section 36 of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission to conditionally or unconditionally
exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of persons, securities, or
transactions, from certain provisions of the Exchange Act or certain rules or regulations
thereunder, by rule, regulation, or order, to the extent that such exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors. 15 U.S.C.

723

Proposed Rule 13n-12(a)(1) under the Exchange Act defines “non-U.S. person” to mean any
person that is not a U.S. person. Proposed Rule 13n-12(a)(2) under the Exchange Act defines
“U.S. person” by cross-reference to the definition of “U.S. person” in re-proposed Rule 3a713(a)(7) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section III.B.5 above.

724

Proposed Rule 13n-12(b) under the Exchange Act.

196

The Commission preliminarily believes that a non-U.S. person would be performing “the
functions of a security-based swap data repository within the United States” if, for example, it
enters into contracts, such as user or technical agreements, with a U.S. person to enable the U.S.
person to report security-based swap data to such non-U.S. person. As another example, a nonU.S. person would be performing “the functions of a security-based swap data repository within
the United States” if it has operations in the United States, such as maintaining security-based
swap data on servers physically located in the United States, even if its principal place of
business is not in the United States. 725 Given the constant innovation in the market and the factspecific nature of the determination, it is not possible to provide here a comprehensive discussion
of every activity that would constitute a non-U.S. person performing “the functions of a securitybased swap data repository within the United States.”
The Commission preliminarily believes that the SDR Exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, and consistent with the protection of investors. Because the
reporting requirements of Title VII and re-proposed Regulation SBSR can be satisfied only if a
security-based swap transaction is reported to an SDR that is registered with the Commission,726
the Commission preliminarily believes that the primary reason for a person subject to the
reporting requirements of Title VII and re-proposed Regulation SBSR to report a security-based
swap transaction to an SDR that is not registered with the Commission would likely be to satisfy
reporting obligations that it or its counterparty has under foreign law. Such person would still be
required to fulfill its reporting obligations under Title VII and re-proposed Regulation SBSR by
reporting its security-based swap transaction to an SDR registered with the Commission, absent
other relief from the Commission, 727 even if the transaction were also reported to a non-U.S.
person that relies on the SDR Exemption. The Commission preliminarily believes that this
725

The Commission notes that if a person performing the functions of an SDR has operations in the
United States to the extent that such operations constitute a principal place of business, then the
person would fall within the proposed definition of “U.S. person.” As proposed, the term “U.S.
person” includes a partnership, corporation, trust, or other legal person having its principal place
of business in the United States. See Section III.B.5(b)ii, supra. As a result, under the
interpretation proposed in Section VI.B.3(a) above, such person would be required to register as
an SDR with the Commission.

726

The Commission notes that a non-U.S. person that performs the functions of an SDR may choose
to register with the Commission as an SDR to enable that person to accept data from persons that
are reporting a security-based swap pursuant to the reporting requirements of Title VII and reproposed Regulation SBSR. See 15 U.S.C. 78m(m)(1)(G) and 78m-1(a)(1), as added by Sections
763(i) and 766(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and Section VIII, infra (discussing re-proposed
Regulation SBSR). The Commission may consider also granting, pursuant to its authority under
Section 36 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78mm, exemptions to such non-U.S. person that
registers with the Commission from certain of the SDR Requirements on a case-by-case basis. In
determining whether to grant such an exemption, the Commission may consider, among other
things, whether there are overlapping requirements in the Exchange Act and applicable foreign
law.

727

See discussion of Regulation SBSR in Section VIII, infra, and discussion of substituted
compliance in Section XI.D, infra.

197

proposed approach to the SDR Requirements appropriately would balance the Commission’s
interest in having access to security-based swap data involving U.S. persons, while addressing
commenters’ concerns regarding the potential for duplicative regulatory requirements 728 as well
as furthering the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act.
The SDR Exemption would be subject to the condition that each regulator with
supervisory authority over the non-U.S. person that performs the functions of an SDR within the
United States enters into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other arrangement with the
Commission, as specified in proposed Rule 13n-12(b) under the Exchange Act. The
Commission anticipates that in determining whether to enter into such an MOU or other
arrangement with a relevant authority, the Commission would consider whether the relevant
authority would keep data collected and maintained by the non-U.S. person that performs the
functions of an SDR within the United States confidential 729 and whether the Commission would
have access to data collected and maintained by such non-U.S. person. 730 The Commission
anticipates that it would consider other matters, including, for example, whether the relevant
authority agrees to provide the Commission with reciprocal assistance in securities matters
within the Commission’s jurisdiction and whether a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other
arrangement would be in the public interest. 731 The Commission preliminarily believes that, in
lieu of requiring non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States
to register with the Commission, the condition in the SDR Exemption is appropriate to address
the Commission’s interest in having access to security-based swap data involving U.S. persons
and U.S. market participants that is maintained by non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of
an SDR within the United States and protecting the confidentiality of such security-based swap
data involving U.S. persons and U.S. market participants.

728

See Section VI.B.2, supra (summarizing comment letters concerning the registration of SDRs in
the cross-border context).

729

The Commission contemplates that the relevant authority would keep data collected and
maintained by such non-U.S. person confidential in a manner that is consistent with Section 24 of
the Exchange Act and Rule 24c-1 thereunder. See 15 U.S.C. 78x and 17 CFR § 240.24c-1.

730

The Commission contemplates that the Commission’s access to data collected and maintained by
such non-U.S. person would be in a manner that is consistent with Section 13(n)(5)(D) of the
Exchange Act and previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(5) thereunder. See 15 U.S.C.
78m(n)(5)(D), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

731

The Commission has previously entered numerous cooperative agreements with foreign
authorities. See Cooperative Arrangements with Foreign Regulators, available at:
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_cooparrangements.shtml. Based on the Commission’s
experience with negotiating MOUs and other agreements with foreign authorities, the
Commission believes that the MOU or agreement described in proposed Rule 13n-12(b) could, in
many cases, be negotiated in a timely manner based on existing confidentiality and information
sharing agreements so that the exemptive relief provided under proposed Rule 13n-12(b) would
be available before the registration of an SDR seeking to claim the exemption would be required.

198

Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the Commission’s proposed
interpretive guidance and the SDR Exemption, including the following:
•

Is the Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and the SDR Exemption
appropriate and sufficiently clear? Why or why not? Do you agree with the
Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and SDR Exemption? Is it overly
broad or narrow? If so, why? Is there a better alternative?

•

Under the Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and SDR Exemption, will
SDRs be subject to duplicative regulatory requirements? If so, will the Commission’s
proposed interpretive guidance and SDR Exemption reduce the costs of compliance
with duplicative regulatory requirements? Why or why not?

•

How may the Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and SDR Exemption
affect the duplicative reporting of security-based swap data? Would the
Commission’s ability to exercise oversight of our registrants be compromised if it did
not have the ability to learn and/or obtain all security-based swap data from non-U.S.
persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States that have
chosen not to register with the Commission and that are not subject to a substituted
compliance order? Why or why not?

•

Are there any circumstances where a U.S. person performing the functions of an SDR
should not be required to register with the Commission? If so, what are those
circumstances?

•

Should the Commission require all non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an
SDR within the United States to register with the Commission? Why or why not?

•

Non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States may
rely on the SDR Exemption. Are there any circumstances where non-U.S. persons
that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States should be required to
register with the Commission? If so, what are those circumstances? Do any of the
following facts and circumstances, either individually or in combination, warrant
requiring non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United
States to register with the Commission: maintaining security-based swap data
pertaining to a U.S. person or U.S. financial product; facilitating or supporting in the
United States the submission of security-based swap data by U.S. persons; having any
operations within the United States; entering into contracts, such as user or technical
agreements, in order to accept security-based swap data from U.S. persons? If so,
which one(s) and why? If not, why not? What types of activities and SDR functions
performed within the United States do not warrant requiring a non-U.S. person that
performs the functions of an SDR within the United States to be registered with the
Commission? What if, for example, a non-U.S person that performs the functions of
an SDR within the United States accepts only data from persons that are “U.S.
persons” solely because they are foreign branches of U.S. persons?
199

•

Does the proposed definition of “U.S. person” or “non-U.S. person” in the SDR
Exemption need to be clarified or modified? If so, which terms and how should they
be defined?

•

Do you agree with the proposed condition in the SDR Exemption? Why or why not?
Should the condition include additional requirements? If so, what requirements
would be appropriate? Are the Commission’s estimates of the time required to
establish an MOU reasonable? Why or why not? Should the condition apply only to
certain non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United
States? Please explain. Should the condition apply if, for example, the only
connection to the United States by a non-U.S. person that performs the functions of
an SDR within the United States is that it maintains a back-up server physically
located in the United States? Should the condition apply only to non-U.S. persons
that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States that collect securitybased swap data from a reporting side that includes at least one counterparty that is a
U.S. person?

•

Do you believe that most, if not all, non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an
SDR within the United States will maintain at least some security-based swap data
involving U.S. persons or U.S. market participants? Why or why not?

•

Is the Commission’s reference in the SDR Exemption to a “non-U.S. person that
performs the functions of a security-based swap data repository” sufficiently clear? If
not, what is a better alternative? Should the Commission replace, for example, “nonU.S. person” with “non-resident security-based swap data repository,” as defined in
previously proposed Rule 13n-1(a)(2) under the Exchange Act, instead? Why or why
not? Are there circumstances that would be covered by using “non-U.S. person that
performs the functions of a security-based swap data repository” in the SDR
Exemption rather than using “non-resident security-based swap data repository that
performs the functions of a security-based swap data repository” in the SDR
Exemption, and vice versa? If so, what circumstances and does it matter for practical
purposes?

•

Is the SDR Exemption’s reference to “within the United States” sufficiently clear?
What are the implications of this reference in the SDR Exemption?

•

Are there any other factors that the Commission should consider in our interpretive
guidance or the SDR Exemption, but that are not addressed above? If so, please
explain.

•

What would be the market impact of proposed approach to the registration of SDRs?
How would the application of proposed approach affect the competitiveness of U.S.
entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States as well as in foreign
jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any market participants at a
competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed
approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please explain. What
200

other measures should the Commission consider to implement the proposed
approach? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects of
alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?
C.

Relevant Authorities’ Access to Security-Based Swap Information and the
Indemnification Requirement

Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 732 and previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(9)
thereunder provide that an SDR shall on a confidential basis, pursuant to Section 24 of the
Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, upon request, and after notifying the
Commission of the request (“Notification Requirement”), make available all data obtained by the
SDR, including individual counterparty trade and position data, to each appropriate prudential
regulator, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the CFTC, the Department of Justice, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and any other person that the Commission determines to
be appropriate, including, but not limited to, foreign financial supervisors (including foreign
futures authorities), foreign central banks, and foreign ministries. Further, Section 13(n)(5)(H)
of the Exchange Act 733 and previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(10) provide that before sharing
information with any entity described in Section 13(n)(5)(G) 734 or previously proposed Rule
13n-4(b)(9), 735 respectively, an SDR must obtain a written agreement from the entity stating that
the entity shall abide by the confidentiality requirements described in Section 24 of the Exchange
Act, 736 and the rules and regulations thereunder, relating to the information on security-based
swap transactions that is provided; in addition, the entity shall agree to indemnify the SDR and
the Commission for any expenses arising from litigation relating to the information provided
under Section 24 of the Exchange Act 737 and the rules and regulations thereunder
(“Indemnification Requirement”).
The Commission believes that the goals of Sections 13(n)(5)(G) and 13(n)(5)(H) of the
Exchange Act 738 are, among other things, to obligate SDRs to make available security-based
swap information to relevant authorities and maintain the confidentiality of such information.

More broadly, the goal of the Dodd-Frank Act is, among other things, to promote the financial
stability of the U.S. by improving accountability and transparency in the financial system. 739
As discussed further below, the Commission recognizes that the Indemnification
Requirement raises a number of concerns, including, among other things, the inability of certain
relevant authorities to provide, as a matter of law or practice, an open-ended indemnification
agreement and the possibility of security-based swap data being fragmented among trade
repositories globally if foreign authorities establish trade repositories in their jurisdictions to
ensure access to data that they need to perform their regulatory mandates and legal
responsibilities. 740
In this section, the Commission will first describe the alternatives to the Notification
Requirement and Indemnification Requirement that were discussed in the SDR Proposing
Release. The Commission will then summarize the comments received, primarily in response to
the SDR Proposing Release. Finally, the Commission will discuss our proposed interpretive
guidance regarding relevant authorities’ access to security-based swap information and our
proposed exemptive relief from the Indemnification Requirement.
1. Information Sharing under Sections 21 and 24 of the Exchange Act
In the SDR Proposing Release, the Commission highlighted two alternative ways for
relevant authorities to obtain data maintained by SDRs directly from the Commission (rather
than directly from SDRs) without providing an indemnification agreement. 741 Specifically, the
Commission noted that there is existing independent authority in the Exchange Act for certain
domestic and foreign authorities to obtain data maintained by SDRs directly from the
Commission (rather than directly from SDRs) pursuant to Sections 21(a) and 24(c) of the
Exchange Act 742 in certain circumstances and without application of the Indemnification
Requirement. 743

739

See note 4, supra.

See Section VI.C.3(c), infra.

See SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77319.

Section 13(n)(5)(H) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(H), as added by Section 763(i) of
the Dodd-Frank Act. See SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77319. The Indemnification
Requirement does not apply to requests for information made pursuant to Sections 21(a) and
24(c) of the Exchange Act. Further, since relevant authorities requesting information under these
provisions would go directly to the Commission, the Notification Requirement would also be
inapplicable. Thus, these requirements would not apply to requests by relevant authorities for
security-based swap data when the Commission is exercising its independent statutory authority
to assist relevant authorities pursuant to Section 21(a) or 24(c) of the Exchange Act.

202

Section 21(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 744 provides that the Commission may provide
assistance to a foreign securities authority. The term “foreign securities authority” is broadly
defined in Section 3(a)(50) of the Exchange Act 745 to include “any foreign government, or any
governmental body or regulatory organization empowered by a foreign government to administer
or enforce its laws as they relate to securities matters.” The Commission may provide assistance
under Section 21(a)(2) of the Exchange Act 746 to the foreign securities authority in connection
with an investigation being conducted by the foreign securities authority to determine whether
any person has violated, is violating, or is about to violate any laws or rules relating to securities
matters that the authority administers or enforces. Section 21(a)(2) further provides that, as part
of this assistance, the Commission may conduct an investigation to collect information and
evidence pertinent to the foreign securities authority’s request for assistance. 747 The
Commission believes that Section 21(a)(2) provides the Commission with independent authority
to assist foreign securities authorities in certain circumstances by, for example, collecting
security-based swap data from an SDR and providing such authorities with the data.
Pursuant to Section 24(c) of the Exchange Act 748 and Rule 24c-1 thereunder, 749 the
Commission may share nonpublic information 750 in our possession with, among others, any
“federal, state, local, or foreign government, or any political subdivision, authority, agency or
instrumentality of such government . . . . [or] a foreign financial regulatory authority.” 751
Because the Exchange Act provides the Commission with the statutory authority to share
information in our possession with other authorities, the Commission is of the view that if
security-based swap transaction data is in our possession, then it may share this information with
744

15 U.S.C. 78u(a)(2).

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(50).

746

Section 21(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires that, in considering whether to provide assistance

other authorities. In this regard, the Commission notes that the indemnification requirement set
forth in Section 13(n)(5)(H)(ii) of the Exchange Act 752 does not apply to the Commission, and
would be inapplicable to the Commission’s provision of security-based swap data to relevant
authorities pursuant to our independent authority in Section 24(c) of the Exchange Act. 753
2. Comment Summary
Four commenters submitted comments relating to relevant authorities’ access to securitybased swap information, three of which were in response to the SDR Proposing Release and one
of which was in response to a joint public roundtable regarding the cross-border application of
Title VII held by the Commission and the CFTC on August 1, 2011. 754 Commenters were
generally supportive of relevant authorities having access to security-based swap data maintained
by SDRs when such access is within the scope of the authorities’ mandate, but these commenters
expressed particular concerns relating to the Indemnification Requirement and relevant
authorities’ unfettered access to security-based swap data.
As a general matter, one commenter stated that an SDR should be able to provide: (i)
enforcement authorities with necessary trading information; (ii) regulatory agencies with
counterparty-specific information about systemic risk based on trading activity; (iii) aggregate
trade information on market-wide activity and aggregate gross and net open interest for
publication; and (iv) real-time reporting from SB SEFs and bilateral counterparties and related
dissemination. 755 The same commenter supported relevant authorities’ access to reports from
SDRs that are scheduled on a regular basis or triggered by certain events, and believed that the
Commission’s regulatory model regarding regulatory access should be “location agnostic,
without preferential access for [a] prudential regulator, except to perform its prudential
duties.” 756 The commenter also believed that “it is important to preserve [the] spirit of
cooperation and coordination between regulators around the world” in the context of ensuring
global regulators’ access to security-based swap data. 757
Two commenters concurred with the Commission’s statements in the SDR Proposing
Release that relevant authorities will likely be unable to agree to provide SDRs and the
Commission with indemnification, as required by Section 13(n)(5)(H)(ii) of the Exchange Act

prior to receiving security-based swap data maintained by SDRs. 758 One of these commenters
described the Indemnification Requirement as contravening the purpose of SDRs by diminishing
transparency if regulators are not allowed to have ready access to information and thereby
jeopardizing market stability. 759 Specifically, the commenter believed that the Indemnification
Requirement should not apply where relevant authorities are carrying out their regulatory
responsibilities, in accordance with international agreements and while maintaining the
confidentiality of data provided to them. 760 Recognizing that the Indemnification Requirement is
mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, however, the commenter suggested that in order to ensure
consistent application of the requirement and to “minimize any disruption to the global
repository framework,” the Commission should provide model indemnification language for all
SDRs to use. 761 Further, the commenter believed that “any indemnity should be limited in scope
to minimize the potential reduction in value of registered SDRs to the regulatory community.” 762
In discussing the Indemnification Requirement, another commenter reiterated the notion
that relevant authorities must ensure the confidentiality of security-based swap data provided to
them. 763 The commenter believed that the Indemnification Requirement “undermines the key
principle of trust according to which exchange of information [among relevant authorities]
should occur.” 764 Thus, the commenter recommended that the Commission’s rules help
streamline the Indemnification Requirement for an “efficient exchange of information.” 765
One commenter voiced concerns about unfettered access to security-based swap
information by regulators, including foreign financial supervisors, foreign central banks, and
foreign ministries, beyond their regulatory authority and mandate. 766 This commenter was
concerned that the statutory language incorporated in previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(9),
which provides that in addition to the entities specifically listed in the rule, an SDR could make
758

See DTCC Letter I at 3; Cleary Letter IV at 31; see also SDR Proposing Release, 75 at 77318-19
(“With respect to the indemnification provision, the Commission understands that regulators may
be legally prohibited or otherwise restricted from agreeing to indemnify third parties, including
SDRs as well as the Commission. The indemnification provision could chill requests for access
to data obtained by SDRs, thereby hindering the ability of others to fulfill their regulatory
mandates and responsibilities.”).

available data to “any other person that the Commission determines to be appropriate,” is vague
and could result in an SDR providing access to persons without proper authority. 767 The
commenter suggested that the Commission adopt an approach similar to the CFTC’s proposed
Rule 49.17(d), 768 and that the Commission and the CFTC “endeavor to adopt similar procedures
to control regulator requests for security-based swap information.” 769
3. Proposed Guidance and Exemptive Relief
Consistent with the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act 770 and the purposes of SDRs, 771 and
after considering the comments received to date, the Commission is proposing additional
guidance regarding relevant authorities’ access to security-based swap information and
proposing exemptive relief from the Indemnification Requirement. For the reasons discussed
further below, the Commission preliminarily believes that our proposed guidance and exemption
from the Indemnification Requirement is necessary or appropriate to, among other things, further
the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act and the purposes of SDRs while preserving the confidentiality
of the security-based swap information maintained by SDRs, as necessary. The Commission
also preliminarily believes that our proposed guidance and exemption will, as one commenter
suggested, help provide for an “efficient exchange of information.” 772
(a) Notification Requirement
Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act requires an SDR, upon request, to “make
available all data obtained by the SDR, including individual counterparty trade and position
data,” to certain specified relevant authorities, as well as “other persons that the Commission

768

As adopted, CFTC Rule 49.17(d) requires any “Appropriate Domestic Regulator” or
“Appropriate Foreign Regulator” requesting access to swap data obtained and maintained by a
swap data repository to first file a request for access with the swap data repository and certify the
statutory authority for such request. The swap data repository then must promptly notify the
CFTC of such request and the swap data repository subsequently would provide access to the
requested swap data. CFTC Rule 49.17(b)(1) defines “Appropriate Domestic Regulator” and
CFTC Rule 49.17(b)(2) provides that “Appropriate Foreign Regulators” are those that have an
existing memorandum of understanding with the CFTC or otherwise as determined through an
application process. See CFTC Final Rule, Swap Data Repositories: Registration Standards,
Duties and Core Principles, 76 FR 54538 (Sept. 1, 2011) (“CFTC SDR Adopting Release”).

determines to be appropriate.” 773 However, the SDR may make such data available only “after
notifying the Commission of the request.” 774 The Commission preliminarily believes that an
SDR can fulfill its obligation to notify “the Commission of the request” under Section
13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 775 and previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(9) by notifying the
Commission, upon the initial request for security-based swap data by a relevant authority, of the
request for security-based swap data from the SDR, and maintaining records of the initial request
and all subsequent requests. 776 The Commission would consider the notice provided and records
maintained as satisfying the Notification Requirement. 777 The Commission preliminarily
believes that this approach is an efficient way for an SDR to satisfy its statutory notification
obligation. 778

Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), as added by Section 763(i) of
the Dodd-Frank Act (specifying each appropriate prudential regulator, the Financial Stability
Oversight Council, the CFTC, and the Department of Justice); see also proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(9)
under the Exchange Act (adding the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation).

775

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

776

Pursuant to previously proposed Rule 13n-7(b) under the Exchange Act, the SDR would be
required to maintain records of the initial request and all subsequent requests, including details of
any on-line access by relevant authorities to security-based swap data maintained by the SDR, by
such relevant authority. See proposed Rule 13n-7(b) under the Exchange Act (requiring, among
other things, keeping at least one copy of all documents required under the Exchange Act and
records made or received by the SDR in the course of its business as such for not less than five
years, and promptly furnishing such documents to any representative of the Commission upon
request).

777

One commenter stated that “regulators want direct electronic access to data in SDRs where that
data is needed to fulfill regulatory responsibilities” rather than access “by request, with notice to
another regulatory authority.” See DTCC Letter III at 11-12. The Commission preliminarily
believes that SDRs can provide direct electronic access to relevant authorities under its
interpretation. In such a case, the SDR would have to provide the Commission with actual
notification upon the initial time that the relevant authority accesses the SDR’s security-based
swap data, and retain records of any electronic access by the relevant authority.

778

As discussed in the SDR Proposing Release, an SDR must keep its notifications to the
Commission and requests by relevant authorities confidential. See SDR Proposing Release, 75
FR at 77318. Failure by an SDR to treat such notifications and requests confidential could render
ineffective or could have adverse effects on the underlying basis for the requests. See id. If, for
example, a regulatory use of the data is improperly disclosed, such disclosure could possibly
signal a pending investigation or enforcement action, which could have detrimental effects. See
id.

207

(b) Determination of Appropriate Regulators
Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act requires an SDR, upon request, to “make
available all data obtained by the [SDR], including individual counterparty trade and position
data,” to certain specified relevant authorities, as well as “each appropriate prudential regulator”
and “other persons that the Commission determines to be appropriate,” including, but not limited
to, foreign financial supervisors (including foreign futures authorities), foreign central banks, and
foreign ministries. 779 The Commission contemplates that a relevant authority will be able to
request that the Commission make a determination that the relevant authority is appropriate for
requesting security-based swap data from an SDR. The Commission preliminarily believes that
it will make such a determination through the issuance of a Commission order.
In making such a determination, the Commission expects that we would consider a
variety of factors, and our order may include, among other things, conditions on determining that
a relevant authority is appropriate for purposes of receiving security-based swap data directly
from SDRs. The Commission preliminarily believes that such determination will likely be
conditioned on a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other arrangement between the
Commission and the relevant authority. 780 Given the necessity of maintaining the confidentiality
of the proprietary and highly sensitive data maintained by an SDR, such an MOU or
arrangement 781 would be designed to protect the confidentiality of the security-based swap data
provided to the relevant authority by an SDR. 782 The Commission anticipates that in
determining whether to enter into such an MOU or other arrangement with a relevant authority,
the Commission may consider whether, among other things, the relevant authority needs
security-based swap information from an SDR to fulfill its regulatory mandate or legal
responsibilities and the relevant authority agrees to protect the confidentiality of the securitybased swap information provided to it. The Commission preliminarily believes that this MOU or
779

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act. See also proposed
Rule 13n-4(b)(9) under the Exchange Act.

780

Similarly, the CFTC requires “appropriate foreign regulator[s]” to have an MOU or similar type
of arrangement with the CFTC or, as determined by the CFTC on a case-by-case basis. CFTC
Rule 49.17(b)(2), 17 CFR § 49.17(b)(2).

781

This MOU or other arrangement is separate from the written agreement under Section
13(n)(5)(H)(i) of the Exchange Act and previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(10) thereunder, both
of which require the SDR to receive a written agreement from each relevant authority pertaining
to the confidentiality of the security-based swap transaction information that is provided by the
SDR. The MOU or other arrangement is between the Commission and the relevant authority,
whereas the written agreement is between the SDR and the relevant authority.

782

The CFTC requires certain foreign regulators “to provide sufficient facts and procedures to
permit the [CFTC] to analyze whether the [foreign regulator] employs appropriate confidentiality
procedures and to satisfy itself that the information will be disclosed only as permitted by Section
8(e) of the [Commodity Exchange Act].” CFTC Rule 49.17(b)(2), 17 CFR § 49.17(b)(2). The
Commission expects that the relevant authority will need to provide to the Commission similar
information before the Commission will enter into the MOU or other arrangement.

208

arrangement could also satisfy the condition in proposed Rule 13n-4(d)(3) for an SDR to avail
itself of the Indemnification Exemption, which is discussed below. 783
In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that in making the determination, it
would be reasonable for the Commission to consider whether the relevant authority has a
legitimate need for access to the security-based swaps maintained by an SDR in order to help
safeguard such information. 784 Confirming that the relevant authority has a legitimate need
could reduce the risk of unauthorized disclosure, misappropriation, or misuse of security-based
swap data. In this regard, the Commission would be furthering the objectives of the Dodd-Frank
Act, which created a number of protections for proprietary and highly sensitive data, including
“individual counterparty trade and position data,” maintained by an SDR. 785 The Commission,
therefore, preliminarily believes that a reasonable approach for our determination of an
appropriate authority is for the Commission to consider the scope of the relevant authority’s
regulatory mandate and legal responsibilities. The Commission preliminarily believes that our
consideration of these factors will further the Dodd-Frank Act’s objective to safeguard securitybased swap data and should address a commenter’s concerns over unfettered access to such
proprietary data. 786 The Commission also anticipates considering, among other things, whether
the relevant authority agrees to provide the Commission with reciprocal assistance in securities
matters within the Commission’s jurisdiction, and whether such a determination would be in the
public interest. The Commission may take into account any other factors as the Commission
determines are appropriate in making our determination.
In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is not necessary to prescribe by
rule—as one commenter suggested 787—a specific process such as the one proposed by the

trade and position data, on a confidential basis only to circumscribed list of authorities or other
persons that the Commission determines to be appropriate); Section 13(n)(5)(H)(i) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(H)(i), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act
(requiring that, prior to an SDR sharing such information, the SDR must receive a written
agreement from each entity stating that the entity shall abide by certain confidentiality
requirements); and Section 13(n)(5)(F) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(F), as added by
Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act (requiring SDRs to maintain the privacy of any and all
security-based swap transaction information that they receive from a security-based swap dealer,
counterparty, or any other registered entity).

209

CFTC 788 that sets forth criteria for relevant authorities and the SDR to use in order to facilitate
relevant authorities’ access to security-based swap data maintained by the SDR. The
Commission preliminarily believes that our determination of an appropriate authority, pursuant
to the process described above, represents a reasonable approach to provide appropriate access
by relevant authorities, while at the same time providing safeguards against access by persons
without proper authority. 789 The Commission also preliminarily believes that SDRs should have
the flexibility to consider whether to provide relevant authorities with access to requested
security-based swap data. 790 The Commission preliminarily believes that a specific rule that
delineates a process governing relevant authorities’ access requests, as suggested by the
commenter, would limit the flexibility of SDRs in considering whether to provide relevant
authorities with access to requested security-based swap data.
The Commission contemplates that, in our sole discretion, we would determine whether
to grant or deny a request for a determination that the relevant authority is appropriate for
purposes of requesting security-based swap data from an SDR. 791 In addition, the Commission
could revoke our determination at any time. 792 For example, the Commission may revoke a
determination or request additional information from a relevant authority to support continuation
of the determination if a relevant authority fails to keep confidential security-based swap data
provided to it by an SDR.

788

See CFTC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking: Swap Data Repositories, 75 FR 80898 (Dec. 23,
2010). The CFTC has since adopted CFTC Rule 49.17(d), 17 CFR § 49.17(d), which does not
include several of its proposed requirements, such as requiring relevant authorities to detail the
basis for their requests. See CFTC SDR Adopting Release, 76 FR 54538.

789

See MFA Letter I at 4 (voicing concern that vague standard could result in an SDR providing
access to persons without proper authority).

790

The Commission preliminarily believes that an SDR’s consideration of whether to provide
relevant authorities with access to requested security-based swap data is implicitly subsumed in
an SDR’s statutory duty to maintain the privacy of security-based swap information that it
receives. See Section 13(n)(5)(F) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(F), as added by
Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act; see also proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(8) under the Exchange
Act (requiring SDRs to maintain the privacy of any and all security-based swap transaction
information that the SDR receives from a security-based swap dealer, counterparty, or certain
registered entity) and proposed Rule 13n-9 under the Exchange Act (requiring an SDR to protect
the privacy of security-based swap transaction information that the SDR receives by, among other
things, establishing safeguards, policies, and procedures that are reasonably designed to protect
such information and that address, without limitation, the SDR limiting access to confidential
information, material, nonpublic information, and intellectual property).

791

The Commission may issue a determination order that is for a limited time.

792

As a general matter, the Commission provides a list of MOUs and other arrangements on its
website, which is one way for an SDR to monitor and determine whether a relevant authority has
entered into an applicable MOU or other arrangement. The MOUs and other arrangements can be
found at the following link: http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_cooparrangements.shtml.

(c) Option for Exemptive Relief from the Indemnification Requirement
i.

Impact of the Indemnification Requirement

As noted above, Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 793 and previously proposed
Rule 13n-4(b)(9) thereunder provide that an SDR shall on a confidential basis, pursuant to
Section 24 of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, upon request, and after
notifying the Commission of the request, make available all data obtained by the SDR to each
appropriate prudential regulator, the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the CFTC, the
Department of Justice, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation and any other person that the
Commission determines to be appropriate. Section 13(n)(5)(H)(ii) of the Exchange Act requires
that before an SDR shares security-based swap information with a relevant authority requesting
such information from the SDR, the relevant authority must “agree to indemnify the securitybased swap data repository and the Commission for any expenses arising from litigation relating
to the information provided under section 24 [of the Exchange Act].” 794 Based on the
Commission’s understanding that certain relevant authorities may be unable to agree to
indemnify any SDR and the Commission, the Commission preliminarily believes that the
Indemnification Requirement could significantly frustrate the purpose of Section 13(n)(5)(G) of
the Exchange Act 795 by preventing SDRs from making available security-based swap
information to relevant authorities.
As stated in the SDR Proposing Release, “under the Dodd-Frank Act, SDRs are intended
to play a key role in enhancing transparency in the [security-based swap] market by retaining
complete records of [security-based swap] transactions, maintaining the integrity of those
records, and providing effective access to those records to relevant authorities and the public in
line with their respective information needs.” 796 Commenters 797 as well as relevant authorities,
however, have expressed concerns about how the Indemnification Requirement would
contravene the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act, and more specifically, the statutory purposes of

793

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

797

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 31 (“[T]he indemnification requirement could be a significant
impediment to effective regulatory coordination, since non-US regulators may establish parallel
requirements for U.S. regulators to access swap data reported in their jurisdictions.”); DTCC
Letter I at 3 (discussing how the Indemnification Requirement would result in the reduction of
information accessible to regulators on a timely basis and would greatly diminish regulators’
ability to carry out oversight functions); ESMA Letter at 2 (noting that the Indemnification
Requirement “undermines the key principle of trust according to which exchange of information
[among relevant authorities] should occur”).

211

SDRs. 798 The Commission preliminarily believes that the Indemnification Requirement should
not be applied rigidly so as to frustrate such purposes.
Specifically, the Commission recognizes that certain domestic authorities, including
some of those expressly identified in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 799 and the
Commission, cannot, as a matter of law, provide an open-ended indemnification agreement. For
example, the Antideficiency Act prohibits certain U.S. federal agencies from obligating or
expending federal funds in advance or in excess of an appropriation, apportionment, or certain
administrative subdivisions of those funds (e.g., through an unlimited or unfunded
indemnification). 800 Similarly, the Commission understands that foreign authorities may also be
prohibited under applicable foreign laws from satisfying the Indemnification Requirement. 801 As
such, the Commission agrees with three commenters’ views that the Indemnification
Requirement could hinder the ability of relevant authorities to fulfill their regulatory mandates
and legal responsibilities. 802
Moreover, the Commission understands from foreign authorities that their regulatory
regimes will require them to have direct access to data maintained by trade repositories,
including SDRs registered with the Commission, in order to fulfill their regulatory mandates and
legal responsibilities. 803 Many foreign regulators 804 and market participants have indicated,
798

See, e.g., DTCC Letter IV at 5 (noting that SDRs should be able to provide, among other things,
enforcement authorities with necessary trading information and regulatory agencies with certain
counterparty-specific information). As stated above, the Commission believes that the goal of
Sections 13(n)(5)(G) and 13(n)(5)(H) of the Exchange Act is, among other things, to obligate
SDRs to make available security-based swap information to relevant authorities, provided that the
confidentiality of the information is preserved.

803

For example, in the case of Europe, under European Market Infrastructure Regulation (“EMIR”),
trade repositories established in third countries that provide services to entities established in the
European Union must apply for recognition by ESMA, which conditions its approval on, among
other things, “[European] Union authorities, including ESMA, hav[ing] immediate and
continuous access” to information in such trade repositories. Regulation No. 648/2012 of the
European Parliament and of the Council of 4 July 2012 on OTC derivatives, central
counterparties and trade repositories, 2012 O.J. (L 201) 1, 49.

804

See CFTC and SEC, Joint Report on International Swap Regulation (Jan. 31, 2012) (noting that
the indemnification provisions have “caused concern among foreign regulators, some of which
have expressed unwillingness to register or recognize [a swap data repository] unless [they are]
able to have direct access to necessary information” and that foreign regulators “are considering
the imposition of a similar requirement that would restrict the CFTC’s and SEC’s access to
information at [trade repositories] abroad”).

212

however, that because foreign authorities cannot, as a matter of law or practice, comply with the
Indemnification Requirement, the practical effect of having an open-ended indemnification
requirement may be the fragmentation of security-based swap data across multiple SDRs, as
foreign authorities establish trade repositories in their jurisdictions to ensure access to data that
they need to perform their regulatory mandates and legal responsibilities. 805 Such fragmentation
may lead to duplicative reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions, higher reporting costs
for market participants, and less transparency in the security-based swap market. 806 In light of
these concerns, the Commission preliminarily believes that an exemption from the
Indemnification Requirement may be necessary or appropriate, as a practical matter, to minimize
fragmentation of security-based swap data that could otherwise be consolidated and reduce
duplicative reporting requirements. 807
ii.

Proposed Rule 13n-4(d): Indemnification Exemption

The Commission is proposing, pursuant to our authority under Section 36 of the
Exchange Act, 808 a tailored exemption from the Indemnification Requirement. To avoid a result
that could significantly frustrate the purpose of Section 13(n)(5)(G) and the purpose of SDRs, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the Indemnification Exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors, 809
particularly given that the exemption is narrowly tailored and could be applied in only limited
circumstances.
Specifically, the Commission is proposing Rule 13n-4(d) (“Indemnification Exemption”),
which states as follows: “A registered security-based swap data repository is not required to
comply with the indemnification requirement set forth in Section 13(n)(5)(H)(ii) of the
[Exchange] Act and [Rule 13n-4(b)(9) thereunder] with respect to disclosure of security-based
swap information by the security-based swap data repository if: (1) [a]n entity described in [Rule
13n-4(b)(9)] requests security-based swap information from the security-based swap data
repository to fulfill a regulatory mandate and/or legal responsibility of the entity; (2) [t]he
request of such entity pertains to a person or financial product subject to the jurisdiction,
805

See Section XV.H.2(b)iii, infra (discussing the potential effects of fragmentation of securitybased swap data among trade repositories across multiple jurisdictions).

806

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 31 (The Indemnification Requirement “could be a significant
impediment to effective regulatory coordination, since non-U.S. regulators may establish parallel
requirements for U.S. regulators to access swap data reported in their jurisdictions”).

807

The Commission preliminarily believes that the Indemnification Requirement does not apply
when an SDR is registered with the Commission and is also registered or licensed with a foreign
authority and that authority is obtaining security-based swap information directly from the SDR
pursuant to that foreign authority’s regulatory regime.

808

that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the
protection of investors”).

supervision, or oversight of the entity; and (3) [s]uch entity has entered into a supervisory and
enforcement memorandum of understanding or other arrangement with the Commission that
addresses the confidentiality of the security-based swap information provided and any other
matters as determined by the Commission.”
In proposing the Indemnification Exemption, the Commission is mindful of the
comments received. The Commission intends for the Indemnification Exemption to—as one
commenter suggested—“preserve [the] spirit of cooperation and coordination between regulators
around the world” in the context of ensuring global regulators’ access to security-based swap
data. 810 By identifying specific conditions that are applicable to requests by any relevant
authority, the Commission also intends for the Indemnification Exemption to be—as one
commenter suggested—“location agnostic,” 811 whereby relevant authorities are treated similarly
regardless of whether they are domestic authorities or foreign authorities. 812 In addition, the
Indemnification Exemption is consistent with one commenter’s suggestion that the Commission
should not apply the Indemnification Requirement where relevant authorities are carrying out
their regulatory responsibilities, in accordance with international agreements and while
maintaining the confidentiality of data provided to them. 813 In order for an SDR to share
security-based swap information with a relevant authority without an indemnification agreement,
the three proposed conditions specified in the Indemnification Exemption, as discussed further
below, must be met.
First, the relevant authority’s request for security-based swap information from an SDR
must be for the purpose of fulfilling the relevant authority’s regulatory mandate and/or legal
responsibility. The Commission preliminarily believes that this condition is aligned with the
Dodd-Frank Act’s requirements to protect security-based swap information, including
proprietary and highly sensitive data, maintained by an SDR from unauthorized disclosure,
misappropriation, or misuse of security-based swap information. 814 In particular, the
810

See DTCC Letter III at 12 (discussing implementation of guidance provided by the ODRF
regarding global regulators’ access to security-based swap data maintained by a trade repository
in the United States).

811

See DTCC Letter III at 12 (suggesting that the Commission’s regulatory model regarding
regulatory access should be “location agnostic”).

812

The Commission intends for the Indemnification Exemption to provide relief for both foreign
authorities and domestic authorities that require access to security-based swap data maintained by
SDRs in order to fulfill a regulatory mandate or legal responsibility. The Commission
preliminarily believes that an SDR may rely on the Indemnification Exemption in connection
with requests from relevant authorities, including SROs, registered futures associations, and
international financial institutions.

813

See DTCC Letter III at 12.

814

See Section 13(n)(5)(F) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(F), as added by Section 763(i)
of the Dodd-Frank Act (requiring SDRs to maintain the privacy of any and all security-based
swap transaction information that they receive from a security-based swap dealer, counterparty,
or any other registered entity); Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G),

214

Commission preliminarily believes that this condition is consistent with an SDR’s statutory duty
to maintain the privacy of security-based swap information that it receives. 815 In complying with
its duty to maintain the privacy of security-based swap information, an SDR would need to
determine when it can or cannot provide security-based swap information to others. The
Commission preliminarily believes that, for the limited purposes of satisfying the
Indemnification Exemption, it is appropriate for the SDR to include in its consideration of
whether to provide security-based swap information to relevant authorities whether a relevant
authority’s specific request for security-based swap information is indeed within its regulatory
mandate or legal responsibilities before the SDR provides the information to the relevant
authority. 816 Finally, the Commission notes that establishing such a condition in the
Indemnification Exemption is consistent with guidelines that one commenter indicated that it
followed on a voluntary basis in providing relevant authorities with access to security-based
swap information. 817
Second, the relevant authority’s request must pertain to a person or financial product
subject to that authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight. If, for instance, the relevant
authority requests information on a security-based swap that pertains to a counterparty or
underlier that is subject to the authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight, then this
as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act (directing SDRs to provide data, including
individual counterparty trade and position data, on a confidential basis only to circumscribed list
of authorities or other persons that the Commission determines to be appropriate); and Section
13(n)(5)(H)(i) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(H)(i), as added by Section 763(i) of the
Dodd-Frank Act (requiring that, prior to an SDR sharing such information, the SDR must receive
a written agreement from each entity stating that the entity shall abide by certain confidentiality
requirements).
815

See Section 13(n)(5)(F) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(F), as added by Section 763(i)
of the Dodd-Frank Act; see also proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(8) under the Exchange Act (requiring
SDRs to maintain the privacy of any and all security-based swap transaction information that the
SDR receives from a security-based swap dealer, counterparty, or certain registered entity) and
proposed Rule 13n-9 under the Exchange Act (requiring an SDR to protect the privacy of
security-based swap transaction information that the SDR receives by, among other things,
establishing safeguards, policies, and procedures that are reasonably designed to protect such
information and that address, without limitation, the SDR limiting access to confidential
information, material, nonpublic information, and intellectual property).

816

The Commission preliminarily believes that in complying with an SDR’s statutory privacy duty,
the SDR has the flexibility to consider whether to provide relevant authorities with access to
requested security-based swap data and will most likely decide that it is reasonable to consider
whether a relevant authority’s request for security-based swap information is within its regulatory
mandate or legal responsibilities before the SDR provides the information.

817

See DTCC Letter III at 12 (stating that it “routinely provides [swap] transaction data to U.S.
regulators (and ... routinely provides data related to [swap] transactions in the U.S. by U.S.
persons on European underlyings to European regulators), as contemplated by the ODRF”
guidelines that provide guidance on relevant authorities’ information needs and level of access to
data); see also DTCC Letter IV at 7-8.

215

condition to the Indemnification Exemption would be satisfied. The Commission preliminarily
believes that the person or financial product need not be registered or licensed with the authority
in order for this condition to be satisfied. Similar to the first condition of the Indemnification
Exemption, the Commission preliminarily believes that this condition is aligned with the DoddFrank Act’s requirements to protect security-based swap information, including proprietary and
highly sensitive data, maintained by an SDR from unauthorized disclosure, misappropriation, or
misuse of security-based swap information. 818 In particular, the Commission preliminarily
believes that the second condition is consistent with an SDR’s statutory duty to maintain the
privacy of security-based swap information that it receives. 819 In complying with its duty to
maintain the privacy of security-based swap information, an SDR would need to determine when
it can or cannot provide security-based swap information to others. The Commission
preliminarily believes that, for the limited purposes of satisfying the Indemnification Exemption,
it is appropriate for the SDR to include in its consideration of whether to provide security-based
swap information to relevant authorities whether a relevant authority’s specific request pertains
to a person or financial product that is subject to the authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or
oversight. 820 Finally, the Commission notes that establishing such a condition in the
Indemnification Exemption is consistent with guidelines that one commenter indicated that it
followed on a voluntary basis in providing relevant authorities with access to security-based
swap information. 821
Third, the requesting relevant authority must enter into a supervisory and enforcement
818

See Sections 13(n)(5)(F), (G), and (H)(i) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(F), (G), and
(H)(i), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

819

See Section 13(n)(5)(F) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(F), as added by Section 763(i)
of the Dodd-Frank Act; see also proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(8) under the Exchange Act (requiring
SDRs to maintain the privacy of any and all security-based swap transaction information that the
SDR receives from a security-based swap dealer, counterparty, or certain registered entity) and
proposed Rule 13n-9 under the Exchange Act (requiring an SDR to protect the privacy of
security-based swap transaction information that the SDR receives by, among other things,
establishing safeguards, policies, and procedures that are reasonably designed to protect such
information and that address, without limitation, the SDR limiting access to confidential
information, material, nonpublic information, and intellectual property).

820

The Commission preliminarily believes that in complying with an SDR’s statutory privacy duty,
the SDR has the flexibility to consider whether to provide relevant authorities with access to
requested security-based swap data and will most likely decide that it is reasonable to consider
whether a relevant authority’s request for security-based swap information pertains to a person or
financial product that is subject to the authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight before the
SDR provides the information.

821

See DTCC Letter III at 12 (stating that it “routinely provides [swap] transaction data to U.S.
regulators (and . . . routinely provides data related to [swap] transactions in the U.S. by U.S.
persons on European underlyings to European regulators), as contemplated by the ODRF”
guidelines that provide guidance on relevant authorities’ information needs and level of access to
data); see also DTCC Letter IV at 7-8.

216

MOU or other arrangement with the Commission that addresses the confidentiality of the
security-based swap information provided and any other matters as determined by the
Commission.822 For those entities not expressly identified in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the
Exchange Act 823 or the rules thereunder, such an MOU or other arrangement can be entered into
during the Commission’s determination process, as discussed in Section VI.C.3(b) above. On
the other hand, entities expressly identified in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act and the
rules thereunder, which are not subject to the Commission’s process to determine appropriate
regulators, would need to enter into such an MOU or other arrangement to satisfy this condition
of the Indemnification Exemption. The Commission anticipates that in determining whether to
enter into such a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other arrangement with a relevant
authority, the Commission will consider whether, among other things, the relevant authority
needs security-based swap information from an SDR to fulfill its regulatory mandate or legal
responsibilities; the relevant authority agrees to protect the confidentiality of the security-based
swap information provided to it; the relevant authority agrees to provide the Commission with
reciprocal assistance in securities matters within the Commission’s jurisdiction; and a
supervisory and enforcement MOU or other arrangement would be in the public interest.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the third condition in the Indemnification
Exemption is—as one commenter suggested—an effective way to streamline the Indemnification
Requirement for an “efficient exchange of information.” 824 The Commission also preliminarily
believes that the third condition in the Indemnification Exemption is appropriate to help protect
the confidentiality of the security-based swap data provided to relevant authorities, and also to
further the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act. In this regard, the Commission preliminarily
believes that where a relevant authority cannot agree to indemnification, a supervisory and
enforcement MOU or other arrangement, which a relevant authority can legally enter into, may
be a reasonable alternative because, similar to an indemnification agreement, a supervisory and
enforcement MOU or other arrangement would serve as another mechanism to protect the
confidentiality of security-based swap data provided to a relevant authority by committing the
authority to maintain such confidentiality. 825 In light of the confidentiality agreement required

822

As a general matter, the Commission provides a list of MOUs and other arrangements on its
website, which is one way for an SDR to monitor and determine whether a relevant authority has
entered into an applicable MOU or other arrangement for purposes of satisfying the third
condition of the Indemnification Exemption. The MOUs and other arrangements can be found at
the following link: http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_cooparrangements.shtml.

823

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

824

See ESMA Letter at 2 (recommending an MOU between the Commission and relevant authorities
to address duplicative regulatory regimes and facilitate cooperation among authorities from
different jurisdictions).

825

See 15 U.S.C. 8325(a), as added by Section 752 of the Dodd-Frank Act (providing that the
Commission and foreign regulators “may agree to such information-sharing arrangements as may
be deemed to be necessary or appropriate in the public interest . . . .”).

217

under Section 13(n)(5)(H)(i) of the Exchange Act and previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(10) 826
as well as the importance of maintaining good relations and trust among relevant authorities, the
Commission also preliminarily believes that a relevant authority will have strong incentives to
take reasonable measures and precautions to comply with its obligation to protect the
confidentiality of the security-based swap information received from an SDR. In lieu of
providing an indemnification agreement, a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other
arrangement would provide an SDR and the Commission with an additional layer of protection
in maintaining the confidentiality of security-based swap information shared by the SDR. 827
For the reasons stated above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the
Indemnification Exemption is a reasonable alternative to the Indemnification Requirement. The
Commission recognizes, however, that a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other
arrangement would not necessarily provide SDRs that invoke the exemption with the same level
of protection that an indemnification agreement would provide (i.e., coverage for any expenses
arising from litigation relating to information provided to a relevant authority) and thus, an SDR
may prefer the benefits of the Indemnification Requirement rather than rely on the
Indemnification Exemption. Therefore, under the Commission’s proposed exemption, an SDR
would have the option to require an indemnification agreement from a relevant authority should
the SDR choose to do so rather than rely on the Indemnification Exemption.
The Commission expects that where an SDR seeks to obtain an indemnification
agreement from a relevant authority, the SDR should negotiate in good faith an indemnification
agreement. In this regard, the Commission agrees with one commenter’s view that “any
indemnity should be limited in scope” 828 and expects that an SDR will not unreasonably hinder
the ability of relevant authorities to obtain security-based swap information from the SDR. 829
Regarding the same commenter’s suggestion that the Commission provide model
indemnification language, 830 the Commission does not believe that it is appropriate to prescribe
by rule specific language that an SDR would be required to use when requesting indemnification
826

As stated above, the MOU or other arrangement is separate from the written agreement under
Section 13(n)(5)(H)(i) of the Exchange Act and previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(9) thereunder
stating that the relevant authority shall abide by the confidentiality requirements described in
Section 24 of the Exchange Act relating to the information on security-based swap transactions
that is provided by the SDR. The MOU or other arrangement is between the Commission and the
relevant authority, whereas the written agreement is between the SDR and the relevant authority.

827

The Commission notes that the MOU or other arrangement would not constitute a waiver on the
part of the Commission or SDR to pursue legal action against a relevant authority and liability, if
any, will be determined in accordance with applicable law. The Commission also does not
interpret the indemnification as extending to an SDR’s own wrongful acts.

828

See DTCC Letter III at 12.

829

For example, the Commission does not expect that an indemnification agreement would include a
provision requiring a relevant authority to indemnify the SDR from the SDR’s own wrongful or
negligent acts.

830

See DTCC Letter III at 12.

218

from relevant authorities. Because such language could vary on a case-by-case basis depending
on various factors, such as the laws applicable to the relevant authority, the Commission
preliminarily believes that it is appropriate to allow for flexibility in negotiation of an
indemnification agreement.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed guidance,
interpretation, and the Indemnification Exemption, including the following:
•

Is the Commission’s proposed interpretation of the Notification Requirement
appropriate and sufficiently clear? Why or why not? Is it overly broad or narrow? If
so, why? Does the Commission’s proposed interpretation provide the Commission
with sufficient information to fulfill our responsibilities?

•

Should the Commission require SDRs to provide the Commission with actual notice
of all of requests for security-based swap data by relevant authorities? Why or why
not? If so, what should such notice include? Why?

•

What would be the advantage of requiring SDRs to provide actual notice to the
Commission of requests for security-based swap data by relevant authorities before
making the data available to the relevant authorities?

•

With regard to the Notification Requirement, should the Commission adopt a rule that
is consistent with the approach taken by the CFTC in its Rule 49.17(d)(4), 17 CFR §
49.17(d)(4), which requires a swap data repository to promptly notify the CFTC
regarding any request received by an appropriate foreign or domestic regulator to gain
access to the swap data maintained by such swap data repository? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission provide an exemption from the Notification Requirement
similar to the Indemnification Exemption? Why or why not? For example, should
proposed Rule 13n-4(d) be revised to begin with “[a] registered security-based swap
data repository is not required to comply with the notification requirements set forth
in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Act and paragraph (b)(9) of this section and the
indemnification requirement set forth in Section 13(n)(5)(H)(ii) of the Act and
paragraph (b)(10) of this section . . .”? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission propose a rule with regard to the application of the
Notification Requirement? Why or why not? If so, what should the rule stipulate?

•

In determining whether a person is appropriate to obtain security-based swap data
from SDRs, should the Commission establish the process set forth in this release for
persons to request a Commission determination? Why or why not? Should the
Commission make such a determination by order? Why or why not? Should the
Commission delegate this determination to the staff? Why or why not?

219

•

In determining whether a person is appropriate to obtain security-based swap data
from SDRs, should the Commission require a supervisory and enforcement MOU or
other arrangement? Why or why not? If so, what matters should be addressed in the
MOU or other arrangement? What factors should the Commission take into
consideration when determining whether to enter into an MOU or other arrangement
with the person?

•

In determining whether a person is appropriate to obtain security-based swap data
from SDRs, does the Commission need to understand the scope of a relevant
authority’s regulatory mandate or legal responsibilities? Why or why not? What
other factors should the Commission take into account in making such a
determination?

•

Should the Commission’s process for determining whether a person is appropriate to
obtain security-based swap data from SDRs be memorialized in a rule? If so, what
should the rule stipulate?

•

Should the Commission require by rule or in our determination orders that SDRs not
provide relevant authorities with access to security-based swap data beyond their
regulatory mandates or legal responsibilities? Why or why not? Should the
Commission adopt a process such as the one adopted by the CFTC in it Rule
49.17(d), 17 CFR § 49.17(d), which requires certain regulators seeking to gain access
to the swap data maintained by a swap data repository to certify that they are acting
within the scope of their jurisdiction?

•

Are there any reasons why the Commission should determine a person appropriate to
obtain security-based swap data from one or more SDRs, but not all SDRs? If so,
what are they?

•

Should the Commission, when it determines that a person is appropriate to obtain
security-based swap data from SDRs, include limitations on such determination?
Why or why not? For example, should the Commission limit the determination to a
certain period of time or to certain individual persons at a relevant authority?

•

Under what circumstances should the Commission be able to revoke our
determination order? Under what circumstances would it be appropriate for the
Commission to request a relevant authority to provide additional information in order
to maintain such a determination?

•

Should the Commission provide additional clarification with respect to how parties
comply with the confidentiality requirements in Section 24 of the Exchange Act? In
what aspect would clarification be helpful?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed interpretation of the Indemnification Requirement
appropriate and sufficiently clear? Should the Commission interpret the
Indemnification Requirement more broadly or narrowly? If so, explain.
220

•

Should the Commission interpret the Indemnification Requirement to be limited to
the liability that a relevant authority otherwise would have to an SDR pursuant to the
laws applicable to that relevant authority, such as the Federal Tort Claims Act, which
is applicable to domestic authorities?

•

Is the Commission’s Indemnification Exemption appropriate and sufficiently clear?
If not, what would be a better alternative? Please also explain the costs and benefits
of any alternative, including how the alternative would be consistent with and further
the goals of Title VII.

•

Is the Indemnification Exemption overly broad or narrow? If so, what would be a
better alternative? Please also explain the costs and benefits of any alternative,
including how the alternative would be consistent with and further the goals of Title
VII.

•

Are there ways to narrowly tailor the Indemnification Exemption further without
hindering a relevant authority’s ability to obtain security-based swap data information
from SDRs?

•

Should the SDRs have the option to require a relevant authority to provide an
indemnification agreement even if the three conditions in the Indemnification
Exemption can be satisfied? Why or why not? Does providing SDRs with such an
option raise any competiveness concerns?

•

If the Commission were to modify the Indemnification Exemption so that SDRs do
not have the option to require an indemnification agreement pursuant to Section
13(n)(5)(H)(ii) of the Exchange Act even if the three conditions in the exemption are
satisfied, would this be appropriate and consistent with the Indemnification
Requirement?

•

What is the likelihood of an SDR not availing itself of the Indemnification Exemption
even if the three conditions are met? Are there any measures that the Commission
should take to address or mitigate this scenario? Are there any restrictions that the
Commission should impose on an SDR that requires an indemnification agreement
even if it can avail itself of the Indemnification Exemption?

•

Should an SDR be required to make and keep records of its decision to rely on the
Indemnification Exemption?

•

Are the Indemnification Exemption and the Commission’s proposed interpretive
guidance sufficient to address the possibility that SDRs may be registered with
ESMA and national regulators at the European Union (“EU”) member state level will
obtain security-based swap information from ESMA? Are there any regulatory
regime or circumstances that the Commission should take into consideration that is
not addressed by the Indemnification Exemption or the Commission’s interpretive
guidance? Please explain.
221

•

Will organizations such as FINRA and other self-regulatory organizations, the
National Futures Association, the IMF, and the International Bank for Reconstruction
and Development be able to meet the three conditions of the Indemnification
Exemption? Why or why not? If not, should the Indemnification Exemption be
modified to explicitly exempt such organizations from the Indemnification
Requirement? Why or why not? If so, which organizations and why?

•

Does the Indemnification Exemption adequately address the concerns of relevant
authorities with respect to the Indemnification Requirement? Are there any
circumstances that would warrant an exemption from the Indemnification
Requirement, but that would not satisfy all the conditions in the Indemnification
Exemption? If so, how could the Indemnification Exemption be modified and
narrowly tailored to capture such circumstances so as not to have the effect of
nullifying the Indemnification Requirement?

•

Is it appropriate to provide SDRs with the flexibility to determine, on a case-by-case
basis, whether a relevant authority that is requesting security-based swap information
is acting within the scope of its regulatory mandate or legal responsibilities? Why or
why not?

•

Should the Commission impose any additional requirements on SDRs to confirm that
a relevant authority is requesting security-based swap information for the purpose of
fulfilling its regulatory mandate or legal responsibilities? For example, should the
Commission prescribe, as a condition in the Indemnification Exemption, that the SDR
obtain a written confirmation from the requesting relevant authority that it is acting
within its regulatory mandate or legal responsibilities?

•

Should the Commission impose any additional requirements on SDRs to confirm that
a relevant authority is requesting security-based swap information that pertains to a
person or financial product subject to the jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight of the
authority? For example, should the Commission prescribe, as a condition in the
Indemnification Exemption, that the SDR obtain a written confirmation from the
requesting relevant authority that its request pertains to a person or financial product
subject to the jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight of the authority?

•

Would an MOU between the Commission and a relevant authority in lieu of an
indemnification agreement provide protection of security-based swap information
shared with the relevant authority comparable to that of an indemnification
agreement? If not, why not?

•

Should the Commission specify in the Indemnification Exemption any other matters
that may be in a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other arrangement? If so,
what?

•

On January 25, 2012, the European Commission proposed reforms to strengthen
online privacy rights and to modernize the principles set forth in the EU’s 1995 Data
Protection Directive (“EU Directive”) to protect personal data. Will the EU Directive
222

affect the ability of SDRs to provide security-based swap data to other relevant
authorities, including the Commission? If so, please explain. Will the EU Directive
affect the ability of the EU and its member countries to provide reciprocal assistance
in securities matters, as contemplated by the supervisory and enforcement MOU or
other arrangement discussed above? If so, please explain.
•

Should the Commission impose any additional conditions in the Indemnification
Exemption? If so, what? Are there any conditions in the Indemnification Exemption
that the Commission should not require? If so, what conditions and why?

•

For the purpose of satisfying the Indemnification Exemption, should an SDR be
required to maintain policies and procedures setting forth how to determine (i)
whether security-based swap information being requested is needed to fulfill a
regulatory mandate and/or legal responsibility of the requesting entity, (ii) whether a
relevant authority’s requests pertain to a person or financial product subject to the
authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight, or (iii) whether the requesting
relevant authority has entered into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other
arrangement with the Commission? To the extent such policies and procedures
require each requesting relevant authority to provide a written representation with
respect to one or more of the conditions in the Indemnification Exemption, should
such written representations be considered sufficient to satisfy the relevant conditions
in the Indemnification Exemption?

•

Are there better ways that the Commission could address the Indemnification
Requirement besides the Indemnification Exemption that would be consistent with
and further the goals of Title VII? Please explain the costs and benefits of any
alternative.

•

What is the likely impact of the Indemnification Exemption on the security-based
swap market? Would the Indemnification Exemption potentially promote or impede
the establishment of SDRs?

•

Is the Commission’s proposed interpretation of how the Indemnification Requirement
applies to SDRs dually registered with the Commission and a foreign regulator
appropriate and sufficiently clear? If not, why not? Should the Commission apply
the Indemnification Requirement when an SDR is registered with the Commission
and is also registered or licensed with a foreign authority and that foreign authority is
obtaining information from the SDR pursuant to its regulatory regime? Why or why
not? Should there be any additional conditions in such instances? If so, what
conditions and why?

•

Should the Commission provide guidance on what it means for a “person or financial
product” to be “subject to [an] authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight”?
Why or why not?

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to providing an
exemption from the Indemnification Requirement? How would the proposed
223

application of the Indemnification Requirement, including the proposed exemption,
affect the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the
United States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach
place any market participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so,
please explain. Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on
competition? If so, please explain. What other measures should the Commission
consider to implement the Indemnification Requirement? What would be the market
impacts and competitiveness effects of alternatives to the proposed approach
discussed in this release?

VII.

Security-Based Swap Execution Facilities

A. Introduction
As discussed throughout this release, the market for security-based swaps is global in
scope, with transactions in security-based swaps often involving counterparties in different
jurisdictions. The Commission recognizes that, as a result, there may be uncertainty regarding
the application of our proposed SB SEF registration requirements for a security-based swap
market whose principal place of business is outside of the United States. The Commission
believes, therefore, that guidance and clarification on the application of our proposed registration
requirements would be useful with respect to security-based swap markets operating in the crossborder context.
Under the Dodd-Frank Act, new Section 3D(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that “no
person may operate a facility for the trading or processing of security-based swaps, unless the
facility is registered as a security-based swap execution facility or as a national securities
exchange under this section.” 831 In our release proposing rules governing SB SEFs, 832 the
Commission expressed the view that the registration requirement of Section 3D(a)(1) would
apply only to a facility that meets the definition of “security-based swap execution facility” in
Section 3(a)(77) of the Exchange Act. 833 The SB SEF Proposing Release, however, did not
explicitly address the circumstances under which a foreign 834 security-based swap market would
be required to register with the Commission under Section 3D of the Exchange Act. 835 As
discussed below, the Commission herein proposes to interpret when the registration requirements

832

See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR 10948. The proposed rules governing SB SEFs are
contained in proposed Regulation SB SEF.

833

See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10949 n.10. Section 3(a)(77) of the Exchange Act
defines “security-based swap execution facility” to mean “a trading system or platform in which
multiple participants have the ability to execute or trade security-based swaps by accepting bids
and offers made by multiple participants in the facility or system, through any means of interstate
commerce, including any trading facility, that (A) facilitates the execution of security-based
swaps between persons and (B) is not a national securities exchange.” 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(77).

834

In using the terms “foreign” and “non-resident” in connection with a security-based swap market,
the Commission intends that these terms refer to a security-based swap market that is not a U.S.
person.

835

In the SB SEF Proposing Release, the Commission contemplated that non-resident persons may
apply for registration as a SB SEF. In this regard, the Commission proposed Rule 801(f) of
Regulation SB SEF, which would require any non-resident person applying for registration as a
SB SEF to certify and provide an opinion of counsel that it can, as a matter of law, provide the
Commission with prompt access to its books and records and submit to onsite inspection and
examination by representatives of the Commission. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at
11001.

of Section 3D of the Exchange Act would apply to a foreign security-based swap market. 836 The
Commission also discusses below the circumstances under which it may consider granting an
exemption from registration for a foreign security-based swap market.
The proposed interpretations described below represent the Commission’s proposed
approach to applying the SB SEF registration requirements to foreign security-based swap
markets. We recognize that other approaches may achieve the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act, in
whole or in part. Accordingly, we invite comment regarding all aspects of the proposal
described below, and each proposed interpretation contained therein, including potential
alternative approaches. Data and comment from market participants and other interested parties
regarding the likely effect of each proposed interpretation and potential alternative approaches
would be particularly useful to the Commission in evaluating modifications to the proposals.
B. Registration of Foreign Security-Based Swap Markets
As noted above, in our SB SEF Proposing Release, the Commission expressed the view
that the registration requirement of Section 3D(a)(1) would apply only to a facility that meets the
definition of “security-based swap execution facility” in Section 3(a)(77) of the Exchange Act. 837
A “security-based swap execution facility” is defined as “a trading system or platform in which
multiple participants have the ability to execute or trade security-based swaps by accepting bids
and offers made by multiple participants in the facility or system, through any means of interstate
commerce, including any trading facility, that (A) facilitates the execution of security-based
swaps between persons and (B) is not a national securities exchange.” 838
As outlined further below, the Commission preliminarily believes that, when evaluating
whether a foreign security-based swap market would have to register under Section 3D(a)(1),
activities by the foreign security-based swap market that provide U.S. persons, or non-U.S.
persons located in the United States, the ability to directly execute or trade security-based swaps
on the foreign security-based swap market or facilitate the execution or trading of security-based
swaps by U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United States, on the foreign securitybased swap market should be considered. 839 The Commission also preliminarily believes that, if
a foreign security-based swap market takes affirmative actions to induce the execution or trading
of security-based swaps on its market by U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United
States, including by inducing such execution or trading through marketing its services relating to
the ability to execute or trade security-based swaps on its market to U.S. persons, or non-U.S.
persons located in the United States, or otherwise initiating contact with such persons for the
purpose of inducing such execution or trading, then those activities could be viewed as
836

Entities that do not meet the definition of SB SEF may nonetheless be required to register in
another capacity under the Exchange Act.

226

facilitating the execution or trading of security-based swaps on its market and could cause the
foreign security-based swap market to fall within the scope of the registration requirements of
Section 3D of the Exchange Act.
The Commission believes that it would be useful to provide some discussion of the types
of activities that it preliminarily believes would place a foreign security-based swap market
within the scope of Section 3D of the Exchange Act under the Commission’s proposed
interpretation. Given the constant innovation of trading mechanisms and methods, as well as
technological and communication developments, however, it would not be possible to provide a
comprehensive, final discussion of every activity for which a foreign security-based swap market
would be considered to be providing U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons located in the United
States the ability to execute or trade security-based swaps, or to be facilitating the execution or
trading of security-based swaps, on its market, thereby triggering the requirement to register as a
SB SEF under Section 3D(a)(1).
The Commission preliminarily believes that when a foreign security-based swap market
provides U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United States, with the direct ability to
trade or execute security-based swaps on the foreign security-based swap market by accepting
bids and offers made by one or more participants on the foreign security-based swap market,
then such market would be required to register as a SB SEF. The Commission notes that a
foreign security-based swap market could grant such direct access to U.S. persons, and non-U.S.
persons located in the United States, through a variety of means, such as (i) providing proprietary
electronic screens, market terminals, monitors or other devices for trading security-based swaps
on its market; (ii) granting direct electronic access to the foreign security-based swap market’s
trading system or network, including by providing data feeds or codes for use with software
operated through the computer of a U.S. person, or non-U.S. person located in the United States,
or by allowing such persons to access the foreign security-based swap market through third-party
service vendors or public networks (such as the Internet); or (iii) allowing its members or
participants to provide U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons located in the United States with direct
electronic access to trading in security-based swaps on the foreign security-based swap market.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that, if a foreign security-based swap market
were to grant membership or participation in the foreign security-based swap market to U.S.
persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United States, which would provide such persons
with the ability to directly execute or trade security-based swaps by accepting bids and offers
made by one or more participants on the foreign security-based swap market, then such market
would be required to register as a SB SEF.
Although the Commission preliminarily believes that the foregoing activities are the
types of activities that would warrant application of the registration requirement of Section 3D,
the Commission emphasizes that these activities are not intended to be an exclusive or
exhaustive discussion of all the activities that could trigger the registration requirements of
Section 3D by a foreign security-based swap market. In addition, as trading and communication
mechanisms and methods evolve, other activities that aim at providing U.S. persons, or non-U.S.
persons located in the United States, the ability to directly execute or trade security-based swaps
by accepting bids and offers made by multiple participants on a foreign security-based swap
227

market, or that aim to facilitate the execution or trading of security-based swaps by U.S. persons
or non-U.S. persons located in the United States on a trading platform or system operated by a
foreign security-based swap market, could cause a foreign security-based swap market to fall
within the ambit of the registration requirements of Section 3D. 840
The Commission anticipates that some U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons located in the
United States may choose to transact on a foreign security-based swap market on an indirect
basis through a non-U.S. person that is not located in the United States and that is a member or
participant of a foreign security-based swap market. The Commission preliminarily believes
that, to the extent that the U.S. person, or non-U.S. person located in the United States, initiates
the contact and the foreign security-based swap market does not attempt to solicit such business,
such a transaction would not on its own warrant requiring the foreign security-based swap
market to register under Section 3D of the Exchange Act. 841 However, as discussed above, to
the extent that a foreign security-based swap market initiates contacts with U.S. persons or nonU.S. persons located in the United States to induce or facilitate the execution or trading of
security-based swaps by such persons on its market, such activity would trigger the requirement
to register under Section 3D. 842
The Commission also anticipates that, given the global nature of the security-based swap
business, a foreign security-based swap market could, at some point, seek to enter into a business
combination with a registered SB SEF. Under the Commission’s proposed interpretation, such
business combination also could trigger the registration requirements of Section 3D of the
Exchange Act for the foreign security-based swap market, depending on the nature and extent of
integration of the entities’ operations and activities. In this regard, the Commission’s experience
in recent years with national securities exchanges that have engaged in cross-border
combinations may be illustrative for these purposes. Several national securities exchanges in
recent years have entered into transactions to combine under common ownership with certain
non-U.S. markets, such as NYSE Group, Inc.’s transaction with Euronext N.V. to form NYSE
Euronext in 2007; 843 Eurex Frankfurt AG’s acquisition of the International Securities Exchange,
LLC in 2007; 844 and The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc.’s transaction with Borse Dubai Limited to

840

In the alternative, the foreign security-based swap market could elect to apply for registration as a
national securities exchange. See 15 U.S.C. 78f.

841

The U.S. person or non-U.S. person located in the United States may, however, be required to
register as a broker under Section 15(a)(1) of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78o(a)(1).

842

For example, if a foreign security-based swap market were to allow its members or participants to
provide U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United States with direct electronic
access to trading in security-based swaps on the foreign security-based swap market, this access
would be considered direct access by a U.S. person, or a non-U.S. person located in the United
States and, as noted above, would require the foreign security-based swap market to register.

form NASDAQ OMX Group, Inc. in 2008. 845 In each case, the U.S. and the foreign markets,
under their respective parent companies, generally have continued to operate as separate legal
entities, maintained separate liquidity pools in their respective jurisdictions without integrating
trading interest among markets under common ownership, and continued to be regulated subject
to their own home country’s requirements. Similarly, a registered SB SEF and a foreign
security-based swap market could come under common ownership but continue to be separate
legal entities, maintain separate liquidity pools for their security-based swap businesses without
integrating trading interest among affiliated markets, and be separately regulated in their own
home jurisdictions. However, if a registered SB SEF and foreign security-based swap market
were to integrate their security-based swap trading facilities, for example, by the foreign
security-based swap market providing direct access to the SB SEF’s participants, or by the
foreign security-based swap market and the registered SB SEF integrating their liquidity
pools, 846 under the Commission’s proposed interpretation, such actions would trigger the
registration requirements of Section 3D of the Exchange Act for the foreign security-based swap
market because the market would then be operating a facility for trading security-based swaps
within the United States.
C. Registration Exemption for Foreign Security-Based Swap Markets
The prior section discusses when a foreign security-based swap market would be required
to register as a SB SEF under Section 3D of the Exchange Act. The Commission recognizes,
however, that the security-based swap market is global in nature and therefore one or more
foreign security-based swap markets may seek relief from the Commission to allow some of the
activities discussed above that would trigger the SB SEF registration requirement to continue
without the foreign security-based swap market having to register as a SB SEF under Section 3D
of the Exchange Act.
Following the publication of the SB SEF Proposing Release, the Commission received
comments from the public expressing concerns about the implications of the proposed rules and
the requirements of Section 3D of the Exchange Act for foreign security-based swap markets and
the global markets for security-based swaps generally. 847 Several commenters urged the
Commission to work with foreign regulators to develop harmonized rules for the trading of
security-based swaps. 848 Some commenters believed that harmonization or flexibility with
845

See Exchange Act Release No. 57099 (Jan. 4, 2008), 73 FR 1901 (Jan. 10, 2008).

846

An integrated trading pool for security-based swaps would indicate that there is a unitary market
for the security-based swaps. In such a scenario, persons with direct access to or membership in
the registered SB SEF effectively would have the same direct access or membership privileges in
the foreign security-based swap market by virtue of their access to the integrated trading pool,
and thus would have the ability to directly execute or trade security-based swaps on the foreign
security-based swap market.

regard to foreign security-based swap markets would help reduce the risk of regulatory
arbitrage. 849 One commenter stated that such harmonization would reduce the burdens of
duplicative or conflicting requirements that could be faced by security-based swap markets
operating in multiple jurisdictions. 850
Although a number of foreign jurisdictions are in the process of developing standards for
the regulation of security-based swaps and security-based swap markets, at this time few foreign
jurisdictions have enacted legislation or adopted standards for the regulation of security-based
swap markets. 851 The Commission, however, is in discussions with its foreign counterparts to
explore steps toward harmonizing standards for such regulation in the future. 852 In the
meantime, the Commission is considering how best to address commenters’ concerns about the
risks of regulatory arbitrage and duplicative regulatory burdens on security-based swap markets
that operate on a cross-border basis, in a manner consistent with the requirements of the DoddFrank Act and the federal securities laws generally.
The Commission preliminarily believes that it may be appropriate to consider an
exemption as an alternative approach to SB SEF registration depending on the nature or scope of
the foreign security-based swap market’s activities in, or the nature or scope of the contacts the
foreign security-based swap market has with, the United States. Exemptions that are carefully
tailored to achieve the objectives of Section 3D could help to improve security-based swap
market supervision overall by allowing the Commission to focus our resources on areas where it
has a substantial interest, while reducing duplication of efforts in areas where our interests are
aligned with those of other regulators.
The Commission could exempt from the registration requirements of Section 3D a
foreign security-based swap market that is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision
and regulation under appropriate governmental authorities in its home country. 853 The
availability of such an exemption could serve to reduce any potential duplicative regulatory
burdens faced by security-based swap markets that operate on a cross-border basis and that
otherwise would be required to register both in the United States and in a non-U.S. jurisdiction.
Before the Commission would consider issuing an exemption from the registration
requirements of Section 3D for a particular foreign security-based swap market, the Commission

and exchange and electronic platform trading in global OTC derivatives markets.”).

Any such exemption would be issued by order pursuant to the Commission’s authority under

could consider whether the foreign security-based swap market is subject to comparable,
comprehensive supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities in its
home country, as compared to the supervision and regulation of SB SEFs under the Dodd-Frank
Act and the Commission’s implementing regulations. This process could include a review of the
foreign jurisdiction’s laws, rules, regulatory standards and practices governing the foreign
security-based swap market and would entail consultation and cooperation with the foreign
security-based swap market’s home country governmental authorities.
The Commission expects that any such registration exemption could be subject to
appropriate conditions that could include, but not be limited to, requiring a foreign securitybased swap market to certify that it would provide the Commission with prompt access to its
books and records, including, for example, data relating to orders, quotes, and transactions, as
well as provide an opinion of counsel that, as a matter of law, it is able to provide such access.
The Commission also could require, as a condition to receiving an exemption from registration,
that a foreign security-based swap market would appoint an agent for service of process in the
United States who is not an employee or official of the Commission. These potential conditions
would be consistent with the proposed requirements for non-resident registered SB SEFs 854 and
would allow the Commission to exercise, as necessary or appropriate, supervisory oversight of a
foreign security-based swap market that receives an exemption from Section 3D’s registration
requirements. The Commission also could require that, before issuing an exemption from
registration, the Commission and the appropriate financial regulatory authority or authorities in
the foreign security-based swap market’s home jurisdiction enter into a MOU that addresses the
oversight and supervision of that market.
In certain cases, the Commission also could require, as a condition to granting such an
exemption, that a foreign security-based swap market meet some of the requirements applicable
to registered SB SEFs. Such a condition may be useful where the Commission is unable to make
a determination regarding the broader comparability of the home jurisdiction’s regulation and
supervision, but where there is comparability with respect to some of the requirements applicable
to registered SB SEFs and to a foreign security-based swap market (or class of security-based
swap markets) in its home country. Therefore, the terms and conditions of any exemption that
the Commission may grant to a foreign security-based swap market (or class of security-based
swap markets) could depend on the degree to which the foreign jurisdiction’s laws, rules,
regulatory standards, and practices governing security-based swaps “compare” to those of the
United States.
In considering the above, the Commission may consider any requirements of the home
country that would conflict with the requirements applicable to SB SEFs under the Dodd-Frank
Act. For example, Section 3D of the Exchange Act seeks to ensure fair and open access to SB
SEFs by requiring that a SB SEF establish and enforce rules that include means to provide
market participants with impartial access to the market. 855 The Commission also could consider
854

See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 11001, proposed Rule 801(f), and proposed Form SB
SEF.

855

15 U.S.C. 78c-4(d)(2)(B).

231

whether a home country regulator imposes a regulation or policy limiting fair and open access to
its security-based swap markets.
The Commission notes that security-based swap market structure and security-based
swap market supervision and regulation could vary in other jurisdictions and could affect the
Commission’s ability to make a comparability determination. In addition, such differences in
supervision and regulation would necessitate that each exemption request be reviewed on a
jurisdiction-by-jurisdiction basis by the Commission. The conditions to any such exemption also
would be based on the differences in the market structure and supervisory regime in the
jurisdiction under consideration in comparison to U.S. oversight of SB SEFs.
As noted above, few foreign jurisdictions have adopted a comprehensive framework for
the regulation of security-based swap markets and the Commission has not yet adopted rules
governing SB SEFs. Thus, the Commission believes that it is premature to specify the precise
criteria that the Commission may use for our evaluation and comparison of the regulatory and
supervision programs for foreign security-based swap markets, should the Commission choose to
consider exempting from registration as a SB SEF a foreign security-based swap market that
becomes subject to regulation in its home country at a future date. Nonetheless, the Commission
believes that it is useful now to elicit comment from interested persons regarding our proposed
approach, should it choose to consider providing such an exemption.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed approach, which may condition
any exemption for a foreign security-based swap market on the existence of comparable,
comprehensive supervision and regulation under the appropriate financial regulatory authority or
authorities in the foreign security-based swap market’s home country, should provide
comparable regulatory oversight and supervision as that afforded by the Commission’s
regulation and supervision of SB SEFs. The standard of “comparability” discussed above should
allow the Commission sufficient flexibility to make exemption determinations based on the
similarity of the requirements and practices of the foreign jurisdiction’s regulatory program
governing security-based swaps. In this regard, the Commission preliminarily believes that the
comparability standard could extend not only to the written laws and rules of the foreign
jurisdiction, but also to the jurisdiction’s comprehensive supervision and regulation of its
security-based swap markets, including the jurisdiction’s oversight of its markets and
enforcement of its laws and rules. The breadth of the proposed comparability standard (i.e., to
consider actual practices as well as written laws and rules) could help ensure that the regulatory
protections provided in the foreign jurisdiction’s security-based swap markets are substantially
realized by sufficiently vigorous supervision and enforcement.
Finally, as discussed below, 856 the Commission proposes to permit substituted
compliance, under certain circumstances, with respect to the mandatory trade execution
requirement in Section 3C(h)(1) of the Exchange Act, if the Commission finds that a foreignbased security-based swap market (or class of security-based swap markets) is subject to
comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by a foreign financial regulatory
856

See Section XI.F, infra.

232

authority in such foreign jurisdiction. 857 While the proposed comparability standard for our
granting an exemption from SB SEF registration could be similar to the proposed comparability
standard for a substituted compliance determination with respect to the mandatory trade
execution requirement, which is discussed below, the factors that the Commission could find
relevant to a comparability determination with respect to SB SEF registration would not
necessarily be the same factors that it would consider when making a comparability
determination with respect to mandatory trade execution. This is because Section 3D of the
Exchange Act is focused on the registration of SB SEFs and compliance by registered SB SEFs
with the 14 enumerated core principles governing SB SEFs, 858 whereas Section 3C(h)(1) of the
Exchange Act is focused on the circumstances where execution of a security-based swap on a SB
SEF (or an exchange) is required. 859 However, the Commission solicits comment on the
appropriateness or feasibility of our proposed approach.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on the discussion regarding SB SEFs,
including the following:
•

The Commission requests comment on all aspects of our discussion regarding when a
foreign security-based swap market would be required to register as a SB SEF under
Section 3D and on the non-exhaustive discussion of the types of activities, noted
above, that would trigger registration of the foreign security-based swap market as a
SB SEF. The Commission also requests comment on all aspects of our proposal to
consider requests for an exemption from SB SEF registration for a foreign securitybased swap market under certain circumstances.

•

The Commission seeks commenters’ views on the potential impact of applying the
proposed SB SEF registration requirements to foreign security-based swap markets
that engage in activities that would require such markets to register as a SB SEF. Are
there aspects of the proposed SB SEF rules and registration requirements that present
issues for foreign security-based swap markets that would be required to register as a
SB SEF? If so, please explain in detail.

•

The Commission requests commenters’ views on whether the non-exhaustive
discussion of the types of activities, noted above, which would trigger the application
of Section 3D registration requirements to a foreign security-based swap market, is
appropriate to aid foreign security-based swap markets in assessing whether they
would be required to register as a SB SEF. Are there other activities that foreign
security-based swap markets currently engage in that should be evaluated for
consideration as to whether those activities would trigger Section 3D registration

857

See proposed Rule 3Ch-2 under the Exchange Act.

858

See 15 U.S.C. 78c-4.

859

233

requirements? If so, please describe those activities in detail. Are there specific
items set forth in the non-exhaustive discussion of the types of activities noted above
or any other specific activities engaged in by foreign security-based swap markets
that should not trigger Section 3D registration requirements? If so, commenters
should describe those activities in detail and explain their rationale. Does the
proposed interpretation regarding the application of Section 3D and the proposed
non-exhaustive discussion of the types of activities provide sufficient guidance for a
foreign security-based swap market to assess whether it would have to register, or
seek an exemption from registration, as a SB SEF? If not, what kind of further
guidance would be helpful for making that determination? Does the proposed
approach provide sufficient guidance to a foreign security-based swap market that
may seek an exemption? If not, what kind of further guidance would be helpful?
•

The Commission seeks comment on the appropriateness of the proposed
interpretation that the registration requirements of Section 3D should be triggered by
certain activities directed at “U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United
States.” Are the categories of persons captured by this proposed approach too broad?
Too narrow? Please specify and explain. For example, foreign branches would be
included by the proposed approach, such that a foreign security-based swap market’s
provision of direct access or participation in its market to a foreign branch, or
activities facilitating execution or trading of security-based swaps on its market by
such a foreign branch, would trigger the Section 3D registration requirement. Do
commenters agree with this approach? If not, why not? What would be a better
approach? If so, how so?

•

The Commission requests comment on what would be the appropriate circumstances
under which the Commission should consider granting an exemption from the
registration requirements of Section 3D. Should the Commission consider granting
an exemption from registration for a foreign security-based swap market when the
nature or scope of its activities in the United States are limited? If so, why? Or
should the Commission also consider granting an exemption for a foreign securitybased swap market when the nature or scope of its activities in the United States are
more extensive? Why or why not? What would be the advantages and disadvantages
of either approach? What would be the appropriate criteria for the Commission to
apply when it considers whether to grant an exemption from the registration
requirements of Section 3D? Please specify and explain.

•

The Commission seeks comment on whether the proposed standard of comparability
is an appropriate standard for the Commission to determine whether to grant an
exemption from Section 3D’s registration requirements for a foreign security-based
swap market. Should a different standard be used? If so, what should be the standard
and why? Should it be stricter or more lenient than the proposed standard? If it
should be stricter or more lenient, in what respects and in what manner? Why or why
not? As proposed, when making a comparability determination, the Commission
would look not just at the rules of a foreign jurisdiction, but also at the
comprehensiveness of the supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental
234

authorities of that jurisdiction. Is the Commission’s holistic approach to making a
comparability determination appropriate? Why or why not? Comment also is
requested regarding whether the Commission should put in place a more detailed
standard for granting an exemption, for example, by providing specific criteria that
the Commission would look to in determining whether there is comparable,
comprehensive regulation and supervision of a foreign security-based swap market by
the appropriate financial regulatory authority or authorities in the home country. If
so, what criteria should the Commission include and why? Commenters also are
requested to explain how the Commission should develop such criteria in the absence
of existing regulations in other jurisdictions at the present time. Are there specific
procedures or comparability considerations that commenters believe that the
Commission would find useful to incorporate in our proposed exemption approach at
this time? If so, please describe. What would be the advantages of adopting such
measures now? What would be the disadvantages of adopting such measures now?
•

The Commission solicits comment on the appropriateness or feasibility of
distinguishing between the comparability determination for purposes of an exemption
from registration as a SB SEF and for purposes of substituted compliance for the
mandatory trade execution requirement. Should the Commission consider the same
factors in making a comparability determination for mandatory trade execution and a
comparability determination for SB SEF registration? If so, what factors would be
relevant and appropriate to both determinations? Please describe. What factors, if
any, would only be relevant or appropriate to a comparability determination for SB
SEF registration or a comparability determination for mandatory trade execution,
respectively? Please describe.

•

The Commission seeks comment on the proposed process for granting an exemption
from Section 3D’s registration requirements for a foreign security-based swap
market. Is the process explained in a sufficiently clear manner? Does the process
provide foreign security-based swap markets with an efficient method for obtaining
exemptions? If not, what aspects of the process would be burdensome for foreign
security-based swap markets? Are there other ways to streamline the exemption
process? Please describe.

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to the registration of
foreign security-based swap markets? How would the proposed application of the SB
SEF registration requirement affect the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global
marketplace (both in the United States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the
proposed approach place any market participants at a competitive disadvantage or
advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed approach be a more general

VIII. Regulation SBSR—Regulatory Reporting and Public Dissemination of SecurityBased Swap Information
A. Background
Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 860 provides that all security-based swaps that are
not accepted for clearing shall be subject to regulatory reporting. Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the
Exchange Act 861 provides that each security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be
reported to a registered SDR, and Section 13(m)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act 862 generally provides
that transaction, volume, and pricing data of all security-based swaps shall be publicly
disseminated in real time, except in the case of block trades. 863 On November 19, 2010, the
Commission proposed Regulation SBSR to implement these requirements. 864
Rule 908 of Regulation SBSR as initially proposed was designed to clarify the
application of Regulation SBSR to cross-border security-based swaps. Proposed Rule 908(a)
would require a security-based swap to be reported and publicly disseminated if the securitybased swap: (i) has at least one counterparty that is a U.S. person; (ii) was executed in the
United States or through any means of interstate commerce; or (iii) was cleared through a
registered clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States. Proposed
Rule 908(b) provided that, notwithstanding any other provision of Regulation SBSR, no
counterparty to a security-based swap would incur any obligation under Regulation SBSR unless
it is: (i) a U.S. person; (ii) a counterparty to a security-based swap executed in the United States
or through any means of interstate commerce; or (iii) a counterparty to a security-based swap
cleared through a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States.
Thus, under the Commission’s initial proposal, a security-based swap—wherever it is executed
or cleared—would be required to be reported pursuant to Regulation SBSR if at least one
counterparty were a U.S. person. Furthermore, a security-based swap—even if both
counterparties were non-U.S. persons—would be required to be reported if the security-based
swap were executed in the United States or through any means of interstate commerce, or cleared
through a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States.

large notional security-based swap transaction (block trade) for particular market and contracts”
and “specify the appropriate time delay for reporting large notional security-based swap
transactions (block trades) to the public.”

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR 75208.

236

Rule 901(a)(1), as initially proposed, also provided that, where only one counterparty to a
security-based swap is a U.S. person, the U.S. person would be the “reporting party” (i.e., the
party that incurs the duty to report the security-based swap pursuant to Regulation SBSR). Rule
901(a)(3), as initially proposed, provided that, where neither counterparty to a security-based
swap that must be reported is a U.S. person, the counterparties must select which of them would
be the reporting party.
To date, the Commission has received 48 comment letters specifically in response to
proposed Regulation SBSR, many of which raised issues relating to the cross-border aspects of
the proposal. The Commission has received other letters that, while not specifically referencing
proposed Regulation SBSR, raised cross-border issues that are germane to proposed Regulation
SBSR. 865 In response to these comments—which are described further herein—and upon further
consideration of issues related to cross-border security-based swap transactions across all of the
various areas of Title VII, the Commission is proposing various modifications to proposed
Regulation SBSR, particularly Rule 908 thereof, which address cross-border transactions.
One significant modification being proposed here would take into account situations in
which a U.S. person, although not a “direct counterparty,” as defined below, to a security-based
swap, guarantees the performance of one of the direct counterparties. As discussed above, 866 the
Commission is proposing to apply various Title VII provisions to the security-based swap
transactions of non-U.S. persons that are guaranteed by U.S. persons—including the regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements of Regulation SBSR, as discussed below. 867 A
second significant modification is to propose a “substituted compliance” regime. As explained
in more detail below, the Commission is now proposing a framework that would allow certain
Title VII requirements to be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction rather
than the specific requirements under U.S. rules. Below, the Commission describes the
circumstances under which compliance with the rules of such a foreign jurisdiction could, under
re-proposed Regulation SBSR, be “substituted” for compliance with the specific regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements of Regulation SBSR. 868
A number of new definitions are being added to re-proposed Rule 900 in light of the
changes being proposed. 869 For example, new paragraph (g) of Rule 900 would define the term
“counterparty” to mean “a person that is a direct counterparty or indirect counterparty of a
security-based swap.” A direct counterparty would be “a person that enters directly with another
person into a contract that constitutes a security-based swap.” An indirect counterparty would be

See Section II.B.2(d), supra.

867

See Sections VIII.C and VIII.D, infra.

868

See Section XI.D, infra.

869

In some cases, a definition used in Rule 900 would cross-reference a term defined elsewhere in
the Commission’s Title VII rules. In other cases, a definition might be specific to Regulation
SBSR and not be used elsewhere in the Commission’s Title VII rules.

237

“a person that guarantees the performance of a direct counterparty to a security-based swap or
that otherwise provides recourse to the other side for the failure of the direct counterparty to
perform any obligation under the security-based swap.” Although a guarantor is not a direct
counterparty to the security-based swap, the duties to be performed under the security-based
swap, and thus the risks associated with the security-based swap, ultimately fall to the
guarantor. 870 Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that it is appropriate to deem a
guarantor to be a counterparty to the security-based swap for purposes of the regulatory reporting
requirements of Title VII and the rules proposed thereunder. As discussed in detail below, the
concept of “reporting party” used in Regulation SBSR as initially proposed would be replaced by
the newly proposed term “reporting side,” to reflect the fact that reporting obligations could
attach to both direct and indirect counterparties. 871
The Commission has received and continues to consider comments on the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release that address areas other than those relating to cross-border securitybased swap activity. In this release, the Commission is re-proposing only changes relating to
cross-border security-based swap activity, technical and conforming changes necessitated by
these larger revisions, and certain other minor changes that would help to clarify these reproposed revisions (such as numbering each definition in re-proposed Rule 900, so that each
defined term can more readily be identified). Changes to Regulation SBSR in other areas could,
if appropriate, be addressed in a future release. 872
Regulation SBSR, as re-proposed today, represents the Commission’s preliminary views
regarding the application of Title VII’s provisions relating to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of cross-border security-based swap transactions, and how those provisions would
apply to non-U.S. persons who act in capacities regulated under the Dodd-Frank Act. The
Commission invites comment regarding all aspects of the approaches taken by the Commission
and each provision of re-proposed Regulation SBSR, including potential alternative approaches.
In particular, data and comment from market participants and other interested parties regarding
the likely effect of each re-proposed rule regarding application of a specific Title VII
requirement, the effect of such proposed application in the aggregate, and potential alternative
approaches will be particularly useful to the Commission in evaluating possible modifications to
re-proposed Regulation SBSR.
870

See Section II.B.2(d), supra.

871

Re-proposed Rule 900(ee) would define “side” as “a direct counterparty and any indirect
counterparty that guarantees the direct counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a
security-based swap.” Re-proposed Rule 900(cc) would define “reporting side” as “the side of a
security-based swap having the duty to report information in accordance with [Regulation SBSR]
to a security-based swap data repository, or if there is no security-based swap data repository that
would receive the information, to the Commission.”

872

For example, the Commission in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release did not propose how to
define a “block trade.” As noted in Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
intends to do so in a separate proposal. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at
75228.

238

B. Modifications to the Definition of “U.S. Person”
Rule 900 of re-proposed Regulation SBSR contains a revised definition of “U.S. person.”
As initially proposed, “U.S. person” was defined as “a natural person that is a U.S. citizen or
U.S. resident or a legal person that is organized under the corporate laws of any part of the
United States or has its principal place of business in the United States.” Two persons who
commented specifically on the Regulation SBSR proposal 873 argued that “U.S. person” as used
in the Commission’s Title VII rules should have the same definition as in Regulation S. 874
Proposed Regulation SBSR was the only one of the Commission’s proposals for
implementing Title VII to propose to use and define the term “U.S. person.” Because the
Commission is now addressing cross-border issues across multiple Title VII rules, the
Commission has given further thought to the definition of “U.S. person” as initially proposed in
Regulation SBSR. The Commission now believes that using a single definition of “U.S. person”
in all Title VII rulemaking would promote consistency and transparency in understanding and
complying with these various rules. However, as described above, 875 the Commission
preliminarily believes that the Regulation S definition of “U.S. person” is not appropriate for
Title VII rules. Proposed Rule 900(pp) would define “U.S. person” to have the same meaning as
in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act. 876
Under both the proposed and re-proposed definitions of “U.S. person,” a natural person
resident in the United States would be a U.S. person, as would a legal person that is organized or
incorporated under the laws of the United States or having its principal place of business in the
United States. Furthermore, under both definitions, a foreign branch of a U.S. person would not
be recognized as having an existence separate from the U.S. person. 877 The proposed rule also
would cover partnerships, trusts, and other legal persons, as set forth in proposed Rule
3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act. The re-proposed definition of “U.S. person” also would
clarify certain situations that were not specifically addressed in the initial proposal. For example,
the initially proposed definition of “U.S. person” did not address whether—and, if so, when—an
account would be considered a U.S. person. The re-proposed definition would provide that an
account, whether discretionary or non-discretionary, of a U.S. person would be a U.S. person.
873

See Cleary Letter III at 2, 6-9; Davis Polk Letter I at note 6 (arguing that using the existing
Regulation S definition, rather than creating a new definition, “would avoid confusion and also
provide consistency of application”).

such as branches that are part of the U.S. legal entity).

239

New paragraph (q) of re-proposed Rule 900 would define the term “non-U.S. person” as
a person that is not a U.S. person.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the re-proposed definition of “U.S.
person” in Regulation SBSR. In particular:
•

Should the definition of “U.S. person” in Regulation SBSR be consistent with that
proposed for the Commission’s other Title VII rules? Why or why not? If so, what
should that definition be and why? Would having a different definition of “U.S.
person” in Regulation SBSR create ambiguity or conflict with other Title VII rules
being issued by the Commission? If not, why not?

C. Additional Modifications to Scope of Regulation SBSR
1. Revisions to Proposed Rule 908(a)
Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, provided that a security-based swap would be subject
to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under Regulation SBSR if the security-based
swap: (i) has at least one counterparty that is a U.S. person; (ii) is executed in the United States
or through any means of interstate commerce; or (iii) is cleared through a registered clearing
agency having its principal place of business in the United States. Thus, Rule 908(a), as
originally proposed, would not impose reporting or public dissemination requirements in
connection with a security-based swap solely because the obligations of one of the direct
counterparties is guaranteed by a U.S. person. As noted above, the re-proposed definition of
“U.S. person”—like the initially proposed definition—would not treat a direct counterparty that
is guaranteed by a U.S. person as itself, solely due to the existence of the guarantee, a U.S.
person. However, as noted below, the Commission is concerned about instances where—
because of a guarantee extended by a U.S. person—the risk of a transaction resides in the United
States, even if the direct counterparties of the transaction are domiciled outside the United States.
Thus, upon further consideration, the Commission is now proposing to apply Title VII’s
regulatory reporting requirements to security-based swaps having at least one counterparty,
whether direct or indirect, that is a U.S. person.
Guarantees provided by U.S. persons to their foreign affiliates or other non-U.S. persons
could have the effect of concentrating significant risks within the United States that may rise to
the systemic level. If a U.S. person guarantees the performance of a non-U.S. person, the
financial resources of that U.S. person could be called upon to satisfy the contract. This activity
is capable of posing risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system. The Commission
preliminarily believes that, if it does not require regulatory reporting of security-based swaps that
are guaranteed by U.S. persons, in addition to security-based swaps having a U.S. person direct
counterparty, the Commission and other federal financial regulators would be less likely to detect
the build-up of potentially significant risks within individual institutions or more widespread
systemic risks to the U.S. financial system. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to promote the

240

financial stability of the United States by, among other things, reducing risks to the U.S.
financial system by allowing regulators better access to necessary market data. 878
In addition, the Commission is now proposing to require regulatory reporting of all
security-based swaps entered into by non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swaps participants, wherever they may be executed. 879 This is a change from how
the initial proposal applied to a security-based swap executed by a non-U.S. person securitybased swap dealer or major security-based swap participant. Under the initial proposal, such a
security-based swap would not be required to be reported solely based on an entity’s status as a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, unless the security-based
swap was executed in the United States or through any means of interstate commerce, or was
cleared by a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States.
A non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
generally would be subject to all rules applicable to security-based swap dealers or major
security-based swaps participants, regardless of its principal place of business or where it is
organized. 880 Having access to all of the security-based swap transactions entered into by a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant is an important aspect of
understanding its compliance with the applicable Title VII requirements, including without
limitation, compliance with the capital, margin, and other applicable entity-level and transactionlevel requirements. The Commission notes that Section 15F(f)(1)(a) of the Exchange Act
provides that each registered security-based swap dealer and major security-based swap
participant shall make such reports as are required by the Commission, by rule or regulation,
regarding the transactions and financial condition of the registered security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant. 881 Therefore, the Commission is now proposing to
require that all security-based swaps of all security-based swap dealers and major security-based
swap participants, regardless of where such security-based swaps are executed or where these
entities have their principal place of business or are organized, be subject to regulatory reporting
to a registered SDR. 882

Stability Act of 2010, S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 32 (“As a key element of reducing systemic risk
and protecting taxpayers in the future, protections must include comprehensive regulation and
rules for how the OTC derivatives market operates. Increasing the use of central clearinghouses,
exchanges, appropriate margining, capital requirements, and reporting will provide safeguards for
American taxpayers and the financial system as a whole”) (emphasis added); note 4, supra.

Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o-8(f)(2), requires the Commission to “adopt rules governing reporting and
recordkeeping for security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants.”

882

As discussed below, however, the Commission is proposing that certain security-based swaps of
non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants would

241

To reflect these changes and to reincorporate other provisions that are not being
substantially revised, the Commission is re-proposing Rule 908(a) as follows. The rule would be
divided into two subparagraphs, (1) and (2), which would address regulatory reporting and
public dissemination, respectively. Specifically, re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1) would provide that
a security-based swap transaction would be subject to regulatory reporting if:
(i) The security-based swap is a transaction conducted within the United States;
(ii) There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either side of the
transaction;
(iii) There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant on either side of the transaction; or
(iv) The security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(i) would preserve the principle from the original proposal
that a security-based swap would be subject to regulatory reporting if it is executed in the United
States. 883 As noted above, 884 the concept of a security-based swap transaction being solicited,
negotiated, executed, or booked in the United States has been integrated into the new term
“transaction conducted within the United States,” which also is being used in other Title VII
proposals of the Commission. Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act would define
“transaction conducted within the United States” as “a security-based swap transaction that is
solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked within the United States, by or on behalf of either
counterparty to the transaction, regardless of the location, domicile, or residence status of either
counterparty to the transaction.” 885
The Commission received no comments that specifically addressed our use of the phrase
“through any means of interstate commerce” in three places in Regulation SBSR, as initially
proposed. 886 However, upon further consideration, the Commission is concerned that this
language could unduly require a security-based swap to be reported if it had only the slightest
connection with the United States. Therefore, the Commission has decided to delete the phrase
“through any means of interstate commerce” from re-proposed Regulation SBSR. Instead, the
not be subject to public dissemination. In addition, certain security-based swaps that would
otherwise be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under Regulation SBSR
could qualify for substituted compliance. See Section XI.D, infra.

242

Commission is proposing to require reporting of a security-based swap that falls within the
definition of “transaction conducted within the United States,” which would describe more
precisely the nature of the activities in the United States that could result in a security-based
swap becoming subject to Regulation SBSR. The Commission generally believes that securitybased swaps that are solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked within the United States—by or
on behalf of either counterparty to the transaction, and regardless of the location, domicile, or
residence status of either counterparty to the transaction—generally should be subject to
Regulation SBSR.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(ii)—which would require regulatory reporting of any
security-based swap if there is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either side
of the transaction—embodies the principle in the initial proposal that a security-based swap,
wherever executed, must be reported if it has at least one counterparty that is a U.S. person. This
revised prong, however, also would apply the reporting requirement to any security-based swap,
wherever executed, that has at least one indirect counterparty 887 that is a U.S. person, even when
no direct counterparty is a U.S. person. The original proposal, because it did not include
guarantors as counterparties, would not have required regulatory reporting in such case. As
discussed above, the Commission now preliminarily believes that—to satisfy Congressional
intent that security-based swaps be subject to regulatory reporting, thereby informing the
Commission and other financial regulators of potential systemic risks—any security-based swap
having at least one direct counterparty that is a U.S. person should be reported. The Commission
also preliminarily believes that, because guarantees extended by U.S. persons create risk to the
U.S. financial system, regulatory reporting of security-based swaps should extend to any
security-based swap transaction in which one or both direct counterparties is guaranteed by a
U.S. person. In the absence of regulatory reporting of such security-based swaps, the
Commission’s ability to detect and analyze potentially significant sources of risk to the U.S.
financial system could be limited.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(iii) would, for reasons described above, require regulatory
reporting of any security-based swap executed by a security-based swap dealer or major securitybased swap participant, regardless of the entity’s place of domicile and regardless of the place of
execution.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(iv) would preserve the principle from the original proposal
that a security-based swap would be subject to regulatory reporting if it is cleared through a
clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States. 888 As noted in the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily believes that, if a securitybased swap is cleared by a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United
States, U.S. regulators should have access to information regarding the security-based swap
887

“Indirect counterparty” would be defined as “a guarantor of a direct counterparty’s performance
of any obligation under a security-based swap.” See re-proposed Rule 900(o) of Regulation
SBSR.

888

See Rule 908(a)(3) of Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed.

243

through a registered SDR. 889 This approach is premised on the view that, when a security-based
swap is cleared through a clearing agency, the initial transaction is novated and two new
transactions take its place, with the clearing agency becoming the seller to the buyer and the
buyer to the seller. If the clearing agency is located within the United States, the new
transactions necessarily would be executed within the United States. 890
While subparagraph (1) of re-proposed Rule 908(a) would address when a security-based
swap would be subject to regulatory reporting, subparagraph (2) would address when a securitybased swap would be subject to public dissemination. Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2) would
provide that a security-based swap shall be subject to public dissemination if:
(i) The security-based swap is a transaction conducted within the United States;
(ii) There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on each side of the
transaction;
(iii) At least one direct counterparty is a U.S. person (except in the case of a transaction
conducted through a foreign branch 891);
(iv) One side includes a U.S. person and the other side includes a non-U.S. person that is
a security-based swap dealer; or
(v) The security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States.
The Commission notes that Section 13(m)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act 892 “authorize[s] the
Commission to make security-based swap transaction and pricing data available to the public in
such form and at such times as the Commission determines appropriate to enhance price
discovery.” Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2) reflects the Commission’s revised preliminary
determination regarding an appropriate way to enhance price discovery in the U.S. market for
security-based swaps. As noted below, since issuing the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release,
the Commission has obtained and analyzed more extensive data regarding the overlap between
the U.S. market and the global market for security-based swaps. 893 These data suggest that a
vast majority of security-based swap transactions directly involved at least one non-U.S.

domiciled counterparty. 894 Furthermore, these transactions frequently may be conducted with
one direct counterparty located in one jurisdiction with the other direct counterparty located in
another jurisdiction, further suggesting that no easy distinction can be made between the U.S.
market and foreign or global markets. The Commission is concerned that limiting the
application of Title VII’s public dissemination requirement only to transactions that are wholly
conducted within the United States or to transactions where both direct counterparties are U.S.
persons would significantly reduce the potential benefits of post-trade transparency in the
security-based swap market. The Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release
that, “[b]y reducing information asymmetries, post-trade transparency has the potential to lower
transaction costs, improve confidence in the market, encourage participation by a larger number
of market participants, and increase liquidity in the [security-based swap] market.” 895 The
Commission also noted that, “[i]n other markets, greater post-trade transparency has increased
competition among market participants and reduced transaction costs.” 896
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2) eliminates use of the term ‘interstate commerce” and instead
incorporates the new concept of “transaction conducted within the United States,” which is being
used throughout the Commission’s proposed Title VII cross-border rules, to help delineate
precisely the types of security-based swap transactions that would be subject to public
dissemination under Regulation SBSR. Furthermore, re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2) is designed to
achieve the goal of improving the transparency, fairness, and efficiency of the U.S. securitybased swap market, as reflected in Section 13(m)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act. Re-proposed Rule
908(a)(2) also is designed, as far as practicable, to minimize competitive disparities that might
result under the proposed public dissemination regime, as well as to minimize incentives for
market participants to structure their operations for the purpose of evading Regulation SBSR. 897
Each individual subparagraph of re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2) is discussed below.

897

We preliminarily believe that the proposed approach with respect to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination is not being applied to persons who are “transact[ing] a business in securitybased swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States,” within the meaning of Section 30(c).
See Sections II.B.2(a) - II.B.2(d), supra. However, the Commission also preliminarily believes
that the proposed approach with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination is
necessary or appropriate to help prevent the evasion of the particular provisions of the Exchange
Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act that are being implemented by the approach and
prophylactically will help ensure that the purposes those provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are
not undermined. See Section II.B.2(e), supra; see also Section II.B.2(d), supra.
For example, if the reporting requirements do not apply to transactions among non-U.S. persons
that receive guarantees from U.S. persons and foreign branches of U.S. banks, then U.S. persons
would have an incentive to evade the reporting requirements by conducting transactions with
other U.S. persons through guaranteed foreign affiliates or foreign branches. Altering the form of

245

Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(i), similar to re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1)(i), generally would
preserve the principle from the original proposal that a security-based swap would be subject to
public dissemination if it were executed in the United States. 898 That concept has been
integrated into the new term “transaction conducted within the United States,” which also is
being used in the Commission’s other Title VII proposals.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(ii) would provide that a security-based swap would be
subject to public dissemination if there is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on
each side of the transaction. Under the initial proposal, a security-based swap involving two
non-U.S. person direct counterparties, but where each direct counterparty is guaranteed by a U.S.
person, would not be required to be publicly disseminated. The Commission now preliminarily
believes that, where U.S. persons have an interest on both sides of the transaction, even if
indirectly, the transaction generally should be viewed as part of the U.S. security-based swap
market and, as such, should be subject to Title VII’s public dissemination requirement.
Moreover, to the extent that U.S. persons might be incented to structure their trading operations
through guaranteed foreign subsidiaries to avoid public dissemination that otherwise would
apply to trades executed between U.S. person direct counterparties, the Commission seeks to
minimize that incentive by re-proposing Rule 908(a)(2)(ii) to require public dissemination of a
security-based swap transaction if a U.S. person is present on each side, whether directly or
indirectly.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iii) would provide that a security-based swap would be
subject to public dissemination if at least one direct counterparty is a U.S. person (except in the
case of a transaction conducted through a foreign branch 899). This prong generally
reincorporates the original proposal’s approach that a security-based swap executed anywhere in
the world and having just one U.S. person counterparty would be subject to public dissemination.
The Commission generally believes that a security-based swap transaction having even just one
U.S. person direct counterparty generally should be viewed as part of the U.S. security-based
swap market and, as such, should be subject to Title VII’s public dissemination requirement.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the benefits of requiring public dissemination of all
security-based swaps involving at least one U.S. person direct counterparty would inure to other
U.S. persons that transact in the same or similar instruments.

the transaction in this manner would allow U.S. persons to continue to avail themselves of
transparency in the U.S. security-based swap market while themselves evading the requirements
intended to enhance that transparency, even though the substance of the transaction remains
unchanged.

Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75239-40.

899

The term “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” would be defined in re-proposed Rule
900(hh) of Regulation SBSR to cross-reference the definition of that term in proposed Rule
3a71-3(a)(4) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section III.B.7 above.

246

However, re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iii) would provide a limited exception to the
general rule that any transaction involving a U.S. person direct counterparty would be subject to
public dissemination; re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iii) would not apply if the transaction is
conducted through a foreign branch. 900 The Commission is concerned that, if it did not take this
approach, non-U.S. market participants might avoid entering into security-based swaps with the
foreign branches of U.S. banks so as to avoid their security-based swaps being publicly
disseminated. The Commission notes that registration with the local regulatory authority to
engage in banking business is inherent in the proposed definition of “foreign branch.” This
approach would restrict the proposed exception to public dissemination for transactions
conducted through a foreign branch. 901 The Commission further notes that the proposed
exclusion for transactions conducted through a foreign branch is equivalent to the proposed
approach for transactions conducted by foreign affiliates that are guaranteed by a U.S. person. In
the case of a security-based swap transaction executed outside the United States between a nonU.S. person and either the guaranteed foreign affiliate or the foreign branch of the U.S. bank, reproposed Rule 908(a)(2) would not require public dissemination of the transaction. Re-proposed
Rule 908(a)(2)(iii) would not require public dissemination if the transaction were conducted
through a foreign branch. Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(ii) would not require public
dissemination if the only U.S. person involved in the transaction were the U.S. person providing
the guarantee.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iv) would provide that a security-based swap would be
subject to public dissemination if one side includes a U.S. person and the other side includes a
non-U.S. person that is a security-based swap dealer, as defined in Section 3(a)(71) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission notes that re-proposed
Rule 908(a)(2)(ii) would require public dissemination of a transaction if both sides include a U.S.
person. Under re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iv), however, public dissemination would be required
when only one side includes a U.S. person, provided the other side includes a non-U.S. person
security-based swap dealer. The Commission preliminarily believes that both types of
transaction generally should be considered part of the U.S. security-based swap market and, as
such, should be subject to Title VII’s public dissemination requirement. As the Commission has
previously stated, post-trade transparency of security-based swap transactions would reduce
information asymmetries and could have the potential to lower transaction costs, improve
confidence in the market, encourage participation by a larger number of market participants, and
increase liquidity in the security-based swap market. 902 Post-trade transparency of security900

However, a security-based swap having a direct counterparty that is a foreign branch could be
subject to public dissemination for other reasons—e.g., if the transaction included a U.S. person
on the other side. See re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR.

901

Thus, for example, a security-based swap involving a U.S. person that sends staff to a foreign
country to negotiate and execute the transaction but does not have a recognized foreign branch in
that country would be required to be publicly disseminated, and would not qualify for the
proposed exclusion in re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iii) for transactions conducted through a
foreign branch.

based swap transactions also has the potential to improve valuation models and thereby
contribute to more efficient capital allocation. 903 The Commission preliminarily believes that
not subjecting transactions between U.S. persons (whether directly or indirectly) or between a
U.S. person and a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer to post-trade transparency would
undermine these goals. The fact that both sides of the transaction include a U.S. person, or that
one side includes a U.S. person and the other side includes a person that conducts enough U.S.
business to warrant requiring it to register with the Commission, suggests that they are engaging
in the types of transactions that might be engaged in by other U.S. persons or others who are
required to register with the Commission. Furthermore, in the absence of re-proposed Rule
908(a)(2)(iv), a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer could encourage foreign affiliates
that are guaranteed by a U.S. parent to transact business with it outside the United States in order
to evade the public dissemination requirement. 904 If re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iv) applied, all
transactions between a security-based swap dealer (regardless of whether it is a U.S. person) and
a U.S. person (whether as a direct or indirect counterparty), would be required to be publicly
disseminated, regardless of where such transactions are conducted. Finally, the Commission
notes that Section 13(m)(1)(D) of the Exchange Act gives the Commission authority to require
registered entities—such as security-based swap dealers—regardless of whether or not they are
U.S. persons, to publicly disseminate security-based swap transaction and pricing data.
However, the Commission notes that re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2) would not require
public dissemination of a security-based swap transacted outside the United States between two
non-U.S. persons that are security-based swap dealers (assuming that neither side is guaranteed
by a U.S. person). Non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers are likely to have significant
operations in foreign security-based swap markets. A transaction between two such non-U.S.
person security-based swap dealers conducted outside the United States is less likely than a
transaction conducted within the United States or a transaction involving a U.S. person on the
other side to affect the U.S. security-based swap market. Therefore, the Commission is not
proposing to require public dissemination of transactions conducted outside the United States
between two non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(v) would preserve the principle from the original proposal
that a security-based swap would be subject to public dissemination if it is cleared through a
clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States. 905 As noted in the
903

See id. at 75267-68.

904

The Commission notes that re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iii) of Regulation SBSR would require
public dissemination if only one direct counterparty is a U.S. person, regardless of the status,
nationality, or place of domicile of the other direct counterparty. Thus, re-proposed Rule
908(a)(2)(iii) already would require public dissemination in the case of a security-based swap
between a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer and a U.S. person direct counterparty. Reproposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iv) of Regulation SBSR would, in addition, require public dissemination
in the case of a security-based swap between a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer and a
U.S. person indirect counterparty.

905

See Rule 908(a)(3) of Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed.

248

Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily believes that, if non-U.S.
persons determined to clear a security-based swap transaction through a clearing agency having
its principal place of business in the United States, this suggests that the clearing agency has
made the security-based swap eligible for clearing because at least some U.S. counterparties
might wish to trade the security-based swap as well. 906 The Commission preliminarily believes,
therefore, that requiring public dissemination of the security-based swap transaction would
promote price discovery for market participants in the United States and elsewhere. 907
A security-based swap transaction would need to meet only one prong of re-proposed
Rule 908(a)(2) to trigger the public dissemination requirement. For example, assume a securitybased swap is solicited, negotiated, executed, and cleared in London between (A) the London
branch of a U.S. financial institution and (B) a London-based firm (i.e., a non-U.S. person) that
has registered with the Commission as a security-based swap dealer. Re-proposed Rule
908(a)(2)(i) would not apply, because the transaction is not conducted within the United States.
Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(v) would not apply, because the security-based swap is not cleared
in the United States. Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(ii) would not apply, because there is not a
direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on both sides of the transaction. Re-proposed
Rule 908(a)(2)(iii) would not apply because neither side includes a direct counterparty that is a
U.S. person that would trigger public dissemination; here, the U.S. person direct counterparty is
acting through a foreign branch, which is carved out of re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2)(iii).
However, this transaction would be subject to public dissemination under re-proposed Rule
908(a)(2)(iv): one side includes a U.S. person (in this case, the London branch of the U.S. bank)
and the other side includes a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer. The result would be
the same if, instead of a London branch of a U.S. financial institution, one of the direct
counterparties were the London-based affiliate of a U.S. person that guarantees the performance
of the London subsidiary (i.e., the transaction is between, on one side, a security-based swap
dealer and, on the other side, an indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person).

2. Revisions to Proposed Rule 908(b)

In the initial proposal, the Commission explained when duties would be imposed on nonU.S. person counterparties of security-based swaps when some connection to the United States
might be present. Rule 908(b), as initially proposed, provided that no duties would be imposed
on a counterparty unless one of the following conditions were true:
•

The counterparty is a U.S. person;

•

The security-based swap is executed in the United States or through any means of
interstate commerce; or

•

The security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States.

Under the initial proposal, if none of these conditions were true, a foreign counterparty “would
not become a ‘participant’ of an SDR and would not become subject to proposed Regulation
SBSR” 908—even if the security-based swap itself and its counterparty were subject to Regulation
SBSR.
In light of other revisions being made to Regulation SBSR discussed above, the
Commission is now proposing several conforming revisions to proposed Rule 908(b). First,
consistent with the other revisions described above, Rule 908(b) is being re-proposed to account
for the possibility that a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant could incur a duty to report. Second, consistent with the broader conceptual
framework set forth in this release, the “interstate commerce clause,” used in the initial proposal
to describe a security-based swap that may generate reporting duties for counterparties under
Regulation SBSR, 909 is being replaced with the new concept of a “transaction conducted within
the United States” that is being used throughout the Commission’s proposed cross-border
rules. 910 Therefore, re-proposed Rule 908(b) would provide that a direct or indirect counterparty
to a security-based swap would not incur any obligation under Regulation SBSR unless the
counterparty were:

Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the re-proposed Rule 908(b),
including the following:
•

Do you agree with the removal of the “interstate commerce clause” contained in
Rules 908(a)(2) and 908(b)(2), as originally proposed, and its replacement with the
new concept of “transaction conducted within the United States”? Does this new
concept provide additional clarity? If not, what alternative formulations of the
concept should the Commission consider, and why? Please be specific.

D. Modifications to “Reporting Party” Rules and Assigning Duty to Report
The Commission also is re-proposing aspects of Regulation SBSR that would specify
who must report the security-based swap. Rule 900, as initially proposed, would define
“reporting party” as “the counterparty to a security-based swap with the duty to report
information in accordance with [Regulation SBSR] to a registered security-based swap data
repository, or if there is no registered security-based swap data repository that would receive the
information, to the Commission.” Because the Commission is now proposing to extend the
reporting requirement to security-based swaps executed outside the United States if the
performance of one or both direct counterparties under the security-based swap is guaranteed by
a U.S. person, 912 the Commission also is re-proposing the rules that would assign the duty to
report in a number of ways. Overall, these revisions are designed to assign the responsibility to
911

In addition, the Commission is re-proposing the definition of the term “participant” in Rule 900 to
make changes conforming to re-proposed Rule 908(b) of Regulation SBSR. The term
“participant” was designed to include any counterparty to a security-based swap that might incur
duties under Regulation SBSR. Rule 906(a) of Regulation SBSR, as proposed and re-proposed,
would impose certain duties on participants other than those required to initially report the
transaction. The originally proposed definition of “participant” would track proposed Rule
908(b) and include a U.S. person that is a counterparty to a security-based swap that is required to
be reported to a registered SDR, or a non-U.S. person that is a counterparty to a security-based
swap that is: (i) required to be reported to a registered SDR; or (ii) executed in the United States
or through any means of interstate commerce, or cleared through a clearing agency having its
principal place of business in the United States. As re-proposed, “participant” would be defined
simply as “a person that is a counterparty to a security-based swap that meets the criteria of [Rule
908(b)].” This would include both direct and indirect counterparties.

912

The Commission notes that, under both the initial and current proposals, security-based swaps
would be subject to Regulation SBSR if they are executed within the United States, regardless of
who the counterparties are or whether they are guaranteed by U.S. persons.

252

report a security-based swap transaction to persons that the Commission preliminarily believes
have greater capacity to fulfill that responsibility, and in a manner consistent with the reporting
hierarchy set forth in Section 13A(a)(3) of the Exchange Act. 913
First, the Commission is revising the proposed term “reporting party” to “reporting side.”
A “side” would be defined in new paragraph (ee) of re-proposed Rule 900 to mean “a direct
counterparty and any indirect counterparty.” “Reporting side” would be defined as “the side of a
security-based swap having the duty to report information in accordance with §§ 242.900-911 to
a registered security-based swap data repository, or if there is no registered security-based swap
data repository that would receive the information, to the Commission.” Under this formulation,
if a side has the duty to report a security-based swap transaction, any counterparty on that side—
direct or indirect—would have responsibility for carrying out the reporting obligation. The
Commission preliminarily believes that it would be impractical and unnecessarily complicated to
attempt to assign the reporting duty to either the direct or indirect counterparty specifically, and
is instead proposing to assign the duty to the side jointly. 914
Furthermore, the Commission is revising our proposed approach to assigning the
reporting duty to minimize consideration of the domicile of the counterparties, and to focus more
on their status (i.e., whether or not a counterparty is a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant). The initial proposal laid out three scenarios for assigning the
reporting duty: both direct counterparties are U.S. persons, only one direct counterparty is a U.S.
person, and neither direct counterparty is a U.S. person. 915 The definition of “U.S. person”—as
proposed and re-proposed—does not include a security-based swap dealer or major securitybased swap participant that is organized under the laws of a foreign jurisdiction and has its
principal place of business outside the United States, even though it is a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant under Title VII. Thus, under the initial proposal,
for a security-based swap between (A) an end user or other counterparty that is a U.S. person and
is not a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant (a “non-registered
U.S. counterparty”) and (B) a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant that is a non-U.S. person, the non-registered U.S. counterparty would have been the
reporting party.
Several commenters argued that this requirement would unfairly place the reporting
913

15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(3). Section 13A(a)(3) of the Exchange Act assigns to specific kinds of
counterparties the duty to report uncleared security-based swaps to an SDR or to the Commission.

914

The Commission anticipates that the direct counterparty and any indirect counterparty on the
reporting side would decide which of them would carry out the duty to report the transaction.
Alternately, the direct and indirect counterparties on the reporting side could elect to have a third
party carry out the duty to report on their behalf, although the direct and indirect counterparties
on the reporting side—not the agent—would incur legal liability for the agent’s failure to report
the transaction in a timely and complete manner.

Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75211.

253

burden on the non-registered U.S. counterparty. These commenters generally argued that, due to
their status as security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, even
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants that are not U.S. persons
have greater technological capability than non-registered U.S. counterparties to carry out the
reporting function. 916 These commenters generally maintained that non-registered U.S.
counterparties would incur significant costs to build the systems necessary to report securitybased swaps. 917 Certain commenters noted the unequal treatment and potential consequences
that could result if non-registered U.S. counterparties incurred the reporting obligation for
security-based swaps that they entered into with non-U.S. security-based swap dealers and nonU.S. major security-based swap participants. 918 One commenter specifically recommended that
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants that are not U.S. persons
be subject to the same regulatory reporting responsibilities as security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants that are U.S. persons, when transacting with nonregistered U.S. counterparties. 919
The Commission generally agrees with these arguments. The Commission preliminarily
believes that non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants, like U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants, have greater technological capability than non-registered U.S. persons to carry out
the reporting function. Furthermore, the Commission preliminarily sees no reason not to assign
the duty to report to non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants in appropriate circumstances. Although such entities are not U.S. persons, the fact
that they are security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants necessarily
implies that they have substantial contacts with the U.S. security-based swap market and thus
could incur significant regulatory duties arising from their U.S. business. Accordingly, the

participants that currently have the standardization necessary to report the required security-based
swap data); ISDA/SIFMA Letter I at 19; SIFMA Letter I at 3 (arguing that an end user should not
incur higher transaction costs or potential legal liabilities depending on the domicile of its
counterparty); Vanguard Letter at 6 (stating that non-U.S. security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants would be more likely to have appropriate systems in place to
facilitate reporting).

security-based swap dealers, thereby potentially reducing price competition).

254

Commission is re-proposing Rule 901(a) to provide that a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant that is not a U.S. person could incur the duty to report a securitybased swap in various cases. Re-proposed Rule 901(a) now provides as follows:
•

If both sides of the security-based swap include a security-based swap dealer, the
sides would be required to select the reporting side.

•

If only one side of the security-based swap includes a security-based swap dealer, that
side would be the reporting side.

•

If both sides of the security-based swap include a major security-based swap
participant, the sides would be required to select the reporting side.

•

If one side of the security-based swap includes a major security-based swap
participant and the other side includes neither a security-based swap dealer nor a
major security-based swap participant, the side including the major security-based
swap participant would be reporting side.

•

If neither side of the security-based swap includes a security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant: (i) if both sides include a U.S. person or
neither side includes a U.S. person, the sides would be required to select the reporting
side; and (ii) if only one side includes a U.S. person, that side would be the reporting
side.

Re-proposed Rule 901(a)(2) would preserve the reporting hierarchy of proposed Rule
901(a), while additionally taking into account the possibility that a direct counterparty to a
security-based swap might have a guarantor that is better suited for carrying out the reporting
duty. Thus, the newly proposed approach set forth in re-proposed Rule 901(a) looks to the status
of each person on a side (i.e., whether it is a security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant), not the status of only the direct counterparties. Under the initial proposal, if a
non-U.S. person were a direct counterparty to a security-based swap executed outside the United
States, that non-U.S. person would under no circumstances have had a duty to report the
security-based swap, even if it were guaranteed by a U.S. person or if it were a security-based
swap dealer or major security-based swap participant. The Commission is now proposing to
refocus the reporting duty primarily on the status of the counterparties, rather than on their
nationality or place of domicile.
Under re-proposed Rule 901(a), the only time that the domicile of the counterparties
could determine who must report is if neither side includes a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant. In such case, if one side includes a U.S. person while the other
side does not, the side with the U.S. person would be the reporting side. Similar to the initial
proposal, however, if both sides include a U.S. person or neither side includes a U.S. person, the
sides would be required to select the reporting side.
These proposed revisions to Regulation SBSR are designed to more efficiently align the
duty to report with the entities that the Commission preliminarily believes are best suited to
carrying out that duty. The Commission has previously noted that it “understands that many
255

reporting parties already have established linkages to entities that may register as SDRs, which
could significantly reduce the out-of-pocket costs associated with establishing the reporting
function.” 920 These proposed revisions also are designed to minimize the burdens faced by nonregistered U.S. counterparties that might enter into security-based swaps with non-U.S. person
security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants, as well as to clarify and
simplify the reporting rules more generally.
The following examples explain the operation of re-proposed Rule 901(a).
•

Example 1. A non-registered U.S. counterparty executes a security-based swap with
a security-based swap dealer that is a non-U.S. person. Neither side has a guarantor.
The security-based swap dealer would be the reporting side.

•

Example 2. Same facts as Example 1, except that the non-registered U.S.
counterparty is guaranteed by a security-based swap dealer. Because both sides
include a person that is a security-based swap dealer, the sides would be required to
select which is the reporting side.

•

Example 3. A security-based swap is executed in London between a foreign
subsidiary of a U.S. person and a French hedge fund. The performance of the foreign
subsidiary is guaranteed by its U.S. parent, a major security-based swap participant.
The side consisting of the major security-based swap participant and its foreign
subsidiary would be the reporting side.

•

Example 4. The New York branch of a German bank executes, in New York, a
security-based swap with the New York branch of a Brazilian bank. Neither foreign
bank is a security-based swap dealer or a major security-based swap participant and
neither direct counterparty is guaranteed by a U.S. person. The sides must select
which would be the reporting side.

•

Example 5. A U.S. hedge fund executes a security-based swap in London with a
foreign bank that is registered as a dealer in its home jurisdiction, but is not a
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant under Title VII.
Neither direct counterparty is guaranteed by a U.S. person. The U.S. hedge fund
would be the reporting side, because its side includes the only U.S. person.

counterparties? Please be specific.

obligations? Would additional examples be helpful? If so, please provide specific
examples that should be addressed by the Commission.

E. Other Technical and Conforming Changes
In connection with the new provisions of re-proposed Regulation SBSR discussed above,
the Commission is proposing to make various minor technical and conforming changes to other
parts of the regulation. These changes are described below.
Rule 902(a), as initially proposed, would require a registered SDRs to publicly
disseminate a transaction report of any security-based swap immediately upon receipt of
information about the security-based swap, except in the case of a block trade. Re-proposed
Rule 908, however, contemplates situations where a security-based swap would be required to be
reported to a registered SDR but not publicly disseminated. 921 Therefore, the Commission is re921

This could occur in the case of a security-based swap between (i) a foreign branch of a U.S. bank,
a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer, or a non-U.S. person that has a guarantee from a

257

proposing Rule 902(a) to provide that a registered SDR would not have an obligation to publicly
disseminate a transaction report for any such security-based swap.
Similarly, Rule 910(b)(4), as initially proposed, would provide that, in Phase 4 of the
Regulation SBSR compliance schedule, “[a]ll security-based swaps reported to the registered
security-based swap data repository shall be subject to real-time public dissemination as
specified in § 242.902.” As noted above, under the re-proposal of Rule 908, certain securitybased swaps would be subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination requirements.
Therefore, the Commission is re-proposing Rule 910(b)(4) to provide that, “All security-based
swaps received by the registered security-based swap data repository shall be treated in a manner
consistent with §§ 242.902, 242.905, and 242.908.” 922
In addition, the Commission is proposing certain changes to proposed Rules 901(c) and
901(d), which address the data elements to be reported to a registered SDR, to reflect that, under
the re-proposal, certain security-based swaps may be subject to regulatory reporting but not
public dissemination. Rule 901(c), as initially proposed, was titled “Information to be reported
in real time.” Under Rule 902(a), as originally proposed, the registered SDR to which such
information was reported would be required to promptly disseminate to the public such
information (except in the case of a block trade). However, the Commission preliminarily
believes that, if a security-based swap were subject to regulatory reporting but not public
dissemination, there is no need to require that information about the security-based swap be
reported in real time. Therefore, the introductory language to Rule 901(c) is being re-proposed
as follows: “For any security-based swap that must be publicly disseminated pursuant to §§
242.902 and 242.908 and for which it is the reporting side, the reporting side shall report the
following information in real time. If a security-based swap is required by §§ 242.901 and
242.908 to be reported but not publicly disseminated, the reporting side shall report the following
information no later than the time that the reporting side is required to comply with paragraph (d)
of this section.” In addition, re-proposed Rule 901(c) would be retitled “Primary trade
information,” thus eliminating the reference to real-time reporting—since the information
required to be reported under Rule 901(c) would no longer in all cases be required to be reported
in real time. Furthermore, re-proposed Rule 901(d) would be retitled “Secondary trade

U.S. person, and (ii) a non-U.S. person that is not guaranteed by a U.S. person; and further
provided that neither side solicits, negotiates, executes, books, or submits to clear the transaction
within the United States. See Section VIII.C, supra.
922

Re-proposed Rules 902 and 908 of Regulation SBSR, when read together, would provide that
certain security-based swaps reported to a registered SDR would not be publicly disseminated.
The Commission also is adding the reference to Rule 905 here to provide that, after Phase 4, a
registered SDR must publicly disseminate not only initial transaction reports (consistent with reproposed Rules 902 and 908), but also corrected transaction reports (consistent with re-proposed
Rule 905).

258

information.” 923
The Commission also is re-proposing Rule 905(b)(2) to clarify that, if a registered SDR
receives corrected information relating to a previously submitted transaction report, it would be
required to publicly disseminate a corrected transaction report only if the initial security-based
swap were subject to public dissemination. 924
Rule 901(c)(10), as initially proposed, provided that the following data element would be
required to be reported: “If both counterparties to a security-based swap are security-based swap
dealers, an indication to that effect.” As the Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release: “Prices of transactions involving a dealer and a non-dealer are typically ‘allin’ prices that include a mark-up or mark-down, while interdealer transaction prices typically do
not. Thus, the Commission believes that requiring an indication of whether a [security-based
swap] was an interdealer transaction or a transaction between a dealer and a non-dealer
counterparty would enhance transparency by allowing market participants to more accurately
assess the reported price for a [security-based swap].” 925 The Commission is now re-proposing
Rule 901(c)(10) as follows: “If both sides of the security-based swap include a security-based
swap dealer, an indication to that effect.” The re-proposed rule would clarify that a securitybased swap dealer might be a direct or indirect counterparty to a security-based swap. The
Commission continues to believe that, in either case, a security-based swap having a securitybased swap dealer on each side could, all other things being equal, be priced differently than a
security-based swap having a security-based swap dealer on only one side. Therefore, the
Commission continues to believe that the existence of a security-based swap dealer on each side
should be reported to the registered SDR and made known to the public.
The Commission is re-proposing Rule 901(d)(1)(ii) to require reporting of the broker ID,
desk ID, and trader ID, as applicable, only of the direct counterparty on the reporting side. The
Commission preliminarily believes that it would be impractical and unnecessary to report such
data elements with respect to an indirect counterparty, as such elements might not be applicable
to an indirect counterparty. 926 Similarly, Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) is being re-proposed to require
reporting of a description of the terms and contingencies of the payment streams only of each
direct counterparty to the other. The Commission is including the word “direct” to avoid
extending Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) to indirect counterparty relationships, where payments generally
would not flow to or from an indirect counterparty.
923

In the original proposal, Rule 901(d) of Regulation SBSR was titled “Additional information that
must be reported.” This additional information would be for regulatory purposes only and would
not be publicly disseminated.

924

Re-proposed Rule 905(b)(2) of Regulation SBSR also substitutes the word “counterparties”—
which is a defined term in Regulation SBSR—for the word “parties,” which was used in the
initial proposal but was not a defined term.

925

Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75214.

926

An indirect counterparty typically would not have a desk or trader involved in the transaction, or
engage the services of a broker, in the same manner as a direct counterparty.

259

Proposed Rule 901(e) set forth provisions for reporting life cycle events of a securitybased swap. The basic approach set forth in proposed Rule 901(e) was that, generally, the
original reporting party of the initial transaction would have the responsibility to report any
subsequent life cycle event; this approach remains unchanged in the re-proposal. However, if the
life cycle event were an assignment or novation that removed the original reporting party, either
the new counterparty or the original counterparty would have to be the reporting party. Further,
Rule 901(e), as initially proposed, would provide that the new counterparty would be the
reporting party if it were a U.S. person, whereas the other counterparty would be the new
reporting party if the new counterparty were not a U.S. person.
However, as discussed above, the Commission is now proposing the concept of a
“reporting side,” which would include the direct and any indirect counterparty. Further, as
discussed above, the Commission is proposing that non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers
or major security-based swap participants would, in certain instances, incur a duty to report.
Thus, the Commission is re-proposing Rule 901(e) to provide that the duty to report would
switch to the other side only if the new side did not include a U.S. person (as in the originally
proposed rule) or a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
(references to which are being added to Rule 901(e)). The Commission preliminarily believes
that, if the new side includes a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant, the new side should retain the duty to report. This approach is designed to align
reporting duties with the market participants that the Commission preliminarily believes are
better suited to carrying them out because non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants likely have already taken significant steps to establish
and maintain the systems, processes and procedures, and staff resources necessary to report
security-based swaps currently. 927

by the registered security-based swap data repository [] be treated in a manner
consistent with §§ 242.902, 242.905, and 242.908”? Are there any alternative

Are there any other technical and conforming changes that the Commission should

F. Cross-Border Inter-Affiliate Transactions
Commenters raised concerns about applying Title VII reporting or dissemination
requirements to cross-border inter-affiliate security-based swaps. 928 One commenter argued that,
928

See Japanese Banks Letter at 5; Multiple Associations Letter IV at 11-12.

261

for a foreign entity registered as a bank holding company and subject to the consolidated
supervision of the Federal Reserve, the reporting of inter-affiliate transactions would be
superfluous because the Federal Reserve has “ample authority to monitor transactions among
affiliates.” 929 The second commenter expressed concern about duplicative or conflicting
regulation of inter-affiliate transactions. It stated that, for example, inter-affiliate security-based
swaps “could be required to be publicly reported in multiple jurisdictions, even though they are
not suitable for reporting in any jurisdiction.” 930 A third commenter argued that inter-affiliate
security-based swaps generally—not referencing cross-border inter-affiliate transactions in
particular—should not be subject to public dissemination requirements, stating that “public
reporting could confuse market participants with irrelevant information and raise the costs to
corporate groups of managing risk internally.” 931
The Commission preliminarily believes that regulatory reporting and public
dissemination serve different purposes and, while these two requirements are related, their
application to cross-border inter-affiliate transactions should be considered separately. The
Commission notes that the statutory provisions that require regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swap transactions state that “each” security-based swap shall be
reported; these statutory provisions do not by their terms distinguish such reporting based on
particular characteristics (such as being negotiated at arm’s length). Section 13A(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act 932 provides that each security-based swap that is not accepted for clearing shall be
subject to regulatory reporting. Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act 933 provides that each
security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be reported to a registered SDR, and
Section 13(m)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act 934 generally provides that transaction, volume, and
pricing data of security-based swaps shall be publicly disseminated. With respect to regulatory
reporting of cross-border inter-affiliate security-based swaps, the Commission preliminarily
believes that regulators should have ready access to information about the precise legal entities
that hold risk positions in all security-based swaps. While it is true that the Federal Reserve or
perhaps other regulators might exercise consolidated supervision over a group, this might not
provide regulators with current and specific information about security-based swap positions
taken by the group’s subsidiaries. As a result, it would likely be more difficult for the
Commission to conduct general market analysis or surveillance of market behavior, and could
create particular problems during a crisis situation when having accurate and timely information
about specific risk exposures could be crucial. Therefore, the Commission continues to believe
that each cross-border inter-affiliate security-based swap that otherwise satisfies any of the
criteria in re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1) should be subject to regulatory reporting.

With respect to public dissemination of cross-border inter-affiliate transaction data, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the analysis of this issue in the cross-border context is in
many ways similar to the analysis of dissemination of inter-affiliate transaction data in the
domestic context. In particular, many of the issues raised by commenters with respect to the
public dissemination of inter-affiliate transactions generally appear to be relevant whether a
transaction is conducted within the United States or conducted on a cross-border basis. These
general issues include a concern about information distortion, market confusion, and interference
with internal risk management of a corporate group.
First, commenters stated that inter-affiliate transactions—whether cross-border or not—
are typically risk transfers with no market impact. They believe that the market-facing
transactions already would have been publicly reported, so requiring that inter-affiliate
transactions also be publically reported would duplicate information already known to the public.
The commenters express the concern that such “double counting” would distort information that
is critical for price discovery and measuring liquidity, the depth of trading, and exposure to
swaps in the market. 935 They also believe that it would distort the establishment of regulatory
thresholds and analysis, as well as enforcement activities that require an accurate assessment of
the swaps market. 936
Second, commenters stated that affiliates often enter into an inter-affiliate transaction on
terms linked to an external trade being hedged, which they are concerned could create confusion
in the market if publicly reported. If markets move because of the external trade before the interaffiliate transaction is entered into on a SEF or reported as an off-exchange trade, market
participants could misconstrue the market’s true direction and depth simply because of the
disconnect in timing between the two offsetting trades. 937
Third, commenters stated that public dissemination of inter-affiliate transactions could
interfere with the internal risk management practices of a corporate group. For example, one
entity in a group may be better positioned to take on a certain type of risk, even though another
entity must, for unrelated reasons, actually enter into the transaction with an external
counterparty. Public disclosure of a transaction between affiliates could prompt other market
participants to act in a way that would prevent the corporate group from following through with
its risk management strategy by, for instance, causing adverse price movements in the market
that the risk-carrying affiliate would use to hedge. 938
Beyond these concerns regarding the public dissemination of inter-affiliate transactions,
commenters addressing the public reporting of cross-border inter-affiliate transactions focused
more generally on duplicative and conflicting regulations. Using public dissemination as an
example, one commenter stated that inter-affiliate security-based swaps “could be required to be

263

publicly reported in multiple jurisdictions, even though they are not suitable for reporting in any
jurisdiction.” 939 However, the Commission is not aware of any commenter proposing a
treatment of cross-border inter-affiliate transactions under public dissemination requirements that
differs substantively from proposals for the treatment of other inter-affiliate transactions.
The Commission has considered the issues raised by these commenters both with respect
to inter-affiliate transactions generally and in the cross-border context. The common thread of
the issues identified by commenters to date is that public dissemination should not be required
for a security-based swap that is undertaken to transfer the risk of an initial security-based swap
(between X and Y) to an affiliate (i.e., from X to XA) because it would have no price discovery
value or could even give market observers a false understanding of the nature of the
transaction. 940 The Commission acknowledges that the initial security-based swap between X
and Y likely would have more price discovery value than the subsequent inter-affiliate
transaction between X to XA, all else being equal. In this hypothetical, the initial transaction
presumably represents the mutual agreement of parties operating on an arm’s-length basis to
execute a trade at a particular price, while the latter transaction generally would not involve
negotiation of the terms, particularly as regards to price. It may not follow, however, that the
subsequent inter-affiliate transaction would have no price discovery value whatsoever,
particularly in a cross-border context where multiple public dissemination requirements may be
involved. Arguing that an inter-affiliate security-based swap has no price discovery value
appears to presuppose that the initial, arm’s-length security-based swap had been publicly
disseminated. This could be the case if the initial security-based swap were subject to the rules
of a jurisdiction having public dissemination requirements. 941 However, if the initial securitybased swap had not been publicly disseminated, public dissemination of the cross-border interaffiliate transaction, assuming it were subject to Rule 908(a)(2) of re-proposed Regulation
SBSR, 942 might be the only way for the market to obtain any pricing information about the series
of transactions. These circumstances could be present if the initial security-based swap were not
subject to the rules of a jurisdiction having public dissemination requirements. In this case,
public dissemination of the cross-border inter-affiliate transaction, assuming it were subject to
Rule 908(a)(2) of re-proposed Regulation SBSR, 943 might be the only way for the market to
obtain any pricing information about the series of transactions.
As described above, commenters also raised a general concern about the potential for
duplicative and conflicting regulation of cross-border inter-affiliate transactions. The

264

Commission is sensitive to these concerns both generally and in the context of public
dissemination. 944 The treatment of these issues in connection with public dissemination is not
dissimilar to their treatment in other contexts under Title VII, including the context of regulatory
reporting. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that the concern expressed by the
commenters should be addressed by the proposed substituted compliance policy and framework
discussed in detail below, as well as when the Commission considers the adopting release for
public dissemination, which the Commission anticipates will address the issue of dissemination
of inter-affiliate transactions. 945
In light of these considerations, the Commission preliminarily believes that cross-border
inter-affiliate security-based swaps should not be excluded from the public dissemination
requirements to the extent that inter-affiliate security-based swaps are not excluded as a general
matter. The Commission preliminarily believes that the considerations regarding whether or not
to exclude inter-affiliate cross-border security-based swaps from public dissemination on the
grounds that they could be misleading or have no price discovery value are similar to the
considerations regarding whether or not to exclude inter-affiliate security-based swaps generally.
Similarly, the Commission preliminarily believes that any steps short of exclusion that could be
taken to maximize the price discovery value that inter-affiliate cross-border security-based swaps
may have (while minimizing any concern that they might mislead the market) are similar to the
steps that could be taken with respect to inter-affiliate security-based swaps generally. Although
the Commission is not in this release re-proposing any provisions of Regulation SBSR regarding
the public dissemination of inter-affiliate security-based swaps generally (whether or not crossborder), 946 as previously stated, the Commission invites public comment on whether there are
specific concerns or reasons to support different treatment or analysis of public dissemination of
cross-border inter-affiliate transactions from the treatment or analysis of the same issue in the
domestic context, and, in particular, why cross-border inter-affiliate transactions may not be
suitable for public dissemination.
For example, the concerns about the potentially limited price discovery value of interaffiliate security-based swaps may be able to be addressed through the public dissemination of
relevant data that may be indicative of such limitations, rather than suppressing these
transactions entirely. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission proposed to
require a registered SDR to “publicly disseminate a transaction report of a security-based swap
immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap from a reporting

944

Duplicative and conflicting regulation is one of the considerations the Commission takes into
account in proposing the approach to application of Title VII requirements to security-based swap
transactions in the cross-border context. See Section II.C, supra.

945

See Section XI, infra.

party.” 947 As the Commission noted in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, “[t]he
transaction report that is disseminated would be required to consist of all the information
reported by the reporting party pursuant to proposed Rule 901(c).” 948 One of the data elements
enumerated in proposed Rule 901(c) would be “[i]f applicable, an indication that the transaction
does not accurately reflect the market.” 949 Such data element should send a message to the
market that the transaction was not conducted at arm’s length on the open market. 950 Market
participants could take such information into account when interpreting or analyzing the
publicly-disseminated inter-affiliate transaction pricing information.
As noted above, one commenter expressed concern that public dissemination of an interaffiliate transaction could interfere with the internal risk management of a corporate group by
causing adverse price movements in the market that the risk-carrying affiliate might use to
hedge. The commenter did not explain why the corporate group might be unable or might
choose not to hedge the risk when the initial transaction is executed, or why the impact of the
public dissemination of the subsequent inter-affiliate transaction might be different from the
impact of the public dissemination of the initial transaction. The Commission preliminarily
believes that, assuming that the corporate group does not hedge at the time the initial transaction
was executed, a concern about the potential impact of public dissemination of the inter-affiliate
transaction on the ability to hedge the position would be similar to the concern that commenters
have expressed generally about public dissemination of block trades. 951 This concern about a
potential impact of the public dissemination—either of the original transaction or the subsequent
inter-affiliate transaction—may be addressed by delayed dissemination instead of suppressing
dissemination of these transactions entirely. The broader issue of how to treat block trades,
including how to define what is a block trade, is one that the Commission continues to
947

See Rule 902(a) of Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed. If the SDR were closed when the
reporting party submitted its transaction report, the SDR would be required to publicly
disseminate the transaction report immediately upon re-opening. See id.

The Commission preliminarily disagrees with the commenter that argued that “inclusion of these
swaps in swaps market data will distort the establishment of position limits, analysis of open
interest, determinations of block trade thresholds and performance of other important regulatory
analysis, functions and enforcement activities that require an accurate assessment of the swaps
market.” Multiple Associations Letter IV at 11-12. Security-based swaps that have been
appropriately marked as inter-affiliate transactions also could be excluded from certain
aggregated market data, depending on the purpose for which those data are being used.

951

Specifically, if the corporate group hedges the initial transaction at the time of execution, there
would appear to be no need to hedge at the time of the inter-affiliate transaction, and thus no
concern about the impact of the dissemination of the inter-affiliate transaction on the market in
which the hedge is put on. Furthermore, if the corporate group chooses not hedge the position
until the time of the inter-affiliate transaction, the Commission questions why the concern about
the impact of the disclosure of that transaction would be different than a concern about the
dissemination of the original transaction.

266

evaluate. In addition, public dissemination of relevant data indicating the inter-affiliate nature of
the transaction separately may help address concerns about potential impact on markets on which
a hedge might if occur if such markets are made aware that there may be special considerations
that should be taken into account when assessing the extent to which the transaction may reflect
the current market.
Regulation SBSR would require registered SDRs, in their policies and procedures, to
enumerate the specific data elements of a security-based swap or life cycle event that would be
required to be reported, and to specify one or more acceptable data formats, connectivity
requirements, and other protocols for submitting information. 952 The Commission itself did not
propose to specify each data element that would have to be reported, but instead identified broad
categories of information that must be reported. 953 Furthermore, the Commission initially
proposed to require, in Rule 907(a)(4), that a registered SDR have policies and procedures
“[d]escribing how reporting parties shall report and, consistent with the enhancement of price
discovery, how the registered security-based swap data repository shall publicly disseminate . . .
security-based swap transactions that do not involve an opportunity to negotiate any material
terms, other than the counterparty; and any other security-based swap transactions that, in the
estimation of the registered security-based swap data repository, do not accurately reflect the
market.” 954 However, the Commission invites public comment on whether concerns about the
inter-affiliate security-based swaps not accurately reflecting the market can be addressed in the
policies and procedures of registered SDRs that would be required under re-proposed Rule
907(a)(4).
For example, such policies and procedures could be designed to maximize the price
discovery value of cross-border (or other) inter-affiliate security-based swaps and to minimize
their ability to mislead. These policies and procedures could require not only that reporting sides
mark whether a security-based swap is an inter-affiliate transaction, but also whether the initial
security-based swap was executed in a jurisdiction with public dissemination requirements. 955
Further, these policies and procedures also could require the reporting side to indicate the
approximate time when the initial security-based swap was executed. 956 This would permit
952

See Rules 907(a)(1) and 907(a)(2) of Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed.

953

For example, the Commission proposed to require the reporting of “[i]nformation that identifies
the security-based swap instrument”—see Rule 901(c)(2) of Regulation SBSR, as originally
proposed—but did not specify the exact manner in which such information must be reported,
instead proposing to allow SDRs discretion to set such specifications in their policies and
procedures. However, the Commission did propose to require reporting of certain discrete data
elements. See, e.g., Rule 901(d)(vi) of Regulation SBSR (requiring reporting of the name of the
clearing agency, if the security-based swap will be cleared).

954

Rule 907(a)(4) of Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed.

955

This could be either the United States or another jurisdiction that imposes post-trade transparency
requirements similar to those in re-proposed Regulation SBSR.

956

For example, there could be indicators for the initial security-based swap having been executed
within the past 24 hours, between one and seven days before, or longer than seven days before.

267

market observers to gauge how much price discovery value to assign to the price provided in the
inter-affiliate security-based swap transaction report that would be publicly disseminated under
Rule 902 of re-proposed Regulation SBSR. Information about an initial trade done less than 24
hours before (obtained indirectly from the later-appearing trade report of the inter-affiliate crossborder security-based swap) could have significant price discovery value, while information
from an initial trade executed over a week before could, all things being equal, have less. 957 The
Commission invites public comment on these approaches to the treatment of inter-affiliate
security-based swaps generally, as well as their relative advantages and disadvantages. In
particular, the Commission invites public comment on how these approaches would affect the
internal risk management practices of a corporate group. In addition, as previously stated, the
Commission invites public comment on whether there are specific concerns or reasons to support
different treatment or analysis of public dissemination of cross-border inter-affiliate transactions
from the treatment or analysis of the same issue in the domestic context.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on all aspects of issues regarding crossborder inter-affiliate security-based swaps, including the following:

957

•

Do you believe that cross-border inter-affiliate security-based swaps should be
excluded from the regulatory reporting requirements of Regulation SBSR? If so,
under what circumstances should such security-based swaps be excluded, and why?
What would be the harm of having such inter-affiliate security-based swaps reported
to a registered SDR? What are the risks of not requiring regulatory reporting of interaffiliate security-based swaps?

•

Do you believe that cross-border inter-affiliate security-based swaps should be
analyzed differently from domestic inter-affiliate security-based swaps? Why or why
not?

•

Do you believe that cross-border inter-affiliate security-based swaps should be
excluded from the public dissemination requirements of Regulation SBSR? Why or
why not? What are the risks or benefits of not requiring public dissemination of
inter-affiliate security-based swaps? How should the Commission balance these risks
and benefits?

•

Does your view about public dissemination for cross-border inter-affiliate securitybased swaps change depending on whether an initial, arm’s-length security-based
swap was executed and publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction having public
dissemination requirements? Why or why not? On what basis could or should the
Commission exclude the cross-border inter-affiliate security-based swap from the
public dissemination requirements if the initial, arm’s-length security-based swap was

However, even information about a trade done over a week ago (or more) could have price
discovery value for security-based swap instruments that trade infrequently.

268

executed and publicly disseminated in a jurisdiction having no public dissemination
requirements, or public dissemination requirements that are not comparable to those
in the United States?
•

Does your view on the application of regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements to inter-affiliate security-based swaps change if the affiliates are subject
to consolidated supervision? If so, please explain.

•

Can you suggest any additions to the policies and procedures of registered SDRs that
could maximize the price discovery value, and minimize any potentially misleading
aspects, of public trade reports of cross-border inter-affiliate security-based swaps? If
so, what are they? Should the Commission more clearly specify in Rule 907(a)(4)
how inter-affiliate security-based swaps should be publicly disseminated so as to
maximize their price discovery value and minimize their potential for misleading
market observers? If so, how?

•

Do you have any other concerns about public dissemination of cross-border interaffiliate security-based swaps so long as they are appropriately marked?

G. Foreign Privacy Laws versus Duty to Report Counterparty ID
Rule 901(d), as initially proposed, set forth the data elements that would constitute the
required regulatory report of a security-based swap (i.e., information for use only by regulators
that would not be included in the publicly disseminated report). One such element is the
“participant ID” of the counterparty. 958 The Title VII provisions relating to security-based swap
trade reporting and proposed Regulation SBSR that would implement those provisions
contemplate only one counterparty to a security-based swap having a duty to report. However,
the Commission preliminarily believes that being able to assess the positions and behavior of
both counterparties to the security-based swap would facilitate our ability to carry out our
regulatory duties for market oversight. 959 Because only one party would be required to report,
958

See Rule 901(d)(1)(i) of Regulation SBSR, as initially proposed. See also Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75217.

959

U.S. regulators have a strong interest in being able to monitor the risk exposures of U.S. persons,
particularly those involved in the security-based swap market, as the failure or financial distress
of a U.S. person could impact other U.S. persons and the U.S. economy as a whole. U.S.
regulators also have an interest in obtaining information about non-U.S. counterparties that enter
into security-based swaps with U.S. persons, as the ability of such non-U.S. counterparties to
perform their obligations under those security-based swaps could impact the financial soundness
of U.S. persons. See, e.g., S. Comm. on Banking, Hous., & Urban Affairs, The Restoring
American Financial Stability Act of 2010, S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 32 (“As a key element of
reducing systemic risk and protecting taxpayers in the future, protections must include
comprehensive regulation and rules for how the OTC derivatives market operates. Increasing the
use of central clearinghouses, exchanges, appropriate margining, capital requirements, and
reporting will provide safeguards for American taxpayers and the financial system as a whole”)
(emphasis added).

269

the only way to obtain the identity of the non-reporting party counterparty would be to require
the reporting party to disclose its counterparty’s identity. 960
Three comments on proposed Regulation SBSR cautioned that U.S. persons may be
restricted from complying with such a requirement in cases where a security-based swap is
executed outside the United States. 961 One commenter stated that the London branch of a U.S.
person would need its counterparty’s consent to identify that party under U.K. law. 962 The
commenter added that, under French law, consent is required each time a report is made
identifying the counterparty, and this restriction cannot be resolved by changes to the firm’s
terms of business. 963 Another commenter urged the Commission to “consider carefully and
provide for consistency with, foreign privacy laws, some of which carry criminal penalties for
wrongful disclosure of information,” 964 but did not provide further detail. A third commenter
argued that allowing substituted compliance when both parties are not domiciled in the United
States could avoid problems with foreign privacy laws conflicting with U.S. reporting
requirements. 965
The Commission seeks to understand more precisely if—and, if so, how—requiring a
counterparty to report the transaction pursuant to Regulation SBSR (including disclosure of the
counterparty’s identity to a registered SDR) might cause it to violate local law in a foreign
jurisdiction where it operates. Before determining whether any exception to reporting the
counterparty’s identity might be necessary or appropriate, the Commission seeks to obtain
additional information about any such foreign privacy laws.

960

Once the identity of the opposite counterparty to a security-based swap is known by a registered
SDR, the SDR would be required to obtain certain additional information from that counterparty.
See proposed Rule 906(a), which is not being revised by this re-proposal.

961

In addition, two comments on the Commission’s interim final temporary rule on the reporting of
security-based swaps entered into before July 21, 2010, Securities Exchange Act Release No.
63094 (Oct. 13, 2010), 75 FR 64643 (Oct. 20, 2010), made similar points. See Deutsche Bank
Letter at 5 (“In some cases, dissemination or disclosure of [counterparty] information could lead
to severe civil or criminal penalties for those required to submit information to an SDR pursuant
to the Interim Final Rules. These concerns are particularly pronounced because of the
expectation that Reportable Swap data will be reported, on a counterparty identifying basis, to
SDRs, which will be non-governmental entities, and not directly to the Commissions”); ISDA
Letter II at 6 (“In many cases, counterparties to cross-border security-based swap transactions
will face significant legal and reputational obstacles to the reporting of such information. Indeed,
disclosure of such information may lead to civil penalties in some jurisdictions and even criminal
sanctions in other jurisdictions”).

Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment on all aspects of issues relating to foreign
privacy laws with respect to proposed Regulation SBSR, including the following:
•

What jurisdictions have laws that might affect a reporting side’s ability to report the
participant ID of its counterparty? Please cite and describe specifically for each such
law: to whom such restrictions would apply and under what circumstances; how the
law might restrict reporting (e.g., what data elements that otherwise would be
required to be reported under Regulation SBSR would be restricted); whether any
exceptions under the law, particularly but not limited to consent provisions and
provisions relating to compliance with applicable law, might be available to a
reporting side that otherwise would be required to comply with re-proposed Rule
901(d)(1)(i), or explain why none of the exceptions would be available.

•

If no such exceptions are available under the local law and you believe that an
exception by rule from re-proposed Rule 901(d)(1)(i) would be appropriate, how
should that exception be crafted? Please suggest appropriate rule text.

•

How, if at all, would a substituted compliance regime for regulatory reporting avoid
problems with foreign privacy laws? Would the Commission and other U.S.
financial regulators be able to obtain information about security-based swap
counterparties from foreign trade repositories or foreign regulatory authorities to
which such transactions had been reported?

H. Foreign Public Sector Financial Institutions
Six commenters expressed concern about applying the requirements of Title VII to the
activities of FPSFIs, such as foreign central banks and multilateral development banks. 966 One
commenter, the European Central Bank (“ECB”), noted that security-based swaps entered into
by the Federal Reserve Banks are excluded from the CEA’s definition of “swap” 967 and that the
functions of foreign central banks and the Federal Reserve are broadly comparable. The ECB
argued, therefore, that security-based swaps entered into by foreign central banks should likewise
be excluded from the definition of “swap.” 968 A second commenter, the World Bank
966

See BIS Letter passim; CEB at 2, 4; ECB Letter passim; ECB Letter II passim; EIB Letter
passim; Nordic Investment Bank Letter at 1; World Bank Letter II passim.

967

Section 1a(47)(B)(ix) of the CEA excludes from the definition of swap any agreement, contract,
or transaction a counterparty of which is a Federal Reserve Bank, the Federal Government, or a
Federal agency that is expressly backed by the full faith and credit of the United States. A
security-based swap includes any swap, as defined in the CEA, that is based on, among other
things, a narrow-based index or a single security or loan. See Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c3(a)(68). See also Product Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 48208.

968

See ECB Letter I at 2; ECB Letter II at 2. See also EIB Letter at 1; Nordic Development Bank at
1.

271

(representing the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the International
Finance Corporation, and other multilateral development institutions of which the United States
is a member) also argued generally that the term “swap” should be defined to exclude any
transaction involving a multilateral development bank. 969 The World Bank further noted that the
EMIR—which is intended to serve as the E.U. counterpart to Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act—
would expressly exclude multilateral development banks from its coverage. 970
The ECB and BIS stated that foreign central banks enter into security-based swaps solely
in connection with their public mandates, which require them to act confidentially in certain
circumstances. 971 The ECB argued in particular that public disclosure of its market activities
could compromise its ability to take necessary actions and “could cause signaling effects to other
market players and finally hinder the policy objectives of such actions.” 972 Another commenter,
the Council of Europe Development Banks (“CEB”), while opposing application of Title VII
requirements to multilateral development banks generally, did not object to the CFTC and SEC
preserving their authority over certain aspects of swaps activity, including reporting
requirements. 973 Similarly, the World Bank believed that the definition of “swap” could be
qualified by a requirement that counterparties would treat such transactions as swaps solely for
reporting purposes. 974
The Commission preliminarily believes that security-based swaps to which an FPSFI is a
counterparty (“FPSFI trades”) should not, for that fact alone, be exempt from regulatory
reporting. 975 Under Regulation SBSR, as initially proposed, an FPSFI trade would be required to

See id. at 4. See also EIB Letter at 7 (“As a matter of comity, actions by U.S. financial regulators
should be consistent with the laws of other jurisdictions that provide exemption from national

See BIS Letter at 4-5; ECB Letter I at 3.

972

ECB Letter I at 3. See also ECB Letter II at 2.

973

See CEB Letter at 4. However, the CEB did not state a view as to whether FPSFI trades should
be subject to post-trade transparency.

974

See World Bank Letter II at 7.

975

The Commission notes that all FPSFIs, even FPSFIs that are based in the United States, would be
deemed non-U.S. persons under the Commission’s Title VII rules. See proposed Rule 3a713(a)(7)(ii) (“The term ‘U.S. person’ does not include the International Monetary Fund, the
International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, the Inter-American Development Bank,
the Asian Development Bank, the African Development Bank, the United Nations, and their
agencies, affiliates, and pension plans, and any other similar international organizations, their
agencies, affiliates, and pension plans”). See also Section III.B.5, supra (discussing proposed
definition of “U.S. person”). As with any other security-based swap transaction having a direct
counterparty that is a non-U.S. person, a transaction involving an FPSFI as a direct counterparty
would be subject to Regulation SBSR’s regulatory reporting requirements only if it met one of
the conditions in re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1), and would be subject to Regulation SBSR’s public
dissemination requirements only if it met one of the conditions in re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2).

272

be reported to a registered SDR if the counterparty were a U.S. person. The Commission
continues to believe that, if an FPSFI executes a security-based swap with a counterparty that is a
U.S. person, the security-based swap should be subject to regulatory reporting. Under reproposed Regulation SBSR, an FPSFI trade also would be required to be reported if the
counterparty were a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant. In either case, without a regulatory report of such security-based swaps, the
Commission would have an incomplete view of the risk positions held by security-based swap
market participants that are U.S. persons or registered with the Commission. Regulatory
reporting of such security-based swaps, despite the fact that an FPSFI is a counterparty, would
facilitate the Commission’s ability to carry out our regulatory oversight responsibilities with
respect to registered entities and the security-based swap market. The Commission notes that
this approach was endorsed by two commenters. 976
Furthermore, the Commission believes that, at this time, a sufficient basis does not exist
to support an exemption from public dissemination for FPSFI trades. The Commission
preliminarily understands that FPSFI participation in the security-based swap market—rather
than the swap market generally—may be limited. Comments submitted by FPSFIs generally
were addressed to both the Commission and the CFTC and addressed participation in the swap
market generally; it is unclear the extent to which these comments should be read to apply to the
security-based swap market. 977 Furthermore, to the extent that FPSFI trades are subject to public
dissemination under Regulation SBSR (e.g., because the direct counterparty is a U.S. person
other than a foreign branch of a U.S. bank), such trades could provide useful price discovery
information to other market participants.
The Commission is seeking more information with respect to the basis for the claim that
public dissemination of FPSFI trades, as contemplated by re-proposed Regulation SBSR, would
“hinder the policy objectives” 978 of FPSFIs. The Commission notes that proposed Regulation
SBSR contains provisions relating to public dissemination that are designed to protect the
identity of security-based swap counterparties 979 and prohibit a registered SDR (with respect to
uncleared security-based swaps) from disclosing the business transactions and market positions
of any person. 980 Furthermore, to the extent that an FPSFI trade is small enough not to constitute
a block trade, the Commission questions the extent to which market observers would be able to
distinguish the trade as having been conducted by an FPSFI. Given these provisions of
Regulation SBSR, which are designed to prevent adverse market impacts due to disclosure of a
counterparty’s identity or the public dissemination of a block trade, the Commission
976

See CEB Letter at 4; World Bank Letter II at 7 (stating that, although swaps involving FPSFIs as
counterparties generally should be exempt from the definition of “swap,” they should be treated
as swaps solely for reporting purposes).

977

But see BIS Letter at 3 (stating that the BIS generally does not transact security-based swaps such
as credit default swaps or equity derivatives).

preliminarily does not see a basis to exempt FPSFI trades from public dissemination. However,
the Commission is open to receiving further information that might support an exemption.
Request for Comment
As noted above, certain FPSFI commenters stated that carrying out their policy mandates
would require confidentiality in certain circumstances. 981 The Commission seeks additional
information to assist our analysis of this issue, and requests answers to the following questions.
In responding, please focus on the security-based swap market, not the market for other swaps.
In addition, commenters are requested to answer only with respect to security-based swap
activity that would be subject to Regulation SBSR, and not with respect to activity that, because
of the place where the transaction is conducted or the nationality of the counterparties, would not
be subject to Regulation SBSR in any case:

981

•

How many FPSFIs engage in security-based swap activity with U.S. persons? How
active are they in the security-based swap market generally?

•

What policy goals might an FPSFI be attempting to carry out by participating in the
security-based swap market?

•

What trading strategies might an FPSFI conduct in the security-based swap market?

•

Are there any characteristics of FPSFI activity in the security-based swap market that
could make it easier for market observers to detect an FPSFI as a counterparty, or that
could make it easier to detect an FPSFI’s business transactions or market positions?
If so, are there steps the Commission could take to minimize such information
leakage short of suppressing all FPSFI trades from public dissemination? If so, what
are they?

•

Do FPSFIs typically trade standardized or more bespoke security-based swap
instruments? If the former, would market observers be less likely to detect the
participation of an FPSFI in the security-based swap market?

•

What sizes do FPSFIs typically transact in? Does the size impact any concerns with
publicly disseminating FPSFI trades? If so, how? Could the concerns of FPSFIs be
addressed by crafting appropriate block thresholds and dissemination delays rather
than by suppressing all FPSFI trades from public dissemination? Why or why not?

•

Do you believe that FPSFI trades should be included in public dissemination? Why
or why not? To what extent, and how, would price transparency and market
efficiency be affected if FPSFI trades were suppressed from public dissemination?

See BIS Letter at 5; ECB Letter at 3.

I. Summary and Additional Request for Comment
The provisions of re-proposed Regulation SBSR discussed above represent the
Commission’s preliminary views regarding the application of Title VII’s provisions relating to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swap transactions in the crossborder context. This re-proposal reflects a particular balancing of the principles and applicable
requirements described above, 982 informed by, among other things, the particular nature of the
security-based swap market, the structure of security-based swap dealing activity, and the
Commission’s experience in applying the federal securities laws in the cross-border context. The
Commission recognizes that other approaches are possible and might more effectively achieve
the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act, in whole or in part. Accordingly, the Commission invites
comment regarding all aspects of re-proposed Regulation SBSR, and each re-proposed rule
contained therein, including potential alternative approaches. Data and comment from market
participants and other interested parties regarding the likely effect of each re-proposed rule and
potential alternative approaches will be particularly useful to the Commission in evaluating
possible modifications to the proposals.
The Commission requests comment on any other cross-border issues relating to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps that may not have been
addressed above. In particular, the Commission requests comment on how the Commission’s reproposal addressing cross-border issues related to regulatory reporting and public dissemination
might differ from the CFTC’s cross-border guidance on these matters. 983 For example, the
CFTC Cross-Border Proposal provides that a swap between two unregistered non-U.S. persons,
each of which is guaranteed by a U.S. person, would not be subject to regulatory reporting or
public dissemination requirements. 984 The Commission, on the other hand, is proposing that a
security-based swap between two such direct counterparties would be subject to both regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements. 985 Furthermore, the CFTC Cross-Border
Proposal provides that a swap between, on one side, an unregistered non-U.S. person that is
guaranteed by a U.S. person and, on the other side, an unregistered non-U.S. person that is not
guaranteed by a U.S. person also would not be subject to regulatory reporting or public
dissemination requirements. 986 The Commission is proposing that a security-based swap between
two such direct counterparties would be subject to regulatory reporting 987 (but, in accord with the
CFTC’s proposal, not subject to public dissemination). Please describe any other differences
that you believe might exist and what would be the impact of any such differences.

In addition, the Commission requests comment on the market impact of the approach to
re-proposed Regulation SBSR. For example, how would the application of re-proposed
Regulation SBSR affect the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in
the United States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would re-proposed Regulation SBSR
place any market participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain.
Would re-proposed Regulation SBSR be a more general burden on competition? If so, please
explain. What other measures should the Commission consider to implement re-proposed
Regulation SBSR?

IX.

Mandatory Security-Based Swap Clearing Requirement

A. Introduction
Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides that it “shall be unlawful for any person
to engage in a security-based swap unless that person submits such security-based swap for
clearing to a clearing agency that is registered under [the Exchange] Act or a clearing agency that
is exempt from registration under [the Exchange] Act if the security-based swap is required to be
cleared.” 988 In this section, we are proposing a rule to specify when persons engaging in crossborder security-based swap transactions would be required to comply with a mandatory clearing
determination. 989 Consistent with the approach we have taken elsewhere in this release, 990 the
proposed rule is designed in general to help ensure that the mandatory clearing requirement
applies to persons that engage in security-based swap transactions within the United States and
who may pose financial or operational risk to the U.S. financial system that may be mitigated by

988

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(a)(1). Section 3C of the Exchange Act further requires the Commission to
review each security-based swap (or any group, category, type, or class of security-based swaps)
to make a determination that such security-based swap (or group, category, type, or class of
security-based swap) should be required to be cleared. 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(b). The Commission has
adopted final rules regarding process for submissions for review of security-based swaps for
mandatory clearing and notice filing requirements for clearing agencies. See Clearing Procedures
Adopting Release, 77 FR 41602. The proposed application of the mandatory clearing
requirement in the cross-border context does not address, in any respect, our obligation to review
security-based swaps and make mandatory clearing determinations under Section 3C(b) of the
Exchange Act.

989

The mandatory clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act will not apply
unless and until the Commission makes a determination that a security-based swap is required to
be cleared, and the Commission has not yet made any such determinations. In addition, the
registration requirement for security-based swap clearing agencies in Section 17A(g) of the
Exchange Act is not yet effective because further rulemaking is required regarding registration of
and standards for security-based swap clearing agencies. See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(i) and (j). The
Commission recently adopted rules to establish minimum requirements for registered clearing
agency risk management practices and operations. The rules identify certain minimum standards
for all clearing agencies, including clearing agencies that clear security-based swaps. See
Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, 77 FR 66220. The Commission continues to
consider additional standards for adoption, including standards for confidentiality of trading
information, conflicts of interest, and members of clearing agency boards of directors or
committees, as outlined in the proposing release for clearing agency standards. See Exchange
Act Release No. 64017 (Mar. 3, 2011), 76 FR 14472 (Mar. 16, 2011). Any new rules governing
security-based swap clearing agencies could also affect counterparties that are required to clear
security-based swaps.

990

See, e.g., Section V, supra (discussing the registration requirement in Section 17A(g) of the
Exchange Act for security-based swap clearing agencies); see also the general discussion of the
Commission’s approach to applying Title VII to cross-border activities in Section II.B, supra.

277

requiring transactions to be centrally cleared. 991 The proposed rule also is designed to help avoid
limiting the access of U.S. persons that conduct security-based swap activity through foreign
branches or guaranteed non-U.S. persons to foreign security-based swap markets. To address
concerns regarding the clearance and settlement of security-based swaps subject to the
mandatory clearing requirement, as well as the potential for conflicting mandatory clearing
requirements in different jurisdictions, we discuss under what circumstances the Commission
would permit substituted compliance with the mandatory clearing requirement in Section XI.E
below. 992
Our proposed approach reflects a particular balancing of the principles discussed
above.
We recognize that other approaches may achieve the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act and
Section 17A of the Exchange Act, in whole or in part. Accordingly, we invite comment
regarding all aspects of the proposed rule described here, including potential alternative
approaches. Data and comment from market participants and other interested parties regarding
the likely effect of the proposed rule and of potential alternative approaches will be particularly
useful to the Commission in evaluating potential modifications to the proposal.

Derivatives Market Before the Subcomm. on Secs., Ins., & Inv., of the S. Comm. on Banking,

Commission), available at: http://www.sec.gov/news/testimony/2008/ts070908jao.htm (“The
1975 Amendments [to the Exchange Act] were in direct response to the Paperwork Crisis of the
late 1960's that nearly brought the securities industry to a standstill and directly or indirectly
resulted in the failure of large numbers of broker-dealers. The causes of the Paperwork Crisis are
similar to the issues that we have been trying to resolve in the OTC derivatives market. The crisis
resulted from a combination of sharply increased volume and inattention to securities processing.
As a result, the industry's clearance and settlement procedures were inefficient and lacked
automation, thus implicating the finances of the securities firms. Today, almost forty years later,
increasing automation in the processing of OTC derivatives transactions is one of the key goals of
the OTC confirmations initiative, in which the Commission is a very active participant . . . .”); see

importance of “operational reliability” to “safe and efficient clearing and settlement” as the
“market infrastructure moves further in the direction of centralised processing of trades and posttrade events”).

Under the Commission’s proposal, substituted compliance may be permitted for cross-border
security-based swap transactions subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in Section
3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act to enable counterparties to clear and settle such transactions at a
clearing agency that is neither registered with the Commission nor exempt from registration,
under certain conditions. See Section XI.E, infra.

B. Summary of Comments
The Commission has published several rulemaking proposals under Title VII of the
Dodd-Frank Act that relate to clearing security-based swaps. 994 The Commission solicited
public comment on each of these proposals. The Commission also solicited public comment on
regulatory initiatives under the Dodd-Frank Act related to clearing security-based swaps. 995
Generally, these commenters requested that the Commission take actions to limit duplicative or
conflicting regulations with respect to clearing security-based swaps. 996

See, e.g., Davis Polk Letter I at 8 (“First, requiring foreign swap transactions to be cleared
through a U.S.-regulated clearinghouse may conflict with any applicable foreign law that requires
such transactions to be cleared at a home country (non-U.S.) clearinghouse. Second, such an
approach would also legally compel a disproportionate amount of global swaps clearing to be
conducted through U.S.-regulated clearinghouses. Third, such a requirement would also
concentrate risk that is non-U.S. (because the transactions are with non-U.S. persons) in the U.S.regulated clearinghouses, which would cause them and the U.S. financial system to bear
additional non-U.S. risks.”); Davis Polk Letter II at 21-22 (proposing rule modifications that
“would avoid imposing unnecessarily duplicative and inconsistent clearing and trade reporting
obligations on swap dealers and their counterparties”); Cleary Letter IV at 27 (noting swaps
between non-U.S. persons “are, in many cases, likely to be subject to local clearing requirements
(which may (practically or legally) require use of a local clearing organization and so, in some
cases, could conflict with Dodd-Frank’s clearing requirement)”); Japanese Banks Letter at 4
(“We believe that future Japanese regulation of swap activities of Japanese banks will render
regulation of such banks subject to Title VII superfluous at best and potentially subject such
banks to inconsistent regulations under U.S. and Japanese law.”); Multiple Associations Letter I
at 9-10 (“We believe that [the Commission] and other U.S. regulatory agencies should anticipate
where the rulemaking may overlap, and possibly conflict, and make every effort to actively
coordinate with each other and with foreign regulators both as to harmonizing the substance of
related regulations and the timing of their implementation. Otherwise, the development of the
Swap markets will be vulnerable to false starts, significant revisions and inefficiencies, and
possible regulatory arbitrage across, or the flight to, other jurisdictions.”); Multiple Associations
Letter II at 2 (stating that it is “essential that rules be appropriately tailored, work in tandem, and
avoid unduly impairing market liquidity or adversely impacting investors” and that [i]t is not
enough to phase-in implementation if the final rules themselves are unworkable or in conflict”).

279

Two commenters highlighted the global nature of the security-based swap market and
raised concerns about the possible effect of foreign regulations on U.S. participants in the
security-based swap market. 997 These commenters requested that U.S. and foreign regulators
identify possible areas where rulemaking may overlap or conflict and actively coordinate to
harmonize both the substance of related regulations and the timing of their implementation. 998
The commenters argued that, without such coordination, “the development of the swap markets
will be vulnerable to false starts, significant revisions and inefficiencies, and possible regulatory
arbitrage across, or the flight to, other jurisdictions.” 999
Commenters representing several foreign banks requested that the Commission adopt
implementing regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act “that enable and encourage foreign banks
engaged in swap dealing activities to book their swaps businesses in a single well-capitalized,
highly rated foreign-based banking institution.” 1000 These commenters did not comment
specifically on the proposed rules, but rather argued in favor of a regulatory framework that
relies on home country supervision where regulations operate at the entity level, and that relies
on Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act with respect to “U.S. swap transactions,” where regulations
operate at the transaction level. 1001 In particular, these entities believe that the mandatory
clearing requirement should not apply to “foreign swap transactions” (i.e., transactions they
defined as not involving a U.S. counterparty) or, more broadly, to transactions that a
counterparty thereto is required to submit for clearing pursuant to foreign law. 1002
Commenters representing foreign financial institutions submitted a second, supplemental
comment letter to elaborate on the above comments. 1003 In this letter, these commenters
requested that the Commission modify the proposed definition of “security-based swap dealer”
to make clear that “a security-based swap which is required to be cleared under foreign law
(including by virtue of the fact that any counterparty thereto is required under foreign law to
submit the same for clearing) is not required to be cleared under the [Dodd-Frank] Act.” 1004
Moreover, commenters representing Japan’s three largest bank groups requested that the
Commission “adopt implementing regulations under the Dodd-Frank Act with the effect that
997

See Multiple Associations Letter I at 9 (“[I]t is unclear to what extent foreign regulation, in
addition to regulation by the Commissions, may affect U.S. Swap market participants.”); Multiple
Associations Letter II at 1 (noting that “an iterative approach to rulemaking has been taken when
rules have an unusually large impact on market structure and participants”).

Japanese banks, including their U.S. branches, are not made subject to the application of Title
VII requirements.” 1005 Should the Commission not take such action, these commenters
requested that the regulations issued pursuant to Title VII: (i) not apply to transactions between
affiliates of a bank group regulated as a bank holding company 1006 and (ii) not apply to “a
foreign dealer”—particularly one that is “subject to comprehensive home country regulation”—
with respect to transactions entered into by the foreign dealer with a U.S.-based dealer regulated
as a swap dealer or security-based swap dealer pursuant to Title VII. 1007
In addition, multiple commenters endorsed the use of mandatory clearing generally to
further the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act. One commenter described mandatory clearing as “the
centerpiece of reform embodied in Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act” that, accordingly, should be
subject to “only a very few, narrow, and limited exceptions.” 1008 Another commenter similarly
urged the Commission to “prioritize the finalization and implementation of clearing-related
rules.” 1009 Another stated that the Commission’s “top priority should be to implement
requirements that reduce systemic risk, such as the use of centralized Swap clearinghouses.” 1010
C. Application of Title VII Mandatory Clearing Requirements to Cross-Border Transactions
1. Statutory Framework
By its terms, the mandatory clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange
Act applies to any person that “engage[s] in a security-based swap . . . if the security-based swap
is required to be cleared.” 1011 We are proposing to apply the statutory language “engage in a
security-based swap” to mean any transaction in which a U.S. person is a counterparty 1012 to a

1011

Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(a)(1).

1012

The use of the term “counterparty” in the proposed rule is intended to refer to the direct
counterparty to the security-based swap transaction, not a party that provides a guarantee on the
performance of the direct counterparty under the security-based swap. As discussed in Section
VIII.C, supra, re-proposed Rules 900(j) and (o) under the Exchange Act would define the term
“direct counterparty” as “a person that enters directly with another person into a contract that
constitutes a security-based swap,” and an “indirect counterparty” as “a person that guarantees the
performance of a direct counterparty to a security-based swap or that otherwise provides recourse

281

security-based swap or guarantees the performance of a non-U.S. person under a security-based
swap because of the involvement of a U.S. person in the transaction. 1013 We also are proposing
to apply the statutory language “engage in a security-based swap” to include any transaction in
which a person performs any of the activities that are key stages in a security-based swap
transaction (i.e., solicitation, negotiation, execution, or booking of the transaction) 1014 within the
United States. As we noted above, a “transaction conducted within the United States,” as
defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5), includes soliciting, negotiating, executing, or booking a
security-based swap transaction. 1015 Accordingly, subject to certain statutory exceptions 1016 and
certain other exceptions described below, 1017 we are proposing to apply the mandatory clearing
requirement to any person that engages in a security-based swap transaction in which at least one
of the counterparties to the transaction is a U.S. person or a non-U.S. person whose performance
under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person, or if the transaction is a
“transaction conducted within the United States,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5)
under the Exchange Act. 1018
We preliminarily believe our proposed approach to the mandatory clearing requirement,
including the interpretation of the statutory language discussed above and further discussed
below, is consistent with the purposes of the mandatory clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1)
of the Exchange Act. The Dodd-Frank Act is intended to promote the financial stability of the
United States by, among other things, reducing risks to the U.S. financial system by ensuring
that, whenever possible and appropriate, derivatives contracts are centrally cleared rather than

to the other side for the failure of the direct counterparty to perform any obligation under the
security-based swap.”
1013

See Section II.B.2(d), supra (discussing the Commission’s treatment of guarantees).

1014

As noted above, solicitation, negotiation, execution, and booking are activities that represent key
stages in a potential or completed security-based swap transaction. See note 310 and
accompanying text, supra. Persons that conduct any of these activities would be considered to be
“engaged in a security-based swap” under the Commission’s proposed interpretation.

1015

See Section III.B.6, supra.

1016

The Exchange Act provides an exception from the mandatory clearing requirement in connection
with security-based swaps that involve persons that are not financial entities and that use the
security-based swaps to hedge or mitigate commercial risk. See Section 3C(g) of the Exchange
Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g). The Exchange Act also provides exemptions from the clearing
requirement for security-based swaps entered into prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act,
and for security-based swaps entered into prior to the application of the clearing requirement, so
long as those instruments are reported to a registered SDR. See Sections 3C(e)(1) and (f)(1) of
the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(e)(1) and (f)(1) (pre-enactment security-based swaps);
Sections 3C(e)(2) and (f)(2) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(e)(2) and (f)(2) (postenactment security-based swaps entered into prior to the application of the clearing requirement).

traded exclusively in the OTC market. 1019 In making our mandatory clearing determination, the
Commission is required to take into account certain factors, including, among other things, “the
availability of rule framework, capacity, operational expertise and resources, and credit support
infrastructure” in clearing agencies to support clearing of the product in question, and “the effect
on the mitigation of systemic risk.” 1020 The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed
approach generally would help to ensure that the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act to increase the use
of available centralized market infrastructures to reduce operational risks and mitigate systemic
risk are achieved, 1021 while not unnecessarily limiting the access of U.S. persons that conduct
security-based swap activity through foreign branches or guaranteed non-U.S. persons to foreign
security-based swap markets.
2. Proposed Rule
In light of the interpretation of the statutory language “engage in a security-based swap”
and the policy concerns discussed above, we are proposing a rule that would apply the
mandatory clearing requirement to a person that engages in a security-based swap transaction if a
counterparty to the transaction is (i) a U.S. person or (ii) a non-U.S. person whose performance
under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person. 1022 We also are proposing a rule
1019

See, e.g., S. Comm. on Banking, Hous., & Urban Affairs, The Restoring American Financial
Stability Act of 2010, S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 32 (“As a key element of reducing systemic risk
and protecting taxpayers in the future, protections must include comprehensive regulation and
rules for how the OTC derivatives market operates. Increasing the use of central clearinghouses,
exchanges, appropriate margining, capital requirements, and reporting will provide safeguards for
American taxpayers and the financial system as a whole.”); id. at 34 (“Some parts of the OTC
market may not be suitable for clearing and exchange trading due to individual business needs of
certain users. Those users should retain the ability to engage in customized, uncleared contracts
while bringing in as much of the OTC market under the centrally cleared and exchange-traded
framework as possible.”).

1020

Section 3C(b)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(b)(4)(B).

1021

The purpose of central clearing is to mitigate counterparty credit risk by shifting that risk from
individual counterparties to CCPs, thereby helping protect counterparties from each other’s
potential failures. Central clearing also requires that mark-to-market pricing and margin
requirements be applied in a consistent manner. CCPs generally use liquid margin collateral to
manage the risk of a CCP member’s failure, and rely on their margin calculations and their access
to that liquid collateral to protect against sudden movements in market prices, including
movements in market value after a counterparty’s default. A CCP that stands between
counterparties for OTC derivatives is generally perceived to decrease systemic risk. Further, the
use of CCPs may lead to standardization of contracts and processes, which improve market
efficiency and reduce the operational risks attributable to human and processing errors. See, e.g.,
Wellink, supra note 110, at 132–33; Culp, supra note 111, at 15–16; Manmohan Singh,
“Collateral, Netting and Systemic Risk in the OTC Derivatives Market,” IMF Working Paper
(2010), at 9–13, available at: http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2010/wp1099.pdf.

1022

Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a)(1) under the Exchange Act. Under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(c) under the
Exchange Act, the term “U.S. person” would have the same meaning as set forth in proposed
Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section III.B.5, supra.

283

that would apply the mandatory clearing requirement to a person that engages in a security-based
swap transaction if such transaction is a “transaction conducted within the United States,” as
defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act. 1023 To limit the scope of the
proposal, we are proposing exceptions to the mandatory clearing requirement in the following
two scenarios:
•

If the security-based swap transaction is not a “transaction conducted within the
United States,” the proposed rule would not apply the mandatory clearing
requirement if one counterparty to the transaction is (i) a foreign branch of a U.S.
bank 1024 or (ii) a non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap
is guaranteed by a U.S. person, 1025 and if the other counterparty to the transaction is a
non-U.S. person (i) whose performance under the security-based swap is not
guaranteed by a U.S. person and (ii) who is not a foreign security-based swap
dealer. 1026

•

If the security-based swap transaction is a “transaction conducted within the United
States,” the proposed rule would not apply the mandatory clearing requirement if (i)
neither counterparty to the transaction is a U.S. person; (ii) neither counterparty’s
performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person; and (iii)
neither counterparty to the transaction is a foreign security-based swap dealer. 1027

1023

Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a)(2) under the Exchange Act. Under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(c) under the
Exchange Act, the term “transaction conducted within the United States” would have the same
meaning as set forth in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in
Section III.B.5, supra.

1024

Under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(c) under the Exchange Act, the term “foreign branch” would have
the same meaning as set forth in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(1) under the Exchange Act. See
discussion in Section III.B.7, supra. A security-based swap transaction conducted through a
foreign branch, as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4) under the Exchange Act, would be
specifically excluded from the proposed definition of “transaction conducted within the United
States.” See proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5)(ii) under the Exchange Act.

1025

A security-based swap transaction involving a non-U.S. person whose performance under the
security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person would not be a “transaction conducted within
the United States” by virtue of the guarantee alone under proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the
Exchange Act, unless the transaction is solicited, negotiated, executed, or booked within the
United States. We would consider such transaction to be engaged in within the United States,
however, by virtue of the guarantee from the U.S. person, who acts as an “indirect counterparty”
to the transaction. See note 1012, supra.

1026

Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act. Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(c) defines the term
“foreign security-based swap dealer” by cross-reference to the definition of that term in proposed
Rule 3a71-3(a)(3) of the Exchange Act (defining “foreign security-based swap dealer” to mean “a
security-based swap dealer, as defined in section 3(a)(71) of the [Exchange] Act (15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(71)), and the rules and regulations thereunder, that is not a U.S. person”).

284

We discuss below the proposed rule regarding the application of the mandatory clearing
requirement in more detail.
3. Discussion
(a) Security-Based Swap Transactions Involving U.S. Persons or Non-U.S.
Persons Receiving Guarantees from U.S. Persons
i.

Proposed Rule

The proposed rule would apply the mandatory clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1)
of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, to a person that engages in a
security-based swap transaction if a counterparty to the transaction is (i) a U.S. person or (ii) a
non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S.
person, 1028 subject to certain exceptions. 1029
As discussed above, 1030 a U.S. person that is a counterparty to a security-based swap
transaction bears the ongoing risk of the transaction. It is the financial resources of that U.S.
person that will be called upon in performing any obligations pursuant to that transaction, and
this activity is capable of posing risks to the stability of the U.S. financial system. Because these
obligations and risks reside in the United States, the Commission preliminarily believes that
when a U.S. person is a counterparty to a security-based swap transaction, such person
necessarily engages in a security-based swap within the United States and, therefore, would be
subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder.
In the case of a non-U.S. person guaranteed by a U.S. person (“U.S. guarantor”), the
guarantee provides the counterparty of the guaranteed entity direct recourse to the U.S. guarantor
with respect to any obligations owed by the guaranteed entity under the security-based swap, and
the U.S. guarantor exposes itself to the security-based swap risk as if it were a direct
counterparty 1031 to the security-based swap through the security-based swap activity engaged in
by the guaranteed entity. In many cases, the counterparty would not enter into the transaction (or
would not do so on the same terms) with the guaranteed entity, and the guaranteed entity would
not be able to engage in any security-based swaps, without the guarantee. Given the reliance by
both the guaranteed entity and its counterparty on the creditworthiness of the guarantor in the
course of engaging in security-based swap transactions and for the duration of the transaction,
we preliminarily believe that a security-based swap transaction in which one of the
counterparties is a non-U.S. person whose performance under a security-based swap is
guaranteed by a U.S. person is a transaction that is engaged in within the United States by virtue

of the involvement of the U.S. guarantor in the security-based swap. 1032 Our proposed rule,
therefore, would subject transactions involving at least one counterparty whose performance
under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person to the mandatory clearing
requirement, 1033 subject to certain exceptions discussed below. 1034
We recognize that this proposed approach would subject certain security-based swap
transactions with non-U.S. persons to the mandatory clearing requirement if a U.S. person is a
counterparty to the transaction (e.g., U.S. dealer to foreign dealer transactions). We
preliminarily believe that such an approach is appropriate, as a significant proportion of the risk
borne by U.S. persons, and, therefore, the risk to the U.S. financial system as a result of the U.S.
persons’ security-based swap activity, arises from transactions entered into with non-U.S.
persons. 1035 Even where a U.S person’s security-based swap activity occurs in part outside the
United States (e.g., the transaction is negotiated or executed outside the United States), this
activity may pose risk to the U.S. financial system because security-based swap transactions give
rise to ongoing obligations on the part of the U.S. person and credit risk exposures to its nonU.S. counterparties. Therefore, subjecting a transaction in which a U.S. person is a counterparty
to the transaction to the mandatory clearing requirement would further the purposes of Title VII
by ensuring that security-based swaps involving persons whose security-based swap activities
create risk that Title VII is intended to address would be centrally cleared through a CCP. 1036

1034

Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b) under the Exchange Act.

1035

See Section II.A.6, supra.

1036

We preliminarily believe that the proposed approach to the mandatory clearing requirement is not
being applied to persons who are “transact[ing] a business in security-based swaps without the
jurisdiction of the United States,” within the meaning of Section 30(c). See Section II.B.2(b),
supra. However, the Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposed approach to the
mandatory clearing requirement is necessary or appropriate to help prevent the evasion of the
particular provisions of the Exchange Act that were added by the Dodd-Frank Act that are being
implemented by the approach and prophylactically will help ensure that the purposes of those
provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are not undermined. See Section II.B.2(e), supra; see also
Section II.B.2(d), supra.
For example, if the mandatory clearing requirement does not apply to transactions among nonU.S. persons that receive guarantees from U.S. persons and foreign branches of U.S. banks, then
U.S. persons would have an incentive to conduct transactions with other U.S. persons through
guaranteed foreign affiliates or foreign branches to avoid the mandatory clearing requirement,
even though altering the form of the transactions would not alter the substance of the risk to U.S.
markets that the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted to address and thus could undermine the purposes
of the Dodd-Frank Act. See Section II.A.6, supra.

286

ii.

Proposed Exception for Certain Transactions Involving Foreign
Branches of U.S. Banks and Guaranteed Non-U.S. Persons

The Commission is proposing an exception from the mandatory clearing requirement
described above for certain transactions that involve foreign branches of a U.S. bank or
guaranteed non-U.S. persons, provided the transactions are not conducted within the United
States. Specifically, under the proposed rule, the mandatory clearing requirement would not
apply to a security-based swap transaction if one counterparty to the transaction is a foreign
branch of a U.S. bank 1037 or a non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based
swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person and if the other counterparty to the transaction is a non-U.S.
person (i) whose performance under the security-based swap is not guaranteed by a U.S. person
and (ii) who is not a foreign security-based swap dealer. 1038 Such exception would not apply if
the security-based swap transaction were a transaction conducted within the United States, as
defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act. 1039
Without such an exception, U.S. persons conducting security-based swap activity out of
foreign branches or guaranteed non-U.S. persons may have less access to foreign security-based
swap markets because non-U.S. person counterparties may be less willing to enter into securitybased swap transactions with them if such transactions are subject to a mandatory clearing
requirement. We recognize that imposing the mandatory clearing requirement on a foreign
branch of a U.S. bank or on a non-U.S. person whose performance under a security-based swap
is guaranteed by a U.S. person would be consistent with the view that a foreign branch of a U.S.
bank is part of a U.S. person 1040 and that a U.S. guarantor is an indirect counterparty 1041 to the
transaction entered into by the guaranteed non-U.S. person. We also recognize that such
transactions pose risk to the U.S. financial system. At the same time, however, imposing the
mandatory clearing requirement on U.S. persons that conduct their foreign security-based swap
dealing activity through foreign branches or guaranteed non-U.S. persons, without any
exceptions, could put such U.S. persons at a significant competitive disadvantage to non-U.S.
persons who conduct security-based swap business in the same foreign local market and thereby
limit the access of such U.S. persons to foreign security-based swap markets. 1042 After balancing

See, e.g., Sullivan & Cromwell Letter at 14 (“The jurisdictional scope of the swaps entity

position in foreign marketplaces. Imposing the regulatory regime of Title VII on their Non-U.S.
Operations would place them at a disadvantage to their foreign bank competitors because the
Non-U.S. Operations would be subject to an additional regulatory regime which their foreign
competitors would not.”); Cleary Letter IV at 7 (“Subjecting such non-U.S. branches and
affiliates to U.S. requirements could effectively preclude them from, or significantly increase the

287

the various policy considerations, including the Dodd-Frank Act’s goal of mitigating risk to the
U.S. financial system, we have preliminarily concluded that the proposed exception from the
mandatory clearing requirement for transactions by U.S. persons conducting security-based swap
activity out of foreign branches or guaranteed non-U.S. persons with non-U.S. persons whose
performance under the security-based swap is not guaranteed by a U.S. person is appropriate,
provided that it is not a transaction conducted within the United States. 1043
This exception from the mandatory clearing requirement would not apply under the
proposed rule, however, when the non-U.S. person counterparty of the foreign branch of the U.S.
bank or the guaranteed non-U.S. person is a foreign security-based swap dealer. 1044 As
discussed above, a non-U.S. person would be required to register as a foreign security-based
swap dealer if its transactions with U.S. persons or otherwise conducted within the United States,
connected with its dealing capacity, exceed the de minimis threshold in the security-based swap
dealer definition. 1045 Thus, a foreign security-based swap dealer would necessarily have a
significant connection with the U.S. security-based swap market. As a result, the Commission
preliminarily believes that it is not appropriate to provide an exception for U.S. persons
conducting security-based swap activity out of foreign branches or guaranteed non-U.S. persons
when they enter into security-based swaps with foreign security-based swap dealers.
We are not proposing to provide an exception from mandatory clearing for U.S. persons
generally, however, although we recognize that such exception could increase access to foreign
security-based swap markets for all U.S. persons. The Commission preliminarily believes that
such a broad exception to the mandatory clearing requirement, in a market as global as the
security-based swap market, 1046 would undermine the goal of the mandatory clearing
requirement to reduce financial risk to the U.S. financial system. In light of the statutory goal,
we preliminarily do not believe that the benefit of providing U.S. persons greater access to
foreign security-based swap markets warrants expanding the exception beyond the scope we are
proposing here. In this regard, we also note that a uniform mandatory clearing requirement for
all U.S. persons other than foreign branches and guaranteed non-U.S. persons should facilitate
cost of, managing their risk in the local financial markets, since local financial institutions may be
required to comply with Dodd-Frank to provide those services.”).
1043

In this regard, we note that such transaction may be subject to a mandatory clearing requirement
in a foreign jurisdiction. See Section XI.E, infra (discussing substituted compliance).

1044

Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b)(1)(ii)(B) under the Exchange Act. Like U.S. persons conducting
security-based swap activity out of foreign branches or guaranteed non-U.S. persons, a foreign
security-based swap dealer would not be subject to the mandatory clearing requirement when it
engages in a security-based swap transaction with a non-U.S. person, provided neither party’s
performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person and the transaction is
not conducted within the United States. Such a transaction would not be captured by proposed
Rule 3Ca-3(a) under the Exchange Act (and, therefore, it is not necessary for such transaction to
be included as an exception in paragraph (b) of Rule 3Ca-3).

(b) Transactions Conducted Within the United States
i.

Proposed Rule

Under the proposed rule, a security-based swap transaction that is a “transaction
conducted within the United States,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the
Exchange Act, would be subject to the mandatory clearing requirement. 1048 The Commission
preliminarily believes that engaging in a security-based swap includes the performance by a
person of any of the activities that represent key stages in a security-based swap transaction,
including solicitation, negotiation, execution, or booking of a security-based swap transaction.
As we have noted above, a “transaction conducted within the United States,” as defined in
proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5), includes soliciting, negotiating, executing, or booking a securitybased swap transaction. 1049 Accordingly, we preliminarily would interpret engaging in a
security-based swap within the United States to encompass the same types of activities that
characterize a transaction conducted within the United States, as that term is defined in proposed
Rule 3a71-3(a)(5). 1050
ii.

Proposed Exception for Transactions Conducted Within the United
States by Certain Non-U.S. Persons

The Commission recognizes that transactions between two non-U.S. persons whose
performances under a security-based swap are not guaranteed by a U.S. person do not pose the
same risk to the U.S. financial system that is posed by transactions with U.S. person
counterparties or transactions in which a U.S. person provides a guarantee. In particular, while
the operational risks associated with the transaction may reside in the United States and would
potentially be reduced by required use of the central market infrastructure available to clear the
products in question, we preliminarily believe that because the financial risks of the transaction
would reside with non-U.S. persons outside the United States, it is not necessary to apply the
mandatory clearing requirement to a transaction between two non-U.S. persons solely because
the transaction is a “transaction conducted within the United States” as defined in proposed Rule
3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act. Accordingly, the Commission is proposing an exception
1047

See, e.g., note 991, supra. A robust infrastructure for clearing of security-based swaps should
reduce operational risks resulting from backlogs and processing errors. See FMI Principles at 20,
94 (describing operational risk as the “risk that deficiencies in information systems or internal
processes, human errors, management failures, or disruptions from external events will result in
the reduction, deterioration, or breakdown of services” and noting that operational risks “can be a
source of systemic risk.”).

1049

See Section III.B.6, supra.

1050

Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a)(2) under the Exchange Act.

289

from the mandatory clearing requirement for security-based swap transactions that are
“transactions conducted within the United States” when no counterparty to the transaction is (i) a
U.S. person; (ii) a non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap is
guaranteed by a U.S. person; or (iii) a foreign security-based swap dealer. 1051
The Commission preliminarily believes it is appropriate to limit the exception from the
mandatory clearing requirement when one or both of the non-U.S. person counterparties is a
foreign security-based swap dealer. Non-U.S. persons whose transactions arising from dealing
activity with U.S. persons or otherwise conducted within the United States exceed the de
minimis threshold in the security-based swap dealer definition have a sufficient connection to the
U.S. security-based swap market to lead the Commission to preliminarily conclude that it would
not be appropriate to except transactions involving them from the mandatory clearing
requirement when they conduct security-based swap transactions within the United States.
Permitting non-U.S. persons to engage in security-based swap transactions within the United
States with foreign security-based swap dealers without being subject to the mandatory clearing
requirement would potentially limit the access of U.S. persons to foreign security-based swap
markets because non-U.S. persons seeking to engage in security-based swaps within the United
States may prefer to engage in security-based swaps with foreign security-based swap dealers
rather than U.S. persons to avoid the mandatory clearing requirement.
Request for Comment
The Commission seeks comment on the proposed rule in all aspects. In addition, the
Commission seeks comment on the following specific questions:

1051

•

Should the mandatory clearing requirement apply to all transactions conducted by a
U.S. person, including transactions conducted out of a foreign branch, or by a
guaranteed non-U.S. person? Why or why not? Should the mandatory clearing
requirement apply to such transactions unless, for example, they are conducted in a
foreign regime that has a mandatory clearing regime that is comparable to the
mandatory clearing regime under the Dodd-Frank Act? In assessing comparability
under this approach, to what extent should results of mandatory clearing
determinations under the foreign regime be taken into account? Should the
determinations with respect to “local” products be viewed differently than products
that are subject to mandatory clearing determinations in one or more other
jurisdictions, i.e., “global” products? Would some other standard for assessing a
foreign regime in these circumstances be appropriate?

•

Is the proposed approach over-broad or over-narrow? If so, why? Should a securitybased swap that is required to be cleared under foreign law not be required to be
cleared pursuant to Section 3C, as some commenters stated? If so, why?

Id.

290

•

When the conduct occurring in the United States is limited only to negotiating or
soliciting a transaction, does the transaction carry risk into the U.S. financial system?
If not, is application of the mandatory clearing requirement to such transactions
appropriate?

•

How should the Commission weigh the operational risks that arise from requiring
mandatory clearing? To what extent do the exceptions to the mandatory clearing
requirement undermine the development of a central clearing infrastructure that will
facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of security-based swaps?
Are persons excepted from the mandatory clearing requirement likely to develop the
same operational capacity and safeguards to facilitate clearing as persons not
excepted? If not, to what extent does this increase operational risk to the national
system for clearance and settlement? To what extent, if any, should the exceptions to
the mandatory clearing requirement be limited to minimize operational risks and
market risks that may be experienced in the United States?

•

Are there other rationales besides risk mitigation that justify imposing the mandatory
clearing requirement? If so, what are they and why? Do these alternative rationales
support a different application of the requirement to U.S. persons and non-U.S.
persons? As regards foreign branches of U.S. banks? As regards non-U.S. persons
who receive guarantees from U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons who do not receive
guarantees from U.S. persons? As regards security-based swap dealers?

•

How should the mandatory clearing requirement treat members of clearing agencies
registered with the Commission? For instance, to what extent should the mandatory
clearing requirement apply to members of clearing agencies registered with the
Commission if the member is not a U.S. person, does not have its performance
guaranteed by a U.S. person, is not a security-based swap dealer, or is not conducting
the transaction within the United States? Please be specific.

•

How should the mandatory clearing requirement treat counterparties who are swap
dealers? For instance, should non-U.S. persons who are swap dealers and whose
performance under the swap is not guaranteed by a U.S. person be excepted from the
mandatory clearing requirement in any circumstances? If so, under what
circumstances? How should other financial entities be treated? How should major
swap participants and major security-based swap participants be treated under the
proposed rule? Should they be excepted from the mandatory clearing requirement, in
certain circumstances, as we have proposed?

•

Are the proposed exceptions from the mandatory clearing requirement appropriate?
Should other transactions also be excepted? If so, which? Should other categories of
persons also be excepted? If so, whom?

•

Should any transactions conducted within the United States be subject to any
exception from the mandatory clearing requirement? If so, why? For instance,
should a transaction between two non-U.S. persons neither of whom is guaranteed by
291

a U.S. person and neither of whom are security-based swap dealers, as excepted from
the mandatory clearing requirement under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b)(2), be subject to
mandatory clearing? If so, why?
•

Should any transactions where one counterparty is a U.S. person be subject to an
exception from the mandatory clearing requirement? If so, which transactions and
why? For instance, should transactions not conducted in the United States in which
one counterparty is a foreign branch of a U.S. bank be subject to any exceptions, such
as the exception in proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b)(1)?

•

To what extent might the exceptions described in proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b) create
competitive disparity between similarly situated persons competing in the same
market? For instance, for transactions conducted within the United States, to what
extent, if any, might proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b)(2) create competitive disparity between
U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons? For transactions not conducted within the United
States, to what extent, if any, might proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b)(1) create competitive
disparity between counterparties who are security-based swap dealers and foreign
branches of U.S. banks?

•

Should the Commission impose any conditions to the exceptions from the mandatory
clearing requirement? What conditions would be appropriate?

•

If the proposed rule overlaps with a foreign mandatory clearing requirement, in what
ways are the requirements likely to conflict? What would be the effects on
efficiency, competition and capital formation in the event that there are overlapping
or duplicative mandatory clearing requirements or varying exceptions to such
requirements across multiple jurisdictions?

•

What provisions of Section 3C, or the Exchange Act and rules thereunder generally,
would a counterparty be unable to comply with if the security-based swap transaction
was subject to more than one mandatory clearing requirement? What categories of
transactions are likely to be subject to such multiple mandatory clearing
requirements? To what extent, if any, would a counterparty’s membership in a
clearing agency that clears security-based swaps affect the likelihood that multiple
mandatory clearing requirements would apply to a security-based swap transaction?
To what extent, if any, would a guaranteed non-U.S. person be subject to multiple
mandatory clearing requirements? To what extent, if any, does the home country of
the reference entity under a security-based swap affect the likelihood that multiple
mandatory clearing requirements would apply to the transaction? Does proposed
Rule 3Ca-3 provide sufficient regulatory guidance regarding such transactions? Why
or why not?

•

What would be the market impact of proposed Rule 3Ca-3? How would the proposed
application of the mandatory clearing requirement affect the competitiveness of U.S.
entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States as well as in foreign
jurisdictions)? Would the proposed rule place any market participants at a
292

competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed
rule be a more general burden on competition? If so, please explain. What other
measures should the Commission consider to implement the mandatory clearing
requirement? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects of
alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?

Mandatory Security-Based Swap Trade Execution Requirement

A. Introduction
Section 3C(h)(1) of the Exchange Act requires, with respect to transactions involving
security-based swaps subject to the clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange
Act, that counterparties execute such transactions on an exchange or a security-based swap
execution facility that is registered under Section 3D of the Exchange Act or exempt from
registration under Section 3D(e) of the Exchange Act (the “mandatory trade execution
requirement”). 1052 Section 3C(h) thus provides that security-based swap transactions subject to
the mandatory trade execution requirement cannot be executed on an OTC basis, but must
instead be executed on an exchange or security-based swap execution facility that is registered or
exempt from registration under the Exchange Act, unless an exception applies. 1053 As such, the
mandatory trade execution requirement is important in helping to bring the trading of securitybased swaps onto transparent, regulated markets, from more opaque OTC markets. 1054
Because transactions in security-based swaps are often conducted globally with
counterparties and intermediaries from multiple jurisdictions, 1055 we recognize uncertainty may
exist regarding how to apply the mandatory trade execution requirement to cross-border securitybased swap transactions. 1056 The Commission is proposing Rule 3Ch-1 under the Exchange Act
1052

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(h)(1).

1053

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(h). Section 3C(h)(2) of the Exchange Act provides two exceptions to
compliance with the mandatory trade execution requirement: (i) if no exchange or security-based
swap execution facility makes the security-based swap available to trade; or (ii) if the securitybased swap transaction is subject to the clearing exception under Section 3C(g) of the Exchange
Act. 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(h)(2). In this release, we are not addressing either of these exceptions, as
they pertain to whether a particular security-based swap is subject to the mandatory trade
execution requirement. Our focus here is on the obligations of the counterparties to a transaction
involving a security-based swap that is subject to the mandatory execution requirement where
neither of these exceptions applies.

1054

See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10949 (“The current market for [security-based] swaps
is opaque, with little, if any, pre-trade transparency (the ability of market participants to see
trading interest prior to a trade being executed) or post-trade transparency (the ability of market
participants to see transaction information after a trade is executed). A key goal of the DoddFrank Act is to bring trading of [security-based] swaps onto regulated markets . . . .”).

1055

See Section II.A.1, supra.

1056

One commenter, writing on behalf of a group of various market participants, asked for clear
guidance regarding the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement for cross-border
transactions in security-based swaps. See Cleary Letter III and Cleary Letter IV. The commenter
recommended that the mandatory trade execution requirement should only apply to transactions
where at least one counterparty is a U.S. person. See Cleary Letter IV at 27. This commenter
also argued that the mandatory trade execution requirement should not apply to transactions
involving two non-U.S. persons that utilize U.S. persons to carry out the transaction. We discuss
this comment below.

294

to specify the applicability of the mandatory trade execution requirement with respect to crossborder security-based swap transactions. Our proposed approach follows the territorial approach
described above 1057 and imposes the mandatory trade execution requirement on transactions that
would be subject to the mandatory clearing requirement 1058 unless they qualify for an
exception. 1059 We discuss substituted compliance with the mandatory trade execution
requirement in Section XI.F below. 1060
We recognize that other approaches are possible to achieve the goals of the Dodd-Frank
Act, in whole or in part. Accordingly, we invite comment regarding all aspects of the proposal
described below, including potential alternative approaches. Data and comment from market
participants and other interested parties regarding the likely effect of the proposed rule and
potential alternative approaches will be particularly useful to the Commission in evaluating
possible modifications to the proposal.
B. Application of the Mandatory Trade Execution Requirement to Cross-Border Transactions
1. Statutory Framework
Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act provides that if a transaction is subject to the
mandatory clearing requirement, counterparties shall execute the transaction on an exchange or
on a registered or exempt SB SEF, unless an exception applies. 1061 Section 3C(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act provides that it shall be unlawful for any person “to engage in a security-based
swap unless that person submits such security-based swap for clearing . . . if the security-based
swap is required to be cleared.” 1062 As discussed above, we are proposing to apply the statutory
mandatory clearing requirement to any person who engages in a security-based swap transaction
within the United States. 1063 We preliminarily believe that, to the extent that a cross-border

1057

See, e.g., Section VII, supra (discussing the registration of foreign security-based swap markets);
see also the general discussion of the Commission’s territorial approach in Section II.B, supra.

1058

See Section IX, supra (discussing the scope of the mandatory clearing requirement).

1059

See note 1053, supra.

1060

Under the Commission’s proposal, substituted compliance would be permitted for certain crossborder security-based swap transactions that would be subject to the mandatory trade execution
requirement in Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. See
discussion in Section XI.F, infra.

1061

See 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(h).

1062

See 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(a)(1).

1063

In Section IX above, the Commission proposes Rule 3Ca-3 under the Exchange Act. Subject to
certain exceptions, proposed Rule 3Ca-3 would apply the mandatory clearing requirement to any
person that engages in a security-based swap transaction in which at least one of the
counterparties to the transaction is a U.S. person or a non-U.S. person whose performance under
the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person, or if the transaction is a “transaction
conducted within the United States,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the

295

transaction is subject to the mandatory clearing requirement under the proposed approach
described above, it also would be subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement unless it
qualifies for an exception. 1064 This approach is consistent with the statutory framework of Title
VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, because a security-based swap transaction first must be subject to the
mandatory clearing requirement before the counterparties to the transaction must comply with
the mandatory trade execution requirement, unless an exception to the mandatory trade execution
requirement applies. Thus, to the extent that we are proposing not to apply the mandatory
clearing requirement to a particular transaction, the mandatory trade execution requirement
would not apply to such transaction.
2. Proposed Rule
Consistent with our proposed rule applying the mandatory clearing requirement 1065 and
our general approach in applying Title VII in the cross-border context, 1066 the Commission is
proposing Rule 3Ch-1 under the Exchange Act. Under the proposed rule, the mandatory trade
execution requirement would apply to any person that engages in a security-based swap
transaction in which at least one of the counterparties to the transaction is (i) a U.S. person 1067 or
(ii) a non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S.
person. 1068 We also are proposing to apply the mandatory trade execution requirement to any
person that engages in a security-based swap if such transaction is a “transaction conducted
within the United States,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act. 1069
To limit the scope of the proposal, we are proposing exceptions to the mandatory trade
execution requirement in the following two scenarios: 1070
•

If the security-based swap transaction is not a “transaction conducted within the
United States,” the proposed rule would not apply the mandatory trade execution
requirement if one counterparty to the transaction is (i) a foreign branch of a U.S.

Exchange Act. See Section IX.C, supra, and Section III.B.6, supra (discussing proposed Rule
3a71-3(a)(5)).
1064

See note 1053, supra.

1065

See proposed Rule 3Ca-3 under the Exchange Act.

1066

See Section II.B, supra.

1067

Under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(c) under the Exchange Act, the term “U.S. person” would have the
same meaning as set forth in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in
Section III.B.5 below.

1068

Proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a)(1) under the Exchange Act.

1069

Proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a)(2) under the Exchange Act.

1070

Consistent with our intent to apply the mandatory trade execution requirement in the same way as
the mandatory clearing requirement, these exceptions are identical to the exceptions from the
mandatory clearing requirement. See proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b) under the Exchange Act, as
discussed in Section IX, supra.

296

bank 1071 or (ii) a non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap
is guaranteed by a U.S. person, 1072 and if the other counterparty to the transaction is a
non-U.S. person (i) whose performance under the security-based swap is not
guaranteed by a U.S. person and (ii) who is not a foreign security-based swap
dealer. 1073
•

If the security-based swap transaction is a “transaction conducted within the United
States,” the proposed rule would not apply the mandatory trade execution requirement
if (i) neither counterparty to the transaction is a U.S. person; (ii) neither
counterparty’s performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S.
person; and (iii) neither counterparty to the transaction is a foreign security-based
swap dealer. 1074

We discuss below the proposed rule regarding the application of the mandatory trade execution
requirement in more detail.
3. Discussion
In considering how to apply the mandatory trade execution requirement, we have relied
primarily on the express statutory relationship between the mandatory clearing requirement and
the mandatory trade execution requirement. The statutory text, in our view, indicates that
Congress viewed the clearing and trade execution requirements as complementary, since a
security-based swap transaction that is subject to the mandatory clearing requirement is subject
1071

Under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(c) under the Exchange Act, the term “foreign branch” would have
the same meaning as set forth in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(1) under the Exchange Act. See
discussion in Section III.B.7, supra. A security-based swap transaction conducted through a
foreign branch, as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4) under the Exchange Act, would be
specifically excluded from the proposed definition of “transaction conducted within the United
States.” See proposed Rule 3a71-3(5)(ii) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section III.B.6,
supra.

1072

A security-based swap transaction involving a non-U.S. person whose performance under the
security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person would not be a “transaction conducted within
the United States” by virtue of the guarantee alone because providing a guarantee on a transaction
is not one of the factors that would cause a transaction to be a transaction conducted within the
United States under proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act. We would consider
such transaction to be engaged in within the United States, however, by virtue of the guarantee
from the U.S. person, who acts as an “indirect counterparty” to the transaction.

1073

Proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b)(1) under the Exchange Act. Proposed Rule 3Ch-1(c) under the
Exchange Act defines the term “foreign security-based swap dealer” by cross-reference to the
definition of that term in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(3) of the Exchange Act (defining “foreign
security-based swap dealer” to mean “a security-based swap dealer, as defined in section 3(a)(71)
of the [Exchange] Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(71)), and the rules and regulations thereunder, that is not
a U.S. person”).

to the mandatory trade execution requirement, absent circumstances that trigger one of the
exceptions to the mandatory trade execution requirement. In the following, we discuss the
proposed rule regarding the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement in more
detail.
(a) Security-Based Swap Transactions Involving U.S. Persons or Non-U.S.
Persons Receiving Guarantees from U.S. Persons
i.

Proposed Rule

The proposed rule would apply the mandatory trade execution requirement to
transactions in which one of the counterparties is (i) a U.S. person or (ii) a non-U.S. person
whose performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person, 1075 subject to
certain exceptions. 1076 We preliminarily believe that applying the mandatory trade execution
requirement to transactions in which U.S. persons are counterparties or provide guarantees of the
performance of non-U.S. persons under a security-based swap would be consistent with the
purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act to improve transparency in the U.S. financial system. 1077 As
noted above, the mandatory trade execution requirement in Title VII is critical to this goal
because this requirement is designed promote the trading of security-based swap transactions on
transparent, regulated markets. 1078 Therefore, by applying the mandatory trade execution
requirement to transactions in which U.S. persons are counterparties or provide guarantees of the
performance of non-U.S. persons under a security-based swap, the proposed rule would further
the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act to improve the transparency of the U.S. financial system. 1079

See note 1054, supra.

1079

We preliminarily believe that the proposed approach with respect to the mandatory trade
execution requirements is not being applied to persons who are “transact[ing] a business in
security-based swaps without the jurisdiction of the United States,” within the meaning of Section
30(c). See Section II.B.2(b), supra. However, the Commission also preliminarily believes that
the proposed approach with respect to the mandatory trade execution requirements is necessary or
appropriate to help prevent the evasion of the particular provisions of the Exchange Act that were
added by the Dodd-Frank Act that are being implemented by the approach and prophylactically
will help ensure that the purposes of those provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act are not undermined.
See Section II.B.2(e), supra; see also Section II.B.2(d), supra.
For example, if the mandatory trade execution requirement does not apply to a transaction among
non-U.S. persons that receive guarantees from U.S. persons and foreign branches of U.S. banks,
then U.S. persons would have an incentive to evade the mandatory trade execution requirement
by conducting transactions with other U.S. persons through guaranteed foreign affiliates or
foreign branches. Altering the form of the transaction in this manner would allow U.S. persons to
continue to avail themselves of transparency in the U.S. security-based swap market while

Proposed Exception for Certain Transactions Involving Foreign
Branches of U.S. Banks and Guaranteed Non-U.S. Persons

Consistent with the Commission’s proposed approach to the mandatory clearing
requirement discussed above, 1080 the Commission is proposing an exception from the mandatory
trade execution requirement described above for certain transactions that involve foreign
branches of U.S. banks or guaranteed non-U.S. persons, provided the transactions are not
conducted within the United States. Specifically, under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b)(1), the
mandatory trade execution requirement would not apply to a security-based swap transaction if
one counterparty to the transaction is (i) a foreign branch of a U.S. bank 1081 or (ii) a non-U.S.
person whose performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person and if
the other counterparty to the transaction is a non-U.S. person (i) whose performance under the
security-based swap is not guaranteed by a U.S. person and (ii) who is not a foreign securitybased swap dealer. 1082 Such exception would not apply if the security-based swap transaction
were a transaction conducted within the United States, as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5)
under the Exchange Act. 1083
The Commission preliminarily believes that imposing the mandatory trade execution
requirement on all security-based swap transactions in which a U.S. person is a counterparty or
in which a U.S. person provides a guarantee to a non-U.S. person counterparty may adversely
affect the ability of U.S. persons to access foreign security-based swap markets because non-U.S.
persons may be less willing to enter into transactions with them if such transactions are subject to
the mandatory trade execution requirement. Accordingly, we are proposing an exception from
the mandatory trade execution requirement for transactions in which a counterparty to the
transaction is a foreign branch of a U.S. bank or a non-U.S. person who receives a guarantee
from a U.S. person on its performance under the security-based swap and the other counterparty
is a non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap is not guaranteed by a
U.S. person and who is not a foreign security-based swap dealer. 1084
We recognize that imposing the mandatory trade execution requirement on a foreign
branch of a U.S. bank or on a non-U.S. person whose performance under a security-based swap
is guaranteed by a U.S. person would be consistent with the view that a foreign branch of a U.S.
bank is part of a U.S. person 1085 and that a U.S. guarantor is an indirect counterparty 1086 to the
evading the requirements intended to enhance that transparency, even though the substance of the
transaction remains unchanged. See note 1054 and accompanying text, supra.

transaction entered into by the guaranteed non-U.S. person. We also recognize that subjecting
such transactions to the mandatory trade execution requirement could help to bring the trading of
security-based swaps onto transparent, regulated markets, from more opaque OTC market. At
the same time, however, imposing the mandatory trade execution requirement on U.S. persons
that conduct their foreign security-based swap dealing activity through foreign branches or
guaranteed non-U.S. persons, without any exceptions, could put such U.S. persons at a
significant competitive disadvantage to non-U.S. persons who conduct security-based swap
business in the same foreign local market and thereby limit the access of such U.S. persons to
foreign security-based swap markets. After balancing the various policy considerations,
including the Dodd-Frank Act’s goal of promoting trading on transparent, regulated markets, we
have preliminarily concluded that the proposed exception from the mandatory trade execution
requirement for transactions by U.S. persons conducting security-based swap activity out of
foreign branches, or transactions by guaranteed non-U.S. persons, with non-U.S. persons whose
performance under the security-based swap is not guaranteed by a U.S. person (and who is not a
foreign security-based swap dealer) is appropriate, provided that it is not a transaction conducted
within the United States.
This exception from the mandatory trade execution requirement would not apply under
the proposed rule, however, when the non-U.S. person counterparty of the foreign branch of the
U.S. bank or the guaranteed non-U.S. person is a foreign security-based swap dealer. 1087 The
reason for this proposed carve-out from the exception from the mandatory trade execution
requirement is similar to the reason discussed above in the context of the mandatory clearing
requirement. Because a foreign security-based swap dealer would necessarily have a significant
connection with the U.S. security-based swap market because its dealing activity with U.S.
persons or within the United States would trigger registration requirements, we preliminarily
believe it is not appropriate to provide an exception for U.S. persons conducting security-based
swap activity out of foreign branches or for guaranteed non-U.S. persons when they enter into
security-based swaps with foreign security-based swap dealers
(b) Transactions Conducted Within the United States
i.

Proposed Rule

Under the proposed rule, a security-based swap transaction that is a transaction conducted
within the United States, as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act,
would be subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement. 1088 As we have noted above, a
“transaction conducted within the United States,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5),
includes soliciting, negotiating, executing, or booking a security-based swap transaction. 1089 The
Commission believes that applying the mandatory trade execution requirement to a securitybased swap transaction when the activities that are key stages in that transaction are conducted

within the United States furthers a goal of the mandatory trade execution requirement, namely, to
bring the trading of security-based swaps within the United States onto regulated markets, unless
an exception applies. Furthermore, such an approach is consistent with our proposed approach to
the mandatory clearing requirement discussed above. 1090
ii.

Proposed Exception for Transactions Conducted Within the United
States by Certain Non-U.S. Persons

We recognize that one commenter has recommended that transactions between two nonU.S. persons that utilize U.S. agents should not be subject to the mandatory trade execution
requirement. 1091 The commenter noted that it is common for non-U.S. persons to utilize U.S.
agents because of their expertise in the relevant market (such as in the case of a swap with an
underlying U.S. security) or because of logistical matters (such as the time zones in which the
parties conduct business). 1092 The commenter argued that applying the mandatory trade
execution requirement to these transactions could curtail the use of U.S. agents to negotiate
trades and encourage personnel in the United States to relocate elsewhere. 1093
Consistent with our proposed approach to applying the mandatory clearing requirement
to transactions conducted within the United States by non-U.S. persons, the Commission is
proposing an exception from the mandatory trade execution requirement for security-based swap
transactions that are transactions conducted within the United States when no counterparty to the
transaction is (i) a U.S. person; (ii) a non-U.S. person whose performance under the securitybased swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person; or (iii) a foreign security-based swap dealer. 1094
The Commission preliminarily believes that it is appropriate to limit the exception from
the mandatory trade execution requirement when one or both of the non-U.S. person
counterparties is a foreign security-based swap dealer. Non-U.S. persons whose transactions
arising from dealing activity with U.S. persons or otherwise conducted within the United States
exceed the de minimis threshold in the security-based swap dealer definition have a sufficient
connection to the U.S. security-based swap market to lead the Commission to preliminarily
conclude that it would not be appropriate to except transactions involving them from the
mandatory trade execution requirement when they conduct security-based swap transactions
within the United States. Permitting non-U.S. persons to engage in security-based swap
transactions within the United States with foreign security-based swap dealers without being

As discussed above, the statutory language for the mandatory clearing requirements apply to any
person that “engages in a security-based swap,” which the Commission proposes to interpret to
include any transaction in which a person performs any of the activities that are key stages in a
security-based swap transaction (i.e., solicitation, negotiation, execution, or booking of the
transaction). See Section IX.C, supra; see also Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act.

persons to foreign security-based swap markets because non-U.S. persons seeking to engage in
security-based swaps within the United States may prefer to engage in security-based swaps with
foreign security-based swap dealers rather than U.S. persons to avoid the mandatory trade
execution requirement.
Request for Comment
The Commission seeks comment on all aspects of proposed Rule 3Ch-1, including the
following:
•

Should the mandatory trade execution requirement apply to all transactions conducted
by a U.S. person, including transactions conducted out of a foreign branch of a U.S.
bank or a non-U.S. person whose performance under a security-based swap is
guaranteed by a U.S. person? Why or why not?

•

Is it appropriate for the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement in
the cross-border context to follow our approach to the mandatory clearing
requirement? If not, why not? What alternative approach would better suit the
relationship between these two requirements under the statute? Please explain.

•

Is the proposed rule appropriate and sufficiently clear? Should additional details be
included as to any aspect of the proposed rule? If so, what additional details should
be provided and why?

•

As discussed above, under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a), the mandatory trade execution
requirement would apply to a person that engages in a security-based swap
transaction if such person is a U.S. person, such person is a non-U.S. person whose
performance under such security-based swap transaction is guaranteed by a U.S.
person, or such security-based swap transaction is a transaction conducted within the
United States. Are the circumstances in which the Commission proposes to apply the
mandatory trade execution requirement sufficiently clear? If not, why not? Are these
the appropriate circumstances in which to apply the mandatory trade execution
requirement? If not, why not? Are there additional types of counterparties or
security-based swap transactions to which the mandatory trade execution requirement
should be applied? If so, who or what are they, and why? Are there types of
counterparties or security-based swap transactions that should not be covered by the
proposed rule? If so, why not?

•

Would the proposed rule apply the mandatory trade execution requirement in ways
that appropriately promote the goals of Title VII? Would any objectives of Title VII
be hindered by applying the mandatory trade execution requirement as proposed?
Would there be any regulatory gaps created by the proposed rule? Please provide
detail.

•

By requiring transactions conducted within the United States to be subject to the
mandatory trade execution requirement, would the proposed rule appropriately create
302

competitive parity between U.S. and non-U.S. persons that act as intermediaries
within the United States to conduct transactions in security-based swaps? Why or
why not? Please explain. Please provide specific recommendations and explain how
any recommended approach would better promote competition than the proposed
rule. More generally, should security-based swap transactions be subject to the
mandatory trade execution requirement solely because a transaction was solicited or
negotiated within the United States?
•

Under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b), certain security-based swap transactions by foreign
branches and guaranteed non-U.S. persons that are not conducted within the United
States would be excluded from the mandatory trade execution requirement. The
Commission generally solicits comments on the appropriateness of excluding the
security-based swap transactions described in proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b) from the
application of the mandatory trade execution requirement. Should additional types of
transactions be excluded from the application of the mandatory trade execution
requirement? Should some or all of the transactions covered by proposed Rule 3Ch1(b) not be excluded? If so, in either case, please explain why. Does proposed Rule
3Ch-1(b) appropriately balance the competitiveness of U.S. persons in the global
security-based swaps market and the goals of Title VII? If not, how could this
balance be better achieved? Should proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b) also apply to non-U.S.
persons that are security-based swap dealers? Why or why not?

•

What would be the market impact of proposed Rule 3Ch-1? How would the proposed
application of the mandatory trade execution requirement affect the competitiveness
of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United States as well as in
foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed rule place any market participants at a
competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed
rule be a more general burden on competition? If so, please explain. Would any
burdens on competition be effectively mitigated by the proposed exception to
mandatory trade execution in proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b)? Please explain. What other
measures should the Commission consider to implement the mandatory trade
execution requirement? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness
effects of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?

XI.

Substituted Compliance

A. Introduction
As noted above, we are proposing to establish a policy and procedural framework
pursuant to rules under the Exchange Act in which the Commission would consider permitting
compliance with comparable regulatory requirements in a foreign jurisdiction to substitute for
compliance with requirements in the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder,
relating to security-based swaps (i.e., substituted compliance). As proposed, under a
Commission substituted compliance determination, a person would be able to satisfy relevant
requirements in the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, by substituting
compliance with corresponding requirements under a foreign regulatory system. A person
relying on a substituted compliance determination still would be subject to the particular
Exchange Act requirement that is the subject of the substituted compliance determination, but
would be permitted to comply with such requirement in an alternative fashion. Failure of a
person to comply with the applicable foreign regulatory requirements would mean that such
person would be in violation of the requirements in the Exchange Act.
The Commission is proposing to consider making substituted compliance determinations
with respect to four distinct categories of requirements, each of which raises separate issues and
will be discussed separately below. These categories are as follows: (i) requirements applicable
to registered security-based swap dealers in Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder; (ii) requirements relating to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of information on security-based swaps; (iii) requirements relating to clearing for
security-based swaps; and (iv) requirements relating to trade execution for security-based swaps.
With respect to each of these categories of requirements, the Commission is proposing a
“comparability” standard as the basis for making a substituted compliance determination.
Generally, the Commission would endeavor to take a holistic approach in making substituted
compliance determinations—that is, we would ultimately focus on regulatory outcomes as a
whole with respect to the requirements within the same category rather than a rule-by-rule
comparison. As noted above, 1095 efforts to regulate the derivatives market are underway, not
only in the United States, but also in other jurisdictions. Since their 2009 statement, the G20
leaders have reiterated their commitment to OTC derivatives regulatory reform. And, as
described above, 1096 the Commission has participated in numerous bilateral and multilateral
discussions with foreign regulatory authorities addressing the regulation of OTC derivatives and
foreign regulatory reform efforts. We recognize that foreign regulatory systems differ in their
approaches to achieving particular regulatory outcomes, and that foreign regulatory requirements
may differ from those ultimately adopted by the Commission, but may nonetheless achieve
regulatory outcomes comparable with the regulatory outcomes of the relevant provisions of the
Exchange Act added by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, we recognize that
1095

See Section I.C., supra.

1096

Id.

304

different regulatory systems may be able to achieve some or all of those regulatory outcomes by
using more – or fewer – specific requirements than the Commission. For example, under certain
circumstances, a foreign regulatory system may be able to achieve one of those regulatory
outcomes in the absence of one or more specific requirements that the Commission has
implemented under a particular set of provisions of the Dodd-Frank Act.
Accordingly, we do not envision that the Commission, in making a comparability
determination, would look to whether a foreign jurisdiction has implemented specific rules and
regulations that are comparable to rules and regulations adopted by the Commission. Rather, the
Commission would determine whether the foreign regulatory system in a particular area, taking
into consideration any relevant principles, regulations, or rules in other areas of the foreign
regulatory system to the extent they are relevant to the analysis, achieves regulatory outcomes
that are comparable to the regulatory outcomes of the relevant provisions of the Exchange Act.
If it does, the Commission preliminarily believes that a comparability determination would be
appropriate, notwithstanding differences in or the absence of specific requirements of particular
regulatory provisions.
In addition, the Commission recognizes that other regulatory systems are informed by the
business and market practices present in the foreign jurisdictions where those systems apply, and
that such practices may differ in certain respects from practices described in this release. More
broadly, other regulatory systems are informed by the characteristics of the markets for which
they were designed, including the number and nature of their market participants to which they
apply. In making a comparability determination, the Commission recognizes that it may need to
take into account such practices and characteristics in understanding the design and application
of another regulatory system and whether and how it may achieve regulatory outcomes
comparable to the regulatory outcomes of the relevant provisions of the Exchange Act.
As explained below, how the Commission would find a foreign regulatory system
“comparable” would vary depending on the category of requirements. Because the Commission
is proposing to make substituted compliance determinations with respect to each of the
aforementioned categories of requirements, it is possible that a foreign regulatory system would
be comparable with respect to some, but not all, categories of requirements. For instance, a
foreign regulatory system may impose requirements on non-U.S. dealers that achieve regulatory
outcomes comparable to the requirements applicable to registered security-based swap dealers in
Section 15F of the Exchange Act, but the same foreign regulatory system may not achieve
comparable regulatory outcomes regarding public reporting of trade information for securitybased swaps. Similarly, a foreign regulatory system may impose requirements on clearing
agencies that achieve regulatory outcomes comparable to the requirements applicable to
registered security-based swap clearing agencies under Section 17A of the Exchange Act, but
may not provide for comparable regulation of SB SEFs. By assessing each of these categories
separately, the Commission would have the flexibility to make a substituted compliance
determination with respect to one category of requirements but not another. However, the
Commission would also retain the flexibility to consider the extent to which principles,
regulations, or rules in one category may bear on a determination with respect to another
category. Such an approach also would allow substituted compliance in certain categories to
305

address competition and market efficiency concerns when a foreign regime is not comparable
across the full range of Title VII policy objectives.
In addition, as described below, in making substituted compliance determinations, the
Commission would consider a variety of factors that the Commission deems appropriate,
including the nature of the global security-based swap market and the scope and objectives of the
relevant foreign regulatory requirements. As part of this holistic review, the Commission would
consider the various ways in which a foreign regulatory system achieves its overall goals and
purposes, including those undertaken in response to the G20 commitments. As noted above, the
Commission would also consider the extent to which applicable principles, regulations, or rules
in one category may bear on a determination with respect to another category. In addition, the
Commission recognizes that our proposed application of Title VII to cross-border activities may
affect the policy decisions of these other regulators as they seek to address potential conflicts or
duplication in the regulatory requirements that apply to market participants under their authority.
More specifically, the proposed policy and procedural framework for substituted
compliance recognizes the potential, in a market as global as the security-based swap market, for
market participants who engage in cross-border security-based swap activity to be subject to
conflicting or duplicative compliance obligations. As a result of the efforts to implement the
G20 commitments in various jurisdictions described above, in some cases of cross-border
activity, market participants may be subject to compliance obligations in a foreign jurisdiction
that are similar to those imposed by the Exchange Act. The proposed framework would allow
the Commission to provide for substituted compliance to address the effect of conflicting or
duplicative regulations on competition and market efficiency and to facilitate a well-functioning
global security-based swap market. In other cases, however, market participants may not be
subject to conflicting or duplicative regulation because the foreign jurisdiction has not enacted
comprehensive regulation of the security-based swap markets or is still in the process of
implementing regulatory reforms that have been enacted. It also may be that the foreign
jurisdiction’s regulation does not apply to the market participant or entity or the foreign
jurisdiction has established regulations that differ, in material respects, from requirements in the
Exchange Act (e.g., requirements relating to real-time public reporting) and do not achieve
comparable regulatory outcomes. In such cases, there would be less justification for allowing
substituted compliance.
One alternative to making substituted compliance determinations by looking at separate
categories of requirements would be to provide substituted compliance across the entire set of
security-based swap requirements with respect to regimes that have implemented regulations
consistent with the overall objectives of the G20 commitments. Preliminarily, however, we
believe that making substituted compliance determinations on a regime-wide basis would be
unworkable in light of the Commission’s responsibility to implement the specific statutory
provisions of the Exchange Act added by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. While these
provisions of the Exchange Act are consistent with the G20 commitments, they also contain
provisions designed to achieve particular regulatory outcomes that may not be part of another
jurisdiction’s regulatory system. Thus, while the Commission would certainly consider the
broader regulatory landscape in a foreign jurisdiction—including its approach to the G20
commitments—before making a substituted compliance determination, the Commission would
306

also need to consider the particular regulatory outcomes achieved under the Exchange Act
provisions added by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.
In the following, we propose rules and interpretive guidance addressing the policy and
procedural framework under which we would consider permitting compliance with comparable
regulatory requirements in a foreign jurisdiction to substitute for compliance with requirements
of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, relating to security-based swaps,
with respect to each of the aforementioned categories of requirements.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of our general approach to substituted
compliance, including the following questions:
•

•

•
•

Should the Commission make substituted compliance determinations on a regimewide basis for a jurisdiction rather than with respect to categories of requirements? If
so, should the finding that the regulatory outcomes of a foreign regulatory system are
not comparable with respect to the regulatory outcomes of one category of the
Exchange Act requirements cause the Commission to find the entire foreign
regulatory regime to be not comparable as a whole? More specifically, under a
regime-wide approach, how should the Commission make substituted compliance
determinations with respect to foreign regulatory systems that do not achieve
regulatory outcomes comparable to the regulatory outcomes with respect to certain
categories of the Exchange Act requirements, taking into account the Commission’s
responsibility and statutory authority to implement the requirements of the Exchange
Act added by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act?
Should the Commission take into consideration the various ways in which a foreign
regulatory system achieves its overall goals and purposes that are consistent with the
G20 commitments in making a substituted compliance determination with respect a
category of the Exchange Act requirements added by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank
Act? Why or why not?
Should the Commission take a more granular approach to substituted compliance
determinations, for example, conducting a rule-by-rule or requirement-byrequirement comparison? Why or why not?
Should the Commission identify more or less categories in our framework for
substituted compliance? If so, how should those categories be demarcated?

B. Process for Making Substituted Compliance Requests
The Commission is proposing to amend our Rules of General Application to establish
procedures pursuant to which it would consider applications for substituted compliance
determinations with respect to each of the aforementioned categories of requirements. 1097 These
procedures are similar to those now used by the Commission in considering exemptive order
1097

Proposed Rule 0-13 under the Exchange Act.

307

applications under Section 36 of the Exchange Act. 1098 All supporting documentation submitted
pursuant to the proposed amendment would be made public.
Specifically, the proposed amendment would add new Rule 0-13 under the Exchange Act
setting forth the general procedures for submission of requests for substituted compliance
determinations. These procedures include the requirement that all applications for substituted
compliance determinations must be in writing in the form of a letter, must include any supporting
documents necessary to make the application complete, and otherwise must comply with 17 CFR
§ 240.0-3 (Filing of Material with the Commission). 1099 All applications must be submitted to
the Office of the Secretary of the Commission, and may be submitted either electronically 1100 or
in paper format. 1101 In addition, all filings and supporting documentation filed pursuant to this
proposed rule must be in the English language. 1102 If an application is incomplete, the
Commission may request that the application be withdrawn unless the applicant can justify,
based on all the facts and circumstances, why supporting materials have not been submitted and
undertakes to submit promptly the omitted materials. 1103
The Commission would not consider hypothetical or anonymous requests for a
substituted compliance order. 1104 Consistent with this position, every application (electronic or
paper) must contain the name, address, telephone number, and email address of each applicant
and the name, address, telephone number, and email address of a person to whom any questions
regarding the application should be directed. 1105 In addition, each applicant must provide the
Commission with any supporting documentation it believes necessary for the Commission to
make the requested substituted compliance determination, including information regarding
applicable requirements established by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities, as
well as the methods used by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities to monitor
1098

See 17 CFR § 240.0-12. Cf. 17 CFR § 30.10 (Petitions for Exemptions), including Appendices A

a fair and accurate English translation of the entire foreign language document. A party may
submit a copy of the unabridged foreign language document when including an English
translation of a foreign language document in a filing or submission filed pursuant to this rule. A
party must provide a copy of any foreign language document upon the request of Commission
staff. Id.

applicable precedent related to a substituted compliance determination. 1107 Any amendments to
an application would be required to be prepared and submitted as set forth in the proposed
procedures and marked to show what changes were made. 1108
Under the proposed rule, after the filing of an application for a substituted compliance
determination is complete, Division of Trading and Markets staff would review the application
and make a recommendation to the Commission. 1109 After consideration of the recommendation
by the Commission, the Commission's Office of the Secretary would issue an appropriate
response and would notify the applicant. 1110 As part of our review, the Commission may, in our
sole discretion, schedule a hearing on the matter addressed by the application. 1111 The
Commission also may, in our sole discretion, choose to publish in the Federal Register a notice
that the application has been submitted which invites public comment on the application. 1112
Requestors may, however, seek confidential treatment of their applications for substituted
compliance determinations. 1113
The Commission preliminarily believes that these proposed procedures would provide
sufficient guidance regarding the process whereby persons may seek to make a request for a
substituted compliance determination with respect to each of the categories of requirements, as
described more fully below.

Should the substituted compliance framework contemplate foreign regulatory
authorities, rather than or in addition to market participants, submitting substituted
compliance determination requests? Why or why not?

1. Proposed Rule—Commission Substituted Compliance Determinations
The Commission is proposing a rule that would establish a framework in which the
Commission may make a substituted compliance determination permitting a foreign securitybased swap dealer that is registered with the Commission to satisfy requirements in Section 15F
of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, by complying with the
corresponding rules and regulations established in a foreign jurisdiction. 1114 Specifically, the
proposed rule would provide that the Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by
order, make a substituted compliance determination with respect to a foreign financial regulatory
system that compliance with specified requirements under such foreign financial regulatory
system by a registered foreign security-based swap dealer (or class thereof) 1115 may satisfy the
corresponding requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, that would otherwise apply to such foreign security-based swap dealer (or class
thereof). 1116 The proposed framework would permit the Commission to make a substituted
compliance determination only if we find that the requirements of such foreign financial
regulatory system are comparable to otherwise applicable requirements, taking into account
factors that the Commission determines appropriate, such as, for example, the scope and
objectives of the relevant foreign regulatory requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the
supervisory compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by a

1114

Proposed Rule 3a71-5 under the Exchange Act.

1115

The Commission is proposing a framework under which it may consider making substituted
compliance determinations applicable to bona fide foreign security-based swap dealers. This
proposed approach would not extend to entities organized outside of the United States for the
purpose of evading U.S. regulation. The Commission would consider a variety of factors to
confirm the bona fide nature of a foreign security-based swap dealer for these purposes, including
the location of management and risk controls related to such entity’s security-based swap dealing
activities and the nature of the counterparties.

1116

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(a)(1) under the Exchange Act.

foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities in such system to support its oversight of
such foreign security-based swap dealer (or any class thereof). 1117
In making a substituted compliance determination, as noted above, the Commission’s
determination would focus on the similarities in regulatory objectives, rather than requiring that
the foreign jurisdiction’s rules be identical. Depending on our assessment of the comparability
of the foreign regulatory regime, the Commission could condition the substituted compliance
determination by limiting it to a particular class or classes of registrants in the foreign
jurisdiction. 1118 For instance, if the foreign jurisdiction imposes different levels of supervisory
oversight with respect to classes of entities conducting security-based swap dealing activity, the
Commission could limit a substituted compliance determination to permit only certain classes of
supervised foreign security-based swap dealers to rely on a substituted compliance
determination. The Commission would determine what conditions are appropriate on a case-bycase basis.
The proposed rule would require that, before making a substituted compliance
determination, the Commission must have entered into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or
other arrangement with the appropriate financial regulatory authority or authorities in that
jurisdiction addressing oversight and supervision of applicable security-based swap dealers
subject to the substituted compliance determination. 1119 Through such MOU or other
arrangement, the Commission and the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities would
express their commitment to cooperate with each other to fulfill their respective regulatory
mandates.
Although we intend generally to take a category-by-category approach to substituted
compliance, under the proposed rule, the Commission could make a substituted compliance
determination with respect to one Title VII requirement applicable to registered security-based
swap dealers but not another. 1120 However, consistent with our category-by-category approach,
we believe that certain requirements are interrelated such that the Commission would expect to
make a substituted compliance determination for the entire group of related requirements. For
1117

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(a)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act. In assessing oversight, the Commission
would consider not only overall oversight activities, but also oversight specifically directed at
conduct and activity that would be relevant to the substituted compliance determination. For
example, it would be difficult for the Commission to make a comparability determination if
oversight is directed solely at the local activities of foreign security-based swap dealers, as
opposed to the cross-border activities of such dealers.

1118

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(a)(1) under the Exchange Act (permitting the Commission to make the
substituted compliance determination “conditionally or unconditionally”).

1119

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(a)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act. The Commission expects that any
existing supervisory or enforcement MOU or other arrangement would need to be re-negotiated
during the substituted compliance determination process to reflect the particulars of a
determination.

1120

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(a) under the Exchange Act.

example, the core entity-level requirements relate to the regulation of an entity’s capital and
margin. But certain other entity-level requirements (such as risk management, general
recordkeeping and reporting, and diligent supervision) are so interconnected with capital and
margin oversight that we would expect to make substituted compliance determinations, where
warranted with regard to capital and margin rules, on the entire package of entity-level
regulations.
The proposed rule also would permit the Commission, on our own initiative, to modify
the terms of, or withdraw, a substituted compliance determination for a particular foreign
jurisdiction, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment. 1121 For instance, due to
changes in the foreign regulatory regime, or a failure of a foreign regulator to exercise its
supervisory or enforcement authority in an effective manner, the Commission may determine to
modify the terms of, or withdraw, a previous substituted compliance determination. The
Commission also would have the ability to periodically review the substituted compliance
determinations it has granted and decide whether the substituted compliance determination
should continue to apply.
In addition, the proposed rule would permit a foreign security-based swap dealer to rely
on an applicable substituted compliance determination by the Commission with regard to a
particular jurisdiction to satisfy the specified requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act,
and the rules and regulations thereunder, as applicable, by complying with the corresponding
requirements established in the foreign jurisdiction. 1122 The proposed rule would require a
foreign security-based swap dealer relying on a substituted compliance determination to satisfy
the conditions of the Commission’s substituted compliance determination. 1123
Finally, the proposed rule would address the situation in which a foreign security-based
swap dealer seeks to rely on the rules and regulations of a foreign jurisdiction to satisfy
Commission requirements but the Commission has not previously made a substituted compliance
determination with respect to that jurisdiction. In such a case, the proposed rule would permit
the foreign security-based swap dealer, or a group of foreign security-based swap dealers, to
request pursuant to the procedures set forth in proposed Rule 0-13 under the Exchange Act, that
the Commission make a substituted compliance determination for the foreign jurisdiction with
respect to specified requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act. 1124 The proposed rule
would require that the foreign security-based swap dealer (or foreign security-based swap
dealers) be directly supervised by one or more financial regulatory authorities in that jurisdiction
with respect to requirements similar to those in Section 15F of the Exchange Act, and the rules

and regulations thereunder, 1125 and provide the certification and opinion of counsel as described
in proposed Rule 15Fb2-4(c) under the Exchange Act. 1126
Although the request for a substituted compliance determination could come from a
particular foreign security-based swap dealer or group of dealers, the Commission would make
such a determination, under the proposed rule, on a class or jurisdiction basis, depending on the
regulator(s) and the foreign regulatory regime (rather than on a firm-by-firm basis). 1127 As a
result, once the Commission has made a substituted compliance determination with respect to a
particular foreign jurisdiction, it would apply to every foreign security-based swap dealer in the
specified class or classes registered and regulated in that jurisdiction, subject to the conditions
specified in the Commission’s substituted compliance order.
The proposed rule would not provide for substituted compliance with respect to
registration requirements described in Sections 15F(a) – (d) of the Exchange Act and the rules
and regulations thereunder. 1128 As an initial matter, the registration process serves two important
notice functions for the Commission. First, it is through the submission of a registration
application that security-based swap dealers notify the Commission that they are engaged in
dealing activity in excess of the de minimis threshold. Second, the registration application
process is how foreign security-based swap dealers notify the Commission that they intend to
seek or to rely on an existing substituted compliance determination. 1129 In addition to these key
notice functions, the registration process provides the Commission with information that is
essential to the Commission’s ability to provide effective oversight of foreign security-based
1125

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(c)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act.

1126

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(c)(2)(ii) under the Exchange Act. Proposed Rule 15Fb2-4 under the
Exchange Act, as discussed in the Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65799-801, would
require that a nonresident security-based swap dealer provide the Commission with an opinion of
counsel concurring that the firm can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with prompt
access to its books and records and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and
examination by the Commission. See Section III.C.3(b)ix, supra. The Commission preliminarily
believes that, before a foreign security-based swap dealer should be permitted to make a
substituted compliance request, it should assure the Commission that it can provide the
Commission with prompt access to books and records and submit to onsite inspection and
examination because we expect that access to books and records and the ability to inspect and
examine a foreign security-based swap dealer will be essential conditions of any substituted
compliance determination.

1127

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(a) under the Exchange Act. Because, under the proposed approach, all
requests for substituted compliance determinations must come directly from a foreign securitybased swap dealer, foreign financial regulatory authorities may not themselves request such a
determination.

their obligations under Section 15F requirements. 1130 As a result, we are not proposing to allow
substituted compliance for the registration requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act.
2. Discussion
The goal of the proposed rule is to increase the efficiency of the security-based swap
market and promote competition by helping to avoid subjecting foreign security-based swap
dealers to potentially conflicting or duplicative compliance obligations, while still achieving the
policy objectives of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission preliminarily believes
that the proposed rule, by requiring that a substituted compliance determination be made on a
class or jurisdictional basis and that a foreign jurisdiction’s requirements be comparable to
otherwise applicable U.S. requirements, is consistent with this goal.
In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that such an approach is consistent
with the global nature of the security-based swap market and may be less disruptive of entity
business arrangements than not permitting substituted compliance. At the same time, the
Commission recognizes that U.S. security-based swap dealers may be put at a competitive
disadvantage with their foreign counterparts if they are subject to, for example, more stringent
capital or margin requirements than foreign security-based swap dealers. For instance, all other
things being equal, a foreign security-based swap dealer that is subject to lower capital
requirements would be able to enter into a security-based swap with a customer at a more
competitive price than a U.S. security-based swap dealer that is subject to a higher capital
requirement. Of course, more stringent capital or margin requirements could equally be viewed
as a source of competitive advantage, with counterparties having greater confidence in the
financial stability of U.S. counterparties.
One alternative to the proposed approach would be to impose uniform compliance on all
registered security-based swap dealers rather than permitting substituted compliance for
registered foreign security-based swap dealers. If the Commission were to adopt a uniform
approach to the application of Section 15F requirements to registered U.S. and foreign securitybased swap dealers without allowing for substituted compliance, foreign security-based swap
dealers may find that complying with the Commission’s capital, margin, and other entity-level
rules would subject them to duplicative or conflicting requirements and may put them at a
competitive disadvantage as a result.
1130

As part of the registration process, nonresident security-based swap dealers must (i) appoint an
agent for service of process in the United States, (ii) furnish the Commission with the identity and
address of its agent for services of process, (iii) certify that the firm can, as a matter of law,
provide the Commission with prompt access to its books and records and can, as a matter of law,
submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission, and (iv) provide the
Commission with an opinion of counsel concurring that the firm can, as a matter of law, provide
the Commission with prompt access to its books and records and can, as a matter of law, submit
to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. See proposed Rule 15Fb2-4 under the
Exchange Act, as discussed in the Registration Proposing Release, 77 FR at 65799-801

314

As discussed above, the Dodd-Frank Act divides the entity-level regulatory oversight of
security-based swap dealers between the Commission and prudential regulators. 1131 This
statutory division of authority means that the Commission is not responsible for the capital and
margin regulation of bank security-based swap dealers and, therefore, does not have the authority
to make substituted compliance determinations in those areas for dealers that are banks. As a
result, the Commission’s provision of substituted compliance for capital and margin
requirements only would extend to nonbank security-based swap dealers, whereas the
Commission’s substituted compliance determinations for all other entity-level requirements
would apply to both bank and nonbank security-based swap dealers.
In addition to this statutory limitation on the Commission’s ability to provide for
substituted compliance in certain areas, the Commission also may consider the rationale for
different capital treatment of banks and nonbanks in the United States. As discussed above, the
Commission’s proposed capital rules for nonbank security-based swap dealers differ from those
that would be applicable to bank dealers as proposed by the prudential regulators in that the
Commission’s proposed capital standards are principally focused on the retention of highly
liquid assets that can be distributed to customers. 1132 Assuming that the Commission adopts
capital standards for nonbank security-based swap dealers as proposed, the Commission’s
comparability determinations regarding entity-level requirements would likely analyze separately
the capital treatment of nonbank entities in jurisdictions that do not impose a comparable net
liquid assets test. In performing such an analysis, the Commission would take into account the
other principles, rules, and regulations of the foreign jurisdiction that may be relevant to the
analysis. It also would consider whether nonbank dealers in that jurisdiction are permitted to
hold more illiquid assets as regulatory capital compared to the assets permitted to be held under
the capital rules adopted by the Commission and, if so, whether nonbank dealers in that
jurisdiction have access to sufficient liquidity at the entity level to support the liabilities they
incur out of their business activity. 1133 Similarly, the Commission would need to consider the
impact of any reduced liquidity associated with the application of foreign capital standards on the
ability of nonbank dealers in such jurisdiction to wind down operations quickly and distribute
assets to customers. 1134 As this example illustrates, however, even when separately analyzing
capital requirements, the Commission’s focus would remain on ensuring not that the foreign
jurisdiction has identical rules but on ensuring that a foreign jurisdiction that applies capital rules
that do not impose a comparable net liquid assets test to nonbank security-based swap dealers
can achieve the regulatory outcomes comparable to those intended under the Dodd-Frank Act.
Similarly, consistent with our category-based approach, the Commission’s comparability
determination with respect to the requirements set forth in Section 15F of the Exchange Act
generally would not depend on the comparability of the goals achieved by foreign jurisdiction’s

capital and margin requirements taken alone but also would, in light of the interconnectedness of
capital and margin with related entity-level requirements, take into account regulatory outcomes
of other aspects of the jurisdiction’s requirements. Although we believe that capital and margin
requirements are at the core of a robust internal risk controls system at a firm, equally
foundational to the financial integrity of a firm are effective internal risk management procedures
and the effectiveness of other relevant foreign regulatory requirements that are connected to an
entity’s financial integrity. As noted above, the Commission is proposing to permit substituted
compliance, not only with capital and margin requirements, but also with such other related
entity-level requirements as the Commission finds appropriate. 1135 The Commission
preliminarily believes that this approach to substituted compliance in the context of entity-level
requirements will benefit foreign security-based swap dealers by allowing them to comply,
where possible, with a single set of entity-level requirements where a substituted compliance
determination is deemed appropriate, while ensuring that all registered security-based swap
dealers are subject to robust entity-level oversight.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed rule establishing a
policy and procedural framework for making substituted compliance determinations for
registered foreign security-based swap dealers, including the following:

1135

•

What, if any, are the likely competitive effects, within the U.S. security-based swap
market and among U.S. security-based swap dealers, of the proposed approach for
application of substituted compliance for foreign security-based swap dealers? Please
describe the specific nature of any such effects.

•

The Commission generally solicits comments on the appropriateness and clarity of
the proposed rule. Should additional details be included regarding any aspects of the
proposed rule?

•

As discussed above, in making a substituted compliance determination, the
Commission would ultimately focus on the comparability of regulatory outcomes
rather than a rule-by-rule comparison. Is this holistic approach to making a
substituted compliance determination appropriate? If not, why not?

•

Is the comparability standard appropriate and sufficiently clear? Should additional
detail be provided as to what would and would not satisfy this standard? If so, what
additional detail should be provided? Should a different standard be used? If so,
what should be the standard and why?

•

As discussed above, in making a substituted compliance determination, the
Commission would consider factors such as the scope and objectives of the relevant
foreign regulatory requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory

See Section XII.B.1, supra.

316

compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised. Are
these factors appropriate? Are the enumerated factors too broad or too narrow? What
other factors should the Commission consider?
•

When assessing the effectiveness of a foreign jurisdiction’s supervisory compliance
program should the Commission consider factors such as the existence of a dedicated
examination program, the expertise of examiners, the existence of a risk monitoring
framework and an examination plan, and the existence of a disciplinary program to
enforce compliance with laws? Similarly, when assessing the effectiveness of a
foreign jurisdiction’s enforcement program, should the Commission consider factors
such as whether the program is actively administered, resourced, and transparent?

•

As discussed above, the Commission could condition a substituted compliance
determination by limiting it to a particular class or classes of registrants in the foreign
jurisdiction, in which case the Commission would determine what conditions are
appropriate on a case-by-case basis. What, if any, are the competitive effects of the
proposed approach with respect to conditional substituted compliance
determinations?

•

As discussed above, the proposed rule permits the Commission, on our own initiative,
to modify or withdraw a substituted compliance determination for a particular foreign
jurisdiction, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment. In the event that
the Commission determines that a previous substituted compliance determination
needs to be further conditioned or even withdrawn, how much advance notice would
be sufficient to permit market participants to adjust their activities to reflect the
modification or withdrawal? For example, would 60 days be appropriate? Should the
opportunity for comment be made public? Why or why not?

•

Should a review period or “sunset provision” to revisit a previous substituted
compliance determination be required? If so, what should the appropriate time period
be for such review period or sunset provision?

•

Should the ability of a foreign security-based swap dealer to take advantage of
substituted compliance be conditioned on it not transacting with certain classes of
U.S. counterparties, such as persons that do not meet the definition of qualified
institutional buyer, as defined in Securities Act Rule 144A (17 CFR §
230.144A(a)(1)) (“QIB”), or some other threshold, such as qualified investor, as
defined in Section 3(a)(54) of the Exchange Act? Would such counterparties be less
able to appreciate the differences between engaging in security-based swap
transactions with a security-based dealer subject to relevant provisions of Title VII
versus a security-based swap dealer complying with comparable foreign regulations
than a QIB or qualified investor? Would such an approach result in meaningful
safeguards that would justify adopting such an approach? Is the use of such a
substituted compliance regime likely to have a disparate impact on any particular
class of counterparties? What are the potential advantages or disadvantages
(including in terms of risk, competition, and counterparty protection) to
317

counterparties, foreign security-based swap dealers, and U.S. security-based swap
dealers in restricting the use of substituted compliance to transactions involving
certain classes of U.S. counterparties?
•

As discussed above, the proposed rule permits a foreign security-based swap dealer or
group of foreign security-based swap dealers to submit a request that the Commission
make a substituted compliance determination for the foreign jurisdiction with respect
to specified requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act. Is the proposed
procedure for submitting such requests sufficiently clear? Should additional details
be included regarding any aspects of the proposed procedure?

•

Do the proposed substituted compliance rules appropriately reflect the goal to
increase the efficiency of the security-based swap market and promote competition by
avoiding (as appropriate) subjecting foreign security-based swap dealers to
potentially conflicting or duplicative compliance obligations? Would it be more
appropriate to make substituted compliance determinations on a firm-by-firm basis
rather than a class or jurisdictional basis? If so, why?

•

Should entity-level requirements be treated separately for purposes of substituted
compliance determinations, or should they be considered as a package of regulations?

•

Should the Commission permit substituted compliance with respect to external
business conduct standards in Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder? Would allowing substituted compliance impair the
Commission’s ability to enforce the business conduct standards that the Dodd-Frank
Act added to the Exchange Act?

•

Should the Commission permit substituted compliance in transactions between
registered non-U.S. dealers and U.S. persons?

•

Should the Commission permit substituted compliance in transactions by registered
non-U.S. dealers within the United States?

•

Would allowing substituted compliance impair the Commission’s ability to enforce
the business conduct standards that the Dodd-Frank Act added to the Exchange Act
relating to counterparty protection, particularly with respect to “special entities”?

•

Should the Commission not permit substituted compliance with respect to the
conflicts of interest duties described in Section 15F(j)(5) of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder? Why or why not? In particular, would allowing
substituted compliance with respect to these requirements impair the Commission’s
ability to enforce these counterparty protections that the Dodd-Frank added to the
Exchange Act? Why or why not? Should the foreign dealing subsidiaries of U.S.
parents be allowed to take advantage of substituted compliance for entity-level
requirements if they engage in U.S. Business?

318

•

Should there be a threshold requirement that foreign security-based swap dealers
engage in a predominately foreign business in order to rely on substituted
compliance? If so, how should the “predominantly foreign business” threshold be
measured? Should it be based on the relative notional amount of the security-based
swap business of foreign security-based swap dealers with U.S. persons compared to
the notional amount of their security-based swap business with non-U.S. persons? If
so, what should the threshold be (e.g., 80% Foreign Business by notional amount?
More than 50%?)?

•

Should the Commission consider providing substituted compliance determinations
related to capital regulation in jurisdictions that apply Basel-based capital standards to
nonbank security-based swap dealers? Why or why not?

•

In what ways are Basel-based capital standards as applied to nonbank security-based
swap dealers consistent with the Commission’s own capital standards for nonbank
security-based swap dealers? In what ways are they inconsistent?

•

While the Commission is determining whether to make an initial set of substituted
compliance determinations, should the Commission delay compliance with the
requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, relating
to security-based swap dealers for foreign security-based swap dealers? Are there
some requirements that would be appropriate for delayed compliance? If so, please
specify which ones and explain why. Are there other regulatory or market interests
that the Commission should consider in determining the scope of the delayed
compliance provision? If so, please describe those interests and how the proposed
rule should address them.

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed policy and procedural framework
for making substituted compliance determinations for registered foreign securitybased swap dealers? How would the application of the proposed policy and
procedural framework affect the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global
marketplace (both in the United States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the
proposed approach place any market participants at a competitive disadvantage or
advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed approach be a more general
burden on competition? If so, please explain. What other measures should the
Commission consider to implement the proposed policy and procedural framework?
What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects of alternatives to the
proposed approach discussed in this release?

•

Should the Commission permit substituted compliance in transactions between
registered non-U.S. dealers and U.S. persons?

•

Should the Commission permit substituted compliance in transactions by registered
non-U.S. dealers within the United States?

319

D. Regulatory Reporting and Public Dissemination
As initially proposed, Regulation SBSR did not contemplate that the reporting and public
dissemination requirements associated with cross-border security-based swaps could be satisfied
by complying with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction instead of U.S. rules. Thus, counterparties
to a security-based swap would be required to comply with proposed Regulation SBSR even if
the security-based swap also was, for example, reported to a foreign data repository or a foreign
regulatory authority.
In response to this proposed approach, several commenters stated that requiring
counterparties to report cross-border security-based swaps in more than one jurisdiction could
result in duplicative or inconsistent reporting, unnecessary expense and administrative burden,
and potential conflicts with another jurisdiction’s confidentiality requirements. 1136 Commenters
suggested various ways to address these issues. Some recommended generally that the
Commission coordinate our trade reporting regime with those of other jurisdictions. 1137 Two
commenters urged regulators to encourage the development of a single, global trade repository
for each asset class. 1138 One of these commenters also stated that, in the absence of a global
trade repository, regulators should implement internationally compatible reporting systems so
that cross-border security-based swaps would not have to be reported twice. 1139 Another
commenter suggested that the Commission define the term “security-based swap” to exclude a
transaction that is reported to a non-U.S. trade repository, which would have the effect of
eliminating any U.S. reporting requirement because the transaction would not be a security-based
swap. 1140 Several commenters recommended that the Commission refrain from imposing any
reporting requirements on security-based swaps that are reported pursuant to comparable rules of
another jurisdiction. 1141
1136

See, e.g., AIMA Letter at 6; DTCC Letter II at 21; ISDA/SIFMA Letter I at 18. While not
specifically addressing reporting requirements, another commenter believed generally that the
U.S. branches of Japanese banks should not be subject to Title VII requirements, because such
banks will be subject to comprehensive regulation under Japanese law. See Japanese Banks
Letter at 4 (arguing that application of Title VII would be “superfluous at best” and could subject
foreign banks to potentially inconsistent requirements).

1137

See AIMA Letter at 6; ISDA/SIFMA Letter I at 18 (urging the Commission to “consult with
foreign regulators before establishing the extra-territorial scope of the rules promulgated under
Title VII”); Markit Letter III at 2 (arguing that the SEC and CFTC should “harmonize their
regulations with those of international regulators to the extent possible”).

320

The Commission is sympathetic to the desire to avoid redundant or conflicting reporting
requirements, to the extent consistent with applicable statutory requirements. The Commission
participates in a number of international organizations and initiatives that seek to coordinate
regulation of the global OTC derivatives market, and the Commission staff has engaged in
ongoing bilateral discussions with a number of foreign regulators on the subject of cross-border
security-based swap activity. The Commission preliminarily believes that regulatory reporting
of security-based swap transaction data is crucial to allow it and other regulators more effectively
to carry out their statutorily assigned functions, which include the assessment of systemic
risks. 1142 In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that public dissemination generally
would increase efficiency and price competition in the security-based swap market. 1143 The
Commission preliminarily believes, therefore, that our own efforts to promote these goals should
be implemented as quickly as practicable.
It is possible that other jurisdictions will implement reporting and dissemination regimes
for security-based swap transactions that are comparable to the one set forth in Title VII and
Regulation SBSR. In anticipation of that possibility, the Commission is now proposing rules
regarding substituted compliance relating to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of
security-based swaps, which are described below.
1. General
Proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(i) would provide that the Commission could, conditionally or
unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination with respect to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination in a foreign jurisdiction if such foreign jurisdiction
imposes a comparable system for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of all
security-based swaps.
Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 1144 provides that all security-based swaps that are
not accepted for clearing shall be subject to regulatory reporting. Section 13(m)(1)(G) of the
Exchange Act 1145 provides that each security-based swap (whether cleared or uncleared) shall be
reported to a registered SDR, and Section 13(m)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act 1146 generally
provides that transaction, volume, and pricing data of all security-based swaps shall be publicly
disseminated. However, these statutory provisions do not address whether, or the extent to
international trade repository, regulators should recognize trade repositories in other
jurisdictions); Société Générale Letter I at 11 (recommending deference to foreign regulators that
have a comparable regulatory scheme).

which, these requirements should apply to cross-border security-based swaps. Reporting
security-based swap transactions pursuant to the regimes of both the United States and a foreign
jurisdiction could be duplicative and potentially burdensome. Re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(i)
would provide generally that compliance with a comparable system of a foreign jurisdiction for
the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of all security-based swaps could, if certain
conditions are met, be substituted for compliance with U.S. rules to satisfy the goals and
objectives of these Title VII requirements.
2. Security-Based Swaps Eligible and Not Eligible for Substituted Compliance
The Commission preliminarily believes that, if a foreign jurisdiction applies a
comparable system for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of an entity’s securitybased swaps, it would be appropriate not to apply the U.S. requirements in addition to the
requirements of that foreign jurisdiction. Where the Commission has found that a foreign
jurisdiction’s reporting and public dissemination requirements are comparable to those
implemented by the Commission, we expect to make a substituted compliance determination
with respect to such jurisdiction for these requirements. The Commission is re-proposing Rule
908(c)(1) to provide that compliance with the regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements in Sections 13(m) and 13A of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, may be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction that is the
subject of a substituted compliance order issued by the Commission, provided that, with respect
to at least one of the direct counterparties to the security-based swap:
(i) Such counterparty is either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch; and
(ii) No person within the United States is directly involved in executing, soliciting, or
negotiating the terms of the security-based swap on behalf of such counterparty.
The Commission preliminarily believes that, if at least one direct counterparty to a
security-based swap is a non-U.S. person (even if the non-U.S. person is a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant, or is guaranteed by a U.S. person) and no person
within the United States is directly involved in executing, soliciting, or negotiating the terms of
the security-based swap on behalf of that counterparty, the security-based swap should be
eligible for substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination.
Thus, substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination could
apply even in the instance of a security-based swap with a direct counterparty that is operating
from within the United States, so long as the other direct counterparty is a non-U.S. person and
no person within the United States is directly involved in executing, soliciting, or negotiating the
terms of the security-based swap on behalf of that non-U.S. person. This approach is designed to
limit disincentives for non-U.S. persons to transact security-based swaps with U.S. persons by
allowing compliance with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction to be substituted for compliance with
U.S. rules when the non-U.S. person transacts with a U.S. person.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that the approach proposed above with
respect to non-U.S. persons should be extended to the foreign branches of U.S. banks. As a
result, we are proposing to allow the possibility of substituted compliance with respect to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination if at least one counterparty of a security-based
322

swap is the foreign branch of a U.S. bank, as long as no person within the United States is
directly involved in executing, soliciting, or negotiating the terms of the security-based swap on
behalf of such foreign branch. 1147 This approach is designed to promote access of foreign
branches of U.S. banks to the local markets in which those branches are located. Assume, for
example, that a substituted compliance determination with respect to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination applied to a foreign jurisdiction and a transaction involved, on one side, a
local, non-U.S. person market participant, and the security-based swap is required to be reported
and publicly disseminated under the rules of that foreign jurisdiction regardless of whether the
counterparty on the other side is a local dealer or a foreign branch of a U.S. bank. If substituted
compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination were in effect, the fact
that the foreign branch is a counterparty would not cause the transaction to have to be reported
pursuant to U.S. rules in addition to the foreign jurisdiction’s rules.
Consistent with the factors described above, the Commission preliminarily believes that
certain kinds of security-based swaps should not be eligible for substituted compliance with
respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination, even if they might be subject to
reporting and public dissemination requirements in a foreign jurisdiction. 1148 As noted above,
re-proposed Rule 908(c)(1) would provide that a security-based swap would be eligible for
substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination where both
of the following conditions apply to at least one direct counterparty to the transaction: (i) such
counterparty is either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch; and (ii) the security-based swap
transaction is not solicited, negotiated, or executed by a person within the United States on
behalf of such counterparty. Thus, a security-based swap between two U.S. persons would not
be eligible for substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination, even if the security-based swap were solicited, negotiated, and executed outside
the United States. 1149
Furthermore, re-proposed Rule 908(c)(1) would not allow for the possibility of
substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if both
direct counterparties (or their agents)—regardless of place of domicile—solicit, negotiate, or
execute a security-based swap from within the United States. The Commission preliminarily
believes that U.S. rules for regulatory reporting and public dissemination should apply to
transactions where all or the major part of actions associated with the security-based swap, on
both sides of the transaction, are performed within the United States.

1147

See Section III.B.6, supra (discussing the definition of “foreign branch” in proposed Rule 3a713(a)(1) under the Exchange Act).

1148

If the rules of a foreign jurisdiction would not apply to the security-based swap, there would be
no need to consider the possibility of substituted compliance, because there would be no foreign
rules that could substitute for the applicable U.S. rules.

1149

This assumes that neither U.S. person is acting through a foreign branch. If either U.S. person
were acting through a foreign branch, the security-based swap between those U.S. persons would
be eligible for substituted compliance.

323

The following examples explain the operation of re-proposed Rule 908(c)(1). In all
examples, assume that the Commission has issued a substituted compliance order with respect to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination that applies to the foreign jurisdiction:
•

Example 1. A bank in country X—solely through personnel located in country X—
executes a security-based swap over the phone with a U.S. person located in New
York, and no person within the United States is directly involved in soliciting,
negotiating, or executing the terms of the security-based swap on behalf of the foreign
bank. The security-based swap is not cleared. The security-based swap would be
eligible for substituted compliance, regardless of whether the foreign bank is
registered in any capacity with the Commission.

•

Example 2. A foreign branch of a U.S. bank located in country X executes a securitybased swap over the phone with a U.S. person located in New York. The foreign
branch uses staff located solely in country X to solicit, negotiate, and execute the
security-based swap. The security-based swap is not cleared. The security-based
swap would be eligible for substituted compliance.

•

Example 3. Two foreign branches of U.S. banks, both located in country X, execute a
security-based swap in country X. The security-based swap transaction is not
solicited, negotiated, or executed by a person within the United States on behalf of
either counterparty. The security-based swap would be eligible for substituted
compliance.

•

Example 4. Two New York branches of foreign banks execute a security-based
swap. Persons acting on behalf of each bank are located within the United States and
are involved in soliciting, negotiating, and executing the terms of the security-based
swap. The security-based swap would not be eligible for substituted compliance.

•

Example 5. Same facts as Example 4, except that one foreign bank, instead of
soliciting, negotiating, or executing the security-based swap using persons associated
with its New York branch, uses only persons located in its home office to perform
such functions. The security-based swap would be eligible for substituted
compliance.

•

Example 6. A foreign subsidiary (C1) of a U.S. person executes a security-based
swap with a U.S. person (C2). No person within the United States solicits, negotiates,
or executes the security-based swap on behalf of the foreign subsidiary C1. The
security-based swap would be eligible for substituted compliance, regardless of the
location of persons who executed, solicited, or negotiated the security-based swap on
behalf of the U.S. person C2, and regardless of whether the foreign subsidiary C1 is
guaranteed by a U.S. person.

3. Requests for Substituted Compliance
Proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) would provide that any person that executes a security-based
swap that would, in the absence of a substituted compliance order, be required to be reported
324

pursuant to Regulation SBSR may file an application, pursuant to the procedures set forth in
proposed Rule 0-13, 1150 requesting that the Commission make a substituted compliance
determination regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination with respect to a foreign
jurisdiction the rules of which also would require reporting and public dissemination of the
security-based swap. Proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(ii) would further provide that such application
shall include the reasons therefor and such other information as the Commission may request.
The Commission would consider those reasons as well as information derived from other sources
in considering whether to grant a substituted compliance order with respect to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination.
4. Findings Necessary for Substituted Compliance
Re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii) would provide that, in making a substituted compliance
determination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction, the Commission shall take into account such
factors as the Commission determines are appropriate, such as the scope and objectives of the
relevant foreign regulatory requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory
compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by the foreign
financial regulatory authority to support oversight of its regulatory reporting and public
dissemination system for security-based swaps. Furthermore, the Commission would not make a
substituted compliance determination with respect to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination unless the Commission found that:
(A) The data elements that are required to be reported pursuant to the rules of the foreign
jurisdiction are comparable to those required to be reported pursuant to § 242.901;
(B) The rules of the foreign jurisdiction require the security-based swap to be reported
and publicly disseminated in a manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by
§§ 242.900-911;
(C) The Commission has direct electronic access 1151 to the security-based swap data held
by a trade repository or foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swaps are
reported pursuant to the rules of that foreign jurisdiction; and
(D) Any trade repository or foreign regulatory authority in the foreign jurisdiction that
receives and maintains required transaction reports of security-based swaps pursuant to
the laws of that foreign jurisdiction is subject to requirements regarding data collection
and maintenance; systems capacity, resiliency, and security; and recordkeeping that are
comparable to the requirements imposed on SDRs by §§ 240.13n-5 to 240.13n-7 of the
Exchange Act.

1150

See Section XI.B, supra.

1151

New paragraph (k) of re-proposed Rule 900 would define the term “direct electronic access” to
have the same meaning as in proposed Rule 13n-4(a)(5) under the Exchange Act, as proposed in
the SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR 77318.

325

As noted above, the Commission preliminarily believes that compliance with a foreign
jurisdiction’s rules for reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps should be a
substitute for compliance with the U.S. rules only when the foreign jurisdiction has a reporting
and public dissemination regime comparable to that of the United States. Thus, re-proposed
Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(A) would provide that the data elements required to be reported pursuant to
the rules of the foreign jurisdiction must be comparable to those required to be reported pursuant
to Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR. If the data elements required by the foreign jurisdiction were
not comparable, certain important data elements about a security-based swap might not be
captured by the foreign trade repository or foreign regulatory authority.
Furthermore, re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(B) would provide that the rules of the
foreign jurisdiction must require security-based swaps to be reported and publicly disseminated
in a manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by Regulation SBSR. The
Commission preliminarily believes that, given the Title VII requirements that all security-based
swaps be reported to an SDR and that all security-based swaps be publicly disseminated in real
time (except for block trades), allowing substituted compliance with the rules of a foreign
jurisdiction that has standards significantly different from those in the United States would run
counter to the objectives and requirements of Title VII. Thus, for example, the Commission
would not, under re-proposed Rule 908(c), permit substituted compliance with respect to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination if the foreign jurisdiction did not (among other
things) impose public dissemination requirements on a trade-by-trade basis; dissemination of
trade information on an aggregate basis would not be sufficient. Furthermore, the Commission
would not permit substituted compliance under re-proposed Rule 908(c) with respect to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination if security-based swaps of non-block size were
publicly disseminated in other than real time, as required under Section 763 of the Dodd-Frank
Act.
Re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(C) would also provide that, to grant a substituted
compliance order with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination, the Commission
must have direct electronic access to the security-based swap data held by a trade repository or
foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swaps are reported pursuant to the rules of
that foreign jurisdiction. This requirement stems from the fact that the regulatory reporting
provisions of Title VII are premised on the idea that the Commission will have direct electronic
access to all the reported data. Not having direct electronic access could reduce the
Commission’s ability to effectively and efficiently monitor the U.S. security-based swap market
and provide timely and complete data to other U.S. financial regulatory agencies. Thus, the
Commission preliminarily believes that direct electronic access to the foreign trade repository or
foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swap transactions are reported in the foreign
jurisdiction should be a prerequisite to issuing a substituted compliance order with respect to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination applying to that jurisdiction.
An alternative to this proposed requirement would be to permit substituted compliance
with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination if, instead, there existed an
information-sharing agreement between the Commission and an appropriate body in the foreign
jurisdiction that would permit the Commission to request and obtain transaction information
from the foreign trade repository or foreign regulatory authority that otherwise would be reported
326

to a registered SDR pursuant to Regulation SBSR. The Commission preliminarily believes,
however, that it would be more appropriate to require direct electronic access to such data before
allowing substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination.
Without direct electronic access, the Commission could face substantial delays before a foreign
entity, even acting expeditiously, could compile a substantial volume of data relating to a
substantial volume of transactions. Delays in obtaining such data could compromise the ability
of the Commission to supervise security-based swap market participants, and to share
information with other U.S. financial regulators, in a timely fashion.
Re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)(D) would provide that, to grant a substituted compliance
order regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination, the Commission must be able to
find that any trade repository or foreign regulatory authority in the foreign jurisdiction that
receives and maintains transaction reports of security-based swaps pursuant to the laws of that
foreign jurisdiction is subject to requirements regarding data collection and maintenance;
systems capacity, resiliency, and security; and recordkeeping that are comparable to the
requirements that the Commission would impose on SDRs. The Commission has proposed
certain requirements for SDRs relating to data collection and maintenance; 1152 systems capacity,
resiliency, and security; 1153 and recordkeeping. 1154 These requirements are designed, among
other things, to enhance the ability of SDRs to effectively receive and maintain security-based
swap transaction data that are reported to them. Without appropriate system security, for
example, the data held by an SDR could be destroyed or rendered unusable by a hacker attack or
computer virus. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that, to allow substituted
compliance for regulatory reporting and public dissemination with respect to a foreign
jurisdiction, any entity in that foreign jurisdiction that is required to receive and maintain
security-based swap transaction data should be required to have comparable protections.
Re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iv) would specify that, before issuing a substituted
compliance order pursuant to this section, the Commission shall have entered into a supervisory
and enforcement MOU or other arrangement with the relevant foreign financial regulatory
authority or authorities under such foreign financial regulatory system addressing oversight and
supervision of the applicable security-based swap market under the substitute compliance
determination.
5. Modification or Withdrawal of Substituted Compliance Order
Re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(v) would provide that the Commission may, on our own
initiative, modify or withdraw a substituted compliance order with respect to regulatory reporting
and public dissemination in a foreign jurisdiction, at any time, after appropriate notice and
opportunity for comment. Such a modification or withdrawal could result from a situation
where, after the Commission issues an order recognizing the reporting and public dissemination
1152

See proposed Rule 13n-5 under the Exchange Act.

1153

See proposed Rule 13n-6 under the Exchange Act.

1154

See proposed Rule 13n-7 under the Exchange Act.

327

regime of a foreign jurisdiction as eligible for substituted compliance, the basis for that order
ceases to be true. For example, if the foreign jurisdiction did not sufficiently enforce its
reporting and public dissemination rules, compliance with the foreign rules might no longer be
deemed an effective substitute for compliance with the U.S. rules. Therefore, the Commission
preliminarily believes that it would be appropriate to establish a mechanism whereby it could, at
any time and on our own initiative, modify or withdraw a previously issued substituted
compliance order with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination, after appropriate
notice and opportunity for comment.
6. Regulatory Reporting and Public Dissemination Considered Together in the
Commission’s Analysis of Substituted Compliance
The Commission has considered, but has determined not to propose, treating regulatory
reporting and public dissemination separately for purposes of allowing substituted compliance.
Under such an approach, for example, the Commission could allow substituted compliance for
regulatory reporting with respect to a particular foreign jurisdiction without permitting
substituted compliance for public dissemination. The Commission preliminarily believes that
this approach would not implement Title VII’s regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements as effectively as considering these requirements together for purposes of analyzing
requests for substituted compliance determinations.
One example of a potential problem with viewing these two requirements separately
relates to the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction information. If the
Commission were to permit substituted compliance for regulatory reporting but not for public
dissemination, certain transactions could be reported to a foreign trade repository in lieu of an
SDR that is registered with the Commission. However, the Commission has proposed that
registered SDRs would be the entities charged with publicly disseminating information about
security-based swap transactions. A registered SDR could carry out that function only if data
about individual transactions are reported to it. If data about certain transactions were reported
instead to a foreign trade repository, it would be impractical if not impossible for the SDR to
publicly disseminate data about those transactions. The Commission also preliminarily believes
that it would be impractical and unduly complicated to devise an alternate method for public
dissemination of such transactions that did not involve registered SDRs. 1155 The Commission
preliminarily concludes, therefore, that transactions should be required to be reported to a
registered SDR even if there are comparable foreign rules that would provide for reporting of
such transactions to a foreign trade repository, unless the foreign rules also provide for public
dissemination of such transactions in a manner comparable to Regulation SBSR. In such case,
the Commission could, under re-proposed Rule 908(c), issue a substituted compliance order for
1155

A reporting side could be required to report to a registered SDR the data elements required by reproposed Rule 901(c), which are those that would be publicly disseminated, but not be required to
report the elements required by re-proposed Rule 901(d), which are the additional elements
required for regulatory reporting. However, reporting the transaction to both a registered SDR
and to a foreign trade repository (which it would be required to do by the rules of the foreign
jurisdiction) would negate the effect of the substituted compliance order.

328

both regulatory reporting and public dissemination with respect to that foreign jurisdiction.
The Commission notes that, under re-proposed Rules 908(a) and 908(b), certain securitybased swap transactions would be subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination.
The Commission also has considered, but has determined not to propose, treating regulatory
reporting and public dissemination separately for purposes of allowing substituted compliance
with respect to such transactions, even though Regulation SBSR would not require public
dissemination of such transactions in any case. The Commission preliminarily believes that this
approach could introduce unnecessary operational complexity for cross-border market
participants and might yield few if any efficiency gains. Assume that a foreign branch of a U.S.
bank is operating in a jurisdiction where a substituted compliance order were in effect for
transactions that otherwise would be required to be reported but not publicly disseminated. With
each transaction, the foreign branch would be required to determine whether the transaction was
such that regulatory reporting but not public dissemination would be required under Regulation
SBSR, in which case substituted compliance could apply and the transaction could instead be
reported to the foreign trade repository, or whether both regulatory reporting and public
dissemination would be required under Regulation SBSR, in which case substituted compliance
would not apply and the transaction would be required to be reported to a registered SDR. The
determination of the appropriate place to send the trade report would depend on the nature of the
counterparty. 1156 While market participants could be expected to develop the appropriate
compliance systems to report through the appropriate channel depending on the circumstances,
the Commission preliminarily sees only limited benefit to requiring market participants to do so.
The Commission preliminarily believes instead that it would be simpler to permit substituted
compliance for a foreign jurisdiction only when that foreign jurisdiction has rules for regulatory
reporting and public dissemination that are comparable to Regulation SBSR. This approached is
designed to minimize the necessity of determining, on a transaction-by-transaction basis, which
jurisdiction’s rules would apply.
Request for Comment
The Commission is re-proposing Regulation SBSR in a manner that would set forth when
a security-based swap generally would be required to be reported and publicly disseminated, and
when reporting and dissemination requirements could be satisfied by substituting compliance
with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction for compliance with U.S. rules. The public is invited to
comment on all aspects of these proposed rules. In particular, the Commission invites responses
to the following questions about our proposed rules relating to substituted compliance:
1156

For example, if the foreign branch transacted with another foreign branch of a U.S. bank or with a
non-U.S. person that was guaranteed by a U.S. person, the transaction would be subject to public
dissemination (see re-proposed Rule 908(b)(2)(ii)) and substituted compliance would not apply.
Thus, the transaction would have to be reported to an SDR registered with the Commission.
However, if the foreign branch transacted outside the United States with a non-U.S. person that
was not guaranteed by a U.S. person, public dissemination would not be required under
Regulation SBSR. See re-proposed Rule 908(b)(2). Therefore, the transaction could be reported
instead to the foreign trade repository.

329

•

Should the Commission make determinations of substituted compliance for
regulatory reporting separately from public dissemination? Why or why not? If so,
how could a security-based swap transaction be publicly disseminated if substituted
compliance were in effect for regulatory reporting but not for public dissemination?

•

Do you believe the Commission, as proposed in Rule 908(c)(2)(i), should have the
ability to conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance
determination with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination in a
foreign jurisdiction if such foreign jurisdiction imposes a comparable system for the
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of all security-based swaps? Why or
why not? Should the Commission allow for substituted compliance determinations
under more limited circumstances? Why or why not? Under what other
circumstances should the Commission consider substituted compliance? Please be
specific.

•

How should the Commission evaluate whether a foreign system is “comparable” for
purposes of regulatory reporting and public dissemination? Please be specific.

•

The Commission stated that our approach is designed to put the foreign branches of
U.S. banks on a level playing field with non-U.S. persons in foreign jurisdictions
where those branches are located. Do you believe that the proposed formulation
would accomplish this goal? Why or why not? How should the Commission
restructure re-proposed Rule 908(c)(1) to accomplish this goal? Please be specific.

Do you believe that the examples provided adequately describe the situations under
which security-based swap transactions should and should not be eligible for
substituted compliance? Why or why not? What additional situations should the
Commission consider? Please be specific.

Do you agree with the Commission proposal, in re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(ii), that
any person that executes security-based swaps that would be required to be reported
to Regulation SBSR be eligible to file an application requesting substituted

industry associations) be eligible to file such an application? Why or why not?

•

Do you agree with the factors the Commission would take into account when making
a substituted compliance determination? Why or why not? What additional factors
should the Commission take into account? Should a trade repository be subject to
requirements that are comparable to all of Section 13(n) of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder as a condition to a substituted compliance
determination?

•

Do you agree with the proposed findings that the Commission would be required to
make pursuant to re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iii)? Why or why not? Are there any
other findings the Commission should be required to make? Please be specific.

Do you agree, as detailed in re-proposed Rule 908(c)(2)(iv), that the Commission
330

should have the ability, on our own initiative, to modify or withdraw a substituted
compliance order at any time, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment?
Why or why not?

1157

•

The Commission is not at this time proposing that a duty to report and publicly
disseminate a security-based swap would depend on the domicile of the issuer of the
loan or security underlying the security-based swap. Should the Commission’s rules
for reporting and public dissemination take this factor into consideration? Why or
why not?

•

If a foreign jurisdiction has some form of public dissemination but the Commission
does not believe that the foreign jurisdiction’s rules are comparable to those of the
United States to allow substituted compliance with respect to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination, what would be the effect of having transaction reports of
security-based swaps publicly disseminated in multiple jurisdictions? Do you believe
that situation would impact price discovery or the market for such security-based
swaps generally? If so, how, to what extent, and why? If not, why not? How
practical would it be, and what would be the cost, for private actors to consolidate
transaction reports of those security-based swaps emanating from potentially multiple
feeds across multiple jurisdictions?

•

Should the Commission permit substituted compliance with respect to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination even if it does not have direct electronic access to
the security-based swaps transactions reported to the foreign trade repository or
foreign regulatory authority? If yes, how could the Commission ensure that it has
timely access to the security-based swap transaction data held by the foreign entity
that otherwise would have been reported pursuant to Regulation SBSR? If there were
delays associated with obtaining data from the foreign entity, how long could those
delays be for substituted compliance to still be appropriate? In addition to delays, do
you foresee any other potential obstacles to the Commission obtaining this
information from foreign entities?

•

The Commission’s re-proposed rules relating to substituted compliance for regulatory
reporting and public dissemination requirements differ in certain respects from the
CFTC’s cross-border guidance. For example, the CFTC guidance provides that a
swap between a U.S. person swap dealer and a non-U.S. person guaranteed by a U.S.
person would be subject to public dissemination requirements, and that these
requirements could not be satisfied through substituted compliance. 1157 The
Commission, on the other hand, is proposing that public dissemination of a securitybased swap between two such direct counterparties could be satisfied by substituted
compliance (assuming that no person is soliciting, negotiating, or executing the
security-based swap within the United States on behalf of the non-U.S. person that is

guaranteed by a U.S. person). 1158 Please describe any other differences that you
believe might exist and what would be the impact of any such differences.
•

When making a comparability determination, the Commission would look not just at
the rules of a foreign jurisdiction, but also at the comprehensiveness of the
supervision and regulation by the appropriate governmental authorities of that
jurisdiction. When assessing the effectiveness of a foreign jurisdiction’s supervisory
compliance program, should the Commission consider factors such as the existence of
a dedicated examination program, the expertise of examiners, the existence of a risk
monitoring framework and an examination plan; and the existence of a disciplinary
program to enforce compliance with laws? Similarly, when assessing the
effectiveness of a foreign jurisdiction’s enforcement program, should the Commission
consider factors such as whether the program is actively administered, resourced, and
transparent?

•

Is the Commission’s holistic approach to making a comparability determination
appropriate? Why or why not? Are there specific procedures or comparability
considerations that would be useful for the Commission to incorporate in our
proposed substituted compliance approach? If so, please describe. What would be
the advantages of adopting such measures now? What would be the disadvantages of
adopting such measures now?

•

What would be the market impact of proposed approach to substituted compliance for
regulatory reporting and public dissemination? How would the proposed approach
affect the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the
United States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach
place any market participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so,
please explain. Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on
competition? If so, please explain. What other measures should the Commission
consider to implement the proposed approach? What would be the market impacts
and competitiveness effects of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this
release?

•

In making substituted compliance determinations for reporting, should the
Commission require direct electronic access to data maintained at foreign SDRs or
should we only require an information sharing arrangement? Why or why not?

E. Clearing Requirement
Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act requires a security-based swap that is subject to the
mandatory clearing requirement to be cleared at a clearing agency that is either registered with

1158

See re-proposed Rule 908(c)(1) of Regulation SBSR.

332

the Commission or exempt from registration. 1159 The Commission recognizes, however, that in
some circumstances counterparties may seek to clear security-based swaps subject to mandatory
clearing at a clearing agency that is neither registered with the Commission nor exempt from
registration, which would fail to satisfy the Title VII mandatory clearing requirement. This
scenario may occur where counterparties seek—either due to their own preference or regulatory
requirements in a foreign jurisdiction—to clear a transaction through a clearing agency that does
not have any U.S. members and does not clear transactions conducted within the United States,
because this type of clearing agency would not be required to register with the Commission or
obtain an exemption from registration under the Commission’s proposed interpretation of the
clearing agency registration requirement in Section 17A(g), discussed in Section V above.
In recognition of this situation and the potential for duplicative or conflicting clearing
requirements, the Commission preliminarily believes that it would be appropriate in certain
circumstances to permit substituted compliance in this area. Specifically, the Commission is
proposing to use our authority, under Section 36 of the Exchange Act, 1160 to exempt persons
from the clearing mandate in Section 3C of the Exchange Act if a relevant transaction is
submitted to a foreign clearing agency that is the subject of a substituted compliance
determination by the Commission. Because such clearing agencies would not be engaged in
activities that trigger the registration requirement, such substituted compliance determination
would not be subject to the procedure outlined in Section 17A(k) to obtain an exemption from
clearing agency registration, but would instead be considered in the context of an exemption
from the clearing mandate. We preliminarily believe that providing substituted compliance in
this area could help to facilitate the clearance and settlement of cross-border security-based
swaps, while also promoting compliance with clearing mandates.
Under the proposed approach, upon the Commission’s issuance of an order making a
substituted compliance determination with respect to a particular foreign clearing agency, a
counterparty to a security-based swap transaction that is subject to the mandatory clearing
requirement would be able to rely on the Commission’s substituted compliance determination to
satisfy the mandatory clearing requirement by clearing such transaction on the specified foreign
clearing agency.

1159

If a counterparty qualifies for the end-user clearing exception, then the security-based swap
would not be required to be cleared unless the end user elects that it be cleared. See 15 U.S.C.
78c-3(g)(2) (providing that application of the exception is solely at the discretion of the
counterparty to security-based swaps that meets the conditions of the exception in Section
3C(g)(1) of the Exchange Act).

1160

See 15 U.S.C. 78mm. Section 36 of the Exchange Act provides that, subject to certain
exceptions, the Commission “by rule, regulation, or order may conditionally or unconditionally
exempt any person, security, or transaction, or any class or classes of person, securities, or
transactions from any provision or provisions of [the Exchange Act] or of any rule or regulation
thereunder, to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and
is consistent with the protection of investors.”

333

The Commission’s proposed approach to substituted compliance for clearing would be
limited to foreign clearing agencies that have no U.S. person members or activities in the United
States. A foreign clearing agency that meets these two threshold requirements could initiate the
process of making a substituted compliance determination by filing an application, pursuant to
the procedures set forth in proposed Rule 0-13, 1161 requesting that the Commission make a
substituted compliance determination. Such application would need to include the reasons
therefor and such other documentation as the Commission may request. To provide the
Commission with enough information to make a substituted compliance determination, the
application would have to include sufficiently comprehensive information regarding the clearing
agency and the foreign regime such that the Commission has an adequate basis to make the
substituted compliance determination.
In making a substituted compliance determination, the Commission expects that our
review in such cases would include seeking appropriate assurances from the foreign clearing
agency regarding the absence of U.S. person members and relevant activity in the United States,
including the volume of clearing activity originating in the United States. In addition, the review
would look at the scope and objectives of the applicable foreign jurisdiction’s regulatory
requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program administered,
and the enforcement authority exercised, by the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities to support the oversight of such clearing agency. Thus, the Commission’s
determination would take into account a foreign jurisdiction’s overall regulatory framework, and
would focus on the similarity of regulatory objectives in addition to the presence or absence of
similar rules. We expect that our review of substituted compliance applications in this area
would be aided by the resources available to the Commission as a result of cooperative
relationships with other authorities that we expect would allow us to assess the risk
characteristics of such foreign clearing agencies on an ongoing basis. 1162

1161

See Section XI.B, supra.

1162

See, e.g., FMI Principles, note 687, supra. Systemically important payment systems, central
securities depositories, securities settlement systems, central counterparties and trade repositories
(“Financial Market Infrastructures”) are expected to observe the standards as soon as possible,
and CPSS and IOSCO members are seeking to adopt the standards in their respective jurisdictions
by the end of 2012. CPSS and IOSCO have also proposed assessment methodologies to oversee
implementation of the FMI Principles, including self-assessments and external assessments, such
as those conducted by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank under the Financial
Sector Assessment Program. See CPSS and Technical Committee of IOSCO, Assessment
Methodology for the Principles for FMIs and the Responsibilities of Authorities (April 2012),
available at: http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss101b.pdf. In addition, CPSS and the Technical
Committee of IOSCO proposed a disclosure framework to ensure that disclosures made by FMIs
are clear and comprehensive. See CPSS and Technical Committee of IOSCO, Disclosure
Framework for Financial Market Infrastructures (April 2012), available at:
http://www.bis.org/publ/cpss101c.pdf. Finally, see Basel III for a discussion of the preferential
capital treatment that exposures to a central counterparty will receive if such central counterparty
is supervised in a manner consistent with the FMI Principles.

334

Subsequent to making a substituted compliance determination, the Commission would be
able to modify or withdraw, at any time, an order containing such determination, after
appropriate notice and opportunity for comment. This would allow the Commission to take
action in the event that a foreign clearing agency, for any reason, is no longer suitable for
substituted compliance.
The Commission’s proposed approach to substituted compliance with respect to the
mandatory clearing requirement differs from other Title VII categories where substituted
compliance would be permitted in that we are not proposing a specific rule related to substituted
compliance. We preliminarily do not believe that a rule is necessary in the clearing space,
although we are soliciting comment on the issue in the request for comments below. This belief
stems in part from the fact that we do not expect a large number of requests for substituted
compliance in this area due to the small number of security-based swap clearing agencies in the
market. In addition, the Title VII clearing agency registration regime already contains a category
of exempt security-based swap clearing agencies, and clearing security-based swaps through
these entities satisfies the mandatory clearing requirement. As a result, we preliminarily believe
that the proposed approach to substituted compliance in this area, whereby we are proposing a
policy and procedural framework for the use of our exemptive authority in Section 36 of the
Exchange Act, is sufficient to promote Title VII’s clearing mandate while addressing the
regulatory complexities that stem from the global scope of the security-based swaps market.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed interpretation,
including the following:
•

Is substituted compliance related to the mandatory clearing requirement in Section
3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act needed to prevent conflict with mandatory clearing
requirements under foreign law? If so, is the proposed approach to substituted
compliance sufficient to address the potential conflicts?

•

Should the Commission apply Section 17A(k) of the Exchange Act under such
circumstances to exempt particular foreign security-based swap clearing agencies to
permit such clearing agencies to be used by counterparties subject to the mandatory
clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act? Are investor
protection considerations sufficiently addressed if transactions are permitted to be
cleared on a CCP that is not registered or exempt from registration? What conditions
would need to be included to ensure the policy goals in the Dodd-Frank Act regarding
central clearing are fulfilled? Should the conditions identified in Section 17A(k) that
the clearing agency be available for inspection by the Commission and make
available information requested by the Commission apply? Why or why not?

•

Should the Commission codify the proposed approach to substituted compliance in
the mandatory clearing space? Or is the proposed approach’s reliance on the
Commission’s exemptive authority in Section 36 of the Exchange Act, and the
procedures set forth in proposed Rule 0-13, sufficient? Why or why not?
335

•

Are the conditions limiting the potential availability of substituted compliance to
foreign clearing agencies that have no U.S. persons as members or activities in the
United States appropriate? Are there other approaches that the Commission should
consider? Should the Commission only consider a foreign clearing agency’s CCP
activities with regard to securities based swaps, or all type securities, in making a
substituted compliance determination?

•

What would be the market impact of the proposed approach to substituted compliance
for the mandatory clearing requirement? How would the proposed approach affect
the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the global marketplace (both in the United
States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)? Would the proposed approach place any
market participants at a competitive disadvantage or advantage? If so, please explain.
Would the proposed approach be a more general burden on competition? If so, please
explain. What other measures should the Commission consider to implement the
proposed approach? What would be the market impacts and competitiveness effects
of alternatives to the proposed approach discussed in this release?

F. Trade Execution Requirement
Under the Commission’s proposal, substituted compliance would be permitted for certain
cross-border security-based swap transactions that would be subject to the mandatory trade
execution requirement of Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act. Specifically, under proposed Rule
3Ch-2(b)(1), the Commission could, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a
substituted compliance determination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction to permit a person
subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement to execute such transaction, or have such
transaction executed on their behalf, on a security-based swap market (or class of markets) that is
neither registered under the Exchange Act nor exempt from registration under the Exchange Act
if the Commission determines that such security-based swap market (or class of markets) is
subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by a foreign financial
regulatory authority or authorities in such foreign jurisdiction. Upon the Commission’s issuance
of an order making a substituted compliance determination with respect to a particular foreign
jurisdiction under proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b), a counterparty to a security-based swap transaction
that is subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement would be able to rely on the
substituted compliance determination by the Commission to satisfy the mandatory trade
execution requirement by executing such transaction on a security-based swap market in such
foreign jurisdiction, if such security-based swap market is covered by, or is in a class of markets
that is covered by, the Commission’s order. 1163
Only transactions that meet the requirements of proposed Rule 3Ch-2(a), however, would
be eligible for substituted compliance with respect to the mandatory trade execution requirement.
Specifically, with respect to a foreign security-based swap market (or class of markets) for which
the Commission has made a substituted compliance determination pursuant to proposed Rule
3Ch-2(b)(1), substituted compliance would only be available for security-based swap
1163

Proposed Rule 3Ch-2(a) under the Exchange Act.

336

transactions where both of the following conditions apply to at least one counterparty to the
transaction: (i) the counterparty is either a non-U.S. person or foreign branch of a U.S. bank; 1164
and (ii) the security-based swap transaction is not solicited, negotiated, or executed by a person
within the United States on behalf of such counterparty.
Proposed Rule 3Ch-2(a) is designed to extend the availability of substituted compliance
only to security-based transactions where one counterparty to the transaction is not acting
directly or through an agent within the United States. The Commission preliminarily believes
that transactions in which both counterparties utilize a U.S. person to act on their behalf to
execute, solicit, or negotiate the transaction should not be eligible for substituted compliance and
that it is appropriate to apply the mandatory trade execution requirement of Section 3C(h) of the
Exchange Act to these transactions, and not foreign law. This approach should help mitigate any
potential competitive advantage that non-U.S. intermediaries operating within the United States
may have over U.S. intermediaries when facilitating security-based swap transactions on behalf
of non-U.S. persons. It also should promote regulatory parity for U.S. and non-U.S.
counterparties when they enter into security-based swap transactions within the United States.
The Commission, however, solicits comments on this approach.
By contrast, for transactions involving at least one counterparty that is a foreign branch or
a non-U.S. person and for which no person within the United States is directly involved in
executing, soliciting or negotiating the transaction on behalf of such non-U.S. person or foreign
branch, the Commission preliminarily believes that such transactions should be eligible for
substituted compliance in the foreign jurisdiction. The Commission believes that limiting
eligibility for substituted compliance to such cross-border security-based swap transactions
would promote the Title VII goals of transparency, access, competition, and anti-manipulation
with respect to transactions that impact U.S. markets and market participants, and address the
regulatory complexities that stem from the global scope of the security-based swaps market.
Under proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(2), in making a substituted compliance determination, the
Commission would take into account such factors as the Commission determines are appropriate,
such as the scope and objectives of the applicable foreign jurisdiction’s regulatory requirements,
as well as the effectiveness of the supervisory compliance program administered, and the
enforcement authority exercised, by the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities to support the oversight of such security-based swap market (or class of markets).
Thus, the Commission’s determination would take into account a foreign jurisdiction’s overall
regulatory framework, and would focus on the similarity of regulatory objectives in addition to
the presence or absence of similar rules. In addition, in making a substituted compliance
determination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction, the Commission’s determination could be
with respect to a single security-based swap market within such jurisdiction, or a class of
security-based swap markets within the jurisdiction. For instance, if a foreign jurisdiction
imposes different levels of supervisory oversight with respect to different classes or categories of
1164

Under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(c) under the Exchange Act, the term “foreign branch” would have
the same meaning as set forth in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(1) under the Exchange Act. See
Section III.B.7, supra.

337

security-based swap markets, the Commission could apply a substituted compliance
determination to an entire class of security-based swap markets in the foreign jurisdiction,
enabling each security-based swap market of that class within such jurisdiction to rely on the
substituted compliance determination.
Furthermore, under proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(3) under the Exchange Act, before issuing a
substituted compliance order pursuant to proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(1) under the Exchange Act,
the Commission would be required to have entered into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or
other arrangement with the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities
addressing oversight and supervision of the security-based swap market (or class of markets)
under the substituted compliance determination.
Under proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(4) under the Exchange Act, the Commission also would
be able to modify or withdraw, at any time, an order containing a substituted compliance
determination, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment. This would allow the
Commission to take action in the event that a security-based swap market (or class of markets),
for any reason, is no longer suitable for substituted compliance.
The Commission notes that the factors the Commission would consider in making a
substituted compliance determination with respect to mandatory trade execution would not
necessarily be the same factors that the Commission would find relevant to a comparability
determination for purposes of an exemption from registration as a SB SEF. 1165 The Commission
preliminarily believes that possible factors, among others, it could consider when assessing the
effectiveness of a foreign jurisdiction’s supervisory compliance program may include the
existence of a dedicated examination program; examiners with proper expertise; the existence of
a risk monitoring framework and an examination plan; and a disciplinary program to enforce
compliance with laws. The Commission, for example, could find the presence or absence of
certain regulatory requirements in a particular foreign jurisdiction to be more relevant to a
determination of whether a security-based swap market in that foreign jurisdiction should be
exempt from registration as a SB SEF than to a substituted compliance determination with
respect to mandatory trade execution. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that
allowing substituted compliance with respect to mandatory trade execution for a foreign securitybased swap market (or class of markets) would not necessarily result in a determination to
exempt that foreign market (or class of markets) from registration as a SB SEF. However, the
Commission generally solicits comments on the appropriateness or feasibility of this approach.
Proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the Exchange Act provides that one or more securitybased swap markets could initiate the process of making a substituted compliance determination
by filing an application, pursuant to the procedures set forth in proposed Rule 0-13, 1166
requesting that the Commission make a substituted compliance determination. Such application
would need to include the reasons therefor and such other documentation as the Commission
1165

See Section VII.C, supra.

1166

See Section XI.B, supra.

338

may request. To provide the Commission with enough information to make a substituted
compliance determination, the application would have to include sufficiently comprehensive
information regarding the security-based swap market and the foreign regime such that the
Commission has an adequate basis to make the substituted compliance determination set forth in
proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b) under the Exchange Act.
Request for Comment
The Commission seeks comment on all aspects of proposed Rule 3Ch-2, including the
following:
•

The Commission generally solicits comments on the appropriateness and clarity of
the proposed rule. Should additional details be included as to any aspect of this
proposed rule? If so, for what aspects of the proposed rule would additional details
be useful and why?

•

As discussed above, under proposed Rule 3Ch-2(a) under the Exchange Act,
substituted compliance would be permitted only for security-based swap transactions
that have at least one counterparty that is a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch and
the security-based swap transaction is not solicited, negotiated, or executed by a
person within the United States on behalf of such counterparty. The Commission
generally solicits comments on the appropriateness of permitting substituted
compliance for the transactions described in proposed Rule 3Ch-2(a). Is the
Commission’s approach to defining the transactions that qualify for substituted
compliance appropriate? If not, why not? Should some or all of the transactions
described by the proposed rule not be eligible for substituted compliance? Should
additional transactions not covered by the proposed rule be eligible for substituted
compliance? In either case, please describe the transactions that should be eligible or
ineligible for substituted compliance and provide the rationale for each.

•

Does the proposed substituted compliance rule appropriately promote the statutory
objectives of the mandatory trade execution requirement, as well as the goal of
international coordination? If not, how could this be better achieved? Would the
objectives of Title VII be hindered by permitting persons to seek substituted
compliance for the eligible transactions? If so, how?

•

What is the likelihood that cross-border transactions would be subject to the
mandatory trade execution requirements of foreign jurisdictions that conflict with the
mandatory trade execution requirement of Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act? For
such transactions, would the complications stemming from such conflicting
mandatory trade execution requirements be adequately addressed by permitting
substituted compliance for the transactions described in the proposed rule? If not,
why not? Please describe the complications, if any, that might still ensue even with
substituted compliance. Would any conflicts likely arise for security-based swaps
transactions not covered by the proposed substituted compliance rule? If so, please
describe those conflicts and how they would arise.
339

•

Under proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(1), under the Exchange Act, the Commission may
permit substituted compliance with respect to the mandatory trade execution
requirement if a security-based swap market (or class of markets) is subject to
comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by the relevant foreign
financial regulatory authority or authorities. Is this comparability standard
appropriate and sufficiently clear? Should additional detail be provided as to what
would and would not satisfy this standard? If so, what additional detail should be
provided? Should a different standard be used? If so, what should be the standard
and why?

•

In making a substituted compliance determination, under proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(2)
under the Exchange Act, the Commission would consider such factors it determines
are appropriate, such as the factors enumerated in proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(2) under
the Exchange Act. Are these factors appropriate to such a determination? Are the
enumerated factors too broad? Too narrow? Please explain. Should certain of these
factors not be considered or should certain additional factors be enumerated in the
proposed rule?

•

As discussed above, in making a substituted compliance determination, the
Commission would focus on the similarity of regulatory objectives in addition to the
presence or absence of similar rules. Is this holistic approach to making a substituted
compliance determination appropriate? Why or why not? If not, what approach
should the Commission take and why?

•

As discussed above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the factors relevant
to the Commission’s substituted compliance determination for mandatory trade
execution purposes would not necessarily be the same as the factors that the
Commission would find relevant to a comparability determination for purposes of an
exemption from registration as a security-based swap execution facility. The
Commission generally solicits comments on the appropriateness of distinguishing the
two determinations. Should the Commission consider the same factors in making a
substituted compliance determination for mandatory trade execution and a
comparability determination with respect to an exemption from registration as a
security-based swap execution facility? If not, what factors would be relevant and
appropriate to both determinations? Please describe. What factors would only be
relevant or appropriate to a substituted compliance determination for mandatory trade
execution or a comparability determination for an exemption from registration as a
security-based swap execution facility, respectively? Please describe.

•

Under proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the Exchange Act, one or more security-based
swap markets may file an application with the Commission to request that the
Commission make a substituted compliance determination with respect to the
mandatory trade execution requirement. Should persons other than security-based
swap markets be permitted to file such substituted compliance applications? Why or
why not? If so, what other types of persons should be permitted to file such
applications? Please explain.
340

•

What would be the market impact of proposed Rule 3Ch-2? How would the
application of the proposed rule affect the competitiveness of U.S. entities in the
global marketplace (both in the United States as well as in foreign jurisdictions)?
Would the proposed rule place any market participants at a competitive disadvantage
or advantage? If so, please explain. Would the proposed rule be a more general
burden on competition? If so, please explain. What other measures should the
Commission consider to implement the proposed approach? What would be the
market impacts and competitiveness effects of alternatives to the proposed approach
discussed in this release?

341

XII.

Antifraud Authority

The provisions of the proposed rules and interpretive guidance, discussed above, relate
solely to the applicability of the registration and mandatory reporting, clearing, and trade
execution requirements under Title VII. The proposed rules and interpretive guidance do not
limit the cross-border reach of the antifraud or other provisions of the federal securities laws to
these entities.
In Section 929P(b) of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress added provisions to the federal
securities laws confirming the Commission’s broad cross-border antifraud authority. Congress
enacted Section 929P(b) in response to the Supreme Court’s decision in Morrison v. National
Australia Bank, 1167 which created uncertainty about the Commission’s cross-border enforcement
authority under the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws. Prior to Morrison, the
federal courts of appeals for nearly four decades had construed the antifraud provisions to reach
cross-border securities frauds when the fraud either involved significant conduct within the
United States causing injury to overseas investors, or had substantial foreseeable effects on
investors or markets within the United States. 1168 With respect to the Commission’s enforcement
authority, Section 929P(b) codified the court of appeals’ prior interpretation both as to the scope
of the antifraud provisions’ cross-border reach and the nature of the inquiry as one of subjectmatter jurisdiction. 1169
Specifically, the Commission’s antifraud enforcement authority under Section 17(a) of
the Securities Act and the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act—including Sections 9(j) and
10(b)—extends to “(1) conduct within the United States that constitutes significant steps in
1167

See 130 S. Ct. 2869, 2888 (2010) (holding in a Section 10(b) class action that “it is … only
transactions in securities listed on domestic exchanges, and domestic transactions in other
securities, to which §10(b) applies”).

1168

See, e.g., Schoenbaum v. Firstbrook, 405 F.2d 200, 206 (2d Cir. 1968), modified on other
grounds, 405 F.2d 215 (1968) (en banc).

1169

See 156 Cong. Rec. H5237 (daily ed. June 30, 2010) (statement of Rep. Kanjorski, author of
Section 929P(b)) (“In the case of Morrison v. National Australia Bank, the Supreme Court last
week held that section 10(b) of the Exchange Act applies only to transactions in securities listed
on United States exchanges and transactions in other securities that occur in the United States. In
this case, the Court also said that it was applying a presumption against extraterritoriality. This
bill’s provisions concerning extraterritoriality, however, are intended to rebut that presumption by
clearly indicating that Congress intends extraterritorial application in cases brought by the SEC or
the Justice Department. Thus, the purpose of the language of section 929P(b) of the bill is to
make clear that in actions and proceedings brought by the SEC or the Justice Department, the
specified provisions of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act and the Investment Advisers Act
may have extraterritorial application, and that extraterritorial application is appropriate,
irrespective of whether the securities are traded on a domestic exchange or the transactions occur
in the United States, when the conduct within the United States is significant or when conduct
outside the United States has a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.”). See also
156 Cong. Rec. S5915-16 (daily ed. July 15, 2010) (statement of Senator Reed).

342

furtherance of [the antifraud violation], even if the securities transaction occurs outside the
United States and involves only foreign investors,” and “(2) conduct occurring outside the
United States that has a foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.” 1170 Similarly,
the Commission’s enforcement authority under Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act
applies broadly to reach “(1) conduct within the United States that constitutes significant steps in
furtherance of the violation, even if the violation is committed by a foreign adviser and involves
only foreign investors,” and “(2) conduct occurring outside the United States that has a
foreseeable substantial effect within the United States.” 1171
The Commission’s broad antifraud enforcement authority reflects the strong interest of
the United States in applying the antifraud provisions to cross-border frauds that implicate U.S.
territory, U.S. markets, U.S. investors or other U.S. market participants, or other U.S.
interests. 1172 Doing so is necessary to ensure honest securities markets and high ethical
standards in the U.S. securities industry, and thereby to promote confidence in our securities
markets among both domestic and foreign investors. Cross-border application of the antifraud
provisions is also critical for the protection of U.S. investors from securities frauds executed
outside of the United States, but that threaten to produce, foreseeably do produce, or were
otherwise intended to produce effects upon U.S. markets, U.S. investors or other U.S. market
participants, or other U.S. interests.

interests in things, present within its territory” and “conduct outside its territory that has or is
intended to have substantial effect within its territory”).

XIII. General Request for Comment
A. General Comments
In responding to the specific requests for comment above, interested persons are
encouraged to provide supporting data and analysis and, when appropriate, suggest modifications
to proposed rule text. Responses that are supported by data and analysis provide great assistance
to the Commission in considering the practicality and effectiveness of proposed new
requirements as well as assessing the benefits and costs of proposed requirements. In addition,
commenters are encouraged to identify in their responses a specific request for comment by
indicating the section number of the release.
The Commission also seeks comment on the proposals as a whole. In particular, the
Commission seeks comment on the following questions:
•

How would the proposals integrate with provisions in other Titles and Subtitles of the
Dodd-Frank Act and any domestic or global regulations or proposed regulations
under those other Titles and Subtitles of the Dodd-Frank Act? For example, the
Commission invites comment on how certain aspects of the proposals, such as
registration and regulation of foreign security-based swap dealers and major securitybased swap participants, and application of the transaction-level requirements, would
integrate with regulation of systemically important financial institutions in Title I of
the Dodd-Frank Act, regulation of registered broker-dealers and investment advisers,
regulation of bank holding companies in the Bank Holding Company Act, and
regulation of global systemically important financial institutions in other jurisdictions.

•

For what aspects of the proposal should the Commission consider invoking our
authority under Section 30(c) of the Exchange Act to prevent evasion? Please
explain.

B. Consistency with CFTC’s Cross-Border Approach
The CFTC has proposed interpretative guidance and a policy statement describing the
cross-border application of certain swaps provisions of the CEA that were enacted by Title VII,
and the CFTC’s regulations promulgated thereunder. 1173 Specifically, the proposal addresses the
registration requirement for swap dealers and major swap participants that are not U.S. persons,
the application of Title VII requirements appurtenant to such registered entities, and the
1173

The CFTC’s guidance interprets Section 2(i) of the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”), as
revised by Section 722(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 2(i) provides that Title VII’s
provisions relating to swaps, “(including any rule prescribed or regulation promulgated under that
Act), shall not apply to activities outside the United States unless those activities—(1) have a
direct and significant connection with activities in, or effect on, commerce of the United States;
or (2) contravene such rules or regulations as the Commission may prescribe or promulgate as are
necessary or appropriate to prevent the evasion of any provision of this Act that was enacted by
the [Dodd-Frank Act].”

344

application of the clearing, trade execution, and certain reporting provisions under the CEA to
cross-border swap transactions involving counterparties that are not swap dealers or major swap
participants.
Understanding that the Commission and the CFTC regulate different products,
participants, and markets, and have different statutory authority, and thus, appropriately may take
different approaches to various issues, we nevertheless are guided by the objective of
establishing consistent and comparable requirements to U.S. market participants. Accordingly,
we request comments generally on (i) the impact of any differences between the Commission
and CFTC approaches to the application of Title VII to cross-border activities, including the
application of registration requirements and the substantive requirements of Title VII, (ii)
whether the Commission’s proposed application of Title VII in the cross-border context should
be modified to conform to the proposals made by the CFTC, and (iii) whether any cross-border
interpretations proposed by the CFTC, but not proposed by the Commission (whether as
interpretations or rules), should be adopted by the Commission.

XIV. Paperwork Reduction Act
A. Introduction
The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”) 1174 imposes certain requirements on
Federal agencies in connection with their conducting or sponsoring any “collection of
information.” 1175 An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond
to, a collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number. In addition,
44 U.S.C. 3507(a)(1)(D) provides that before adopting (or revising) a collection of information
requirement, an agency must, among other things, publish a notice in the Federal Register stating
that the agency has submitted the proposed collection of information to the Office of
Management and Budget (“OMB”) and setting forth certain required information, including:
(1) a title for the collection of information; (2) a summary of the collection of information; (3) a
brief description of the need for the information and the proposed use of the information; (4) a

requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. Accordingly, the Commission is submitting these
requirements to OMB for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR § 1320.11. The
title of these collections are [“Registration Rules for Security-Based Swap Entities,”
“Disclosures by Certain Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants,” “Reliance on Counterparty Representations Regarding Activity Within the United
States,” “Requests for Cross-Border Substituted Compliance Determinations,” and “Reporting

B. Re-proposal of Form SBSE, Form SBSE-A, and Form SBSE-BD
1. Summary of Collection of Information
On October 24, 2011, the Commission proposed Rules 15Fb1–1 through 15Fb6–1 and
Forms SBSE, SBSE–A, SBSE–BD, SBSE–C, and SBSE–W to facilitate registration of,
certification by, and withdrawal of SBS Entities, as required by Section 15F of the Exchange
Act. 1177 In light of the Commission’s proposed rules regarding substituted compliance, the

Commission is re-proposing Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE-BD to add three questions to
Form SBSE and Form SBSE-A, one question to Form SBSE-BD, and to amend Schedule F to
those Forms as described in more detail below. 1178 The Commission is not proposing to amend
any of the other Forms, or any of the rules, proposed in the Registration Proposing Release. The
burden estimates described below are designed to update our burden estimates for proposed
Forms SBSE and SBSE-A to account for the revisions we are proposing to those two reproposed forms. For information regarding the other burdens associated with proposed Rules
15Fb1–1 through 15Fb6–1 and Forms SBSE, SBSE–A, SBSE–BD, SBSE–C, and SBSE–W,
please refer to the Registration Proposing Release. 1179
Pursuant to paragraph (a) of proposed Rule 15Fb2–1, each SBS Entity would be required
to file an application to register with the Commission. 1180 The Commission sought to reduce
burdens and costs associated with the application process by providing alternate registration
forms for certain types of SBS Entities (including Forms SBSE-A and SBSE-BD). Each SBS
Entity would only need to research, complete, and file one of the proposed Forms.
Proposed Rule 15Fb2–3 would require that SBS Entities promptly amend their
applications if they find that the information contained therein has become inaccurate. 1181 While
SBS Entities may need to update their Forms periodically, each firm would only need to amend
that aspect of the Form that has become inaccurate.
Proposed Rules 15Fb1–1 through 15Fb6–1 and re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE–A, and
SBSE-BD would require that each respondent retain certain records and information for three
years. 1182
2. Proposed Use of Information
Re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE–A, and SBSE-BD, as applicable, are applications
through which SBS Entities would register with the Commission. Information collected through
these re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE–A, and SBSE-BD would allow the Commission to
determine whether applicants meet the standards for registration, including provisions regarding
substituted compliance, and would help the Commission to fulfill our oversight responsibilities.
The Commission intends to make the information collected pursuant to proposed Rule
15Fb1–1 through 15Fb6– 1 and re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE–A, and SBSE-BD public.

1178

See Proposed Rule 3a71-5(c) under the Exchange Act; see also Section III.C, supra. The
Commission is not proposing any changes to Form SBSE-BD, Form SBSE-C, or Form SBSE-W.

Any collections of information required pursuant to proposed Rules 15Fb1–1 through
15Fb6–1 and re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE–A, and SBSE-BD would be mandatory to permit
the Commission to determine whether applicants meet the standards for registration, and to fulfill
our oversight responsibilities.
3. Respondents
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release and Registration Proposing Release the
Commission staff estimated, based on data obtained from DTCC and conversations with market
participants, that approximately 50 entities would fit within the definition of a security-based
swap dealer. 1183 The Commission staff also estimated in the Registration Proposing Release that
up to five entities fit within the definition of major security-based swap participant. 1184 The
Commission sought comment on the reasonableness and accuracy of our estimates, but received
no comments regarding these estimates.
Of the 55 entities likely to be either security-based swap dealers or major security-based
swap participants, the Commission staff estimates that 18 entities will be registered foreign
security-based swap dealers, as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(3) or foreign major securitybased swap participants, as defined in proposed Rule 3a67-10(a)(1) (collectively, “Nonresident
SBS Entities”). 1185 The Commission staff expects that most registered Nonresident SBS Entities
will be based in one of a small number of non-U.S. jurisdictions; however, the Commission
understands that approximately 19 jurisdictions are in the process of developing regulations
and/or infrastructure for swaps, security-based swaps, and other OTC derivatives. 1186 In
addition, the Commission anticipates that a small number of security-based swap market
participants could be based in other jurisdictions. As a result, the Commission staff estimate that
cross-border issues may arise in connection with security-based swap market participants and
transactions in and between up to 30 discrete jurisdictions. 1187
1183

External Business Conduct Standards Proposing Release, 76 FR at 46668.

1185

While the Commission estimated in the Registration Proposing Release that 22 non-resident
entities would likely register with the Commission as SBS Entities (see Registration Proposing
Release, 76 FR at 65807-12), our estimates have changed based on the staff’s further analysis of
the cross-border issues and likely respondents.

1186

See FSB Progress Report April 2013. These 19 jurisdictions are: Argentina, Australia, Brazil,
Canada, China, the European Union, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Republic
of Korea, Russia, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Turkey, and the United
States. See also notes 35 and 36, supra.

1187

The European Union is regulating OTC derivatives reporting, clearing, and bilateral risk
management on a pan-European basis. Accordingly, the Commission may treat the European

348

In the Registration Proposing Release, Commission staff further estimated, based on its
experience and understanding of the swap and security-based swap markets that of the firms that
may register as SBS Entities, approximately 35 also will register with the CFTC as swap dealers
or major swap participants, approximately 16 would also be registered with the Commission as
broker-dealers, and approximately 4 firms not otherwise registered with the CFTC or the
Commission will seek to become an SBS Entity. 1188 The Commission sought comment on the
reasonableness and accuracy of our estimates, but has received no comments regarding these
estimates to date.
The Commission again seeks comment on the reasonableness and accuracy of our
estimates as to the number of participants in the security-based swap market that will be required
to register with the Commission through the use of re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and
SBSE-BD, including the number of registered foreign security-based swap dealers. The
Commission also seeks comment on our estimate of the number of jurisdictions with securitybased swap participants or infrastructure that may transact with or be used by U.S.-regulated
entities.
4. Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
(a) Paperwork Burden Associated With Filing Application Forms
As indicated in the Registration Proposing Release, proposed Rule 15Fb2–1 would
require that each SBS Entity register with the Commission by filing an application on Form
SBSE, Form SBSE-A, or Form SBSE-BD, as appropriate. Each SBS Entity would only need to
research, complete, and file one form. 1189 The Commission is not proposing to amend this rule,
but is re-proposing the Forms that would be filed to facilitate registration. The modifications to
re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE-BD would add two questions to Form SBSE and
Form SBSE-A, add one question to all three Forms, and would modify Schedule F to all the
Forms.
The Commission staff does not believe that the addition of these questions will
significantly increase the burdens associated with the filing of these forms. In the Registration
Proposing Release, the Commission staff estimated that approximately four firms would need to
register using proposed Form SBSE and that the total paperwork burden associated with filing
each proposed Form SBSE (including the Schedules 1190 and disclosure reporting pages
Union as a single jurisdiction for purposes of certain cross-border issues. However, the
Commission notes that there may be variation between individual European countries even within
this consolidated approach (e.g., privacy laws or supervisory oversight or enforcement may differ
in various European countries).

Id. at 65820-21.

1190

Except Schedule G (which we are not proposing to amend) and Schedule F (which is dealt with
separately below).

349

(“DRPs”)) would be approximately 40 hours for each firm that would use this Form. 1191 The
Commission staff acknowledged that it is likely that the time necessary to complete these forms
would vary depending on the nature and complexity of an entity’s business. 1192 The
Commission staff believes, based on its experience with Form BD, that the addition of three new
questions to Form SBSE included in the re-proposed Form SBSE could increase the amount of
time it would take for an SBS Entity to complete this form by about two hours. Thus, the
Commission staff estimates that it would take all 4 SBS Entities who may use Form SBSE to
register with the Commission a total of approximately 168 hours to register using re-proposed
Form SBSE. 1193 As each SBS Entity would only be required to file 1 complete form once, this
would be a one-time burden associated with registration 1194 (the burden associated with
amendments to the form are discussed below).
As proposed, Form SBSE–A contains fewer questions than the proposed Form SBSE and
is available only to firms that are (or will be) familiar with the registration process because they
are registered (or will be registering) with the CFTC as a swap dealer or major swap participant.
As a result, the Commission staff estimated in the Registration Proposing Release that it would
take SBS Entities filing proposed Form SBSE-A approximately 80% of the time that it would
take for an unregistered entity to research, complete, and file proposed Form SBSE (including
the Schedules and DRPs). 1195 Accordingly, the Commission staff estimated that the total
paperwork burden associated with filing each proposed Form SBSE-A across 35 firms would be
approximately 32 hours for each firm who would use this Form. 1196 The Commission staff
believes, based on its experience with Form BD, that the addition of 3 new questions to Form
SBSE-A included in the re-proposed Form SBSE-A could increase the amount of time it would
take for an SBS Entity to complete this form by about two hours. Thus, the Commission staff
estimates that it would take all 35 SBS Entities who may use Form SBSE-A to register with the
Commission a total of approximately 1,190 hours to register using re-proposed Form SBSE1191

Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65808.

1192

Id.

1193

42 hours * 4 firms = 168 hours.

1194

While it is possible that another firm may choose to register as an SBS Entity at some future time,
we presently estimate for purposes of this PRA that no additional firms will register in the next
three years. This is because the Dodd-Frank Act imposed regulation on an existing industry and
we expect those industry participants presently engaged in this business to either register when
the rules become effective or decide to withdraw from this business. In addition, the costs to
start-up an SBS Entity will likely be high, which may discourage new entrants. Finally, as the
Commission has not yet promulgated rules to register or regulate these entities and we have no
experience with the registration trends of SBS Entities over time, any estimate regarding the
number of possible new entrants over time would be speculative.

1195

Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65808. This estimate assumes that an entity that is
familiar with an analogous registration process would require approximately 20% less time to
complete Form SBSE-A compared to an unregistered entity completing Form SBSE.

1196

Id.

350

A. 1197 As each SBS Entity would only be required to file 1 complete form once, this would be a
one-time burden associated with registration 1198 (the burden associated with amendments to the
form are discussed below).
As proposed, Form SBSE–BD contains fewer questions than both the proposed Form
SBSE and Form SBSE-A and is available only to firms that are (or will be) familiar with the
registration process because they are registered (or will be registering) with the Commission as a
broker-dealer. As a result, the Commission staff estimated in the Registration Proposing Release
that it would take SBS Entities filing proposed Form SBSE-BD approximately 25% of the time
that it would take for an unregistered entity to research, complete, and file proposed Form SBSE
(including the Schedules and DRPs). 1199 Accordingly, the Commission staff estimated that the
total paperwork burden associated with filing each proposed Form SBSE-BD across sixteen
firms would be approximately ten hours for each firm that would use this Form. 1200 The
Commission staff believes, based on its experience with Form BD, that the addition of one new
question to Form SBSE-BD included in the re-proposed Form SBSE-BD could increase the
amount of time it would take for an SBS Entity to complete this form by about one half hour.
Thus, the Commission staff estimates that it would take all sixteen SBS Entities that may use
Form SBSE-BD to register with the Commission a total of approximately 168 hours to register
using re-proposed Form SBSE-BD. 1201 As each SBS Entity would only be required to file one
complete form once, this would be a one-time burden associated with registration 1202 (the burden
associated with amendments to the form are discussed below).
(b) Paperwork Burden Associated With Amending Schedule F
As indicated in the Registration Proposing Release, proposed Rule 15Fb2-4 would
require that each nonresident SBS Entity file an additional schedule (Schedule F) with its Form
SBSE, Form SBSE-A, or Form SBSE-BD, as appropriate, to identify its U.S. agent for service of
process and to certify that the firm can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with access
to its books and records and can, as a matter of law, submit to onsite inspection and examination
by the Commission. 1203 The Commission is not proposing to amend this rule, but is re-proposing
Schedule F. The modifications to re-proposed Schedule F would divide Schedule F into two
sections. Section I would include the full text of the originally proposed Schedule F. Section II
would elicit additional information regarding foreign regulators with which the applicant may be
registered or that otherwise have jurisdiction over the applicant.
1197

34 hours * 35 firms = 1,190 hours.

Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65822.

351

The Commission staff does not believe that the addition of this new Section would
significantly increase the burdens associated with the filing of Schedule F because information
regarding the foreign regulators with jurisdiction over the entity should be known and readily
available. In the Registration Proposing Release, the Commission staff estimated, based on its
experience relative to the securities industry and Form BD, that the average time necessary for
each Nonresident SBS Entity to complete and file Schedule F would be approximately one
hour. 1204 The Commission staff believes, based on its experience with Form BD, that adding the
new section to Schedule F could increase the amount of time it would take for an SBS Entity to
complete this form by about one-half hour. Thus, the Commission staff estimates that it would
take all 18 Non-resident SBS Entities who may use Schedule F to register with the Commission a
total of approximately 27 hours complete Schedule F. 1205 As each SBS Entity would only be
required to file Schedule F once, this would be a one-time burden associated with registration 1206
(the burden associated with amendments to the form – including the schedules – are discussed
below).
(c) Paperwork Burden Associated With Amending Application Forms
As discussed in the Registration Proposing Release, proposed Rule 15Fb2–3 would
require that SBS Entities amend their applications if they find that information contained in a
prior filing has become inaccurate. 1207 The Commission is not proposing to amend this rule;
however, the addition of three questions to proposed Forms SBSE and SBSE-A, the addition of
one question to Form SBSE-BD, and the revisions to Schedule F would provide additional
information that could change over time and require amendment of these Forms. As indicated in
the Registration Proposing Release, the staff does not expect that the requirement to amend these
Forms would impose a significant burden because each SBS Entity would have already
completed proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, or SBSE–BD, as applicable, and would only need to
amend those aspects of the Forms that may become inaccurate. In the Registration Proposing
Release, the staff estimated, based on the number of amendments the Commission receives
annually on Form BD, that each SBS Entity would file approximately three amendments
annually. 1208 The staff also estimated in the Registration Proposing Release that, although the
time necessary to file an amendment to proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, or SBSE–BD, as
applicable, would vary depending on the nature and complexity of the amendment, the
Commission staff estimates the average total annual burden associated with amending proposed
Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE-BD would be approximately one hour for each
amendment. 1209 The staff does not believe the addition of 3 questions included in each of reproposed Forms SBSE and SBSE-A, the addition of one new question to re-proposed Form
1204

Id. at 65811.

1205

1½ hours * 18 Non-resident SBS Entities = 27 hours.

SBSE-BD, and the revision of Schedule F would increase either the number of amendments each
firm may be required to file or the amount of time it would take for a firm to file an
amendment. 1210 Thus we continue to believe the annual burden for associated with Rule 15Fb23 would be approximately 165 hours. 1211
As indicated in the Registration Proposing Release, the collection of information relating
to Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, SBSE-BD and Schedule F would be mandatory, and the Commission
intends to make the information provided through these forms and Schedule F public.
5. Request for Comment on Paperwork Burden Estimates
The Commission seeks comment on the paperwork burdens associated with proposed
Rules 15Fb1–1 through 15Fb6–1 and re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE–BD, as
applicable.
•

What burdens, if any, would respondents incur with respect to system design,
programming, expanding systems capacity, and establishing compliance programs to
comply with re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE–BD, as applicable?

•

Is it likely that SBS Entities would complete re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and
SBSE–BD, as applicable, themselves or is it more likely that they would obtain
assistance in completing these forms from some outside entity (e.g., outside counsel)?
If an SBS Entity obtains assistance in completing the forms from an outside entity,
what type of entity may be utilized and what may the relative costs to employ such an
entity for this purpose be?

•

The Commission estimates that no new SBS Entities will register after year 1 because
the security-based swap market is already well-developed and because of potentially
significant barriers to entry for prospective market participants. Is this estimate
accurate? If not, how many SBS Entities will register after year 1?

•

Would there be different or additional paperwork burdens associated with the
collection of information under re-proposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE–BD,
as applicable, that a respondent does not currently undertake in the ordinary course of
business that the Commission has failed to identify? If so, please both describe and
quantify any additional burden(s).

1210

The estimated number of amendments filed by each SBS Entity in the Registration Proposing
Release was based on the number of amendments to Form BD filed annually by broker-dealers.
See Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65809. We did not base our estimate on a
comparison of the number or content of the questions, because we have no data upon which to
base that type of estimate and we believe it would be too speculative.

1211

1 hour * 3 amendments per year * 55 SBS Entities = 165 hours.

353

C. Disclosures by Certain Foreign Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based
Swap Participants
1. Summary of Collection of Information
A registered foreign security-based swap dealer must disclose to any counterparty that is
a U.S. person, prior to accepting any assets from, for, or on behalf of such counterparty to
margin, guarantee, or secure a security-based swap, the potential treatment of any assets
segregated by the registered foreign security-based swap dealer pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 3E in an insolvency proceeding under U.S. bankruptcy law and any applicable foreign
insolvency laws. 1212
2. Proposed Use of Information
The required disclosures would give U.S. counterparties important information regarding
the treatment of their collateral and the role of U.S. and foreign law in any insolvency
proceedings. The Commission preliminarily believes that this information would promote
transparency and help counterparties in fully assessing the risks associated with their
transactions. Moreover, without these disclosures, the Commission preliminarily believes that
there is a risk that some U.S. counterparties could assume, incorrectly, that any security-based
swap transaction with a registered foreign security-based swap dealer or major security-based
swap participant is automatically and fully subject to Title VII and other potentially applicable
U.S. laws (e.g., U.S. bankruptcy law). These disclosures would make such confusion less likely
and, as a result, help to ensure that U.S. counterparties conduct appropriate due diligence when
transacting with foreign security-based swap dealers.
The disclosures required pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-4(e) under the Exchange Act
would be mandatory for all registered foreign security-based swap dealers that enter into
security-based swaps with counterparties that are not U.S. persons.
Registered foreign security-based swap dealers are required to disclose information
pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-4(e) to their U.S. counterparties. Therefore, the Commission
would not typically receive confidential information as a result of this collection of information.
However, to the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to
proposed Rule 18a-4(e) through our examination and oversight program, an investigation, or
some other means, such information would be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of
applicable law. 1213
1212

Proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3) under the Exchange Act.

1213

See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552 (Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act provides an exemption
for “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged
or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Exemption 8 of the Freedom of Information Act provides
an exemption for matters that are “contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition
reports prepare by, or on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or
supervision of financial institutions.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)).

354

3. Respondents
As discussed in Section B.3 above, the Commission staff estimates that there will be 18
Nonresident SBS Entities and that most of these firms will be based in one of a small number of
non-U.S. jurisdictions. 1214 In addition, the Commission staff anticipates that a small number of
security-based swap market participants could be based in other jurisdictions. 1215 As a result, the
Commission staff estimates that cross-border issues may arise in connection with security-based
swap market participants and transactions in and between up to 30 discrete jurisdictions. 1216
4. Total Initial and Annual Reporting Burdens
The estimates in this section reflect the Commission’s experience with burden estimates
for similar disclosure requirements and our staff’s discussions with market participants. 1217
Pursuant to proposed Rule18a-4(e)(3), registered foreign security-based swap dealers would be
required to provide disclosures to their U.S. counterparties. The Commission believes that, in
most cases, these disclosures would be made through amendments to the registered foreign
security-based swap dealer’s existing trading documentation. Because these disclosures relate to
new regulatory requirements, the Commission anticipates that all registered foreign securitybased swap dealers would need to incorporate new language into their existing trading
documentation with U.S. counterparties. Disclosure of the potential treatment of segregated
assets in insolvency proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law and foreign insolvency laws
pursuant to proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3) would likely vary depending on the counterparty’s
jurisdiction. Accordingly, the Commission expects that these disclosures often may need to be
tailored to address the particular circumstances of each trading relationship. However, in some
cases, trade associations or industry working groups may be able to develop standard disclosure
forms that can be adopted by foreign security-based swap dealers with little or no modification.
In either case, the paperwork burden associated with developing new disclosure language and
incorporating this language into a registered foreign security-based swap dealer’s trading
documentation will vary depending on: (1) the number of non-U.S. counterparties with whom
the registered foreign security-based swap dealer trades; (2) the number of jurisdictions
represented by the registered foreign security-based swap dealer’s counterparties; and (3) the
availability of standardized disclosure language. To the extent standardized disclosures become
available, the paperwork burden on registered foreign security-based swap dealers would be
limited to amending existing trading documentation to incorporate the standardized disclosures.

355

Conversely, more time will be necessary where a greater degree of customization is required to
develop the required disclosures and incorporate this language into existing documentation.
The Commission estimates the maximum total paperwork burden associated with
developing new disclosure language would be approximately 2,700 hours, plus $2.1 million for
all 18 foreign security-based swap dealers and 30 jurisdictions. 1218 This estimate assumes little
or no reliance on standardized disclosure language. In addition, the Commission estimates the
total paperwork burden associated with incorporating new disclosure language into each foreign
security-based swap dealer’s trading documentation would be approximately 9,000 hours for all
18 foreign security-based swap dealers. 1219
The Commission expects that the majority of the paperwork burden associated with the
new disclosure requirements will be experienced during the first year as language is developed,
whether by individual foreign security-based swap dealers or through collaborative efforts, and
trading documentation is amended. After the new disclosure language is developed and
incorporated into trading documentation, the Commission believes that the ongoing burden
associated with proposed Rule 18a-4(e) would be limited to periodically updating the disclosures
to reflect changes in the applicable law or to incorporate new jurisdictions with security-based
swap counterparties. The Commission estimates that this ongoing paperwork burden would not
exceed 100 hours per year for all 18 foreign security-based swap dealers (approximately 5 hours
per foreign security-based swap dealer per year).
5. Request for Comment on Paperwork Burden Estimates
The Commission seeks comment on the paperwork burdens associated with proposed
Rule18a-4(e).
•

Is it likely that foreign security-based swap participants will have more than 50 active
non-U.S. counterparties?

•

In how many discrete jurisdictions do most foreign security-based swap participants
have counterparties?

•

In general, is the proposed collection of information necessary for the proper
performance of the Commission’s functions? Will the proposed collection of
information have practical utility to the Commission and Commission staff?

1218

The Commission staff estimates the total paperwork burden associated with developing new
disclosure language for each foreign security-based swap dealer would be 150 hours of in-house
counsel time (5 hours of in-house counsel time * up to 30 potential jurisdictions), plus $120,000
(based on 10 hours of outside counsel time * $400 * up to 30 potential jurisdictions).

1219

The Commission staff estimate that the average Nonresident SBS Entity will have 50 active nonU.S. counterparties. Accordingly, the Commission staff estimates the cost of incorporating new
disclosure language into the trading documentation of an average foreign security-based swap
participant would be 500 hours per foreign security-based swap participant (based on 10 hours of
in-house counsel time * 50 active non-U.S. counterparties).

D. Reliance on Counterparty Representations Regarding Activity Within the United States
1. Summary of Collection of Information
When determining whether a security-based swap is a “transaction conducted through a
foreign branch,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(i) under the Exchange Act, a party
may rely on a representation from its counterparty indicating that “no person within the United
States is directly involved in soliciting, negotiating, or executing” the transaction on behalf of the
counterparty, unless the party receiving the representation knows that it is not accurate. 1220
Similarly, when determining whether a security-based swap is a “transaction conducted within
the United States,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5)(i), a party may rely on a
representation from its counterparty indicating that the transaction “is not solicited, negotiated,
executed, or booked within the United States by or on behalf of such counterparty,” unless the
party receiving the representation knows that it is not accurate. 1221
2. Proposed Use of Information
Under the proposed rules, certain Title VII requirements would not apply to cross-border
transactions conducted through a foreign branch of a U.S. bank where the foreign branch is the
named counterparty to the transaction and no person within the United States is directly involved
in soliciting, negotiating, or executing the security-based swap on behalf of the foreign branch or
its counterparty. For example, under the proposed rules, a non-U.S. person would not be
required to count toward the de minimis threshold in the security-based swap dealer definition its
transactions with the foreign branch of a U.S. bank. Conversely, certain Title VII requirements
would apply to transactions conducted within the United States, even if both counterparties are
non-U.S. persons.
The Commission acknowledges that verifying whether a security-based swap falls within
the definition of a “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” or a “transaction conducted

1221

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5)(ii) under the Exchange Act.

357

within the United States” could require significant due diligence. The Commission preliminarily
believes that the representations described in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii) and proposed Rule
3a71-3(a)(5)(ii) would mitigate the operational difficulties that could arise in connection with
investigating the activities of a counterparty to ensure compliance with the corresponding rules.
The representations described in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii) and proposed Rule 3a713(a)(5)(ii) would be provided voluntarily by the counterparties to certain security-based swap
transactions; therefore, the Commission would not typically receive confidential information as a
result of this collection of information. However, to the extent that the Commission receives
confidential information described in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii) or proposed Rule 3a713(a)(5)(iii) through our examination and oversight program, an investigation, or some other
means, such information would be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of applicable
law. 1222
3. Respondents
Based on our understanding of the OTC derivatives markets, including the size of the
market, the number of counterparties that are active in the market, and how market participants
currently structure security-based swap transactions, the Commission preliminarily estimates that
50 entities may include a representation that a security-based swap is a “transaction conducted
through a foreign branch” in their trading relationship documentation (e.g., the schedule to a
master agreement). Similarly, the Commission preliminarily estimates that 250 entities may
include a representation that a security-based swap is not a “transaction conducted within the
United States.” 1223
4. Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
The estimates in this section reflect the Commission’s experience with burden estimates
for similar requirements and our discussions with market participants. 1224 Pursuant to proposed
Rules 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii) and 3a71-3(a)(5)(iii), parties to security-based swaps would be permitted
to rely on certain representations from their counterparties when determining whether a
transaction falls within the definition of a “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” or a
“transaction conducted within the United States.” The Commission preliminarily believes that,
in most cases, these representations would be made through amendments to the parties’ existing

1222

See, e.g., 5 U.S.C. 552 (Exemption 4 of the Freedom of Information Act provides an exemption
for “trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged
or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). Exemption 8 of the Freedom of Information Act provides
an exemption for matters that are “contained in or related to examination, operating, or condition
reports prepare by, or on behalf of, or for the use of an agency responsible for the regulation or
supervision of financial institutions.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(8)).

358

trading documentation (e.g., the schedule to a master agreement). 1225 Because these
representations relate to new regulatory requirements, the Commission anticipates that
counterparties may elect to develop and incorporate these representations in trading
documentation soon after the effective date of the Commission’s security-based swap
regulations, rather than incorporating specific language on a transactional basis. The
Commission believes that parties would be able to adopt, where appropriate, standardized
language across all of their security-based swap trading relationships. This language may be
developed by individual firms or through a combination of trade associations and industry
working groups.
The Commission estimates the maximum total paperwork burden associated with
developing new representations would be, for each entity, no more than approximately three to
five hours, plus between $1,200 and $2,000 for the services of outside professionals, for a
maximum of approximately 1,500 hours and $600,000 across all security-based swap
counterparties. 1226 This estimate assumes little or no reliance on standardized disclosure
language. In addition, the Commission estimates the total paperwork burden associated with
incorporating new disclosure language would be no more than approximately three to five hours
per counterparty, for a maximum of approximately 15,000 hours across all applicable securitybased swap counterparties. 1227
The Commission expects that the majority of the burden associated with the new
disclosure requirements will be experienced during the first year as language is developed and
trading documentation is amended. After the new representations are developed and
incorporated into trading documentation, the Commission believes that the annual paperwork
1225

The Commission preliminarily believes that because trading relationship documentation is
established between two counterparties, whether one or both counterparties is able to represent
that it is entering into a “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” or a “transaction
conducted within the United States” would not change on a transaction-by-transaction basis and,
therefore, such representations would generally be made in the schedule to a master agreement,
rather than in individual confirmations.

1226

Because the representations will be short and based on facts that should be known and readily
available to the entity making the representation, the Commission staff estimates the paperwork
burden associated with developing new representations would range from three to five hours of
in-house counsel time, plus $1,200 to 2,000 for the services of outside professionals (based on
three to five hours of outside counsel time * $400)). The Commission staff estimates that the
burden for counterparties that only require one of the two representations would be at the lower
end of this range.

1227

The Commission staff estimates that the average security-based swap counterparty (including
security-based swap dealers and buy-side counterparties) will have no more than 10 active
counterparties able to represent that a transaction is conducted through a foreign branch, not
conducted within the United States, or both. Accordingly, the Commission staff estimates the
total burden associated with incorporating new disclosure language into the relevant trading
documentation would be 15,000 hours (based on five hours per counterparty * 300 respondents *
10 applicable security-based swap counterparties).

359

burden associated with this requirement would be no more than approximately 10 hours per
counterparty for verifying representations with existing counterparties and onboarding new
counterparties, for a maximum of approximately 3,000 hours across all applicable security-based
swap counterparties. 1228
5. Request for Comment on Paperwork Burden Estimates
The Commission seeks comment on the paperwork burdens associated with proposed
Rules 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii) and 3a71-3(a)(5)(ii).
•

Are the Commission’s estimates of the numbers of market participants that will
include a representation that a security-based swap is a “transaction conducted
through a foreign branch” or not a “transaction conducted within the United States”
reasonable? Are these estimates likely to become incorrect as a result of changes in
the OTC derivatives markets? If so, how?

•

Is the Commission’s estimate that a representation that a security-based swap is a
“transaction conducted through a foreign branch” or not a “transaction conducted
within the United States” will be made in a schedule to a master agreement rather
than in individual confirmations reasonable? If not, where will these representations
be made?

•

In general, is the proposed collection of information necessary for the proper
performance of the Commission’s functions? Will the proposed collection of
information have practical utility to the Commission and Commission staff?

•

Are the Commission’s estimates of the paperwork burden of the proposed collection
accurate?

•

Is the Commission’s estimate of the cost of outside counsel reasonable?

•

Are there ways for the Commission to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information collected? Are there ways for the Commission to minimize the
paperwork burden of the proposed collection of information (e.g., through the use of
automated collection techniques or other forms of information technology)? If so,
please describe.

E. Requests for Cross-Border Substituted Compliance Determinations
1. Summary of Collection of Information
The Commission is proposing to apply various Title VII provisions to SBS Entities and
related market infrastructures on a cross-border basis. However, as noted above, the
1228

The Commission staff estimates that this burden would consist of 10 hours of in-house counsel
time for each security-based swap market participant.

360

Commission would permit, in appropriate circumstances, compliance with comparable
regulatory requirements in a foreign jurisdiction to substitute for compliance with certain
requirements of the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder, relating to securitybased swaps. As proposed, the Commission would consider making substituted compliance
determinations with respect to four distinct categories of rules: (1) requirements applicable to
registered foreign security-based swap dealers under Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder pursuant to proposed Rule 3a71-5(c) under the Exchange Act;
(2) requirements relating to regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based
swaps pursuant to re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR; (3) requirements
relating to clearing for security-based swaps; 1229 and (4) requirements relating to trade execution
for security-based swaps pursuant to proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the Exchange Act.
Requests for a substituted compliance determination would come from registered foreign
security-based swap dealers or other persons. 1230 However, under the proposed rules noted
above, the Commission would make any determinations with respect to particular requirements
on a class or jurisdiction basis, depending on the specific characteristics of the foreign regulatory
regime, rather than on a firm-by-firm basis. 1231 Once the Commission has made a substituted
compliance determination, other similarly situated market participants would be able to rely on
that determination to the extent applicable and subject to any corresponding conditions.
Accordingly, the Commission expects that requests for a substituted compliance determination
would be made only where an entity seeks to rely on particular requirements of a foreign
jurisdiction that have not previously been the subject of a substituted compliance request. The
Commission believes that this approach would substantially reduce the burden associated with
requesting substituted compliance determinations for an entity that relies on a previously issued
determination, and, therefore, complying with the Commission’s rules and regulations more
generally. 1232
When applying for a substituted compliance determination under one of the proposed
rules, an entity would be required to provide the Commission with any supporting documentation
as the Commission may request, in addition to information that the entity believes is necessary
for the Commission to make a determination, such as information demonstrating that the
requirements applied in the foreign jurisdiction are comparable to the Commission’s and
describing the methods used by relevant foreign financial regulatory authorities to monitor
1229

The Commission is not proposing a rule regarding the substituted compliance process for the
mandatory clearing requirement. See Section XI.E, supra.

1230

As discussed above, the Commission is not proposing to permit substituted compliance for
registered foreign major security-based swap participants.

1231

Requests for substituted compliance determinations under proposed Rule 3a71-5(c) under the
Exchange Act must come directly from a foreign security-based swap dealer (or a group of such
dealers); foreign financial regulatory authorities may not request such a determination. Proposed
Rule 3a71-5(c) under the Exchange Act.

1232

The paperwork burden associated with requesting substituted compliance determinations is
discussed in detail in Section XIV.E.4 below.

361

compliance with those requirements. A foreign security-based swap dealer (or a group of
foreign security-based swap dealers of the same class) seeking a substituted compliance
determination with respect to one or more requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder also must demonstrate that it is directly supervised by the
foreign financial regulatory authority (with respect to requirements relating to the applicable
requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act) and provide the certification and opinion of
counsel, as described in Rule 15Fb2-4(c). 1233
The Commission is proposing that applicants follow the procedures set forth in proposed
Rule 0-13 under the Exchange Act for an application requesting a substituted compliance
determination. 1234
2. Proposed Use of Information
The Commission would use the information collected pursuant to proposed Rule 3a715(c) under the Exchange Act to evaluate requests for substituted compliance with respect to
requirements applicable to registered security-based swap dealers (or classes thereof) under
Section 15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The Commission
would use the information collected pursuant to re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation
SBSR to evaluate requests for substituted compliance with regard to requirements applicable to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps. Finally, the Commission
would use the information collected pursuant to proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the Exchange Act
to evaluate requests for substituted compliance with regard to requirements relating to trade
execution for security-based swaps.
The requests for substituted compliance determinations in proposed Rule 3a71-5, reproposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii), and proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the Exchange Act are
required when a person seeks a substituted compliance determination.
The Commission intends to make public the information submitted to it pursuant to any
request for a substituted compliance determination under proposed Rules 3a71-(5), re-proposed
Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii), and proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the Exchange Act, including
supporting documentation provided by the requesting party.
3. Respondents
As discussed in Section XIV.B.3 above, the Commission preliminarily estimates that
there will be 22 Nonresident SBS Entities and that most of these firms will be based in one of a
small number of non-U.S. jurisdictions. 1235 In addition, the Commission staff anticipates that a
small number of security-based swap market participants could be based in other

1233

Proposed Rule 3a71-5(c); see also Section XIV.B, supra.

1234

See Section XI.B, supra (discussing proposed Rule 0-13 under the Exchange Act).

1235

See Section XIV.B.3, supra.

362

jurisdictions. 1236 As a result, the Commission staff estimates that requests for substituted
compliance determinations may arise in connection with security-based swap market participants
and transactions in and between up to 30 discrete jurisdictions. 1237
4. Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
Proposed Rule 3a71-5 under the Exchange Act, proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the
Exchange Act, and re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR would require
submission of certain information to the Commission to the extent entities elect to request a
substituted compliance determination with respect to one or more areas where the Commission
has issued rules under the Dodd-Frank Act.
(a) Proposed Rule 3a71-5
Proposed Rule 3a71-5(c) under the Exchange Act would apply only to registered foreign
security-based swap dealers (or classes thereof) that request a substituted compliance
determination with regard to one or more requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act and
the rules and regulations thereunder. As discussed above, in connection with each request, a
registered foreign security-based swap dealer would be required to provide the Commission with
any supporting documentation it believes necessary for the Commission to make a determination
that its foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities have established requirements that are
comparable to requirements otherwise applicable to a U.S. security-based swap dealer. Among
other things, a foreign security-based swap dealer would be required to provide the Commission
with information regarding applicable requirements established by the foreign financial
regulatory authority or authorities, as well as the methods used by the foreign financial
regulatory authority or authorities to monitor compliance with these rules. All such supporting
documentation would be made public. 1238
A registered foreign security-based swap dealer would not be required to make a request
with respect to rules and regulations of a foreign jurisdiction that have previously been the
subject of a substituted compliance determination. Given that only a relatively small number of
jurisdictions have substantial OTC derivatives markets and are implementing OTC derivatives
reforms, the Commission estimates that it will receive no more than 50 requests for substituted
compliance determinations pursuant to proposed Rule 3a71-5. 1239 This estimate accounts for the
fact that the Commission may receive multiple requests from each jurisdiction (e.g., separate
requests from bank and nonbank entities). 1240 Because the Commission preliminarily expects

1239

See Section XIV.B.3, supra.

1240

The Commission preliminarily estimates that is may receive requests for substituted compliance
determinations for up to 30 different jurisdictions. In approximately two-thirds of those

363

that registered foreign security-based swap dealers will seek to rely on substituted compliance
upon registration, the Commission believes that these requests will be made during the first year
following the effective date. 1241
The Commission staff estimates that the total paperwork burden associated with
preparing and submitting a request for a substituted compliance determination pursuant to
proposed Rule 3a71-5(c) would be approximately 4,000 hours, plus $4 million for the services of
outside professionals for all 50 requests. 1242 These total costs include all collection burdens
associated with the proposed rule, including burdens associated with analyzing and comparing
the regulatory requirements of the foreign jurisdiction with the requirements in Section 15F of
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
(b) Re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR
Re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR would apply to any person that
requests a substituted compliance determination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction’s rules
regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps. In connection
with each request, the requesting party would be required to provide the Commission with any
supporting documentation that the entity believes is necessary for the Commission to make a
determination, including information demonstrating that the requirements applied in the foreign
jurisdiction are comparable to the Commission’s and describing the methods used by relevant
foreign financial regulatory authorities to monitor compliance with those requirements. 1243 The
Commission preliminarily estimates that the total paperwork burden associated with submitting a
request for a substituted compliance determination with respect to regulatory reporting and
public dissemination would be approximately 1,120 hours, plus $1,120,000 for 14 requests. 1244
jurisdictions, the Commission preliminarily estimates that it may receive requests from more than
one type of market participant (e.g., a bank and a non-bank security-based swap dealer).
1241

For purposes of this estimate, the Commission has assumed that proposed Rules 3a71-3 and
3a71-5 will be implemented contemporaneously. If the Commission requires registration before
certain substituted compliance determinations are finalized, the Commission staff may receive
requests for substituted compliance determinations pursuant to proposed Rule 3a71-5 after the
first year following the effective date.

1242

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making each
substituted compliance request pursuant to proposed Rule 3a71-5 would be approximately 80
hours of in-house counsel time, plus $80,000 for the services of outside professionals (based on
200 hours of outside counsel time * $400). The paperwork burden associated with the opinion of
counsel referenced in proposed Rule 3a71-5 is discussed in the Registration Proposing Release in
connection with proposed Rule 15Fb2-4(c). See Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65811.

1243

See Section VIII.C, supra.

1244

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making a substituted
compliance request pursuant to re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR would be
approximately 80 of in-house counsel time, plus $80,000 for the services of outside professionals
(based on 200 hours of outside counsel time * $400).

364

This estimate includes all collection burdens associated with the request, including burdens
associated with analyzing whether the regulatory requirements of the foreign jurisdiction impose
a comparable, comprehensive system for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of all
security-based swaps. Furthermore, this estimate assumes that each request would be prepared
de novo, without any benefit of prior work on related subjects. The Commission notes, however,
that as such requests are developed with respect to certain jurisdictions, the cost of preparing
such requests with respect to other foreign jurisdictions could decrease.
Because only a small number of jurisdictions have substantial OTC derivatives markets
and are implementing OTC derivatives reforms, the Commission preliminarily estimates that it
would receive approximately 10 requests in the first year for substituted compliance
determinations with respect to regulatory reporting and public dissemination pursuant to reproposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR. Assuming 10 requests in the first year, the
Commission staff estimates an aggregated burden for the first year would be 800 hours, plus
$800,000 for the services of outside professionals. 1245 The Commission preliminarily estimates
that it would receive 2 requests for substituted compliance determinations pursuant to reproposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) in each subsequent year. Assuming the same approximate time
and costs, the aggregate burden for each year following the first year would be up to 160 hours
of company time and $160,000 for the services of outside professionals. 1246
(c) Proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c)
Finally, proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the Exchange Act would apply to any person who
requests a substituted compliance determination with respect to the rules of a foreign jurisdiction
relating to trade execution for security-based swaps. In connection with each request, the
requesting party would be required to provide the Commission with certain supporting
information. 1247 However, a person would not be required to make a request with respect to
rules and regulations of a foreign jurisdiction related to trade execution that have previously been
the subject of a substituted compliance determination. As discussed above, because only a
relatively small number of jurisdictions have substantial OTC derivatives markets and are
implementing OTC derivatives reforms, the Commission estimates that it will receive no more
than 25 requests for substituted compliance determinations pursuant to proposed Rule 3Ch1245

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making a substituted
compliance request pursuant to re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR would be
up to approximately 800 hours (80 hours of in-house counsel time * 10 respondents), plus
$800,000 for the services of outside professionals (based on 200 hours of outside counsel time *
$400 * 10 respondents).

1246

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making a substituted
compliance request pursuant to re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation SBSR would be
up to approximately 160 hours (80 hours of in-house counsel time * two respondents) + plus
$160,000 for the services of outside professionals (based on 200 hours of outside counsel time *
$400 * two respondents).

1247

See Section XIV.E.1, supra.

365

2(c). 1248 Moreover, because market participants will likely seek to rely on substituted
compliance upon registration, the Commission believes that many of these requests will be made
during the first year following the effective date. However, because some jurisdictions may not
fully implement their trade execution requirements in the immediate future, the Commission
staff estimates that it may receive requests for substituted compliance determinations pursuant to
proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) for several years following the effective date. 1249
The Commission preliminarily believes that the total paperwork burden associated with
preparing and submitting a request for a substituted compliance determination pursuant to
proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) will be 2,000 hours and associated costs of $2 million for the services of
outside professionals, including attorneys. 1250 These total costs include all collection burdens
associated with the proposed rule, including burdens associated with analyzing whether the
regulatory requirements of the foreign jurisdiction impose a comparable, comprehensive system
for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of all security-based swaps.
Assuming 17 requests in the first year, the Commission staff estimates an aggregated
burden for the first year would be 1,360 hours, plus approximately $1,360,000 for the services of
outside professionals. 1251 The Commission preliminarily estimates that it would receive 4
requests for substituted compliance determinations pursuant to re-proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) in
each subsequent year. Assuming the same approximate time and costs, the aggregate burden for
each year following the first year would be up to 320 hours of company time and $320,000 for
the services of outside professionals. 1252
1248

See Section XIV.B.3, supra. The Commission notes that it may not receive requests for
substituted compliance determinations pursuant to proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) from every
jurisdiction will have a security-based swap market that is potentially eligible for such a
determination.

1249

The Commission notes that certain jurisdictions may implement OTC derivatives reforms
incrementally. Accordingly, the Commission’s estimates in this section are based on the
assumption that certain jurisdictions may implement trade execution requirements later in time
than other OTC derivatives reforms (e.g., dealer regulation, reporting, and mandatory clearing
requirements).

1250

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making each
substituted compliance request pursuant to proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) would be approximately
2,000 hours of in-house counsel time (80 hours * 25 respondents), plus $2,000,000 for the
services of outside professionals (based on 200 hours of outside counsel time * $400 * 25
respondents).

1251

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making a substituted
compliance request pursuant to proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) would be up to approximately 1,360
hours (80 hours of in-house counsel time * 17 respondents), plus approximately $1,360,000 for
the services of outside professionals (based on 200 hours of outside counsel time * $400 * 17
respondents).

1252

The Commission staff estimates that the paperwork burden associated with making a substituted
compliance request pursuant to proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) would be up to approximately 320 hours

366

Request for Comment
The Commission seeks comment on the paperwork burdens associated with proposed
Rules 3a71-5(c) under the Exchange Act, re-proposed Rule 242.908(c)(2)(ii) of Regulation
SBSR, and proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c) under the Exchange Act.
•

Are the Commission’s estimates of the numbers of substituted compliance
determinations reasonable? Are these estimates likely to become incorrect as a result
of changes in the OTC derivatives markets? If so, how?

•

In general, is the proposed collection of information necessary for the proper
performance of the Commission’s functions? Will the proposed collection of
information have practical utility to the Commission and Commission staff?

•

Are the Commission’s estimates of the paperwork burden of the proposed collection
accurate? Is the Commission’s estimate of the cost of outside counsel reasonable?

F. Reporting and Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information
1. Background on the Re-proposed Rules
The Commission is re-proposing Regulation SBSR to address a number of cross-border
issues, many of which were discussed in comments to the cross-border provisions of the initial
proposal. The changes made between the proposed and re-proposed versions of Regulation
SBSR, and the Commission’s preliminary estimates of the paperwork burdens that would result
from re-proposed Regulation SBSR, are described below.
2. Modifications to “Reporting Party” Rules
Proposed Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR, as amended herein, contains “collection of
information requirements” within the meaning of the PRA. The title of this collection is “Rule
901 – Reporting Obligations.”
(a) Summary of Collection of Information
Under Rule 901(a), as initially proposed, a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant might incur the duty to report only if the security-based
swap was executed in the United States or through any means of interstate commerce, or was
(80 hours of in-house counsel time * four respondents), plus $320,000 for the services of outside
professionals (based on 200 hours of outside counsel time * $400 * four respondents).

cleared through a clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United States. If a
non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant entered
into a swap with an unregistered U.S. person, the unregistered U.S. person would have incurred
the duty to report. As set forth in more detail above, the Commission is re-proposing Rule
901(a) to provide that a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that
is not a U.S. person could incur the duty to report a security-based swap in various cases. Reproposed Rule 901(a) now provides as follows:
•

If both sides of the security-based swap include a security-based swap dealer, the
sides would be required to select the reporting side.

•

If only one side of the security-based swap includes a security-based swap dealer, that
side would be the reporting side.

•

If both sides of the security-based swap include a major security-based swap
participant, the sides would be required to select the reporting side.

•

If one side of the security-based swap includes a major security-based swap
participant and the other side includes neither a security-based swap dealer nor a
major security-based swap participant, the side including the major security-based
swap participant would be reporting side.

•

If neither side of the security-based swap includes a security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant: (i) If both sides include a U.S. person or
neither side includes a U.S. person, the sides would be required to select the reporting
side; and (ii) If only one side includes a U.S. person, that side would be the reporting
side.

In addition, in re-proposed Rule 901, the Commission is proposing certain technical or
conforming changes. Specifically, the Commission is proposing certain changes to proposed
Rules 901(c) and 901(d), which address the data elements to be reported to a registered SDR, to
reflect that, under the re-proposal, certain security-based swaps might be subject to regulatory
reporting but not public dissemination. Rule 901(c), as initially proposed, was titled
“Information to be reported in real time.” Under Rule 902(a), as originally proposed, the
registered SDR to which such information was reported would be required to promptly
disseminate to the public such information (except in the case of a block trade). However, the
Commission preliminarily believes that, if a security-based swap were subject to regulatory
reporting but not public dissemination, there is no need to require that information about the
security-based swap be reported in real time. Therefore, the introductory language to Rule
901(c) is being re-proposed as follows: “For any security-based swap that must be publicly
disseminated pursuant to §§ 242.902 and 242.908 and for which it is the reporting side, the
reporting side shall report the following information in real time. If a security-based swap is
required by §§ 242.901 and 242.908 to be reported but not publicly disseminated, the reporting
side shall report the following information no later than the time that the reporting side is
required to comply with paragraph (d) of this section.” In addition, re-proposed Rule 901(c)
would be retitled “Primary trade information,” thus eliminating the reference to real-time
368

reporting—since the information required to be reported under Rule 901(c) would no longer in
all cases be required to be reported in real time. Furthermore, re-proposed Rule 901(d) would be
retitled “Secondary trade information.”
Rule 901(c)(10), as initially proposed, provided that the following data element would be
required to be reported: “If both counterparties to a security-based swap are security-based swap
dealers, an indication to that effect.” As the Commission stated in the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release: “Prices of transactions involving a dealer and a non-dealer are typically ‘allin’ prices that include a mark-up or mark-down, while interdealer transaction prices typically do
not. Thus, the Commission believes that requiring an indication of whether a [security-based
swap] was an interdealer transaction or a transaction between a dealer and a non-dealer
counterparty would enhance transparency by allowing market participants to more accurately
assess the reported price for a [security-based swap].” 1253 The Commission is now re-proposing
Rule 901(c)(10) as follows: “If both sides of the security-based swap include a security-based
swap dealer, an indication to that effect.” The re-proposed rule clarifies that a security-based
swap dealer might be a direct or indirect counterparty to a security-based swap. The
Commission continues to believe that, in either case, a security-based swap having a securitybased swap dealer on each side could, all other things being equal, be priced differently than a
security-based swap having a security-based swap dealer on only one side. Therefore, the
Commission continues to believe that the existence of a security-based swap dealer on each side
should be reported to the registered SDR and made known to the public.
The Commission is re-proposing Rule 901(d)(1)(ii) to require reporting of the broker ID,
desk ID, and trader ID, as applicable, only of the direct counterparty on the reporting side. The
Commission preliminarily believes that it would be impractical and unnecessary to report such
data elements with respect to an indirect counterparty, as such elements might not be applicable
to an indirect counterparty. Similarly, Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) is being re-proposed to require
reporting of a description of the terms and contingencies of the payment streams only of each
direct counterparty to the other. The Commission is including the word “direct” to avoid
extending Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) to indirect counterparty relationships, where payments might not
(except in unusual circumstances) flow to or from an indirect counterparty.
Proposed Rule 901(e) set forth provisions for reporting life cycle events of a securitybased swap. The basic approach set forth in proposed Rule 901(e) was that, generally, the
original reporting party of the initial transaction would have the responsibility to report any
subsequent life cycle event; this approach remains unchanged in the re-proposal. However, if the
life cycle event were an assignment or novation that removed the original reporting party, either
the new counterparty or the original counterparty would have to be the reporting party. Further,
Rule 901(e), as initially proposed, would provide that the new counterparty would be the
reporting party if it were a U.S. person, whereas the other counterparty would be the new
reporting party if the new counterparty were not a U.S. person.
However, as discussed above, the Commission is now proposing the concept of a
1253

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75214.

369

“reporting side,” which would include the direct and any indirect counterparty. Further, as
discussed above, the Commission is proposing that non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers
or major security-based swap participants would, in certain instances, incur a duty to report.
Thus, the Commission is re-proposing Rule 901(e) to provide that the duty to report would
switch to the other side only if the new side did not include a U.S. person (as in the originally
proposed rule) or a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
(references to which are being added to Rule 901(e)). The Commission preliminarily believes
that, if the new side includes a registered person such as a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant, the new side should retain the duty to report. This approach is
designed to align reporting duties with the market participants that the Commission preliminarily
believes are better suited to carrying them out because non-U.S. security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants likely have already taken significant steps to establish
and maintain the systems, processes and procedures, and staff resources necessary to report
security-based swaps currently. 1254
Aside from some technical changes to the titles of Rules 901(c) and (d) and to the
introductory language to Rule 901(c) noted above, the Commission is not proposing to add or
delete any data elements from Rules 901(c) and 901(d). Therefore, no revisions to the
Commission’s paperwork estimates are being made to increase or decrease paperwork burdens
because of more or fewer required data elements to be reported. However, other changes to the
paperwork burdens initially proposed for Rule 901 are necessitated by the other changes to the
proposed rule noted above.
(b) Proposed Use of Information
As described by the Commission in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the
security-based swap transaction information required to be reported pursuant to re-proposed Rule
901 would be used by SDRs, market participants, the Commission, and other regulators. The
information reported by reporting parties pursuant to re-proposed Rule 901 would be used by
SDRs to publicly disseminate real-time reports of security-based swap transactions, as well as to
offer a resource for regulators to obtain detailed information about the security-based swap
market. Market participants would use the public market data feed, among other things, to assess
the current market for security-based swaps and to mark their own positions. The Commission
and other regulators would use information about security-based swap transactions reported to
and held by SDRs to monitor and assess prudential and systemic risks, as well as to examine for
improper behavior and to take enforcement actions, as appropriate.
(c) Respondents
Re-proposed Rule 901(a) would designate which side of a security-based swap
transaction would be the reporting side. 1255 In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the
Commission stated our preliminary belief that up to 1,000 entities could incur duties to report
1254

See note 913 and accompanying text, supra; see also 15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(3).

1255

See Section VIII.D, supra (discussing the use of the term “reporting side”).

transactions under proposed Rule 901(a), and that it was reasonable to use the figure of 1,000
respondents for estimating collection of information burdens under the PRA. 1256 As discussed in
more detail below, the Commission now preliminarily estimates there would be 300 respondents
to re-proposed Rule 901.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission noted that proposed Rule
901 would impose certain duties on SDRs. The Commission preliminarily estimated that the
number of SDRs would not exceed 10. The Commission continues to believe that it is
reasonable to use 10 as an estimate of the number of SDRs for the purpose of estimating
collection of information burdens for re-proposed Regulation SBSR.
(d) Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
i.

Baseline Burdens

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that respondents
would face 3 categories of burdens to comply with proposed Rule 901. First, each entity that
would incur a duty to report security-based swap transactions pursuant to Regulation SBSR
would have to develop an internal order and trade management system (“OMS”) capable of
capturing the relevant transaction information. Second, each reporting party would have to
implement a reporting mechanism. Third, each reporting party would have to establish an
appropriate compliance program and support for the operation of the OMS and reporting
mechanism. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily
estimated that the initial, aggregate annualized burden associated with proposed Rule 901 would
be 1,438 hours per reporting party—for a total of 1,438,300 hours for all reporting parties—in
order to develop an OMS, implement a reporting mechanism, and establish an appropriate
compliance program and support system. 1257 The Commission preliminarily estimated that the
ongoing aggregate annualized burden associated with proposed Rule 901 would be 731 hours per
reporting party, for a total of 731,300 hours for all reporting parties. 1258 The Commission further
estimated that the initial aggregate annualized dollar cost burden on reporting parties associated
with Rule 901 would be $201,000 per reporting party, for a total of $201,000,000 for all
reporting parties. 1259
ii.

Re-proposed Burdens

For the reasons discussed above, the Commission now believes that it is appropriate to
re-propose those aspects of Regulation SBSR that would set out who must report security-based
1256

1257

See id. at 75250.

1258

See id.

1259

See id. The Commission notes that the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release incorrectly stated
this total as $301,000 per reporting party. The correct number is $201,000 per reporting party
($200,000 + $1,000).

371

swaps. First, the Commission is proposing to redefine the counterparties to a security-based
swap. Specifically, “counterparty” would be defined as “a direct or indirect counterparty of a
security-based swap.” Re-proposed Rule 900 would define “direct counterparty” as “a person
that enters directly with another person into a contract that constitutes a security-based swap”
and “indirect counterparty” as “a person that guarantees the performance of a direct counterparty
to a security-based swap or that otherwise provides recourse to the other side for the failure of
the direct counterparty to perform any obligation under the security-based swap.” Second,
proposed Rule 900 would revise the term “reporting party” to “reporting side” and would further
define “reporting side” as “the side of a security-based swap having the duty to report
information in accordance with re-proposed rules 242.900-911 of Regulation SBSR to a
registered security-based swap data repository, or if there is no registered security-based swap
data repository that would receive the information, to the Commission.” “Side” would be
defined as “a direct counterparty and any indirect counterparty that guarantees the direct
counterparty’s performance of any obligation under a security-based swap.”
As re-proposed, Rule 901(a) would provide that a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant that is not a U.S. person could incur the duty to report a securitybased swap in various cases, as detailed above. The Commission preliminarily believes that no
aspect of the re-proposal would significantly affect the burdens that an entity with a duty to
report would incur to establish the systems, policies and procedures, and staff resources
necessary to comply with Regulation SBSR. Therefore, the Commission is not revising these
initial infrastructure-related burdens on a per-entity basis.
However, the Commission is revising our initial estimate of the total infrastructurerelated burdens of re-proposed Rule 901(a) due to a reduction in the estimate of the number of
reporting counterparties. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated our
preliminary belief that up to 1,000 respondents could be reporting parties under proposed Rule
901(a), and that it was reasonable to use the figure of 1,000 respondents for estimating collection
of information burdens under the PRA. 1260 Since issuing the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release, the Commission has obtained additional and more granular data regarding participation
in the security-based swap market from DTCC-TIW. These historical data suggest that
approximately 30 counterparties—which are likely to be required to register with the
Commission as security-based swap dealers—account for the vast majority of recent securitybased swap transactions and transaction reports. These data further suggest that there are only a
limited number of security-based swap transactions that do not include at least one of these
larger counterparties on either side. In other words, the vast majority of recent transactions have
included a larger counterparty that reports the transaction currently, and that would likely be
required to report a similar transaction in the future.
In addition, the Commission is attempting in re-proposed Regulation SBSR to further
align reporting obligations to larger market participants that are better able to bear them. As a
1260

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75247. The Commission did not receive any
comments related to its preliminary belief that up to 1,000 respondents could be reporting parties
under proposed Rule 901(a) of Regulations SBSR.

372

result of all of these factors, and to the extent that recent security-based swap market activity
may be indicative of future activity, the Commission preliminarily believes that the more
appropriate estimate of reporting counterparties is 300, 700 fewer than in the original
proposal. 1261 This revised estimate continues to include some smaller counterparties to securitybased swaps that would incur a reporting duty, but many fewer than estimated in the PRA of the
initial Regulation SBSR proposal.
As a result of the revision to the number of reporting counterparties, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the one-time burdens of Regulation SBSR could decrease by
1,006,600 aggregated hours and $140,700,000. 1262 In addition, the Commission preliminarily
believes that the annual ongoing burden of Regulation SBSR could decrease by 511,700
aggregated hours and $140,700,000. 1263 The Commission seeks comment on and data to quantify
these potential cost reductions.
Although re-proposed Rule 901(a) could result in a significant reduction in aggregate
costs due to reduction in the number of reporting counterparties that would be required to
establish the systems, policies and procedures, and staff resources to carry out the reporting
function, the Commission preliminarily believes that there may be a slight increase in burden for
certain individual reporting counterparties due to a re-allocation of reportable security-based
swap transactions among those reporting counterparties that continue to be covered.
Specifically, small unregistered counterparties that may have been required to report a small
number of security-based swaps under the original proposal would be less likely to incur the
reporting duty under re-proposed Rule 901(a). Thus, the counterparties that would continue to
1261

The Commission is basing this new estimate on CDS data from the DTCC-TIW, but not from
data from data repositories for other security-based swap asset classes, which are not currently
available to the Commission. The Commission preliminarily believes that entities that are likely
to incur obligations to report security-based swaps in other asset classes are already likely to be
reporting CDS transactions to DTCC-TIW. The Commission also preliminarily believes that, to
avoid duplicative compliance costs, such entities are likely to leverage their existing
infrastructure for reporting CDS transactions to carry out reporting obligations for other asset
classes, even though these other asset classes might be booked in different affiliated entities. The
Commission preliminarily estimates that these other security-based swap asset classes consist of
less than one-fifth of the overall security-based swap market. Therefore, the Commission
preliminarily believes that reporting counterparties across all security-based swap asset classes
should not exceed the estimate of 300 derived from the DTCC-TIW CDS data. See note 1301,
infra.

1262

The Commission estimates: ((1,000 reporting parties – 300 reporting sides) * 1,438 hours) =
1,006,600 burden reduction for all reporting counterparties. The Commission estimates: ((1,000
reporting parties – 300 reporting sides) * $201,000) = $140,700,000 burden reduction for all
reporting counterparties.

1263

The Commission estimates: ((1,000 reporting parties – 300 reporting sides) * 731 hours) =
511,700 burden reduction for all reporting counterparties. The Commission estimates: ((1,000
reporting parties – 300 reporting sides) * $201,000) = $140,700,000 burden reduction for all
reporting counterparties.

373

have the reporting duty under re-proposed Rule 901(a), primarily security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants, would likely incur the reporting duty for most of
these transactions. Consequently, re-proposed Rule 901(a) could result in each reporting
counterparty being required to report, on average, a larger percentage of the total security-based
swap transactions than envisioned under the original proposal. In the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that, collectively, the reporting parties would
spend 77,300 hours reporting specific security-based swap transactions to a registered SDR, as
required by proposed Rule 901. 1264 Nonetheless, as explained below, the Commission’s estimate
of the anticipated number of security-based swap transactions to be reported pursuant to
Regulation SBSR is being revised significantly downward.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
15.5 million security-based swap transactions per year would be required to be reported. 1265 In
addition to revising our estimate of the number of reporting sides from 1,000 to 300, as discussed
above, the Commission is now also revising our estimate of the number of reportable securitybased swap transactions covered by re-proposed Regulation SBSR, for the following reasons.
First, the Commission notes that the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release inadvertently
overstated the number of historical security-based swap transactions such that the number of
security-based swap transactions based on data available at the time of the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release should have been stated as approximately 2,200,000. 1266 Second, since
issuing the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission has obtained additional and
more granular data regarding participation in the credit default swap market from DTCC-TIW.
These more recent data further suggest that the Commission initially overestimated both the
number of reporting counterparties and the number of security-based swap transactions that
would be reportable to DTCC-TIW. As a result, the Commission now estimates that 300
reporting sides would be required to report approximately 5 million new security-based swaps
1264

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR 75248-49. In arriving at this figure, the
Commission preliminarily estimated that 1,000 reporting parting would be responsible for
reporting 15,458,824 security-based swap transactions. The Commission further estimated that
each transaction would take 0.005 hours to report for a total burden of 77,300 hours, or 77.3
burden hours per reporting party. The Commission preliminarily believes that the hourly burden
of reporting individual security-based swap transactions would not change.

1265

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75248.

1266

See id. at 75248 nn.182-85 and accompanying text. Specifically, in the SBSR Proposing Release,
the Commission misinterpreted weekly CDS volume data as daily volume data. Based on the
weekly data available at the time, a more accurate estimate for the number of CDS transactions
per year would have been 1,872,000. This number is based on the following: (36,000 (estimated
CDS transactions per week) * 52 (weeks/year)) = 1,872,000 CDS transactions/year. Based on the
Commission’s preliminary assumption in the SBSR Proposing Release that CDS transactions
represent approximately eight- to nine- tenths of all security-based swap transactions, a more
accurate estimate for the number of security-based swap transactions per year would have been
2,202,353. This number was based on the following: (1,872,000 (number of CDS transactions
per year)/0.85) = 2,202,353 security-based swap transactions/year.

374

and life cycle events (collectively, “reportable events”) under re-proposed Regulation SBSR per
year. 1267
The Commission notes that the change in the estimate of the number of reportable events
per year since the initial proposal of Regulation SBSR from more than 2,000,000 to
approximately 5 million may be due to better and more precise data available from the industry
on the scope, size, and composition of the security-based swap market. As a result, and to the
extent that the available data regarding recent security-based swap market activity may be
indicative of future activity, the Commission now preliminarily believes that a more appropriate
estimate of the number of reportable events would be approximately 5 million per year.
The Commission preliminarily believes that, once a respondent’s reporting infrastructure
and compliance systems are in place, the burden of reporting a single reportable event would be
de minimis when compared to the burdens of establishing the reporting infrastructure and
compliance systems. 1268 The Commission now preliminarily estimates that re-proposed
Regulation SBSR would result in total burden hours of 5,080 attributable to the reporting to
security-based swap data repositories all reportable events over the course of a year. 1269 The
Commission preliminarily believes that many reportable events would be reported through
electronic means and that the ratio of electronic reporting to manual reporting is likely to
increase over time. The Commission further preliminarily believes that the bulk of the burden
hours estimated above would be attributable to manually reported transactions. Thus, reporting
counterparties that capture and report transactions electronically would likely incur bear fewer
burden hours than those reporting counterparties that capture and report transactions manually.

1267

The Commission now estimates that single-name CDS transactions for 2012 were approximately
4 million transactions. The data studied by the Commission cover CDS transactions, which the
Commission continues to preliminarily believe account for approximately eight- to nine-tenths of
the security-based swap market. As a result, and to the extent that recent security-based swap
market activity may be indicative of future activity, the Commission preliminarily estimates that
300 reporting sides will have the duty to report 5 million security-based swap transactions (i.e.,
4,000,000/0.82 = 4,878,049 reportable events). See also note 1641, infra.

1268

In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
reporting specific security-based swap transactions to a registered SDR would impose an annual
aggregate cost of approximately $5,400,000. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR
75265. The Commission further estimated that Regulation SBSR would impose an aggregate
total first-year cost of approximately $1,039,000,000 and an ongoing annualized aggregate cost of
approximately $703,000,000. See id. at 75280.

1269

The Commission estimates: ((5 million * 0.005) / (300 reporting sides)) = 83.3 burden hours per
reporting side or 25,000 total burden hours. Since the number of respondents would decline from
1,000 reporting parties to 300 reporting sides, the transaction based reporting burden would be
concentrated among fewer respondents.

375

iii.

Summary of Re-proposed Burdens

Based on the foregoing, the Commission preliminarily estimates that re-proposed
Regulation SBSR would impose an estimated total first-year burden of approximately 1,444
hours 1270 per reporting counterparty for a total first-year burden of 433,200 hours for all reporting
counterparties. 1271 The Commission preliminarily estimates that re-proposed Regulation SBSR
would impose ongoing annualized aggregate burdens of approximately 737 hours 1272 per
reporting counterparty for a total aggregate annualized cost of 221,100 hours for all reporting
counterparties. 1273 The Commission further estimates that re-proposed Regulation SBSR would
impose initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost burdens of $201,000 per reporting
counterparty, for total aggregate initial and ongoing annualized dollar cost burdens of
$60,300,000. 1274
The Commission does not preliminarily believe that the proposed changes to Regulation
SBSR would have any material impact on SDRs not discussed in Regulation SBSR, as originally
proposed. The changes discussed herein do not impact the previously estimated burdens for
SDRs. The Commission preliminarily believes that re-proposed Rule SBSR would not result in
the registration of additional SDRs, and would not require existing SDRs to bear the burden of
connecting to additional reporting counterparties. SDRs would already be required under
proposed Regulation SBSR to have established mechanisms to receive and process securitybased swap transaction reports, and none of the costs identified in the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release relating to SDRs were dependent upon the number of security-based swap
transactions or the number of reporting counterparties.
iv.

Recordkeeping Requirements

Concurrently with proposed Regulation SBSR, the Commission issued the SDR
Proposing Release, which includes (among other things) recordkeeping requirements for
security-based swap transaction data received by a registered SDR pursuant to proposed
1270

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (1,438 (Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release estimated total burden) – 77.3 (Regulation SBSR Proposing Release estimated
transaction reporting burden) + 83.3 (revised estimated transaction reporting burden)) = 1,444
hours. See Section XIV.F.2(d)ii.

1271

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (1,444 * 300 reporting counterparties)
= 433,200 hours.

1272

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (731 (Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release estimated total burden) – 77.3 (Regulation SBSR Proposing Release estimated
transaction reporting burden) + 83.3 (revised estimated transaction reporting burden)) = 737
hours. See Section XIV.F.2(d)ii, infra.

1273

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: (737 * 300 reporting counterparties) =
221,000 hours.

1274

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($201,000 * 300 reporting
counterparties) = $60,300,000.

376

Regulation SBSR. Specifically, proposed Rule 13n-5(b)(4) under the Exchange Act would
require a registered SDR to maintain the transaction data that it collects for not less than five
years after the applicable security-based swap expires, and historical positions and historical
market values for not less than five years. 1275 Accordingly, security-based swap transaction
reports received by a registered SDR pursuant to proposed Rule 901 would be required to be
retained by the registered SDR for not less than five years.
(e) Collection of Information is Mandatory
Each collection of information discussed above would be a mandatory collection of
information.
(f) Confidentiality
Re-proposed Rule 901(a) would not affect the confidentiality of responses to the
collection of information provided under Rule 901 of Regulation SBSR as originally proposed.
As described in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, information collected pursuant to
proposed Rule 901(c) would be widely available to the public to the extent it is incorporated into
security-based swap transaction reports that are publicly disseminated by a registered SDR
pursuant to proposed Rule 902. A registered SDR, pursuant to Sections 13(n)(5) of the
Exchange Act and proposed Rule 13n-9 thereunder, would be under an obligation to maintain the
confidentiality of any information reported pursuant to proposed Rule 901(d) of Regulation
SBSR. To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to this
collection of information, such information would be kept confidential, subject to the provisions
of applicable law.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests public comment on our analysis of burdens associated with reproposed Rule 901(a) and proposed Rule 901 generally. The Commission also seeks comment
on the following:

1275

•

Would re-proposed Rule 901(a) impose burdens on parties additional to those
imposed by Rule 901, as originally proposed? If so, what are these additional
burdens? Please describe fully and quantify to the extent possible.

•

Would re-proposed Rule 901(a) reduce overall burdens by aligning the security-based
swap transaction reporting obligation with those market participants better able to
carry out the reporting function? Why or why not?

•

Are there any methods to enhance Rule 901 while minimizing the overall burdens
associated with that rule?

to the reporting requirements? Is the Commission’s revised estimate of 300 reporting
sides reasonable?
•

Would re-proposed Rule 901(a) have any impact on the burden imposed on SDRs?
Are those costs dependent upon the number of reporting counterparties or the number
of transactions submitted to SDRs?
3. Rules 902, 905, 906, 907, and 909

Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed, contained certain proposed rules, each of
which was considered a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA, but that now
either remains unchanged—or contains only technical, or conforming changes—as a result of reproposed SBSR.
(a) Rule 902
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated our preliminary belief
that certain provisions of proposed Rule 902 contained “collection of information requirements”
within the meaning of the PRA. 1276 As such, the Commission preliminarily estimated certain
burdens resulting from the proposed rule. 1277
As set forth in more detail above, the Commission is now proposing technical or
conforming revisions to proposed Rule 902.
Rule 902(a), as initially proposed, would require a registered SDR to publicly
disseminate a transaction report of any security-based swap immediately upon receipt of
information about the security-based swap, except in the case of a block trade. Re-proposed
Rule 908, however, contemplates situations where a security-based swap would be required to be
reported to a registered SDR but not publicly disseminated. 1278 Therefore, the Commission is reproposing Rule 902(a) to provide that a registered SDR would not have an obligation to publicly
disseminate a transaction report for any such security-based swap.
(b) Rule 905
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated our preliminary belief
that certain provisions of proposed Rule 905 contained “collection of information requirements”
within the meaning of the PRA. 1279 As such, the Commission preliminarily estimated certain
burdens resulting from the proposed rule. 1280

As set forth in more detail in Section VIII above, in re-proposed Regulation SBSR, the
Commission has proposed technical or conforming revisions to proposed Rule 905. Rule
905(b)(2) is being re-proposed to clarify that, if a registered SDR receives corrected information
relating to a previously submitted transaction report, it would be required to publicly disseminate
a corrected transaction report only if the initial security-based swap were subject to public
dissemination. 1281 In addition, re-proposed Rule 905 conforms the rule language to incorporate
the use of the term “side.”
(c) Rule 906
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated our preliminary belief
that certain provisions of proposed Rule 906 contained “collection of information requirements”
within the meaning of the PRA. 1282 As such, the Commission preliminarily estimated certain
burdens on reporting parties and SDRs resulting from the proposed rule. 1283
As set forth in more detail above, the Commission is now proposing technical revisions
to proposed Rule 906. Re-proposed Rule 906 conforms the rule language to incorporate the use
of the term “side.”
(d) Rule 907
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated our preliminary belief
that certain provisions of proposed Rule 907 contained “collection of information requirements”
within the meaning of the PRA. 1284 As such, the Commission preliminarily estimated certain
burdens on reporting parties and SDRs resulting from the proposed rule. 1285
As set forth in more detail above, the Commission is now proposing technical or
conforming revisions to proposed Rule 907. Re-proposed Rule 907(a)(6) would require a
registered SDR to establish and maintain written policies and procedures “[f]or periodically
obtaining from each participant information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s)
and any other participant(s) which the counterparty is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and
participant IDs” (emphasis added). The Commission now is re-proposing Rule 907(a)(6) with
the word “participant” in place of the word “counterparty.” Re-proposed Rule 907 also
conforms the rule language to incorporate the use of the term “side.”

1281

Re-proposed Rule 905(b)(2) of Regulation SBSR also substitutes the word “counterparties”—
which is a formally defined term in the regulation—for the word “parties,” which was used in the
initial proposal but was not a formally defined term.

(e) Rule 909
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated our preliminary belief
that certain provisions of proposed Rule 909 contained “collection of information requirements”
within the meaning of the PRA. 1286 As such, the Commission preliminarily estimated certain
burdens SDRs resulting from the proposed rule. 1287
i.

Impact of Re-proposed Rules 902, 905, 906, 907, and 909 on the
Commission’s PRA Analysis

Since re-proposed Rules 902, 905, 906, 907, and 909 of Regulations SBSR either remain
unchanged from the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release or contain only technical or
conforming changes, the Commission preliminarily believes that our original PRA analysis, as
set forth in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, continues to apply. The Commission
preliminarily believes that our original analysis does not require revision, in part, because the
burdens described in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release are not dependent upon the
number of respondents or the number of security-based swap transactions that would be reported
to a registered SDR. In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that the burdens
described in relation to Rule 906 would not change because the number of reports required under
and the universe of respondents subject to Rule 906 would not change. Furthermore, the
Commission preliminarily believes that these re-proposed rules would not result in a change in
the Commission’s original estimate of SDRs.
The Commission requests public comment on our analysis of burdens associated with
these re-proposed rules, and whether re-proposed Rule 902, 905, 906, 907, or 909 would impose
any collection of information requirements that the Commission has not considered. If so, please
describe them.
4. Rules 900, 903, 908, 910, and 911
Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed, contained certain proposed rules that were not
considered a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA.
(a) Modification of the Definition of “U.S. Person”
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated our belief that
proposed Rule 900, since it contains only definitions of relevant terms, would not be a
“collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA. 1288 Rule 900 of re-proposed
Regulation SBSR contains a revised definition of “U.S. person” that cross-references proposed
Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act. Re-proposed Rule 900 also contains definitions for
new terms such as “side,” “reporting side,” and “direct electronic access.” The Commission
1286

See id. at 75260.

1287

See id. at 75260-61.

1288

See id. at 75246.

380

continues to believe that, because Rule 900 contains only definitions of relevant terms, it would
not be a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA.
(b) Rule 903
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission stated our belief that
proposed Rule 903 would not be a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA
because the rule would merely permit reporting parties and SDRs to use codes in place of certain
data elements, subject to certain conditions. 1289 Re-proposed Rule 903 conforms the rule
language to incorporate the use of the term “side.” Because these are only technical changes to
the proposed rule, the Commission continues to believe that re-proposed Rule 903 would not be
a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA.
(c) Re-proposed Rules 908(a) and 908(b)
Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, provided that a security-based swap would be subject
to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under Regulation SBSR if the security-based
swap: (1) has at least one counterparty that is a U.S. person; (2) is executed in the United States
or through any means of interstate commerce; or (3) is cleared through a registered clearing
agency having its principal place of business in the United States. Thus, original Rule 908(a)
would not impose reporting requirements in connection with a security-based swap solely
because one of the counterparties were guaranteed by a U.S. person or were a non-U.S. person
security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant.
The Commission stated our preliminary belief that proposed Rule 908 would not be a
“collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA, as the rule merely described the
jurisdictional reach of proposed Regulation SBSR.
As set forth in more detail above, the Commission now believes that, where a securitybased swap is executed outside the United States by a non-U.S. person direct counterparty but
performance of any duties under that security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person, the
security-based swap should be subject to Title VII regulatory reporting requirements. 1290 In
addition, a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant that is a non-U.S.
person would, under Rule 908(a) of re-proposed Regulation SBSR, be required to report a
security-based swap executed outside the United States with a non-U.S. person counterparty
(assuming no guarantee extended by a U.S. person).
Re-proposed Rule 908(a) is now divided into subparagraphs (1) and (2), which address
regulatory reporting and public dissemination, respectively. The Commission also is reproposing Rule 908(a) to require reporting and public dissemination in certain cases not required
1289

See id. at 75252-53.

1290

However, as discussed above, the Commission preliminarily believes that certain of these crossborder security-based swaps need not be subject to Title VII’s public dissemination requirements.
See Section VIII.C.1, supra.

381

by the original proposal, and to make certain other changes described above (such as eliminating
the “interstate commerce clause”). Because re-proposed Rule 908(a) continues merely to
describe the situations to which proposed Regulation SBSR would apply, the Commission
continues to believe that re-proposed Rule 908(a) would not be a “collection of information”
within the meaning of the PRA. However, to the extent that additional types of security-based
swaps would be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under re-proposed
Regulation than under the initial proposal, the additional burdens on respondents are considered
under re-proposed Rule 901 above.
Rule 908(b), as initially proposed, described when duties would be imposed on foreign
counterparties of security-based swaps when some connections to the United States might be
present. Rule 908(b), as initially proposed, provided that no duties would be imposed on a
counterparty unless one of the following conditions were true: (1) the counterparty is a U.S.
person; (2) the security-based swap is executed in the United States or through any means of
interstate commerce; or (3) the security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having
its principal place of business in the United States.
The Commission stated our preliminary belief that proposed Rule 908 would not be a
“collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA, as the rule merely described the
jurisdictional reach of proposed Regulation SBSR.
As set forth in more detail above, the Commission is proposing several technical
revisions to proposed Rule 908(b). Specifically, Rule 908(b) is being revised to account for the
possibility that a non-U.S. person registered with the Commission as a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant could incur a duty to report. Moreover, the
“interstate commerce clause” is being replaced with the new concept of a “transaction conducted
within the United States.”
Since re-proposed Rule 908(b) continues merely to describe the jurisdictional reach of
Regulation SBSR, the Commission continues to believe that re-proposed Rule 908(b) would not
be a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA. However, the Commission
notes that re-proposed Rule 908(b) could result in a non-U.S. person security-based swap dealer
or major security-based swap participant incurring a duty to report. To the extent that this could
result in a change in the number of reporting counterparties, such burdens are considered in
connection with re-proposed Rule 901 above.
The Commission requests public comment on our analysis of burdens associated with reproposed Rules 908(a) and 908(b) generally. In particular:
•

Would re-proposed Rules 908(a) and 908(b) impose any collection of information
requirements that the Commission has not considered? If so, please describe.

Re-proposed Rule 908 contains a new subparagraph (c), dealing with substituted
compliance, a subject that was not addressed in the original proposal. The PRA analysis for re-

382

proposed Rule 908(c) is provided elsewhere, together with the PRA analysis of the substituted
compliance provisions of the other Title VII proposed rules described in this release. 1291
(d) Rule 910
As originally proposed, the Commission stated our belief that proposed Rule 910 would
not be a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA, as it merely describes when
a registered SDR and its participants would be required to comply with the various parts of
proposed Regulation SBSR, and would not create any additional collection of information
requirements.
As set forth in more detail above, the Commission is now proposing technical, or
conforming revisions to proposed Rule 910. Rule 910(b)(4), as originally proposed, would
provide that, in Phase 4 of the Regulation SBSR compliance schedule, “[a]ll security-based
swaps reported to the registered security-based swap data repository shall be subject to real-time
public dissemination as specified in § 242.902.” As noted above, under re-proposed Rule 908,
certain security-based swaps would be subject to regulatory reporting but not public
dissemination requirements. Therefore, the Commission is re-proposing Rule 910(b)(4) to
provide that, “All security-based swaps received by the registered security-based swap data
repository shall be treated in a manner consistent with §§ 242.902, 242.905, and 242.908.” Reproposed Rule 910 also conforms the rule language to incorporate the use of the term “side.”
The Commission continues to believe that re-proposed Rule 910 would not be a
“collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA.
(e) Rule 911
Rule 911, as originally proposed, would restrict the ability of a reporting party to report a
security-based swap to one registered SDR rather than another, but would not otherwise create
any duties or impose any collection of information requirements beyond those already required
by proposed Rule 901. Therefore, the Commission stated our belief that proposed Rule 911
would not be a “collection of information” within the meaning of the PRA. 1292 As set forth in
more detail above, the Commission is now proposing technical revisions to proposed Rule 911.
Re-proposed Rule 911 conforms the rule language to incorporate the use of the term “side.” The
Commission continues to believe that re-proposed Rule 911 would not be a “collection of
information” within the meaning of the PRA.
G. Request for Comments by the Commission and Director of OMB
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3505(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits comment to:
1. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the proper
performance of our functions, including whether the information shall have practical utility;
1291

See Section XIV.E.4, supra.

1292

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75261.

383

2. Evaluate the accuracy of our estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of
information;
3. Determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected; and
4. Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of collection of information
on those who are to respond, including through the use of automated collection techniques or
other forms of information technology.
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements should direct
them to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503,
and should also send a copy of their comments to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Securities
and Exchange Commission, 100 F Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549–1090, with reference to
File No. S7-02-13. Requests for materials submitted to OMB by the Commission with regard to
this collection of information should be in writing, with reference to File No. S7-02-13, and be
submitted to the Securities and Exchange Commission, Office of FOIA/PA Operations, 100 F
Street, NE., Washington, DC 20549–2736. As OMB is required to make a decision concerning
the collections of information between 30 and 60 days after publication, a comment to OMB is
best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.

Economic Analysis
Introduction

The Commission is sensitive to the economic consequences and effects, including costs
and benefits, of our rules. In proposing the rules and interpretations in this release, the
Commission has been mindful of the economic consequences of the decisions it makes regarding
the scope of application of the Title VII requirements to cross-border activities pursuant to the
proposed rules. The Commission has taken into account the costs and benefits associated with
applying the Title VII regulatory requirements to cross-border transactions and market
participants who would be required to register pursuant to these proposed rules and
interpretations, as well as the costs associated with determining whether Title VII applies to a
specific person or transaction, which we refer to as direct assessment costs these rules and
interpretations would impose on market participants, if adopted as proposed. Some of these
economic consequences and effects stem from statutory mandates, while others are affected by
the discretion we exercise in implementing the mandates. Further, Section 3(f) of the Exchange
Act requires the Commission, whenever we engage in rulemaking pursuant to the Exchange Act
and are required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will
promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 1293 In addition, Section 23(a)(2) of the
Exchange Act requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider
the impact such rules would have on competition. Section 23(a)(2) also prohibits the
Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 1294 The Commission requests
comment on all aspects of the economic analysis of the proposed rules, including their costs and
benefits, as well as any effect these rules may have on competition, efficiency, and capital
formation.
As stated above, the Commission is proposing rules and interpretations regarding the
application of Title VII to cross-border activities holistically in a single proposing release to
provide market participants, foreign regulators, and other interested parties with an opportunity
to consider, as an integrated whole, the Commission’s proposed approach to the application of
various Title VII requirements to cross-border security-based swap transactions and to persons
whose cross-border security-based swap activity is regulated under Title VII. 1295
In analyzing the economic consequences and effects of the rules and interpretations
proposed in this release, the Commission has been guided by the objectives of the Dodd-Frank
Act to mitigate risks to the U.S. financial system, promote counterparty protection, increase swap
market transparency, and facilitate financial stability. We have also taken into account the
importance of maintaining a well-functioning security-based swap market. In evaluating these

1294

15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

1295

See Section I, supra.

385

rules the Commission has considered the importance of avoiding unnecessary market disruption,
and preserving market participants’ access to liquidity irrespective of geography. This analysis
also reflects the importance of regulatory harmonization and maintaining consistent international
standards. In this regard, we recognize that regulators in other jurisdictions are currently
engaged in implementing their own regulatory reforms of the OTC derivatives markets and that
our proposed application of Title VII to cross-border activities may affect the policy decisions of
these other regulators as they seek to address potential conflicts or duplication in the regulatory
requirements that apply to market participants under their authority.
In addition, the Commission is aware of the development of OTC derivatives regulatory
reform in other jurisdictions. In particular, the EU and certain other G20 members have taken
various steps to develop and implement new regulations with respect to OTC derivatives. 1296
Moreover, market participants, foreign regulators, and other interested parties have provided
views on the application of Title VII requirements to cross-border activities through both written
comment letters to the Commission and/or the CFTC and meetings with Commissioners and
Commission staff. 1297 These developments, comments, and discussions have been informative in
the Commission’s consideration of our proposed approach to the application of Title VII in the
cross-border context and the economic consequences of the proposed rules and interpretations.
B.

Economic Baseline
1. Overview

To assess the economic impact of the proposed rules described in this release, the
Commission is using as our baseline the security-based swap market as it exists at the time of
this proposal, including applicable rules adopted by the Commission but excluding the rules and
interpretations proposed here. The analysis incorporates the statutory and regulatory provisions
that currently govern the security-based swap market pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act. Many of
the resulting costs and benefits are difficult to quantify with any degree of certainty, especially as
the practices of market participants are expected to evolve and adapt to changes in technology
and market developments.
In assessing the economic impact of the rules, we refer to the broader costs and benefits
associated with the application of the proposed rules and interpretations as “programmatic” costs
and benefits. These include the costs and benefits of applying the substantive Title VII
requirements to transactions by market participants active in the cross-border context, as well as
to the functions performed by infrastructure participants (clearing agencies, SDRs, and SB SEFs)
in the global security-based swap market. In several places we also consider how the
programmatic costs and benefits might change when comparing the proposed approach to the
other alternatives suggested by industry comment letters and the other regulators. Our analysis
also considers “assessment costs.”
1296

See Section I and notes 35–35, supra.

1297

See Section I and notes 24–25, supra.

386

Our analysis also recognizes that certain market participants may be subject to Title VII
requirements under the proposed rules and interpretations while potentially also being subject to
another set of foreign regulatory requirements. Concurrent, and potentially duplicative or
conflicting, regulatory requirements could be imposed on persons because of their resident or
domicile status or because of the place their security-based swap transactions are conducted. In
certain circumstances, the Commission is proposing to consider permitting substituted
compliance subject to certain conditions. In determining whether to propose rules that would
permit market participants to seek substituted compliance determinations for particular
requirements in certain circumstances, the Commission has considered the programmatic
benefits intended by the specific Title VII requirements with respect to which substituted
compliance may be permitted, the programmatic costs associated with such Title VII
requirements when they become fully effective, and the relevant assessment costs. 1298
The proposed rules and interpretations reflect the Commission’s preliminary
determination regarding which participants and transactions in the security-based swap market
warrant regulation under Title VII, and in making this determination, we have focused on
whether a market participant is incorporated or resident, or has its principal place of business,
within the United States and whether a transaction occurs within the United States. The
economic impact of these proposed rules and interpretations will occur predominantly through
the application in a cross-border context of the substantive requirements outlined in other
releases, without, as a general matter, altering the nature of those substantive requirements. 1299
We have already analyzed many of the costs and benefits of the proposed substantive
requirements in separate proposing and adopting releases. As a result, the following analysis
focuses on the economic impacts and trade-offs of application of these substantive requirements
in a cross-border context, that is, the economic implications of the decisions to include certain
persons that reside or are organized (or have their principal place of business), or transactions
that occur, within the United States within the scope of Title VII and the economic effects arising
from that inclusion.

1298

The Commission is proposing to permit market participants to seek a substituted compliance
determination in connection with certain requirements—it has not yet made any such specific
determinations. The Commission does not believe it is possible at this point to estimate the
number of such determinations that it is likely to make for any given set of requirements, as such
estimate would depend on information that is generally not yet available. However, the
maximum programmatic benefits and costs associated with substituted compliance could occur in
circumstances where the Commission grants every substituted compliance request. This does not
in any way indicate that the Commission will make any number of substituted compliance
determinations. Accordingly, the following analysis does not assume that such substituted
compliance will be allowed. Where appropriate, however, we do discuss the economic
implications if such substituted compliance were ultimately to be allowed.

1299

We recognize that we are re-proposing Regulation SBSR in this release, which would have an
impact on the security-based swap reporting obligations beyond the cross-border context, and we
discuss these effects in our economic analysis of the re-proposal below.

387

To the extent that future adopting releases implementing the substantive requirements
under Title VII reflect substantive changes to the proposals, those releases will incorporate the
relevant economic analysis. We also expect that our respective adopting releases for each of
these substantive areas will discuss the economic consequences of the final substantive rules
together with our final rules on the application of those rules in the cross-border context.
2. Current Security-Based Swap Market
Our analysis of the state of the current security-based swap market is based on data
obtained from DTCC-TIW, especially data regarding the activity of market participants in the
single-name credit default swap (or CDS) market during the years of 2008 to 2011. Because of
the lack of market data in the context of total return swaps on equity and debt, we do not have
the same amount of information regarding those products (or other products that are securitybased swaps) as we have in connection with the present market for single-name CDS. With the
exception of the analysis regarding the level of security-based swap clearing, we did not consider
data regarding index credit default swaps for purposes of the analysis below. The data for index
CDS encompasses both broad-based security indices and narrow-based security indices, and
“security-based swap” in relevant part encompasses swaps based on single securities or on
narrow-based security indices. 1300 We previously noted that the definition of security-based
swaps is not limited to single-name CDS but we believed that the single-name CDS data are
sufficiently representative of the market to help inform the analysis of the state of the current
security-based swap market. 1301
We believe that the data underlying our analysis here provide reasonably comprehensive
information regarding the single-name CDS transactions and composition of the single-name
CDS market participants. In our analysis of market participants and their domiciles in
subsections (a) and (c) below, we base our analysis on firms and accounts that have engaged in
one or more trades with a U.S.-person counterparty or involving a U.S. reference entity
according to data obtained from DTCC-TIW. Our analysis of trading activity in the security1300

See Section 3(a)(68)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S. C. 78c(a)(68)(A).

1301

According to data published by BIS, the global notional amount outstanding in equity forwards
and swaps as of June 2012 was $1.88 trillion. The notional amount outstanding in single-name
CDS was approximately $15.57 trillion, in multi-name index CDS was approximately $9.73
trillion, and in multi-name, non-index CDS was approximately $1.63 trillion. See Semi-annual
OTC derivatives statistics at end-June 2012 (Nov. 2012), Table 19, available at:
http://www.bis.org/statistics/otcder/dt1920a.pdf. For the purposes of this analysis, we assume
that multi-name index CDS are not narrow-based index CDS and therefore, do not fall within the
security-based swap definition. See Section 3(a)(68)(A) of the Exchange Act; see also the
Product Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR 48208. We also assume that all instruments
reported as equity forwards and swaps are security-based swaps, potentially resulting in
underestimation of the proportion of the security-based swap market represented by single-name
CDS. Therefore, single-name CDS appear to constitute roughly 82% of the security-based swap
market. Although the BIS data reflects the global OTC derivatives market, and not just the U.S.
market, we have no reason to believe that these ratios differ significantly in the U.S. market.

388

based swap market in subsections (b) and (d) focuses on transactions involving a single-name
CDS referencing a U.S. entity (“U.S. single-name CDS”). We note that the data available to us
from DTCC-TIW do not encompass those CDS transactions that both: (i) do not involve U.S.
counterparties; and (ii) are based on non-U.S. reference entities. Notwithstanding this limitation,
we preliminarily believe that the DTCC-TIW data provides sufficient information to identify the
types of market participants active in the security-based swap market and the general pattern of
deal flow within that market.
(a) Security-Based Swap Market Participants
Although most security-based swap activity is concentrated among a relatively small
number of dealer entities, 1302 there are thousands of security-based swap market participants,
including, but not limited to, investment companies, pension funds, private (hedge) funds,
sovereign entities, and industrial companies. 1303 In the analysis below, we observe that most end
users of security-based swaps do not engage directly in the trading of swaps, but use dealers,
banks, or investment advisers as agents to establish their positions. Based on an analysis of the
counterparties to trades reported to the DTCC-TIW, there were 1,489 entities 1304 engaged in
trading of single-name CDS shortly after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act. Table 1, below,
highlights that nearly three-quarters of these entities (DTCC-defined “firms” shown in DTCCTIW, which we refer to here as “transacting agents”) were identified as investment advisers, of
which 40% (30% of all transacting agents) were registered investment advisers under the
Investment Advisers Act. 1305 Although investment advisers comprise the vast majority of
transacting agents, the transactions they executed account for only 10.2% of all single-name
CDS trading activity reported to the DTCC-TIW, measured by number of transaction-sides (each

1304

The 1,489 entities included all DTCC-defined “firms” shown in DTCC-TIW as transaction
counterparties that report at least one transaction to DTCC-TIW as of October, 2010. The staff in
the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation classified these firms that are shown as
transaction counterparties by machine matching names to known third-party databases and by
manual classification. Manual classification included searching the EDGAR and Bloomberg
databases, the SEC’s Investment Adviser Public Disclosure database, and the firm’s public
website or the public website of the account represented by the firm. The staff also referred to
ISDA protocol adherence letters available on the ISDA website. All but 52 of the 1,489 DTCCdefined “firms” were identified and classified.

The staff’s further analysis of the “accounts” in DTCC-TIW shows that transaction agents
classified in Table 1 represent over 8,500 accounts and funds who are the principal risk holders
of the transactions. Table 2, below, classifies these “accounts” or principal risk holders by their
counterparty type and whether they are represented by a registered or unregistered investment
adviser. 1307 For instance, 239 banks in Table 1 allocated transactions to 353 accounts, of which
29 were represented by investment advisers and 324 were represented directly by banks, while
16 ISDA-recognized dealers in Table 1 allocated transactions to 69 accounts.
Among the accounts, there are over 1,400 Dodd-Frank Act-defined special entities and 482
investment companies registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940. 1308 Private funds
comprise the largest type of account holders that we were able to classify, and although not
verified through a recognized database, most of the funds we were not able to classify appear to
be private funds. The data analyzed here largely predate the effectiveness of our rules

1306

For the purpose of this analysis, the ISDA-recognized dealers are those defined as G14 by ISDA.
See http://www.isda.org/c_and_a/pdf/ISDA-Operations-Survey-2010.pdf. G14 refers to JP
Morgan Chase NA (and Bear Stearns), Morgan Stanley, Bank of America NA (and Merrill
Lynch), Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank AG, Barclays Capital, Citigroup, UBS, Credit Suisse
AG, RBS Group, BNP Paribus, HSBC Bank, Lehman Brothers, and Société Générale.

Unregistered investment advisers include all investment advisers not registered under the
Investment Advisers Act, and may include investment advisers registered with a state or a foreign
authority.

1308

There remain 3,746 DTCC “accounts” unclassified by type. Although unclassified, each was
manually reviewed to verify that it was not likely to be a special entity within the meaning of the
Dodd-Frank Act and instead was likely to be an entity such as a corporation, an insurance
company, or a bank.

(b) Levels of Security-Based Swap Trading Activity
CDS contracts make up the vast majority of security-based swap products and most are
written on corporate issuers, corporate securities, sovereign countries, or sovereign debt
(reference entities and reference securities). 1311 Figure 1 below describes the percentage of
global, notional transaction volume 1312 in U.S. single-name CDS reported to the DTCC-TIW
1309

See Rules Implementing Amendments to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Investment
Advisers Act Release No. 3221 (June 22, 2011), 76 FR 42950 (July 19, 2011).

1310

This column reflects the number of participants who are also trading on their own accounts.

Flemming, John Jackson, Ada Li, and Asani Sarkar, “An Analysis of CDS Transactions:
Implications for Public Reporting,” Federal Reserve Bank of New York Staff Report, No. 517
(Sep. 2011) (decomposing single-name CDS contracts into corporate, sovereign, and other).

1312

This volume includes all price-forming CDS transactions (trades, assignments, and terminations)
on U.S.-based reference entities reported to the DTCC-TIW during calendar years 2008 through
2011, including those executed between two foreign counterparties. “Price-forming transactions”
include all new transactions, assignments, modifications to increase the notional amounts of
previously executed transactions, and terminations of previously executed transactions.

391

between January 2008 and December 2011, separated by whether transactions are between two
ISDA-recognized dealers (interdealer transactions) or whether a transaction has at least one nondealer counterparty.
The level of trading activity with respect to U.S. single-name CDS in terms of notional
volume has declined from more than $5 trillion in 2008 to less than $2.5 trillion in 2011. The
start of this decline predates the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the rules proposed
thereunder. For the purpose of establishing an economic baseline, this seems to indicate that
CDS market demand shrank prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, and therefore the
causes of trading volume declines may be independent of those related to the development of
security-based swap market regulation. If the security-based swap market experiences further
declines in trading activity, it would be difficult to isolate the effects of the newly-developed
security-based swap market regulation and to identify whether the changes in trading activity are
due to natural market forces or the anticipation of (or reaction to) proposed (or adopted) Title VII
requirements.
Although notional volume had declined over the past four years, the percentage of
interdealer transactions has remained fairly constant, at a little more than 80% of the total
notional volume. This is consistent with the 83.7% of transactions involving ISDA-recognized
dealers on one side of the transactions executed from November 2006 through October 2010 as
shown in Table 1.

Transactions terminated, transactions entered into in connection with a compression exercise, and
expiration of contracts at maturity are not considered price-forming and are therefore excluded, as
are replacement trades and all bookkeeping-related trades.

(c) Market Participant Domiciles
In analyzing data to identify an economic baseline of trading activity for purposes of this
proposal, we found that there has been a distinct shift in country of domicile since the enactment
of the Dodd-Frank Act. Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act, the majority of the funds
and accounts 1313 that were allocated CDS transactions reported to the DTCC-TIW were
domiciled within the United States, according to self-reported registered office location recorded
by the DTCC-TIW. 1314 Since the enactment of Dodd-Frank Act, there has been a significant
shift in reported domiciles, with far fewer funds and accounts reporting a U.S. domicile. Figure
2, left, shows that more than two-thirds of funds and accounts in existence as of October of 2010
1313

The DTCC accounts are not the same as entities. One entity may have multiple accounts and,
depending on where accounts are located, may report multiple domicile locations. For example, a
bank may have one DTCC account for its U.S. headquarters and one DTCC account for one of its
foreign branches. The self-reported registered office location for the U.S. headquarters account is
different from that for the foreign branch account.

1314

Following the Warehouse Trust Guidance on CDS data access (see text accompanying notes 83–
85, supra), the DTCC-TIW surveyed market participants, asking for the physical address
associated with each of their accounts (i.e., where the account is incorporated as a legal entity).
This is designated the registered office location. For purposes of this discussion, we have
assumed that the registered office location reflects the place of domicile for the fund or account.

393

reported a U.S. domicile. 1315 Figure 2, right, reports the domicile of the more than 2,600 new
funds and accounts that were allocated trades reported to the DTCC-TIW for the first time since
October 2010. For these funds and accounts, only 43% report a registered office location in the
United States, a decline of 25 percentage points. While the fraction of foreign domiciled funds
increases by nine percentage points, most of the shift in domicile is a result of funds and
accounts reporting a foreign registered office location while being managed by an adviser in the
United States, or a result of accounts of foreign branches of U.S. banks or subsidiaries of U.S.
entities, an increase from 3% prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act to 19% after the
enactment of the Dodd- Frank Act. 1316
While it is likely that some of the shift in domicile is in reaction to development of the
new Title VII regulatory regime, with many funds shifting their registered office locations
offshore in anticipation of potential future compliance costs and burdens, some of the activity
could be attributed to more precise reporting of domicile by funds and accounts relative to
information that was on record for older funds and accounts. In particular, prior to the enactment
of the Dodd-Frank Act, funds and accounts did not formally report their domicile because there
was no systematic requirement to do so. Since Dodd-Frank Act enactment, the DTCC-TIW has
collected the account or fund registered office location, which is self-reported and voluntary. 1317
Among funds and accounts that signed up for DTCC-TIW services for the first time after
October 2010, most have self-reported domiciles that are outside the United States (57% of firsttime DTCC-TIW users), but a sizeable proportion of these are managed from within the United
States (19% of all first-time DTCC-TIW users).

1315

When the fund does not report a registered office location, we assume that the settlement country
reported by the investment adviser or parent entity to the fund or account is the place of domicile.

1316

In these instances, the fund or account lists a non-U.S. registered office location while the
investment adviser, U.S. bank, or U.S. parent lists the United States as its settlement country.

(d) Level of Current Cross-Border Activity in Single-Name CDS
About half of the trading activity in U.S. single-name CDS reflected in the set of data we
analyzed was between counterparties domiciled in the United States and counterparties
domiciled abroad. When counterparty domicile is based on the registered office location 1318 of
the DTCC-TIW accounts, only 7% of the global transaction volume by notional volume in 2011
was between two U.S.-domiciled counterparties, compared to 49% entered into between one
U.S.-domiciled counterparty and a foreign-domiciled counterparty and 44% entered into between
two foreign-domiciled counterparties (see figure 3). When the domicile locations of DTCC-TIW
accounts are defined according to the domicile of their ultimate parent, headquarters or home
office (e.g., classifying a foreign bank branch or foreign subsidiary of a U.S. entity as domiciled
in the United States), the fraction of transactions entered into between two U.S.-domiciled
counterparties increases to 25%, and to 57% for transactions entered into between a U.S.domiciled counterparty and a foreign-domiciled counterparty.

which is defined as the “place of organization of the legal entity.” DTCC, “Multifund User

By either definition of domicile, the data indicate that a large fraction of U.S. single-name
CDS transaction volume is entered into between counterparties domiciled in two different
jurisdictions or between counterparties domiciled outside the United States. For the purpose of
establishing an economic baseline, this observation indicates that a large fraction of securitybased swap activity would be affected by the scope of any cross-border approach we could
propose to take in applying the Title VII requirements. The large fraction of U.S. single-name
CDS transactions between U.S.-domiciled and foreign-domiciled counterparties also highlights
the extent to which security-based swap activity transfers risk across geographical boundaries.
Moreover, the legal domicile of a counterparty may not represent the only location of risk.
(e) Levels of Security-Based Swap Clearing
Although no mandatory clearing regime yet exists, a substantial proportion of single
name CDS and index CDS are cleared on a voluntary basis. Voluntary clearing of security-based
swaps in the United States is currently limited to CDS products, including single-name CDS and
index CDS. At present, there is no central clearing in the United States for security-based swaps
that are not CDS products.
The analysis below is based on information reported by ICE Clear Credit on its public
website and is based on price-forming transactions, 1319 which includes the clearing of
1319

See note 1312, supra. Transactions reported to the DTCC-TIW used for this analysis reflect all
global activity, including transactions between two foreign counterparties. See Clearing
Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41636-37.

396

transactions on the same day as the transaction was executed as well as the clearing of
transactions submitted for clearing on a retroactive basis. The data presented here do not include
transactions that result from the compression 1320 of transactions previously submitted for
clearing.
Figure 4 shows that index CDS in U.S. names account for the bulk of current voluntary
clearing activity. The proportion of transactions in names accepted for clearing that are
ultimately cleared also appears to be higher in index CDS in U.S. names than in single-name
CDS referencing U.S. corporate issuers or securities. In calendar years 2010 and 2011, Figure 4
indicates that 90% of the total notional volume of transactions is in index names that are
accepted for clearing as of the end of each calendar year and that cleared index transactions
correspond to more than 50% of the total notional volume during the same period. By contrast,
the figure suggests that the proportion of transactions in single-name corporate CDS referencing
names that were accepted for clearing was only 33% of the total single-name CDS during 2011,
with cleared transactions during the same year totaling only 25% of all the single-name CDS
executed during the same period.

In compression, counterparties agree to terminate or change the notional amount of some or all of
their outstanding contracts and replace any terminated contracts with new contracts.
Compression reduces counterparties’ gross notional amount, while leaving their net notional
amount unchanged. Transactions entered into in connection with a compression exercise are not
considered price-forming and are therefore excluded from the analysis here.

397

While a large fraction of CDS trading activity continues to settle bilaterally, particularly
in light of limited eligibility to clear among market participants, clearing activity has steadily
increased alongside the Title VII rulemaking process, and in advance of mandatory clearing
requirements. 1321 Figure 5 shows that member positions at ICE Clear Credit in the United States
are roughly half held by foreign-domiciled dealing members. 1322 Hence, there is considerable
credit exposure between ICE Clear Credit and these foreign-domiciled clearing members, in both
directions.

Analysis of Potential Effects on Efficiency, Competition, and Capital Formation
1. Introduction

In developing our approach to the application of Title VII to cross-border activities, we
have focused on meeting the goals of Title VII, including the promotion of the financial stability
of the United States by improving accountability and transparency in the U.S. financial system,
the reduction of systemic risk, and the protection of counterparties to security-based swaps. 1323
We also have sought to take into account a range of principles relevant to regulation of this

market, as described above. 1324 As reflected in our discussion of the various policy choices we
are proposing above 1325 and of the potential costs and benefits associated with our proposed
approach in the economic analyses below, 1326 we also have considered effects on competition,
efficiency, and capital formation. 1327
In this section, we focus particularly on these effects. Given the complexity and interrelatedness of the potential effects of the proposed rules—both on a rule-by-rule basis and taken
together as a whole—on the market for security-based swaps, we provide a framework for a
general analysis of the effects of the proposed rules on competition, efficiency, and capital
formation. We then use this framework to engage in an analysis of the possible effects of our
proposed approach.
In developing the general analytical framework for considering the effects of our
proposed cross-border approach on competition, efficiency, and capital formation, we have noted
certain distinct analytical issues. First, various proposed rules may give rise to similar or
overlapping effects. Second, each proposed rule or interpretation is a component of the Title VII
regulatory framework and operates in tandem with the other Title VII components to form a
comprehensive regulatory regime. To the extent that the proposed rules interact with each other,
it is appropriate to broaden the analysis beyond a single rule. For example, although each of the
rules and interpretations regarding registration of security-based swap dealers and the application
of the public dissemination, regulatory reporting, mandatory clearing, and mandatory trade
execution requirements in the cross-border context serve distinct regulatory purposes, 1328
together they may have combined effects on dealer participation in the U.S. security-based swap
market and on the ability of certain market participants to access other parts of the global
security-based swap market.
1324

See Section II.C, supra.

1325

See Sections III - XI, supra.

1326

See Sections XV.D-I, infra.

1327

As noted above, Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires that whenever pursuant to the
Exchange Act the Commission is engaged in rulemaking and is required to consider or determine
whether an action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, the Commission shall
consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 15 U.S.C. 78c(f). In addition, Section 23(a)(2) of the
Exchange Act requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange Act, to consider
the impact such rules would have on competition and prohibits the Commission from adopting
any rule that would impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance
of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2)

1328

For example, registration of security-based swap dealers is intended, among other things, to
increase the safety and soundness of security-based swap dealers and improve the stability of the
U.S. financial system, while application of the public dissemination and mandatory trade
execution requirements in the cross-border context are intended, among other things, to increase
the transparency of the U.S. security-based swap market.

399

The analytical framework we establish here for considering the effects of our proposed
approach to analyzing effects related to competition, efficiency, and capital formation is
premised upon our understanding of the existing state of the security-based swap market. Two
important features of the security-based swap market inform our analysis.
First, the security-based swap market is global in nature, and dealers and other market
participants are highly interconnected within this global market. While most end users have only
a few counterparties, dealers can have hundreds of counterparties, consisting of both end users
and other dealers. 1329 This interconnectedness provides a myriad of paths for liquidity and risk
to move throughout the financial system. As a result, it can be difficult to attribute liquidity and
risk to a particular entity. The interconnected nature of the global security-based swap market
contributes to an increased potential for sequential counterparty failures, liquidity shocks, and
market dislocation during times of financial market stress. 1330
In other words, the failure of one firm can have consequences beyond the firm itself, and
the loss of trading confidence and willingness to trade in one market can have consequences
beyond the firm’s home jurisdiction or market. If firms consider the implications of securitybased swap activity only on their own operations, without considering aggregate financial sector
risk, including lack of liquidity and market disruption or the possibility of spillover effects, the
financial system may end up bearing more risk than the aggregate capital of the intermediaries in
the system can support and may cease to function normally. 1331
Second, the security-based swap market developed as an over-the-counter market,
without transparent pricing or volume information. 1332 In markets without transparent pricing,
access to information confers a competitive advantage. Within the security-based swap market,
large dealers and other large market participants with a large share of order flow have an
informational advantage over smaller dealers and end users who observe a smaller subset of the
1329

See Section XV.B.2(a), supra (discussing current security-based swap market participants). In
addition, based on an analysis of 2011 transaction data by staff in the Division of Risk, Strategy,
and Financial Innovation, the entities recognized by ISDA as dealers had on average 292
counterparties, with a minimum of 17 and a maximum of 695. All other entities (i.e., those more
likely to be end users), averaged 4 counterparties, with a minimum of 1 and a maximum of 52.

See Viral V. Acharya, Lasse H. Pedersen, Thomas Philippon, and Matthew Richardson,
“Measuring Systemic Risk” (May 2010), available at: http://vlab.stern.nyu.edu/public/static/SRv3.pdf. The authors use a theoretical model of the banking sector to show that, unless the
external costs of their trades are considered, financial institutions will have an incentive to take
risks that are borne by the aggregate financial sector). Under this theory, in the context of Title
VII, the relevant external cost is systemic risk (i.e., the potential for risk spillovers and sequential
counterparty failure), leading to an aggregate systemic capital shortfall and breakdown of
financial intermediation in the financial sector.

market. Greater private order flow enables better assessment of current market values that
dealers may use to extract rents from counterparties who are less informed. 1333 End users are
aware of this information asymmetry, and certain end users—particularly larger entities who
transact with many dealers—may be able to obtain access to competitive pricing. Typically,
however, the value of private information will be captured by those who have the information—
in this case, predominantly dealers who observe the greatest order flow.
In sum, the security-based swap market is a global market characterized by a high level
of interconnectedness and spillover risk and by significant information asymmetries that result
from the opacity of the OTC market. The global nature of this market, combined with the
interconnectedness of market participants, means that it is difficult to isolate risk and liquidity
problems to one geographical segment of the market, or to one asset class. Because U.S. market
participants and transactions regulated under Title VII are a subset of the overall global securitybased swap market, concerns surrounding these types of spillovers are part of the framework in
which we analyze the competitive effects of our proposed rules and interpretations.
The interconnectedness of this market also highlights the need for coordination among
international regulators. 1334 Because liquidity and risk spillovers, even from entities that engage
in security-based swap activity entirely outside the United States, have the potential to put the
U.S. market at risk, consistent regulation of the security-based swap market across jurisdictions
may be necessary to effectively reduce those risks. However, the regulatory developments in
various jurisdictions are not necessarily consistent in pace and scope, which may result in certain
types of risks being addressed in different ways.
In our assessment of the economic effects of the proposed rules and interpretations, we
also are mindful that these differences in scope and timing may affect the behavior of some
market participants. In particular, the United States being first-mover in many areas of securitybased swap market regulation presents unique challenges to maintaining high regulatory
standards and avoiding disruptions in the global security-based swap market.
We also recognize that regulations designed to mitigate systemic risk and improve
transparency can impose a barrier to entry and access for foreign participants, which could have
an effect on liquidity in the security-based swap market. For example, regulatory requirements
in the U.S. that conflict with foreign laws may preclude foreign entities from participating in
U.S. markets. We also recognize that regulators in other jurisdictions are currently engaged in

implementing their own regulatory reforms of the OTC derivatives markets and are faced with a
similar tradeoff between preserving market access and reducing risks to their financial systems.
Our proposed application of Title VII to cross-border activities may affect the policy decisions of
these other regulators as they seek to address this tradeoff under their authority.
Regulatory differences among jurisdictions in the global security-based swap markets
driven by lack of coordination could create incentives for business restructuring solely for the
purposes of operating outside of Title VII regulation. Furthermore, barriers to market access
may produce competitive distortions and lead to fragmented markets. 1335 We also note that the
potential effects of our proposed application of Title VII in the cross-border context on
competitive frictions and market fragmentation would be moderated or amplified by the
substantive requirements ultimately adopted by the Commission. The Commission is reopening
the comment periods for our outstanding rulemaking releases that concern security-based swaps
and security-based swap market participants and were proposed pursuant to certain provisions of
the Exchange Act, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1336
2. Competition
The proposed rules and interpretations discussed in this release will likely affect
competition in the U.S. security-based swap market and potentially change the set of available
counterparties that would compete for business and provide liquidity to U.S. market participants.
Some of these proposed rules and interpretations will likely enhance competition and
participation in the U.S. market, as application of Title VII requirements to entities that are
engaged in security-based swap activity conducted with U.S. persons or otherwise conducted
within the United States will likely promote safety and soundness, transparency, and competition
within the U.S. security-based swap market and the U.S. financial system as a whole. At the
same time, these proposed rules and interpretations may impose certain costs or other burdens
that may reduce the level of competition in this market.
Assessing the net effect of these proposed rules and interpretations on competition is
particularly complicated in the cross-border context. As already noted, cross-border activity
involving market participants domiciled in different jurisdictions accounts for the vast majority
of transactions in the security-based swap market. U.S. persons routinely enter into securitybased swap transactions with market participants located in other jurisdictions or have operations
outside the United States that engage in security-based swap activity; similarly, non-U.S. persons

Competitive Financial Services Industry,” J. of Fin. Serv. Res., Vol. 17, No. 1 (2000) (showing
that, in a simple industrial organization model of bank lending, a change in the cost of capital
resulting from regulation results in a greater loss of profits when regulated banks face competition
from non-regulated banks than when regulations apply equally to all competitors). See also

routinely enter into transactions with U.S. persons and maintain operations within the United
States. The global nature of the market and of market participants’ operations may lead to
differences in the application of Title VII to firms active in the global security-based swap
market and may create incentives for firms to restructure their operations to minimize contact
with the United States that would be less likely in a less global market.
In our preliminary view, there are three key factors that will contribute to the effects our
proposed cross-border rules and interpretations will have on competition in the security-based
swap market: (1) how Title VII requirements apply to U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons when
they transact security-based swaps within the United States; (2) how these requirements apply to
U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons when they transact security-based swaps outside the United
States; and (3) whether the regulatory requirements that foreign jurisdictions impose on U.S.
persons and non-U.S. persons are comparable to those that we are proposing in this release. In
addition, as noted above, the magnitude of any competitive effects flowing from our proposed
application of the Title VII requirements described in this release will also be determined by the
substantive rules we ultimately adopt to implement Title VII.
For example, in response to our proposal to impose Title VII requirements on non-U.S.
persons that engage in security-based swap activity with U.S. persons or within the United
States, some non-U.S. persons may seek to restructure their operations to minimize their contact
with the United States in an effort to avoid having to comply with Title VII; some non-U.S.
persons may determine to exit the U.S. market entirely. Similarly, to the extent that our
proposed rules treat the foreign business of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons differently from
their U.S. business, these entities may have incentives to restructure their business to separate
their foreign and U.S. operations. Both of these potential responses to our proposal may result in
lessened competition in the security-based swap market within the United States. The decision
to restructure and move operations outside the United States does not necessarily indicate
reduction of the exposures of the U.S. financial system to systemic risk if, for example, the
foreign operations are supported by a guarantee provided by a U.S. person, which provides a
path for the transmission of risk to transmit to the United States.
The competitive effects of our proposal will also be affected by whether entities
potentially subject to Title VII are also subject to similar regulations in foreign jurisdictions
when they transact security-based swaps or perform infrastructure functions in the security-based
swap market, and, if so, whether those regulations are inconsistent with, or duplicative of
applicable Title VII regulations. Many other jurisdictions are implementing reforms of the OTC
derivatives market (including those products defined as security-based swaps within the United
States), but this regulation can be expected to develop along different timelines and impose
different substantive requirements.
To the extent that these timelines or requirements are different, market participants may
have the opportunity to take advantage of these differences by making strategic choices, at least
in the short term, with respect to their transaction counterparties and operating business models.
For example, at a larger scale, firms may choose whether to withdraw from, or participate in the
U.S. security-based swap market. This may change the number of participants in the U.S.
market and could have a direct impact on competition in the U.S. market. In addition,
403

differences in regulatory requirements may make it difficult for U.S. dealers to provide
competitive spreads relative to foreign dealers. While we do not anticipate that this disadvantage
would cause U.S. dealers to exit foreign markets, it could have a direct effect on competition in
foreign markets unless U.S. dealers restructure their business to conduct foreign transactions
through subsidiaries that satisfy the requirements to be considered non-U.S. persons.
In developing the approach we are proposing in this release, we have considered the
potential for competitive distortions as a result of these inconsistencies. At the same time, the
Commission believes that, while the potential of regulatory arbitrage is real, the effects of these
strategic choices may be mitigated to some extent as regulators in other jurisdictions implement
the G20 commitments. 1337 Efforts are underway to achieve robust derivatives market regulation,
including regulations of the security-based swap markets, in various jurisdictions. 1338 As
jurisdictions progress toward full implementation of the G20 commitments, competitive
distortions should decline to some extent, blunting the incentives for this type of strategic
behavior.
(a) Security-Based Swap Dealers
Our proposed approach would generally apply dealer registration and other Title VII
requirements to entities that conduct dealing activity with U.S. persons 1339 or in the United
States. 1340 Because the full range of Title VII requirements are applied generally to activity in
the United States regardless of the counterparty’s U.S.-person status, 1341 persons choosing to
transact a security-based swap in the United States may have no incentive to favor a non-U.S.
counterparty over a U.S. counterparty. 1342

of the mandatory trade execution requirement to cross-border security-based swap transactions in
proposed Rule 3Ch-1, as discussed in Section X above; and the proposed application of the
regulatory reporting and public dissemination requirements in proposed Rule 908 of Regulation
SBSR, as discussed in Section VIII above.

1342

This is in general the case, however, proposed Rules 3Ca-3(b) and 3Ch-1(b) would not apply the
mandatory clearing and mandatory trade execution requirements to transactions between two
non-U.S. persons who are not security-based swap dealers and whose performances under

404

At the same time, some entities may determine that the compliance costs arising from the
requirements of Title VII warrant exiting the security-based swap market in the United States.
Non-U.S. persons may find this option more attractive than U.S. persons because they may find
it easier to structure their foreign business so as to prevent it from falling within the scope of
Title VII. To the extent that entities engaged in dealing activity exit the U.S. security-based
swap market, the level of competition in the market may decline. These exits could result in
higher spreads and affect the ability and willingness of end users to engage in security-based
swaps. 1343
We noted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release that the registration
requirement would impose dealer registration costs on entities that engage in the bulk of dealing
activity in the market, while the de minimis threshold would allow persons who account for a
small portion of dealing activity to avoid incurring these costs to obtain what would likely be
comparatively modest benefits, given the small size of these dealers. 1344 We noted in that release
that the de minimis threshold may mitigate some of the potential competitive burdens that could
fall on entities engaged in a smaller amount of dealing activity without leaving an undue amount
of dealing activity outside of the ambit of dealer regulation. 1345
In the cross-border context, the proposed de minimis exception 1346 could reduce the
number of entities likely to exit the U.S. market because it would enable an established foreign
entity to transact a de minimis amount of security-based swap dealing activity in the U.S. market
before it determines whether to expand its U.S. business 1347 and become a registered securitybased swap dealer. However, since the ability of smaller entities to access the U.S. securitybased swap market without registration would be limited to conducting dealing activity below
the de minimis threshold, these entities would have an incentive to curtail their security-based
swap dealing activity with U.S. persons as they approach the de minimis threshold to avoid
having to register as a dealer. To the extent that such entities choose to operate in the U.S.
security-based swaps are not guaranteed by a U.S. person, even though such transactions are
conducted in the United States.

The proposed application of the de minimis exception would allow a U.S. and foreign dealing
entity to conduct dealing activity in the U.S. security-based swap market without registering as a
security-based swap dealer so long as their trailing 12-month notional volume of transactions
with U.S. persons and transactions conducted within the United States in its dealing capacity is
below the de minimis threshold. See proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act.

market at levels below the de minimis threshold, the net effect on competition of their decision to
remain in the U.S. market is likely to be small and unlikely to deter the accumulation of market
power by a relatively smaller number of large dealing entities than are currently active in the
U.S. market.
On the other hand, Title VII regulatory requirements may allow registered dealers to
credibly signal high quality, better risk management, and better counterparty protection relative
to unregistered dealers that compete for the same order flow. End users in the U.S. market may
be willing to pay higher prices for higher-quality services from registered entities. 1348 These
regulatory benefits could mitigate the competitive burdens imposed by the proposed cross-border
rules and substantive Title VII requirements applicable to registered security-based swap dealers
by, for example reducing incentives for firms to exit the market.
The proposed approach to application of Title VII requirements to dealing activities
outside the United States may also have distinct competitive effects that interact with the effects
just described. Because we are proposing to take a different approach to the application of Title
VII to dealing activity outside the United States from the application of Title VII to dealing
activity in the United States, certain dealing entities may have incentives to restructure their
existing dealing business 1349 in order to prevent all or part of their security-based swap business
from becoming subject to Title VII. For example, a foreign dealing entity conducting its U.S.
Business 1350 in excess of the de minimis threshold may be motivated to separate its U.S.
Business from its Foreign Business into two or more distinct entities. 1351 Such a firm may
conduct U.S. Business and Foreign Business through two separate entities and confine its U.S.
Business in an entity registered as security-based swap dealer, potentially allowing the firm to
insulate its Foreign Business from Title VII requirements. Alternatively, some foreign dealing
entities may choose to exit the U.S. market entirely.

Similarly, application of the transaction-level requirements for public dissemination,
mandatory clearing, and mandatory trade execution may generally be triggered, in part, by the
choice of non-U.S. persons to conduct security-based swap transactions within the United
States. 1352 This may give foreign security-based swap dealers and other market participants an
incentive to restructure their operations or otherwise avoid using an agent in the United States to
conduct security-based swap transactions in order to avoid the transaction-level requirements. 1353
For example, a foreign security-based swap dealer operating within the United States
whose performance under security-based swaps are not guaranteed by a U.S. person (“foreign
non-guaranteed security-based swap dealer”) would be required to comply with the mandatory
clearing requirement with respect to a security-based swap with a non-U.S. person counterparty
whose security-based swap transaction is not guaranteed by a U.S. person (“non-U.S. nonguaranteed counterparty”). However, the same security-based swap between a foreign nonguaranteed security-based swap dealer and a non-U.S. non-guaranteed counterparty would not be
subject to mandatory clearing if the transaction were conducted outside the United States.
Therefore, foreign non-guaranteed security-based swap dealers and non-U.S. non-guaranteed
counterparties may be motivated to avoid using their U.S. operations, such as a sales and trading
desk in the United States, to conduct security-based swaps with non-guaranteed non-U.S.
counterparties in order to avoid application of the mandatory clearing, public dissemination, and
trade execution requirements under Title VII. They may be further motivated to move part of
their operations, such as the sales and trading desk in the United States that currently conducts
security-based swaps with non-guaranteed non-U.S. counterparties to a location outside the
United States.
These potential restructurings may impact competition in the U.S. market. On one hand,
the ability to restructure one’s business rather than exit the U.S. market entirely to avoid
application of Title VII to an entity’s non-U.S. operations may reduce the number of entities that
exit the market, thus mitigating the negative effects on competition described above. On the
other hand, U.S. end users may find that the only foreign security-based swap dealers that are
willing to deal with them are those whose security-based swap business is sufficiently large to
afford the costs of restructuring and of registration as well as the ensuing compliance costs
associated with applicable Title VII requirements. To the extent that smaller dealers continue to
have an incentive to exit the market, the overall level of competition in the market may decline.
1352

This is in general the case, however, proposed Rules 3Ca-3(b) and 3Ch-1(b) would not apply the
mandatory clearing and mandatory trade execution requirements to transactions between two
non-U.S. persons who are not security-based swap dealers and whose performances under
security-based swaps are not guaranteed by a U.S. person, even though such transactions are
conducted in the United States.

1353

This is especially the case with respect to the public dissemination requirement; however, with
respect to mandatory clearing and mandatory trade execution requirements, this incentive
would not exist with respect to a non-U.S. person who is not a security-based swap dealer and
whose performance under security-based swaps is not guaranteed by a U.S. person, if such nonU.S. person transacts with another non-U.S. person that is not a security-based swap dealer and is
not guaranteed by a U.S. person. See note 1352, supra.

407

Moreover, regardless of the response of dealers to our proposed approach, we cannot
preclude the possibility that large end users in the United States who have the resources to
restructure their business also may pursue restructuring and move part of their business offshore
in order to transact with dealers outside the reach of Title VII. This may reduce liquidity within
the U.S. market and provide additional incentives for U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons to shift
a higher proportion of their security-based swap business off-shore, further reducing the level of
competition within the United States. In this scenario, the competitive frictions caused by the
application, in the cross-border context, of a de minimis threshold for dealing activity may affect
the ability of small end users of security-based swaps to access the security-based swap market
more than large ones, as smaller end users are less likely to have the resources that would enable
or justify a restructuring of their business.
To reduce the likelihood of market fragmentation and increase U.S. persons’ access to
foreign markets, we are proposing not to require non-U.S. persons to count transactions with
foreign branches of U.S. banks toward their de minimis threshold if the transactions are
conducted outside the United States. 1354 We preliminarily believe that this would reduce the
incentives of non-U.S. person dealers to avoid engaging in security-based swap dealing activity
with foreign branches of U.S. banks. In addition, we are proposing not to apply certain marketwide transaction-level requirements (i.e., mandatory clearing, public dissemination, and
mandatory trade execution requirements) to foreign branches and non-U.S. persons whose
performance under security-based swap transactions is guaranteed by a U.S. person, when
foreign branches and guaranteed non-U.S. persons transact with non-U.S. persons whose
performance under security-based swap transactions is not guaranteed by a U.S. person and who
are not registered security-based swap dealers. This approach to transaction-level requirements
reduces the likelihood of conflicting regulations for foreign branches of U.S. banks and
guaranteed non-U.S. persons operating in foreign jurisdictions as these jurisdictions adopt
regulatory requirements for security-based swap participants.
Finally, our proposed cross-border approach includes a substituted compliance policy
framework that allows market participants to request substituted compliance. Substituted
compliance, if granted, would allow certain security-based swap transactions or participants to
satisfy their compliance obligations with respect to the applicable Title VII requirements by
complying with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction. This should reduce market participants’
compliance costs by reducing the effects of duplicative regulation. Substituted compliance could
encourage foreign firms’ participation in the U.S. market and U.S. firms’ access to the global
market. This might result in increased competition between both U.S. and foreign intermediaries
without compromising the regulatory benefits intended by the applicable Title VII requirements.
Conflicting regulations may impose a legal barrier to entry that goes beyond firms’
willingness to participate in U.S. markets as a result of duplicative compliance costs. In these
cases, substituted compliance determinations may remove this legal barrier, even if offered
conditionally, and allow market participants to more easily access U.S. markets. This may also
facilitate U.S. participants’ access to foreign liquidity. Access to more liquidity providers and
1354

See proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act.

408

infrastructure services, as well as the general benefits of increased market participation, should
promote competition in the security-based swap market.
The overall effects of the proposed approach described in this release on competition
among dealing entities in the U.S. security-based swap market will depend on the way market
participants respond to these different elements of our proposal. For example, suppose the
proposed application of the security-based swap dealer registration requirement increases
concentration among security-based swap dealers providing services to U.S. end users.
Application of market-wide transaction-level requirements that facilitate competition (as
discussed further below) may offset any competitive effects caused by increased concentration.
Fewer dealing entities may lead to decreased competition and wider spreads in the security-based
swap market; however, implementation of the public dissemination and mandatory trade
execution requirements would increase pre-trade and post-trade transparency, making it more
difficult for dealing entities to post wider spreads. 1355
(b) Security-Based Swap Market Infrastructure Requirements
i.

Registration of Clearing Agencies, SDRs and SB SEFs

The Commission has considered the effects of the proposed application in the crossborder context, of the registration requirements with respect to clearing agencies, SDRs, and SB
SEFs on competition in the U.S. security-based swap market.
The proposed approach to applying the registration requirements with respect to securitybased swap market infrastructures is based on whether a CCP, a data repository, or a securitybased swap trading facility has performed the type of activity in the United States or with respect
to U.S. persons that constitutes clearing services, data repository services, or trading facility
services within the meaning of the Exchange Act that would trigger the registration requirement.
One of the indicators of performing security-based swap infrastructure services in the United
States is to provide such services to a U.S. person. In the case of clearing services, this would
include accepting a U.S. person as a member of a CCP. Similar to our analysis of the effects of
the proposed application of the security-based swap dealer registration requirement on
competition in the cross-border context, we are mindful that the proposed approach would
directly affect the total number of clearing agencies, SDRs, and SB SEFs that would be required
to register with the Commission. Registration would trigger certain Title VII requirements,
which would entail compliance costs. Certain CCPs, data repositories, or security-based swap
trading facilities may choose to withdraw from the U.S. market to avoid registration.
However, the burden on competition imposed by the proposed approach to infrastructure
registration requirements would likely be less acute than the security-based swap dealer
registration requirement. Clearing, trade reporting, and execution on trading platforms are

409

relatively recent services for the security-based swap market, and only a limited number of
CCPs, trade repositories, and execution facilities currently perform these services 1356 and may
therefore be required to register under the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, the proposed
interpretation with respect to availability of an exemption from registration for foreign SB SEFs
should reduce or eliminate the duplicative regulatory costs for foreign SB SEFs subject to
comparable regulatory requirements and increase the likelihood that foreign SB SEFs will enter
the United States, which, in turn, would increase competition.
Nonetheless, the proposed application of Title VII regulation in the cross-border context
generates competitive frictions similar to those discussed above in the context of dealers.
Broadly, providers of security-based swap infrastructure may seek to limit their exposure to the
U.S. portion of the market in order to avoid Title VII regulation. For example, a foreign CCP
that does not otherwise perform clearing services in the United States may refuse to accept U.S.
persons as members to avoid registration and compliance costs, which would limit U.S. persons’
access to foreign clearing services to correspondent arrangements. Similar arguments apply to
U.S. persons’ access to execution venues and data repositories.
The Commission also has considered the ways in which the structure of the market for
infrastructure services may affect the benefits that flow from certain Title VII regulations.
Providing incentives for entry of SDRs could result in fragmentation of regulatory data across
multiple repositories, which would complicate oversight of the security-based swap market and
require that regulators take additional steps to consolidate data sets. 1357 In this release, the
Commission has proposed the availability of conditional exemptive relief for non-U.S. persons
performing SDR functions that potentially reduces the number of SDRs that would receive
regulatory data. 1358 Further, the proposed indemnification exemption may discourage the
establishment of SDRs on jurisdictional lines. 1359
Similarly, a single CCP serving the entire security-based swap market may result in more
effective netting of offsetting positions among members, potentially reducing aggregate
counterparty risk borne by the CCP and making risk management less costly. 1360 Indeed, high
fixed costs and low variable costs associated with the provision of clearing services may
contribute to a natural monopoly in this market. A second benefit of a single CCP is that it
would preclude the possibility that risk management standards could erode as CCPs compete for

seven and 10 entities would be likely to register as CCPs); SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at

clearing business. However, if the market evolves so that a single CCP emerges, it could require
additional regulatory monitoring to address issues associated with natural monopolies. 1361
These arguments are less clear in the case of SB SEFs. Evidence from equity markets
seems to indicate benefits from both consolidation and fragmentation. 1362 On the one hand,
some research supports the conclusion that consolidation of order flow onto a small number of
trading venues may facilitate efficient matching between supply and demand, reduce price
volatility within the trading venue, 1363 and reduce spreads. 1364 On the other hand, other
researchers have found that the competitive effects flowing from multiple trading venues can
outweigh the effects of fragmentation, resulting in more efficient pricing and narrower
spreads. 1365
The Commission has considered the above effects and proposed a cross-border approach
that would require a CCP or execution facility to register if it performs clearing agency function
in the United States or operates a facility for the trading or processing of security-based swaps in
the United States or with respect to U.S. persons. Similarly, the Commission has proposed an
approach that would require a trade repository to register if it performs SDR functions within the
United States. The Commission preliminarily believes that this approach would promote
transparency, improve systemic risk management, and allow better regulatory oversight, which
in turn, would encourage broader market participation in the U.S. security-based swap market.

Application of Mandatory Clearing, Public Dissemination, Regulatory
Reporting, and Trade Execution Requirements in the Cross-Border
Context

The proposed application of the market-wide transaction-level requirements to crossborder activities may have significant effects on competition in the U.S. security-based swap
market. As noted above, the Commission is proposing an approach that would generally apply
Title VII transaction-level requirements evenly to persons who conduct security-based swap
activity with U.S. persons or within the United States. 1366 Because these requirements are
generally applied evenly and expansively in the United States, a foreign person who wishes to
avoid clearing, public dissemination, or pre-trade transparency requirements would have to avoid
either transacting with U.S. persons or involving a U.S. person as agent in negotiating, soliciting,
or executing security-based swap transactions on its behalf within the United States. 1367
Notwithstanding a possible reduction in competition, the Commission believes that these
market-wide transaction-level requirements should be applied to such transactions because they
reduce systemic risk, promote transparency, and improve regulatory oversight. All of these
contribute to the integrity and efficiency of the U.S. security-based swap market and should
increase competition among those who choose to participate under Title VII.
The proposed cross-border approach would generally not apply the market-wide
transaction-level requirements to foreign branches and non-U.S. persons whose performance
under security-based swap transactions is guaranteed by a U.S. person, when foreign branches
and guaranteed non-U.S. persons transact with non-U.S. persons whose performance under
security-based swap transactions is not guaranteed by a U.S. person and who are not registered
security-based swap dealers. As stated in the competition analysis with respect to security-based
swap dealers, 1368 this proposed approach would facilitate U.S.-based dealing entities’ access to
foreign markets and help prevent market fragmentation. However, the guarantees provided by
U.S. persons remain a conduit for systemic risk to be transmitted to the United States.
However, the Commission is mindful that, in the near term and until full implementation
of transparency requirements in the other jurisdictions that are comparable to the U.S. marketwide transaction-level requirements, if any part of the global market is left opaque without either
public dissemination or pre-trade transparency, there may be opportunities for market
participants to restructure and move their transactions to the OTC part of the global market. The
1366

3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act and notes 1340 and 1341 above.

1367

However, with respect to the mandatory clearing and mandatory trade execution requirements,
transactions between two non-U.S. persons whose performance of obligations under securitybased swaps is not guaranteed by U.S. persons and who are not security-based swap dealers
would not be subject to mandatory clearing and mandatory trade execution even though these
transactions are conducted within the United States. See proposed Rules 3Ca-3 and 3Ch-1 under
the Exchange Act.

value of transparency in the U.S. market would be reduced to the extent that liquidity migrates to
less-transparent jurisdictions.
3. Efficiency
As noted above, in proposing the rules and interpretations discussed in this release, we
are required to consider whether these actions would promote efficiency. In significant part, the
effects of our proposed cross-border approach on efficiency are linked to the effects on
competition. Minimizing impediments to access to the security-based swaps not only promotes
competition, but also encourages participants to express their true valuation for security-based
swaps and, as a result, is expected to promote efficiency. Generally, rules and interpretations
that delineate an appropriate scope of application of the Title VII requirements can be expected
to promote the efficient allocation of risk, capital, and other resources by facilitating price
discovery and reducing costs associated with dislocations in the market for security-based swaps.
The proposed application of Title VII rules to cross-border transactions potentially
increases the volume of transactions that will take place on transparent venues. For example,
while the proposed rules allow exceptions to the mandatory trade execution requirement for
certain transactions involving a foreign branch of a U.S. bank or a guaranteed non-U.S. person as
one counterparty, these exceptions do not apply when a foreign security-based swap dealer is the
other counterparty to the transactions, and such transactions would be exposed to pre-trade
transparency on SB SEFs or exchanges. As stated above, the OTC security-based swap market
is characterized by search frictions and asymmetric information. 1369 Currently, in order to trade,
market participants must contact intermediaries on a bilateral basis to locate counterparties.
Intermediaries may capture these search costs by behaving less competitively. Search-based
inefficiencies in the bilateral OTC market manifest explicitly in the costs of matching with
counterparties and are implicit in the somewhat wider spreads that dealers might quote as a
strategic response to customer search costs. 1370 In addition, large intermediaries who observe
vast volumes of order flows from the breadth of their customer base have an informational
advantage over customers or small dealers who observe less order flow. This means that end
users potentially face adverse selection in addition to search costs which may reduce their
willingness to participate in the security-based swap market even when they might benefit from
increased risk-sharing.
In markets with impartial access, such as those characterized by our proposed regime for
SB SEFs, participants would face lower search costs when they decide to enter or exit a securitybased swap position. Moreover, access to the security-based swap market would be available to
more participants, increasing the likelihood of efficient reallocation of risks carried by security-

based swap contracts. 1371 At the same time, pre- and post-trade transparency requirements under
Title VII reduce dealers’ ability to benefit from private information that comes from observing
order flow. 1372 This change may increase the willingness of market participants to lay off risks
they are relatively less-equipped to bear. Increased liquidity in a transparent security-based swap
market should facilitate price discovery. 1373
Increased price efficiency in the security-based swap market, in turn, produces important
externalities. Transparency in the security-based swap market could result in more accurate
valuation of security-based swaps generally, as all market participants would have the benefit of
knowing how counterparties to a security-based swap valued the security-based swap at a
specific moment in time. 1374 Especially with complex instruments, investment decisions
generally are predicated on a significant amount of due diligence to value the instrument
properly. A post-trade transparency system permits other market participants to derive at least
some informational benefit from obtaining the views of the two counterparties who traded that
instrument. Finally, central clearing of security-based swaps could make it easier for market
participants who observe prices to disentangle the default risk of counterparties from the
fundamental risks priced into the underlying contract. This has the benefit of enhancing the
incremental price discovery already associated with the transparency requirements.
Better valuations could have a significant impact on efficiency and capital allocation. In
particular, under the pre-trade and post-trade transparency regimes contemplated by Title VII,
persons outside the security-based swap market could use information produced and aggregated
by the security-based swap market as an input to both real investment decisions as well as

discusses the role of securities markets, new securities, and financial innovation in allowing
individuals to share and diversify risks.

1372

We recognize that intermediaries’ informational advantage may not be completely eliminated by
the mandatory trade execution and public dissemination requirements. For example,
intermediaries would have the advantage of seeing order flows or inquiries that are not ultimately
executed and disseminated. In addition, the executing intermediary still has informational
advantage from knowing the counterparty’s identity, and intermediaries may know about an order
or inquiry before anyone else in the market.

financial investments in related markets for equity and debt. 1375 By helping asset valuations
move closer to their fundamental values, transparency encourages efficient capital allocation. 1376
In the cross-border context, our proposed approach generally applies the full range of
Title VII requirements (including mandatory clearing, regulatory reporting, public dissemination,
and mandatory trade execution requirements) to transactions with U.S. persons and transactions
conducted within the United States, 1377 with the objective of promoting transparency and
efficiency in the U.S. security-based swap market. For example, as noted above, 1378 the
Commission is re-proposing certain provisions of Regulation SBSR to, among other things,
extend the scope of security-based swaps that would be subject to regulatory reporting and public
dissemination. As a result of the re-proposal, more transactions with a nexus to the United States
would be reported to SDRs and thus would be made available to regulators. 1379 Furthermore, by
possessing more comprehensive data on security-based swap transactions, regulators will be able
to observe pockets of risk in the global marketplace that heretofore would not have been
accessible to them. Early awareness of such risks provided by access to such data may enable
regulators to respond by taking actions to mitigate the potential impact of such risks on the
market, which could in turn prevent the deterioration of market conditions that could result if
such risks remain hidden.
Besides impacts on price efficiency and the efficient allocation of capital, the
Commission also has considered more generally the impact of the rules and interpretations in this
release on the efficient use of resources. In our re-proposal of Regulation SBSR, the
Commission is revising our approach to assigning the reporting duty to place less emphasis on
the domicile of the counterparties, and to focus more on their status (i.e., whether or not a
counterparty is a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant). 1380 We
preliminarily believe that the revisions in the re-proposal reallocate the reporting burden to those
entities that face a relatively lower cost of reporting, thus promoting efficiency. These revisions

Markets,” Journal of Finance, Vol. 59, No. 3 (2004) (estimating that the proportion of

percent).

Due to corresponding impacts on the market not realized under Rule 908(a) as originally
proposed, under the re-proposal, security-based swap transactions executed outside the United
States by a non-U.S. person direct counterparty but performance of which is guaranteed by a U.S.
person would now be subject to regulatory reporting.

See Section VIII, supra (describing the Regulation SBSR re-proposal).

415

are designed to assign the responsibility to report a security-based swap transaction to persons
that the Commission preliminarily believes are more easily able to fulfill that responsibility, and
in a manner consistent with the reporting hierarchy set forth in Section 13A(a)(3) of the
Exchange Act. 1381 In addition, the Commission expects any transaction reporting systems
implemented by security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants to be
automated.
However, we recognize that certain aspects of our proposal may reduce efficiency in the
U.S. security-based swap market. Increasing market transparency, in some instances, may cause
certain market participants to abstain from trading that would otherwise be efficient. For
example, market participants might be less willing to trade on centralized, transparent markets if
it means exposing their trading strategies to their competitors. 1382
Further, as we noted in our competition analysis, various jurisdictions are developing
transparency rules at different paces. If stringent regulation under Title VII results in less access
for U.S. persons to foreign segments of the security-based swap market, opportunities for
efficient risk-sharing may correspondingly decline. Furthermore, to the extent that we have
implemented the transparency requirements and the other jurisdictions have not (or to the extent
that the scope of the transparency requirement among various jurisdictions is not comparable),
market participants may have an incentive to restructure their business in order to move
transactions to opaque corners of the global security-based swap market.
If such restructuring results in a large and opaque market outside the reach of Title VII at
the expense of liquidity in a transparent market regulated under Title VII, the efficiency benefits
of Title VII would be undermined, in terms of price efficiency, efficient risk-sharing, and the
efficient allocation of capital across real and financial assets. Moreover, insofar as the types of
restructuring contemplated above purely constitute attempts at regulatory arbitrage, they
represent a use of resources that could potentially be put to more productive uses. In addition,
the effect of the proposed application of the Title VII requirements described in this release on
1381

15 U.S.C. 78m-1(a)(3). Section 13A(a)(3) of the Exchange Act assigns to specific kinds of
counterparties the duty to report uncleared security-based swaps to an SDR or to the Commission.
The Commission previously noted that it “understands that many reporting parties already have
established linkages to entities that may register as [SDRs], which could significantly reduce the
out-of-pocket costs associated with establishing the reporting function.” See Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75249 n.193. The Commission preliminarily believes that the
additional cost for non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants absorbing the costs of reporting these additional transactions should be de minimis,
since these larger market participants have likely already taken significant steps to establish and
maintain the systems, processes, and procedures, and have likely devoted staff resources to report
security-based swaps currently to existing data repositories. See Section XV.H.3(a)(ii), infra.

1382

See, e.g., Ananth Madhavan, et al., “Should Securities Markets Be Transparent?” J. of Fin.
Markets, Vol. 8 (2005) (finding that an increase in pre-trade price transparency leads to lower
liquidity and higher execution costs, because limit-order traders are reluctant to submit orders
given that their orders essentially represent free options to other traders).

416

efficiency also would be affected by the substantive rules we ultimately adopted to implement
the relevant Title VII requirements.
In the cross-border context, we try to strike a balance between promoting efficiency in
the U.S. security-based swap market and mitigating potential disruptions to other parts of the
global market by including certain carve-outs in our proposed application of market-wide
transaction-level requirements. 1383 These exceptions are designed to enable foreign branches and
foreign affiliates whose performance under security-based swaps is guaranteed by a U.S. person
to maintain access to other parts of the global security-based swap markets when they transact
with non-U.S. persons whose performance under security-based swaps is not guaranteed by a
U.S. person. This should help ensure that U.S. banks operating through foreign branches and
foreign affiliates of U.S. persons are able to continue to access global liquidity. However, as
stated in our analysis of competition effects, the tradeoff is that the guarantees provided by U.S.
persons represent a conduit for systemic risk to flow to the United States.
By seeking to minimize, where appropriate, interruption to existing relationships of U.S.
banks and foreign affiliates of U.S. persons with foreign market participants, the Commission’s
proposed cross-border approach could help preserve existing conduits for global risk-sharing.
We considered this benefit and the efficiency costs that may result because these transactions are
not occurring in the transparent market envisioned under Title VII.
Finally, recognizing that the U.S. security-based swap market is an integral part of the
global security-based swap market, the Commission has proposed exemptive relief from
registration for foreign SB SEFs and SDRs in certain cases. The Commission’s proposal to
consider an exemption from SB SEF registration for foreign security-based swap markets may
facilitate the consolidation of global order flow onto certain particular trading venues for
security-based swap contracts written on certain reference entities. The Commission believes
this may promote participation in the transparent market and, in turn, market efficiency, without
sacrificing the benefits of requiring SB SEF registration.
The proposed exemptive relief for non-U.S. persons performing the functions of SDRs
within the United States would allow non-U.S. persons to continue to receive data reported
pursuant to the reporting requirements of a foreign jurisdiction without registering with the
Commission as an SDR, subject to a condition that would help ensure that the confidentiality of
the data and Commission access to data is maintained. The potential for exemptive relief from
SDR registration requirements might reduce the incentive for market participants to restructure
their operations to avoid triggering registration requirements. 1384 Further, the potential for an
Indemnification Exception, proposed in this release, could reduce the potential for SDRs to be
established along purely jurisdictional lines. 1385
1383

Exchange Act.

1385

See Section XV.H.2, infra.

417

Similarly, the proposed cross-border approach permits substituted compliance in certain
circumstances if the Commission determines that the applicable foreign regulatory requirements
are comparable to the related Title VII requirements. By allowing certain security-based swap
transactions or participants to satisfy their compliance obligations with respect to the applicable
Title VII requirements by complying with the rules of a foreign jurisdiction, duplicative
compliance costs could be reduced and compliance burdens minimized. This could allow
security-based swap counterparties to operate more efficiently, as by allocating resources to
other activities, such as improving operational efficiency or engaging in other investment
activity. Therefore, the possibility of substituted compliance would encourage foreign firms’
participation in the U.S. market and would help preserve U.S. firms’ access to the other parts of
the global market, while helping to ensure that substantially equivalent regulatory benefits are
generated by meeting foreign regulatory standards comparable to Title VII.
4. Capital Formation
The Commission preliminarily believes that many aspects of the proposed cross-border
approach are likely to promote capital formation. As mentioned above, 1386 a security-based
swap market with pre-trade and post-trade price transparency, and enhanced regulatory oversight
may facilitate entry by a wide range of market participants seeking to engage in a broad range of
hedging and trading activities. However, we recognize that, to the extent that Title VII imposes
barriers to entry and access, or results in market fragmentation, it may impair capital formation
and result in a redistribution of capital across jurisdictional boundaries.
As stated above, pre- and post-trade transparency should result in more accurate
valuation, which should promote efficient allocation of capital. 1387 In general, market
participants benefit from knowing how counterparties to a security-based swap transaction value
the security-based swap at a specific moment in time; information revealed through pre- and
post-trade transparency allows market participants to derive more-informed assessments with
respect to asset valuations, leading to more efficient capital allocation. This should be true for
the underlying assets as well. That is, information learned from security-based swap quoting and
trading provides signals not only about security-based swap valuation, but also about the value of
the reference assets underlying the swap. Similarly, we expect pre- and post-trade transparency
to benefit the real economy as well. Transparent prices provide better signals about the quality
of a business investment, promoting capital formation in the real economy by helping managers
to make more-informed decisions and making it easier for firms to obtain financing for new
business opportunities. 1388
Furthermore, as discussed above, our proposed cross-border approach strives to address
the disruptions that implementation of Title VII may cause to the foreign branch of U.S. banks
1386

See Section XV.C.3, supra (discussing the effects of our proposed cross-border approach on
efficiency).

418

and foreign affiliates of U.S. persons by proposing certain exceptions to the application of the de
minimis exception to security-based swap dealer registration 1389 and the market-wide
transaction-level requirements. 1390 We preliminarily believe that by doing so, our proposed
cross-border approach to application of the Title VII requirements, as a whole, would address the
disruptions to the global security-based swap market. Integrated markets provide more risksharing opportunities, which encourages efficient risk-sharing and capital allocation; the more
integrated U.S. participants are into the global security-based swap market, the more access,
liquidity, and participation we would expect to see in both the U.S. security-based swap market
and the global security-based swap market as a whole.
Similarly, the proposed policy framework of substituted compliance should encourage
foreign firms’ participation in the U.S. security-based swap market and facilitate U.S. firms’
access to the other parts of the global market while helping to ensure that the regulatory benefits
of the applicable Title VII requirements are achieved by requiring the related foreign regulatory
standards to be comparable to the requirements of Title VII. Substituted compliance is designed
to accommodate the global nature of the security-based swap market and, therefore, should
similarly help the security-based swap market continue to integrate various segments or subparts
of the markets. As stated above, the integration of the U.S. market into the global market should
encourage efficient global risk-sharing, which should, in turn, potentially free up more capital for
investment in real assets.
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment about our preliminary analysis of the
effects of our proposal on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. In particular, the
Commission requests comment on any effect the proposed rules, rule amendments, and
interpretations may have on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, including the
competitive or anticompetitive effects the proposed rule may have on market participants.

Economic Analysis of Proposed Rules Regarding “Security-Based Swap Dealers” and
“Major Security-Based Swap Participants”

To promote the goals of reduced risk, increased transparency, and improved market
integrity in the financial system, Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act requires, among other things,
registration and regulation of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants. The Commission and the CFTC jointly adopted final rules in 2012 to further define
“security-based swap dealer” and “major security-based swap participant.” 1391 Of particular
importance is the de minimis exception to dealing activity, which excepts a dealer in securitybased swaps from the definition and designation of “security-based swap dealer” if the notional

Rule 908(a)(2) under the Exchange Act. See also Section XV.C.3, supra (discussing the effects
of our proposed cross-border approach on efficiency).

419

amount of its dealing activity in the trailing 12-month period is below a particular threshold. As
discussed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the costs and benefits of the dealer
and participant definitions fall into two categories. First, there are costs and benefits associated
with identifying a subset of current and future market participants as either security-based swap
dealers or major security-based swap participants (i.e., the assessment costs). Second, there are
costs and benefits associated with subjecting that subset to a complete, fully effective
complement of Title VII statutory and regulatory requirements (i.e., the programmatic costs and
benefits).
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the Commission estimated that, out of
more than 1,000 entities engaged in CDS activity worldwide in 2011, 166 had worldwide CDS
activity at a level high enough such that they would perform the dealer-trader analysis prescribed
under the security-based swap dealer definition. Furthermore, based on an analysis of trading
activity using DTCC-TIW data, the Commission estimated that, based on their global trading
volumes, potentially 50 of these entities would exceed the de minimis threshold and thus
ultimately have to register as security-based swap dealers. Similarly, based on position data
from DTCC-TIW, the Commission estimated that, based on positions arising from their
worldwide CDS activity, as many as 12 entities would perform substantial position and
substantial counterparty exposure tests prescribed under the major security-based swap
participant definition.
These estimates represent a baseline against which the Commission can analyze the costs
and benefits of the proposed application of the intermediary definitions to cross-border activities.
More specifically, because the proposed cross-border rules would allow non-U.S. persons to
exclude from the de minimis and major participant thresholds certain transactions and positions
with non-U.S. counterparties, the ultimate number of entities that would exceed the dealer de
minimis or the major participant thresholds will likely be lower than estimated in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, and this decline will have a corresponding impact on
the programmatic costs and benefits associated with these definitions. On the other hand, the
cross-border rules are likely to increase assessment costs, as certain non-U.S. persons may need
to determine which transactions and positions may be excluded from the thresholds. These costs
and benefits are discussed more fully below.
1. Programmatic Costs and Benefits
(a) Registration of Security-based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based
Swap Participants
Title VII requires the registration of security-based swap dealers and major securitybased swap participants in accordance with rules promulgated by the Commission.1392 The
Commission proposed rules and forms to facilitate registration of security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants in the Registration Proposing Release. 1393 In that
1392

See Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR 65784.

420

release, the Commission provided an economic analysis relating to the proposed registration
requirements and forms. 1394 As discussed in more detail therein, the Commission expects that
dealers engaging in security-based swap activity exceeding the de minimis amount will incur
costs associated with registration. 1395 In addition, persons who are not security-based swap
dealers but hold substantial security-based swap positions that create an especially high level of
risk that could have systemic impact on the U.S. financial system will incur costs associated with
registration as a major securities-based swap participant. 1396 Registration will provide the
Commission with information regarding security-based swap dealers and major security-based
swap participants, which will enable the Commission to oversee these registered entities with
respect to their security-based swap activity and oversee compliance with the substantive
requirements applicable to them. The Commission believes that the revisions included in reproposed Forms SBSE, SBSE-A, and SBSE-BD would not significantly impact our analysis of
the costs and benefits of the rules and forms to facilitate registration of security-based swap
dealers and major security-based swap participants.
(b) Security-Based Swap Dealers—De Minimis Exception
Title VII requires entities engaged in security-based swap dealing activity to register as
security-based swap dealers unless such transactions constitute only “a de minimis quantity of
security-based swap dealing” and the dealer, therefore, is sufficiently small not to warrant
regulation as a security-based swap dealer. 1397 The statutory de minimis exception is silent on its
application to the cross-border security-based swap dealing activity of U.S. persons and non-U.S.
persons, and the Commission did not address this issue in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release. The Commission proposes Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act in this release to
address this issue.
Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act sets forth the application of the de
minimis exception to the activities of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons, describing which
security-based swap transactions conducted in a dealing capacity should be counted for purposes
of the de minimis exception. Because proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1) under the Exchange Act
would exclude certain transactions from the de minimis calculation and thereby may allow
certain entities to remain below the de minimis threshold, it affects the programmatic benefits
and costs of security-based swap dealer regulation under Title VII, 1398 as these programmatic
1394

In the Registration Proposing Release, the Commission described the costs we expect securitybased swap dealers and major security-based swap participants to incur in connection with
completing and filing forms, providing related certifications, addressing additional requirements
in connection with associated persons, as well as certain additional costs. See Registration
Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65812-19.

costs depend on the number of persons that will ultimately be required to register as securitybased swap dealers as well as the substantive requirements that are to be adopted in connection
with the security-based swap dealer regime.
This does not mean, however, that there would be a one-to-one relationship between the
exclusion of any particular person as a security-based swap dealer as a result of the de minimis
exception and any change in the programmatic benefits and costs that would be associated with
the non-regulation of that person. In other words, although Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1) may
allow certain entities to remain below the de minimis threshold, it does not follow that the
programmatic costs and benefits will change by an amount proportional to the volume of those
entities’ dealing activity. As the Commission explained in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, some of the costs and benefits of regulating an intermediary may be fixed,
while other costs and benefits of regulation may be variable, depending on a particular person’s
security-based swap dealing activity. 1399 For example, the programmatic benefits associated
with the registration and regulation of persons engaged in security-based swap dealing activity—
in other words, the expected mitigation of risks to the stability and transparency of the U.S.
financial system and to the protection of counterparties in the United States—will likely vary
depending on the type and nature of those persons’ dealing activity. Estimating the de minimis
exception’s effects on the programmatic costs and benefits (through including or excluding any
particular person within the intermediary definition) will be further complicated by the other
proposed rules regarding application of the entity-level and transaction-level requirements, as
discussed more fully below.
Given the same limitations on our ability to conduct a quantitative assessment of the
programmatic costs and benefits associated with intermediary definitions as stated in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 1400 we believe the methodology used in the

participants, such as costs of registration, may largely be fixed. At the same time, other costs
associated with regulating that person as a dealer or major participant (e.g., costs associated with
margin and capital requirements) may be variable, reflecting the level of the person’s securitybased swap activity. Similarly, the regulatory benefits that would arise from deeming that person
to be a dealer or major participant (e.g., benefits associated with increased transparency and
efficiency, and reduced risks faced by customers and counterparties), although not quantifiable,
may be expected to be variable in a way that reflects the person’s security-based swap activity.”).

The limitations stated in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release are those related to (i) the
data available to us and (ii) the set of data we use to draw inferences from in order to estimate the
number of dealers. See Section XV.B, supra.
With respect to the availability of data, we have taken into account data obtained from DTCCTIW, especially data regarding the activity of participants in the single-name credit default swap
market. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30635. We also have
considered more limited publicly available data regarding equity swaps. Id. at 30636 n.476, and
30637 n.485. The lack of market data is significant in the context of total return swaps on equity
and debt. We do not have the same amount of information regarding those products as we have
in connection with the present market for single name CDS. Id. at 30724 n.1456. We did not

Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release is appropriate and potentially most illustrative in
demonstrating our consideration of programmatic costs and benefits associated with proposed
Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act regarding application of the de minimis exception in the
definition of security-based swap dealer.
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we sought to identify a subset of
entities that appear to be the types of entities for which the statutory requirements of Title VII
were created based on the volume of their dealing activity. We then sought to adopt definitions
that would capture these entities, as Title VII required us to do, without imposing the costs of
Title VII on those entities for which regulation currently may not be justified in light of those
purposes. In developing Rule 3a71-2, which establishes the de minimis threshold for securitybased swap dealers, we took into account data regarding the security-based swap market and
especially data regarding the activity—including activity that may be suggestive of dealing
behavior—of participants in the single-name CDS market. 1401 Based on the CDS Data
consider data regarding index CDS for purposes of the economic analysis of the security-based
swap dealer definition because the data for index CDS encompasses both broad-based security
indices and narrow-based security indices, and “security-based swap” in relevant part
encompasses swaps based on single securities or on narrow-based security indices. See Section
3(a)(68)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68)(A); see also Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30635 n.472. We noted that the definition of security-based swaps is
not limited to single-name CDS but we believed that the single-name CDS data are sufficiently
representative of the market to help inform the analysis. See Section XV.B.2 and note 1278,
supra, and accompanying text.
With respect to the dataset we use, we have based, in part, our economic analysis of the securitybased swap dealer definition on certain data addressed by an analysis regarding the market for
single-name CDS performed by the SEC’s Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation
made available to the public. See “Information regarding activities and positions of participants
in the single-name credit default swap market” (Mar. 15, 2012), available at:
http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-39-10/s73910-154.pdf (“CDS Data Analysis”). As stated in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we believe that the data underlying the CDS Data
Analysis provides reasonably comprehensive information regarding the CDS activities and
positions of U.S. market participants, but we noted that the data does not encompass those CDS
that both: (i) do not involve U.S. counterparties; and (ii) are based on non-U.S. reference entities.
We also noted that the CDS Data Analysis contains transactions reflecting both dealing activity
and non-dealing activity, including transactions by persons who may engage in no dealing
activity whatsoever. Id. at 30635-36.
We also recognized in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, and in our discussion of
the limitations of this data above, that the CDS Data Analysis may be imperfect as a tool for
identifying dealing activity, given that the presence or absence of dealing activity ultimately turns
upon the relevant facts and circumstances of an entity’s security-based swap transactions, as
informed by the dealer-trader distinction. Nonetheless, various criteria used in the CDS Data
Analysis appear to be useful for identifying apparent dealing activity in the absence of full
analysis of the relevant facts and circumstances. Id. at 30636.

Analysis, 1402 we estimated in the economic analysis of the de minimis exception to the dealer
definition in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release that 50 or fewer entities ultimately
may have to register as security-based swap dealers. 1403
In developing proposed Rule 3a71-3(b), we have applied a methodology and analytical
framework similar to that employed in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release to ensure
that our proposed cross-border approach captures only those entities that we believe are likely,
because activity relevant to the statutory dealer definition as interpreted in the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release occurs with U.S. persons or otherwise within the United States, to
raise the types of concerns with respect to the U.S. financial system that Title VII was intended
to address, including stability, transparency, and counterparty protection. We continue to believe
that entities engaged in such activity at levels above the de minimis threshold may be expected to
raise these concerns and, therefore, warrant regulation under Title VII as security-based swap
dealers. Conversely, we do not believe that entities engaged in dealing activity wholly outside
the United States directly raise these types of concerns with respect to the U.S. financial system,
and our proposed approach would not require non-U.S. persons engaged in dealing activity
wholly outside the United States to register as security-based swap dealers.
We recognize that security-based swap activity outside the United States, including the
activity of foreign persons that engage in security-based swap dealing activity wholly outside the
United States, may affect the U.S. financial system either because the foreign person’s positions
are guaranteed by a U.S. person or through risk spillover effects that may arise from, for
example, counterparty defaults, asset fire sales, capital shortfalls, and asymmetric information
about the positions of unregistered persons active in the global network of security-based swap
market participants. However, to the extent that the risks presented by an entity engaged in
security-based swap dealing activity to the U.S. financial system arise solely from such
guarantees or from these spillover effects, rather than from the entity engaging in relevant
1402

See CDS Data Analysis.

1403

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30725 and n.1457. We stated that this
estimate of 50 security-based swap dealers that would be required to register was a
“conservative” estimate. See id. In establishing the de minimis threshold in that release, we
analyzed the percentage of the market activity that would likely be attributable to registered
security-based swap dealers under various thresholds and various screens designed to identify
entities that are engaged in dealing activity. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77
FR at 30636; CDS Data Analysis at 8-21. Our analysis placed particular weight on the screen
that identified entities that engaged in security-based swap transactions with three or more
counterparties that themselves were not identified as dealers by ISDA. See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30636. Twenty-eight firms and corporate groups
satisfied this criterion, and 25 of these entities also engaged in trading activity over the $3 billion
threshold. See id. Based on this analysis, together with our expectation that some of the included
corporate groups would register more than a single security-based swap dealer and that new
entrants may be likely to enter the market, we estimated that as many as 50 entities would
ultimately be required to register as a security-based swap dealer. See Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30725 n.1457.

activity within the United States, we preliminarily do not believe that Title VII dealer registration
provides the appropriate mechanism for addressing these risks.
As we have already discussed, we believe that Title VII’s dealer registration requirements
are intended to apply to those entities that pose risks to the U.S. financial system or to
counterparties in the United States or to the transparency of the U.S. financial market by virtue of
their dealing activity within the United States. To the extent that an entity engaged in dealing
activity wholly outside the United States poses risks to the U.S. financial system, we
preliminarily believe that subjecting it to dealer registration and the related requirements would
not generate the types of programmatic benefits that Title VII dealer regulation is intended to
produce, as the dealing activity of such entity poses risks to counterparties outside the United
States.
Our proposed Rule 3a71-3 identifies the types of transactions that U.S. persons and nonU.S. persons engaged in dealing activity within the United States, and that may therefore be
expected to raise Title VII concerns, must count toward their de minimis threshold. As described
above, 1404 because dealing activity engaged in by U.S. persons generally involves activity within
the United States and results in risks being borne by a person within the United States, proposed
Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(i) would require U.S. persons to count toward their de minimis threshold all
transactions that they enter into in a dealing capacity, regardless of the location or U.S.-person
status of the counterparty, including any such transactions that the dealing entity conducts
through a foreign branch. Similarly, as we discuss above, because security-based swap dealing
activity conducted entirely outside the United States with non-U.S. persons will generally not
give rise to the concerns addressed by security-based swap dealer regulation under Title VII
within the United States, proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)(1)(ii) would require non-U.S. persons to
include in their de minimis calculation only those transactions arising out of their dealing activity
with U.S. persons or otherwise conducted within the United States.
As discussed above, our proposed rule allows non-U.S. persons to exclude transactions
with foreign branches of U.S. banks from their de minimis threshold, if those transactions are
conducted outside the United States. 1405 Although requiring non-U.S. persons to count these
transactions toward the de minimis threshold would be consistent with the view that a foreign
branch is part of a U.S. person, we are proposing not to require non-U.S. persons to count these
transactions. As noted above, since U.S. banks are U.S. persons subject to certain exemptions,
foreign branches that engage in security-based swap activity will generally be subject to
applicable provisions of Title VII (e.g., mandatory clearing, mandatory trade execution, public
dissemination, and SDR reporting requirements) regardless of whether their non-U.S. person
counterparty is a registered security-based swap dealer. If a foreign branch engages in securitybased swap activity in a dealing capacity with non-U.S. persons outside the United States
exceeding the de minimis level, the bank (including the foreign branch) will be required to

1404

See Section III.B.3, supra.

1405

See Section III.B.7, supra.

425

register as a security-based swap dealer and the entire bank will be subject to the entity-level and
transaction-level requirements discussed above. 1406
The security-based swap transactions excepted from the de minimis calculation of nonU.S. persons take place outside the United States. Requiring non-U.S. persons to count these
transactions occurring in their foreign local markets could discourage non-U.S. persons from
transacting with foreign branches, which could increase the likelihood of market disruption and
fragmentation, including liquidity and order flow fragmentation, while decreasing the ability of
U.S. banks to access foreign markets and foreign liquidity. Therefore, we preliminarily believe
that the proposed approach to excepting non-U.S. persons’ transactions with foreign branches
outside the U.S. from the de minimis calculation would have the benefit of minimizing
disruption to U.S. banks’ access to foreign markets without significantly diminishing the benefits
that flow from Title VII dealer regulation and the proposed application of the de minimis
exception in the cross-border context.
As stated above, the most significant programmatic effects of the de minimis exception
result from how it changes the number of entities that are required to register as security-based
swap dealers. We preliminarily believe that under our proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the
Exchange Act, the number of entities that may have to register with the Commission may be
somewhat smaller than the upper bound of 50 that we estimated in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release and in any case should not exceed that previous estimate of 50 or fewer
entities. 1407 The entities that are not captured under our proposed approach would be those that
1406

See Sections III.C.3 and 4, supra.

1407

See note 1218, supra. After further experience with the data used in the CDS Data Analysis, we
have estimated the trading activity and number of counterparties of firms within a corporate
group, which allows us to conduct a more granular analysis of the potential number of entities
that will be required to register as security-based swap dealers. In the CDS Data Analysis, we
estimated that 28 entities and corporate groups had three or more counterparties that are not ISDA
dealers and that 25 of these entities had trailing notional transactions exceeding $3 billion. See
CDS Data Analysis at 14. Under our refined approach, which identifies the number of entities
within a corporate group that may have to register, we estimate that 46 individual firms have
three or more non-ISDA-dealer counterparties; of these, we estimate that 31 firms also engaged in
a total of $3 billion in worldwide security-based swap dealing activity during 2011. Of these
firms, we estimate that 27 also engaged in at least $3 billion of security-based swap activity
during 2011 that these entities would be required to count toward their de minimis threshold
under proposed Rule 3a71-3(b). We further estimate that the aggregation requirement for
unregistered dealers may result in an additional two firms being required to register, for a total of
29 security-based swap dealers based on the current structure of the security-based swap market.
We continue to believe that an estimate of 50 or fewer entities that would be required to register
with the Commission as security-based swap dealers is reasonable in light of this analysis. As
explained in note 1403 above, our estimate of as many as 50 potential registrants was consistent
with our analysis showing 25 entities that had both three or more non-ISDA-dealer counterparties
and $3 billion or more in trailing notional security-based swap transactions and our recognition of
the potential for growth in the security-based swap market, for new entrants into the dealing
space, and the possibility that some corporate groups may register more than one entity. Because

426

engage in security-based swap dealing activity entirely (or almost entirely) with non-U.S.
persons outside the United States.
We recognize that the U.S. market participants and transactions regulated under Title VII
are a subset of the overall global security-based swap market and that there may be spillover
risks arising from a foreign entity’s dealing activity outside the United States. This spillover risk
has the potential to affect the U.S. financial system either through that foreign entity’s
transactions with foreign entities, which, in turn, transact with U.S. persons (and may, as a result,
be registered security-based swap dealers or major security-based swap participants) or through
membership in a clearing agency which may be providing CCP services in the United States or
have a U.S. person as a clearing member. We have considered these spillover risks in
connection with discussing the effects of our proposed cross-border approach on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. 1408
(c) Major Security-Based Swap Participants—“Substantial Position” and
“Substantial Counterparty Exposure” Thresholds
Title VII requires a person with a “substantial position” or “substantial counterparty
exposure” in security-based swaps to register as a major security-based swap participant. As
described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, the substantial position and
substantial counterparty exposure tests prescribed by Rules 3a67-3 and 3a67-5 under the
Exchange Act seek to capture persons whose security-based swap positions pose sufficient risk
to counterparties and the markets generally, thus, warranting regulation as a major security-based
swap participant. 1409 Furthermore, based on a review of notional positions maintained in 2011
by entities with single-name CDS positions, the Commission estimated that approximately 12
entities may reasonably find it necessary to engage in the requisite calculations, and that the
number of major security-based swap participants likely will be fewer than five. 1410
As proposed, Rule 3a67-10(c) under the Exchange Act provides that when determining
whether a non-U.S. person falls within the major security-based swap participant definition, only
transactions entered into with a U.S. person 1411 as the counterparty would be considered. 1412
our current estimate of 29 firms that may be required to register as security-based swap dealers
includes individual entities within corporate groups (rather than treating corporate groups as a
single entity), it accounts for the possibility that some corporate groups may register more than
one security-based swap dealer. It also accounts for the likely results of our proposed aggregation
requirement. Further allowing for the possibility of additional new entrants and growth in the
security-based swap market, while also recognizing the possibility that our analysis overestimates
the volume of dealing activity (and thus likely dealers), we think that our analysis in this release
remains consistent with our earlier estimate of 50 or fewer entities.

1411

The proposed rule uses the same definition of “U.S. person” as developed in the context of
foreign security-based swap dealer registration. See Section III.B.5, supra.

427

Under this proposed rule, a non-U.S. person would calculate its security-based swap positions
under the major security-based swap definition based solely on its security-based swap
transactions with U.S. persons as counterparties (including foreign branches of U.S. banks), and
all security-based swap transactions with non-U.S. persons would be excluded from the analysis.
We recognize that there may be indirect spillover risks to the U.S. financial system resulting
from the security-based swap positions entered into by non-U.S. persons with other non-U.S.
person counterparties, but we preliminarily believe that such indirect risk may be more
appropriately regulated by the foreign regulatory authorities with responsibilities for such nonU.S. persons. Similar to the de minimis exception to dealer designation and registration, the
most significant programmatic effects of the application in the cross-border context of the major
participant thresholds flow from the number of entities that will fall within the definition of
major security-based swap participant given a particular threshold. Because non-U.S. persons
must count only transactions with U.S. counterparties toward the substantial position and
substantial counterparty exposure thresholds, the final number of registered major participants
may be lower than the preliminary upper bound of five estimated in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release.
We also are proposing interpretive guidance regarding the attribution of guaranteed
positions for purposes of the major security-based swap participant calculation. In the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we provided interpretive guidance that requires a
person that guarantees or otherwise provides direct recourse to an affiliate or guaranteed entity’s
security-based swap counterparties to include those transactions in its own major participant
calculations. 1413 We are proposing further guidance in this release regarding the application of
this interpretation in the cross-border context. As proposed, this guidance would require U.S.
persons that guarantee the obligations of a non-U.S. person’s security-based swap transactions to
count those transactions in their major participant calculations. Our proposed guidance also
would require a non-U.S. person to include in its calculations transactions of a U.S. person that it
guarantees and transactions entered into by a non-U.S. person with U.S. persons that it
guarantees. A non-U.S. person would not include in its calculation transactions it guarantees that
are entered into by a non-U.S. person with another non-U.S. person.
We preliminarily believe that this guidance identifies the guaranteed security-based swap
positions that are likely to pose risks to the U.S. financial system. Title VII envisions the
establishment of a comprehensive regulatory regime that will identify, monitor, and mitigate
risks to the U.S. financial system and protect counterparties in security-based swap transactions.
Our proposed application of the major securities-based swap participant calculation in the crossborder context, and related guidance, is designed to include only those market participants whose
security-based swap activity may directly affect the U.S. financial system in a manner relevant to
the concerns of Title VII.

1413

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30689.

428

With respect to U.S. persons that provide a guarantee, our proposed interpretive guidance
confirms that they must include in their major security-based swap participant calculations all
security-based swap transactions that they guarantee, regardless of the U.S.-person status of the
guaranteed person or the status of the counterparty to the transaction. Such interpretation is
consistent with the rules and interpretations adopted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release. We recognize that attributing security-based swap positions to the person guaranteeing
another person’s security-based swap transactions may increase the number of major participants
and therefore affect the programmatic benefits discussed above. As stated in the Intermediary
Definition Adopting Release, we do not currently possess data relating to the existence of
guarantees of the security-based swap positions of other parties and thus cannot reasonably
estimate the number of additional entities that may be brought within the ambit of major
security-based swap participant regulation by virtue of the interpretation related to
guarantees. 1414 However, to the extent that a guarantee provided by a U.S. person of the
security-based swap positions of another person, whether such other person is a U.S. person or a
non-U.S. person, creates the level of exposure—and corresponding risk to the U.S. guarantor and
the U.S. financial system—that warrants regulation under Title VII, it would appear inconsistent
with the purposes of the statute not to attribute all of the security-based swap positions
guaranteed by a U.S. person to such U.S. person and subject such U.S. person to major
participant regulation. 1415
Our proposed interpretive guidance regarding guarantees provided by non-U.S. persons
also is likely to have no effect on the programmatic costs and benefits of major security-based
swap participant regulation. The proposed guidance would allow non-U.S. persons to exclude
security-based swap positions guaranteed by them from their major security-based swap
participant calculations if the security-based swaps giving rise to the positions are entered into by
a non-U.S. person with another non-U.S. person. By contract, non-U.S. persons would be
required to include security-based swap positions guaranteed by them in their major securitybased swap participant calculations if the security-based swaps are entered into by a non-U.S.
person with a U.S. person. To the extent that any non-U.S. persons who guarantees securitybased swap positions with U.S. persons that do not rise to the major security-based swap
participant thresholds, they are unlikely to pose the types of risks addressed by the major
security-based swap participant definition, and, as a result, not requiring them to register should
not reduce the programmatic benefits that the major security-based swap participant definition
was intended to achieve.
As stated above, we do not currently possess data relating to the existence of guarantees
of the security-based swap positions of other parties and thus cannot reasonably estimate the
number of additional entities that may be brought within the ambit of major security-based swap
participant regulation by virtue of the interpretation related to guarantees. However, any nonU.S. person that is required to register under our proposed approach because of guarantees
extended to U.S. persons or to non-U.S. persons that have positions arising from transactions
1414

with U.S. persons would have security-based swap exposures of the nature and size that would
raise concerns that the major security-based swap participant requirements established by Title
VII were intended to address. We therefore preliminarily believe that the registration of such
persons as major security-based swap participants would increase the programmatic benefits of
our rule by ensuring that the risks presented by such entities to the U.S. financial system and
U.S. counterparties to such transactions are regulated under the framework established by Title
VII. Imposing Title VII on such entities would also increase programmatic costs, as such entities
would be required to comply with the substantive requirements of Title VII.
Moreover, where a non-U.S. person’s home country supervisor has adopted capital
standards consistent in all respects with the Capital Accord of the Basel Committee on Banking
Supervision (Basel Accord), to the extent that such non-U.S. person’s security-based swap
positions are guaranteed, we preliminarily believe that it is not necessary to attribute such
guaranteed security-based swap positions to the guarantor, regardless of the guarantor’s U.S.person status. To the extent that this proposed interpretive guidance reduces the number of
entities that would be required to register as major security-based swap participants as estimated
in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we preliminarily believe that it would not
significantly reduce the programmatic benefits expected under Title VII because the risk arising
from the guaranteed security-based swap positions posed to the United States, and that Title VII
was intended to address, would be addressed by the foreign regulation of the non-U.S. person’s
capital that is consistent with the Basel Accord. At the same time, excluding such entities from
the definition of major security-based swap participant would further reduce the programmatic
costs associated with the various requirements that apply to major security-based swap
participants.
2. Assessment Costs
(a) Security-Based Swap Dealers—De Minimis Exception
Because proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) explains how the dealer de minimis exception adopted
in Rule 3a71-2(a)(1) 1416 should be applied to cross-border dealing activity, the analysis of the
assessment costs relating to the proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) is closely related to the analysis of the
assessment costs relating to the dealer determination described in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release. 1417 Our proposed approach to the de minimis calculation in the cross-border
context would require potential registrants that are non-U.S. persons, in assessing the
applicability of Title VII’s dealer registration and regulation requirements, to apply the new
definitions of “U.S. person,” “transactions conducted within the United States,” and
“transactions conducted through a foreign branch,” which are used in Proposed Rule 3a71-3(b)
of the Exchange Act to identify transactions that should be included in the de minimis
calculation given the purposes of Title VII. Our proposed approach would also allow non-U.S.
persons to exclude from this assessment and the de minimis calculation security-based swap

430

transactions with a foreign branch of a U.S. bank, which would require them to make a separate
determination that a particular counterparty satisfies the definition of “foreign branch.”
As noted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, some market participants
whose security-based swap activities exceed, or are not materially below, the de minimis
threshold may be expected to incur assessment costs in connection with the dealer analysis. 1418
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated that 123 entities out of over
1,000 entities (U.S. and non-U.S.) that engaged in single-name CDS transactions in 2011 had
more than $3 billion in single-name CDS transactions over the previous 12 months. 1419 We also
assumed that the 43 entities that engaged in security-based swap activity during the trailing 12month period totaling between $2 and $3 billion notional may opt to engage in the dealer
analysis out of an abundance of caution or to meet internal compliance requirements, leading to a
total of 166 entities. 1420 We concluded that this estimate of 166 entities represented a potential
upper bound for the total assessment costs arising from security-based swap dealer
determinations. 1421 To the extent that all of these entities retain outside counsel to analyze their
status under the security-based swap dealer definition, including the de minimis exception, we
estimated that the assessment costs may approach $4.2 million.1422
In considering the assessment costs associated with the proposed Rule 3a71-3(b), we hold
the same expectation as we noted in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release that market
participants generally would be aware of the notional amount of their activity involving securitybased swaps as a matter of good business practice. However, as discussed below, proposed Rule
3a71-3(b) introduces a few variables that may result in higher overall assessment costs
associated with the dealer registration analysis for certain non-U.S. persons that may result in
different aggregate assessment costs for all entities performing this dealer analysis from the
figure that we estimated in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release.
Because non-U.S. persons would be required to count toward the dealer de minimis
threshold only those transactions they enter into, in a dealing capacity, with U.S. persons (other
than foreign branches of U.S. banks) or otherwise conducted within the United States, we believe
that such persons would likely implement systems to identify transactions that involve U.S.

1418

Id. at 30731. These assessment costs include costs associated with analyzing an entity’s securitybased swap activities to determine whether those activities constitute dealing activity and the
costs of monitoring the volume of dealing activity against the de minimis threshold.

persons or that are conducted within the United States 1423 and monitor the notional amount of
dealing activity reflected in such transactions. 1424 We preliminarily believe that the costs of
establishing a system capable of identifying the volume of transactions with U.S. persons or
within the United States should be similar to the costs estimated in the Intermediary Definitions
Adopting Release for a system to monitor positions for purposes of the major security-based
swap participant thresholds because such a system would involve monitoring the total volume of
an entity’s dealing transactions in a system capable of flagging those transactions that involve
U.S. persons or otherwise occur within the United States. We preliminarily believe that this
system would have similar functionality and requirements to the system that potential major
security-based swap participants would be likely to adopt in order to track their exposures for
purposes of the major security-based swap participant thresholds. In the Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, we noted that entities establishing such a system would likely
incur one-time programming costs of $15,287 and ongoing annual systems costs of $17,040. 1425

1424

Given the ability of non-U.S. persons under our proposed rule to exclude certain transactions
from their de minimis calculation, we expect that potentially all 166 of the entities identified in
our Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release as likely to perform the dealer analysis may
engage in analysis to determine whether they are U.S. persons. Because our proposed definition
of U.S. person is relatively straightforward to apply, we believe that any market participant
should be able readily to identify its U.S.-person status by referring to its residence status, its
principal place of business, or its organizational documents. To the extent that an entity seeks the
assistance of outside counsel, we expect that the cost of this analysis will be encompassed in the
$25,000 in assessment costs that we have estimated in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting
Release. See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30732.

1425

In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated that the one-time programming
costs of $13,692 per entity and annual ongoing assessment costs of $15,268. See Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30734-35 and accompanying text (providing an
explanation of the methodology used to estimate these costs). The hourly cost figures in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release for the positions of Compliance Attorney,
Compliance Manager, Programmer Analyst, and Senior Internal Auditor were based on data from
SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2010. For purposes of
the cost estimates in this release, we have updated these figures with more recent data as follows:
the figure for a Compliance Attorney is $310/hour, the figure for a Compliance Manager is
$269/hour, the figure for a Programmer Analyst is $234/hour, and the figure for a Senior Internal
Auditor is $217/hour, each from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities
Industry 2011, modified by SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by
5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead. We also have updated
the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release’s $464/hour figure for a Chief Financial Officer,
which was based on 2011 data. Using the consumer price index to make an inflation adjustment
to this figure, we have multiplied the 2011 estimate by 1.02 and arrived at a figure of $473/hour
for a Chief Financial Officer in 2012. Incorporating these new cost figures, the updated one-time
programming costs based upon our assumptions regarding the number of hours required in the

432

The Commission preliminarily believes that market participants would also incur costs
arising from the need to identify and maintain records concerning the U.S.-person status of their
counterparties and the location of their transactions. We anticipate that potential dealers are
likely to request representations from their transaction counterparties to determine the
counterparties’ U.S.-person status and whether the transaction was conducted within the United
States. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the assessment costs associated
with determining the status of counterparties and the location of transactions should be primarily
one-time costs of establishing a practice or compliance procedure of requesting and collecting
representations from trading counterparties and maintaining the representations collected as part
of the recordkeeping procedures and limited ongoing costs associated with requesting and
collecting representations. The Commission preliminarily believes that such one-time costs
would be approximately $15,160. 1426 The Commission preliminarily believes that requesting
and collecting representations would be part of the standardized transaction process reflected in
the policies and procedures described above regarding security-based swap sales and trading
practices and should not result in separate assessment costs. 1427
The Commission also considers it likely that market participants will implement
modifications to the system described above to monitor counterparty status for purposes of future
trading of security-based swaps. The Commission preliminarily believes that there would be
one-time programming costs associated with the system implementation by market participants

Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release would be $15,287 per entity, i.e., (Compliance
Attorney at $310 per hour for 2 hours) + (Compliance Manager at $269 per hour for 8 hours) +
(Programmer Analyst at $234 per hour for 40 hours) + (Senior Internal Auditor at $217 per hour
for 8 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $473 per hour for 3 hours) = $15,287, and the annual
ongoing costs would be $17,040 per entity, i.e., ((Senior Internal Auditor at $217 per hour for 16
hours) + Compliance Attorney at $310 per hour for 4 hours) + (Compliance Manager at $269 per
hour for 4 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $473 per hour for 4 hours) + (Programmer Analyst
at $234 per hour for 40 hours) = $17,040.
1426

This estimate is based on estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s time to
establish a procedure of requesting and collecting representations from trading counterparties,
taking into account that such representation may be built into form of standardized trading
documentation. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour-workyear and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead),
the staff estimates that the average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379.

1427

There will be ongoing costs associated with processing representations received from
counterparties, including additional due diligence and verification to the extent that a
counterparty’s representation is contrary to or inconsistent with the knowledge of the collecting
party. The Commission believes that these would be compliance costs encompassed within
programmatic costs associated with the security-based swap dealer definition.

433

to maintain a record of counterparty status for purposes of performing the dealer de minimis
calculation and estimates such programming costs to be $12,870. 1428
Based on the foregoing discussion, the Commission estimates the total one-time perentity costs for non-U.S. persons engaged in dealing activity within the United States associated
with the de minimis calculation would be $43,317. 1429 Estimated annual ongoing costs would be
$17,040. Based on available data provided by the DTCC-TIW, we preliminarily believe that as
many as 70 of the firms with over $2 billion in total worldwide notional trading activity in
single-name CDS during 2011 may be non-U.S. persons under our proposed rule and thus will
likely incur these costs. Assuming that each of these 70 entities perceived the need to monitor
the status of its counterparties and the location of its transactions to perform the dealer de
minimis calculation, we preliminarily believe that the total annual one-time industry-wide costs
associated with establishing such systems would amount to $3,032,190. Total annual ongoing
costs would amount to $1,192,800.
In addition to assessment costs discussed above associated with determining the volume
of U.S.-facing transactions, market participants would also incur assessment costs relating to
performing the analysis as to whether certain security-based swaps involve dealing activity. At
the same time, some non-U.S. persons that establish such systems may be expected to forgo the
costs of performing the dealing activity analysis. As noted above, we assumed in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release that only entities with more than $2 billion in
security-based swap transactions over the previous 12 months would be likely to engage in the
full dealer analysis. We believe that it similarly is unlikely that non-U.S. persons with less than
$2 billion in U.S.-facing security-based swap transactions over the previous 12 months would
engage in the dealer analysis. Available data from the Trade Information Warehouse shows that
39 of these 70 non-U.S. persons had total U.S.-facing security-based swap transactions under $2
billion in 2011. We preliminarily believe that, under our proposed rule, these entities would not
engage in the full dealer analysis and thus would not be likely to incur the $25,000 in assessment
1428

This is based on an estimate of the time required for a programmer analyst to modify the software
to track the U.S. person status of a counterparty and to record and classify whether a transaction
is a transaction conducted within the United States, including consultation with internal
personnel, and an estimate of the time such personnel would require to ensure that these
modifications conformed to proposed definitions of U.S. person and transaction conducted within
the United States. Using the estimated hourly costs described above, we estimate the costs as
follows: (Compliance Attorney at $310 per hour for 2 hours) + (Compliance Manager at $269 per
hour for 4 hours) + (Programmer Analyst at $234 per hour for 40 hours) + (Senior Internal
Auditor at $217 per hour for 4 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $473 per hour for 2 hours) =
$12,870. See note 1425, supra (for source of the estimated per hour costs).

1429

The estimated one-time costs of $43,317 represent the costs for programming a system to monitor
the dealing activity of a non-U.S. person ($15,287), the costs for programming a system to
monitor the U.S.-person status of its counterparties and the location of its dealing activity
($12,870), and the costs for establishing a practice or compliance procedure of requesting and
collecting representations from trading counterparties and maintaining the representations
collected as part of the recordkeeping procedures ($15,160).

434

costs described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, reducing the estimated
assessment costs in that release by approximately $975,000. The combined effect of our
proposed rule on non-U.S. persons, therefore, should result in a net increase in assessment costs
over those estimated in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release of approximately
$2,057,190. 1430
(b) Major Security-Based Swap Participants—“Substantial Position” and
“Substantial Counterparty Exposure” Thresholds
Proposed Rule 3a67-10(c) and the proposed interpretive guidance regarding the
attribution of guaranteed positions, which is discussed below, together identify the securitybased swap positions that entities would be required to include in determining whether they
exceed the major security-based swap participant thresholds that were established in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. We preliminarily believe that entities that perceive
the need to perform the threshold calculations associated with the major security-based swap
definition will incur only relatively minor incremental costs to those described in the
Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release as a result of our proposed rule and interpretive
guidance applying these thresholds in the cross-border context.
In the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated that certain market
participants could be expected to incur costs in connection with the determination of whether
they have a “substantial position” in security-based swaps or pose “substantial counterparty
exposure” in connection with security-based swaps in connection with their determination as to
whether or not they are a major security-based swap participant. 1431

1430

As noted above, in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, we estimated total annual onetime industry-wide costs associated with the dealer analysis to be $4.2 million. See note 1422,
supra. According to the analysis above, non-U.S. persons are likely to incur additional annual
one-time industry-wide costs of $3,032,190 associated with new systems to monitor the volume
of dealing activity, while annual one-time industry-wide costs associated with the dealing activity
analysis may decline by $975,000. We therefore estimate the annual one-time industry-wide
costs associated with the dealer analysis for both U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons to be
$6,257,190 ($4,200,000 + $3,032,190 - $975,000 = $6,257,190), or $2,057,190 more than our
initial estimate of $4.2 million.
We have not separately estimated the assessment costs that market participants may incur
associated with identifying the special entity status of their counterparties. The Intermediary
Definitions Adopting Release noted that the de minimis threshold for dealing activity involving
special entities would cause market participants to incur costs independent of those associated
with the general de minimis threshold based on the CDS Data Analysis, which showed that all
entities engaged in security-based swap transactions with special entities appeared to also engage
in more than $8 billion in security-based swap transactions in 2011. See CDS Data Analysis at
21 n.8 and Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30732 n.1510.

1431

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30734-36.

435

Based on the data available at that time, we estimated that as many as 12 entities might
perceive the need to perform these calculations, given the size of their security-based swap
positions.1432 We further estimated that each of these entities would likely incur annual one-time
costs of $15,287 and ongoing annual costs of $17,040 in monitoring these positions and
performing the necessary calculations. 1433
Our proposal would require non-U.S. persons to include in these calculations only
transactions they enter into directly with, or that they guarantee, that involve U.S.-person
counterparties. As noted above, Proposed Rule 3a67-10(c) would require a non-U.S. person that
performs the major security-based swap participant calculation to identify the U.S.-person status
of its counterparties. Our proposed interpretive guidance would further clarify that a non-U.S.
person must include in its calculation all transactions of other entities that it guarantees where a
U.S. person has direct recourse to the non-U.S. person performing the major security-based swap
participant calculation. 1434 A non-U.S. person performing this calculation would therefore be
required to identify the U.S.-person status of its counterparties, and the counterparties of
transactions it guarantees, and monitor the positions arising from transactions involving U.S.
person as counterparties.
The Commission preliminarily believes that market participants would request
representations from their transaction counterparties to determine the U.S. person status of their
counterparties. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the one-time assessment
costs associated with the counterparty status should be limited to the costs of establishing a
practice or compliance procedure or requesting and collecting representations from trading
counterparties and maintaining the representations collected as part of the recordkeeping
procedures. The Commission preliminarily believes that such assessment costs would be
approximately $15,160. 1435
1432

See Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release, 77 FR at 30734.

1433

See note 1425, supra.

1434

Our proposed interpretive guidance also would clarify that U.S. persons performing the major
security-based swap participant calculation must include all positions entered into by other parties
where it guarantees the transaction. Because this interpretive guidance would not change the
scope of the transactions that a U.S. person must consider in performing this calculation, we do
not expect it to have any effect on the assessment costs incurred by such persons.

1435

This estimate is based on estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s time to
establish a procedure of requesting and collecting representations from trading counterparties,
taking into account that such representation may be built into form of standardized trading
documentation. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff
estimates that the average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379.
Similar to our analysis of the assessment costs associated with the de minimis exception relating
to the definition of the security-based swap dealer, we preliminarily believe that requesting and
collecting representations would be part of the standardized transaction process reflected in the

436

The Commission also considers it likely that market participants will implement systems
to keep track of counterparty status for purposes of future trading of security-based swaps. The
Commission preliminarily believes that there would be one-time programming costs associated
with the system implementation by market participants to maintain a record of counterparty
status for purposes of assessing the major security-based swap participant status and estimates
such programming costs to be $12,870. 1436 Therefore, the Commission estimates the total onetime costs per entity associated with the proposed Rule 3a67-10(c) and the interpretive guidance
regarding guarantee could be $28,030. 1437 This is in addition to the estimate of ongoing annual
costs of $17,040 associated with performing the major security-based swap participant threshold
calculations and the one-time programming costs of $15,287 related to establishing an automated
system or modifying the existing automated system to perform the major participant threshold
calculations as described in the Intermediary Definitions Adopting Release. 1438
Request for Comment
The Commission generally requests comment about our preliminary estimates of the
number and composition of dealing entities and major participants that may be required to
register as security-based swap dealers as a result of the proposed application of the de minimis
exception in the cross-border context. The Commission also requests comments about our
estimates of the effect of our proposed approach on programmatic costs and benefits and

policies and procedures described above regarding security-based swap sales and trading
practices. There would be ongoing costs associated with processing representations received
from counterparties, including additional due diligence and verification to the extent that a
counterparty’s representation is contrary to or inconsistent with the knowledge of the collecting
party. The Commission believes that these costs would be compliance costs encompassed within
programmatic costs associated with the major security-based swap participant definition.
1436

This is based on an estimate of the time required for a programmer analyst to modify the software
to track the U.S. person status of a counterparty and to record and classify whether a transaction
is a transaction conducted within the United States, including consultation with internal
personnel, and an estimate of the time such personnel would require to ensure that these
modifications conformed to proposed definitions of U.S. person and transaction conducted within
the United States. Using the estimated hourly costs described above, we estimate the costs as
follows: (Compliance Attorney at $310 per hour for 2 hours) + (Compliance Manager at $269 per
hour for 4 hours) + (Programmer Analyst at $234 per hour for 40 hours) + (Senior Internal
Auditor at $217 per hour for 4 hours) + (Chief Financial Officer at $473 per hour for 2 hours) =
$12,870. For the source of the estimated per hour costs. See note 1263, supra.

1437

The $28,030 per entity cost is derived from $15,160 cost of establishing a written compliance
policy and procedures regarding obtaining counterparty representations and plus $12,870 onetime programming cost relating to system implementation to maintain counterparties
representations and track the U.S. person status of each counterparty in the system.

Are the Commission’s estimates regarding the number of U.S.-person and non-U.S.
persons active as dealers in security-based swaps, both in the United States and
worldwide, and the number of these that engage in security-based swap dealing
transactions above the de minimis threshold reasonable in light of the proposed rule?
Are the Commission’s estimates of assessment costs associated with the dealer
registration analysis, including the costs associated with the determination of the
status of counterparties as U.S. persons, non-U.S. persons, foreign branches and the
costs associated with the determination of transactions conducted within the United
States reasonable?
Are the Commission’s estimates of the number of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons
whose security-based swap positions may rise to the major security-based swap
participant level reasonable, both in the United States and worldwide?
Are the Commission’s estimates of the number of U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons
whose security-based swap positions may be attributed to other persons because of
guarantees and whether such attribution may result in such persons becoming major
security-based swap participants reasonable?
Is the Commission’s estimate that the revisions included in re-proposed Form SBSE
and re-proposed Form SBSE-A would not significantly impact the costs and benefits
associated with the rules and forms to facilitate registration accurate?
Has the Commission accurately explained the relationship between the proposed
application of the dealer de minimis threshold (including the definition of U.S.
person) and the programmatic effects and the programmatic costs and benefits of our
dealer definition?
Has the Commission appropriately accounted for the programmatic benefits and costs
of subjecting (or not subjecting) certain entities to the security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant requirements under the proposed approach?
Does the Commission’s analysis of the proposed treatment of non-U.S. persons who
are guaranteed by U.S. persons adequately reflect the expected programmatic costs
and benefits associated with this treatment?
Has the Commission properly analyzed the programmatic costs and benefits
associated with requiring U.S. persons to include dealing activity conducted through a
foreign branch in their dealer de minimis calculations?
Has the Commission properly analyzed the programmatic costs and benefits
associated with permitting non-U.S. persons not to count dealing transactions with a
foreign branch toward their de minimis threshold?
Is the Commission’s estimate of the assessment costs associated with determining
whether one falls within the security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant definitions accurate? Do the Commission’s estimates reflect reasonable
assumptions about the types of systems that would be necessary to perform the
required analyses?
Does the Commission’s estimate of assessment costs appropriately reflect the cost to
an entity of determining its U.S.-person status? Does it appropriately reflect the cost
438

•

of determining whether its counterparty is a U.S. person or is engaging in a
transaction conducted within the United States?
Has the Commission accurately estimated the costs associated with identifying and
maintaining records concerning the U.S.-person status of counterparties and the
location of transactions?
3. Alternatives Considered
(a) De Minimis Exception

As stated above, market participants, foreign regulators and other interested parties have
provided views on the application of Title VII requirements in the cross-border context through
written comment letters (on other proposed rulemakings by the Commission and on the crossborder interpretive guidance proposed by the CFTC) and meetings with the Commission and our
staff. 1439 In particular, commenters have provided their views on how the term “U.S. person”
should be defined and how the de minimis exception in the security-based swap dealer definition
should be applied in the cross border context. 1440 These comments have been informative in the
Commission’s development of our proposed approach to the application of the de minimis
exception in the cross-border context, and our understanding of the economic consequences of
the proposed U.S. person definition and the proposed de minimis exception. In this section, we
briefly describe our analysis of the economic impact of these alternative approaches suggested
by the commenters.
i.

Alternatives to the Proposed Definition of U.S. Person

The proposed definition of U.S. person plays a central role in the application of Title VII
in the cross-border context. It directly affects the number of entities that will have to register as
security-based swap dealers: a potential security-based swap dealer performing its de minimis
calculation must first determine its own U.S.-person status and then, if it is a non-U.S. person,
identify the U.S.-person status of its counterparties in transactions arising out of its dealing
activity. 1441 We also propose to use the U.S. person definition in determining the applicability of
certain transaction-level requirements under Title VII. 1442 As a result, the U.S. person definition
in the proposed rule directly affects the scope of the application of Title VII requirements to the

1439

See Section I, supra.

1440

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 2, 6-9; Davis Polk Letter I at 6 n.6.

1441

See proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section III.B.3, supra.

1442

See Sections VIII - X, supra (discussing the application of the reporting and public dissemination
of security-based swap information, mandatory clearing, and mandatory trade execution
requirements). As further discussed in these sections, the U.S. person definition plays a
significant role in determining whether a particular transaction is subject to transaction-level
requirements.

439

cross-border security-based swap market and, in particular, the number of entities that will be
required to register as security-based swap dealers. 1443
As explained above, our proposed definition of U.S. person is designed to identify those
market participants whose security-based swap activity may be particularly likely to affect the
U.S. market in a manner relevant to the concerns of Title VII or that may warrant the protections
of Title VII. In our view, the security-based swap activity of a person that has its place of
residence, incorporation, or its principal place of business within the United States may be
particularly likely to warrant the application of Title VII because its security-based swap activity
is likely to result in risks being borne by the person within the United States or because its
activity raises other concerns that Title VII is intended to address, such as the stability or
transparency of the U.S. financial system or the protection of counterparties. Consistent with
this view, we have proposed a definition of U.S. person that looks to the location of the person’s
residence, incorporation, or principal place of business.
In developing our proposed definition of U.S. person, we have considered two alternative
definitions: One suggested by commenters, and one proposed by the CFTC in its own crossborder guidance proposal. 1444 In the discussion that follows, we briefly describe these
alternatives and the related benefits and costs. A more in-depth analysis of the programmatic
costs and benefits of these alternatives will continue in the following sections, in which we
analyze the role that these definitions play in the specific application of our proposed approach to
the de minimis calculations to different types of entities.
Several commenters suggested that we consider the definition of U.S. person found in
Regulation S of the Securities Act, noting that at least some market participants would find the
definition familiar and easy to apply. 1445 As explained above, we declined to take this approach
because we believe that the U.S. person definition in Regulation S addresses specific concerns
associated with the offshore offering of unregistered securities that are different from the
concerns of Title VII. 1446 Regulation S, among other things, provides safe harbors for offshore
offerings of unregistered securities, and a central concern of Regulation S is ensuring that

1443

See Section XV.C.1, supra (discussing economic analysis of the proposed de minimis exception).

1444

See, e.g., Cleary Letter IV at 2; SIFMA Letter at 5; see also CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR
at 41218) (discussing the definition of U.S. person proposed by the CFTC).

1445

See SIFMA Letter at 5. Regulation S provides, among other things, certain safe harbors
regarding registration requirements as they relate to the offshore offering of securities. See
Offshore Offers and Sales, Final Rules, 55 FR 18306 (May 2, 1990). Under Regulation S, an
entity’s U.S.-person status is a relevant factor in determining whether certain of the safe harbors
are available to a specific offering or sale of securities. See 17 CFR § 230.902(o) (defining “U.S.
person”).

1446

See Section III.B.4, supra.

440

unregistered securities offered abroad do not come to rest within the United States. 1447 Given
this concern, the definition of U.S. person used in the Regulation S safe harbors appropriately
focuses on the location of the person making the decision to purchase unregistered securities. 1448
On the other hand, as already noted, Title VII addresses the potential impact of swap and
security-based swap transactions on the stability of the U.S. financial system, market
transparency, and counterparty protection. 1449 In this context and in light of the nature of the risk
arising from such transactions, the location of the person making the decision to enter into a
security-based swap appears to us to be less relevant than the location of the person bearing the
risk of the transaction. For example, as discussed further below, if the definition of U.S. person
in Regulation S were used to determine whether a potential security-based swap dealer should be
registered or whether a security-based swap should be subject to Title VII transaction-level
requirements, a dealer may not be required to register as a security-based swap dealer based on
its dealing activity conducted through its foreign branch, despite the fact that such transactions
generally create the same risks for the dealing entity as any other security-based swap activity
that it conducts directly from its headquarters. Excluding foreign branches from the definition of
U.S. person could result in U.S. banks engaging in significant levels of security-based swap
dealing activity, and bearing the risk of such activity, entirely outside the requirements of Title
VII, including the registration requirements. This result would reduce the programmatic benefits
that the Title VII security-based swap dealer definition or the security-based swap dealer
registration requirement is intended to achieve, which are to subject to regulation those dealing
entities that we believe are likely, by virtue of engaging in dealing activity within the United
States, to pose risk to the U.S. financial system that Title VII was intended to regulate. 1450
Therefore, the definition of U.S. person in Regulation S, with its focus on the location of the
person making the investment decision and not on the person bearing the risk of the transaction,
is ill-suited to address these types of concerns.
We also considered the interpretation of U.S. person proposed by the CFTC in its crossborder interpretive guidance. 1451 The CFTC definition resembles our proposed definition in
many respects, as it also focuses on the location of the person bearing the risk of the transaction.
However, we have declined to include in our proposed definition certain categories of entities (or
1447

See Regulation S Adopting Release, 55 FR at 18308. Whether securities come to rest in the
United States or abroad is relevant to whether the interests served by the registration requirement
are affected by the securities offering.

1448

See 17 CFR § 230.902(o).

1449

See note 4, supra.

1450

Similarly, under the definition of U.S. person in Regulation S, certain dealers may not be required
to register as a security-based swap dealer based on their dealing activity with an investment
manager located outside the United States who manages a discretionary account on behalf of a
U.S. person, even though the resulting transactions are with that U.S. person and that U.S. person
bears the risk arising out of that transaction.

1451

their equivalent in the security-based swap market) that the CFTC has defined as U.S. persons.
Most significant of these are (i) entities “in which the direct or indirect owners thereof are
responsible for the liabilities of such entity and one or more of such owners is a U.S. person”; (ii)
certain investment vehicles, wherever organized or incorporated, “of which a majority ownership
is held, directly or indirectly, by a U.S. person;” and (iii) certain investment vehicles “the
operator of which would be required to register as a commodity pool operator with the
CFTC.” 1452 The Commission has preliminarily determined not to include within the definition of
“U.S. person” any entity that is not resident, organized, or incorporated within the United States
or does not have its principal place of business in the United States, regardless of any ownership
interest by a U.S. person.
We are proposing this approach because we preliminarily believe that Title VII is
primarily concerned about security-based swap activity that raises the types of concerns—
including the stability of the U.S. financial system, swap market transparency, and counterparty
protection—within the United States that Title VII was intended to address. 1453 If U.S. residents
or U.S.-based entities suffer losses from their investments in investment vehicles or their
investments in entities organized, incorporated, or having the principal place of business located
outside the United States, such losses are generally limited to their investments in the form of
equity or debt securities. Such investment risks are not related to security-based swaps, and the
protection of U.S. investors with respect to investments in equity, debt securities, or investment
vehicles, as well as investment management or investment advisory activity, is addressed by
other provisions of U.S. securities law pertaining to issuances and offerings of equity or debt
securities.
Therefore, the Commission does not believe that it would advance the programmatic
benefits of Title VII to include foreign entities or foreign investment vehicles in the U.S. person
definition because U.S.-based entities or U.S. residents own them or because a U.S.-based entity
is responsible for the foreign entities’ liabilities (as proposed by the CFTC). Furthermore, given
our focus on reducing risk to, and promoting transparency in, the U.S. security-based swap
market, we do not think the U.S.-person status of a commodity pool operator or fund adviser (as
opposed to the fund actually entering into the transaction) is in itself relevant in determining
whether security-based swap activity occurs within the United States and should therefore be
subject to the full range of Title VII requirements because those entities do not bear the risk of
the transactions. 1454
1452

1453

See Section III.B.3, supra. As noted above, we do not believe that Title VII’s security-based
swap dealer registration requirements are the appropriate mechanism for addressing the potential
for spillover effects caused by non-U.S. persons that engage in security-based swap dealing
activity or other security-based swap activity wholly outside the United States.

1454

We also note that, to the extent that the commodity pool operator or fund advisor enters into a
security-based swap transaction that is conducted within the United States, Title VII would
generally apply to that transaction. See proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(5) under the Exchange Act
(defining “transaction conducted within the United States”), as discussed in Section III.B.5,

442

Finally, the Commission preliminarily believes that the alternative definition of U.S.
person in Regulation S and the definition of U.S. person proposed by the CFTC would likely
cause potential security-based swap dealers and end users to incur higher assessment costs. For
example, Regulation S classifies accounts differently depending on whether they are
discretionary or non-discretionary, 1455 while our proposed definition would focus on the status of
the counterparty to a security-based swap transaction. 1456 The Regulation S definition specifies
the U.S. person status of more types of entities than does our proposed definition and would
introduce a level of complexity into the definition that is not relevant to the purposes of Title VII.
Similarly, the CFTC’s proposed interpretation likely would increase assessment costs compared
to our proposed definition by, for example, requiring investment funds or their counterparties to
determine the U.S.-person status of the direct and indirect owners of such funds. It may be
operationally costly and otherwise impracticable to identify the indirect ownership of an
investment vehicle given the legal structure of the investment vehicle and the beneficial
ownership in book-entry form, and it is unnecessary as those entities bear risks only to the
amount of their investment (as opposed to the open-ended risks that can be associated with
security-based swap positions). We expect that this complexity could significantly raise
assessment costs for market participants.
Based on the above, we preliminarily believe that our proposed definition appropriately
focuses on the types of entities that are likely to be actively engaged in the security-based swap
market and on the specific categories of such entities whose security-based swap activity has the
potential to impact the U.S. financial system. We do not believe that following either the
Regulation S approach or the CFTC’s proposed interpretation would achieve the benefits of Title
VII. We also believe that either approach would result in higher assessment costs. 1457

supra. However, proposed Rules 3Ca-3(b)(2) and 3Ch-1(b)(2) would not apply the mandatory
clearing and mandatory trade execution requirements to transactions between two non-U.S.
persons who are not security-based swap dealers and whose performances under security-based
swaps are not guaranteed by a U.S. person, even though such transactions are conducted in the
United States.

1456

Proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7)(iii) under the Exchange Act (defining an account as a U.S. person by
looking at the status of the account holder or owner), as discussed in Section III.B.4, supra.

1457

We will discuss the relative costs and benefits of these alternatives in more detail in the context of
our analysis of alternatives to proposed rules that use the U.S. person definition in the following
sections.

443

ii.

Alternatives to the Proposed Rule Regarding Application of the De
Minimis Exception

As described above, our proposal also includes a proposed rule regarding the application
of the de minimis exception in the cross-border context. 1458 This rule prescribes how a person’s
transactions arising out of its dealing activity must be included in its de minimis calculation,
depending on whether it is a U.S. person or non-U.S. person. The definition of U.S. person,
described above, is central to this rule, as it is used to identify both the status of the person
engaged in security-based swap dealing activity and, with respect to a non-U.S. person engaged
in dealing activity, the status of its counterparties in transactions connected to dealing activity.
In this section, we will describe certain alternatives to our proposed application of the de
minimis exception and explain how these alternatives would have affected the programmatic
costs and benefits of Title VII. Some of these alternatives have been considered in our
discussions of the U.S. person definition.
a. Calculation of U.S. Persons’ Transactions for De Minimis
Exception
Our proposed approach would require a U.S. person to count toward the de minimis
threshold all transactions it enters into in a dealing capacity, including those it conducts through
a foreign branch, regardless of the location of the counterparty to the transaction. 1459 Some
commenters suggested that the Commission lacks the authority to subject the dealing activity of
a foreign branch of a U.S. bank to Title VII, including our registration requirements, to the extent
that it does business only with counterparties that are not U.S. persons outside the United
States. 1460 As noted above, commenters generally took the view that the Commission should
consider using the Regulation S definition of U.S. person for purposes of applying the de
minimis exception in the cross border context, as Regulation S specifically excludes from its
definition of U.S. person foreign branches of U.S. banks. 1461 Presumably, under the approach
suggested by some commenters, the headquarters of a U.S. bank would be designated a U.S.
person, whereas each of its foreign branches would be classified as a separate non-U.S. person
for purposes of Title VII.
For the reasons already noted above, 1462 we are not proposing to follow this approach.
Because of the nature of the risks posed by security-based swaps, which are borne by the entire
legal entity even if the transaction is entered into by a foreign branch of such entity, consistent
with the Commission’s approach to the meaning of “person” in the security-based swap dealer

definition, as discussed above, 1463 we are proposing to define the term “U.S. person” to include
the entire entity, including its foreign branches. In addition, such separation is inconsistent with
the focus in Title VII on the effect of a person’s dealing activity on the U.S. financial system,
including the risks such person bears as a result of its dealing activity. Although we recognize
that certain U.S.-based banks have chosen to conduct some or all of their foreign security-based
swap business through foreign branches, 1464 we preliminarily believe that, given Title VII’s goal
of addressing potential dealing risk to the U.S. financial system caused by security-based swap
dealing activity, the de minimis exception should apply to all security-based swap dealing
activity of a person that has its principal place of business within, or is incorporated or organized
within, the United States, regardless of which part of such person carries out such dealing
activity wherever its counterparties are located, even if elements of that activity occur outside the
United States.
We preliminarily believe that the alternative approach suggested by commenters could
reduce the programmatic benefits of security-based swap dealer registration under Title VII and
the ensuing substantive requirements applicable to registered security-based swap dealers if the
de minimis calculation for U.S. persons engaged in dealing activity does not include the entire
volume of such persons’ dealing activity. Drawing a distinction between the branches, desks, or
offices of a U.S. person and the entity as a whole would be inconsistent with the fact that the
U.S. person as a whole bears the risk of all security-based swap transactions that it enters into,
including those transactions conducted through a foreign branch or office with non-U.S. person
counterparties located outside the United States. 1465
Even if the headquarters of a U.S. bank were already registered by virtue of its own
security-based swap dealing activity in the United States, the commenters’ suggested approach
would presumably allow the same bank, through its foreign branches, to engage in unlimited
dealing activity with non-U.S. persons outside the United States without registering those
branches. 1466 We do not view such disparate regulatory treatment of two parts of the same legal
entity to be consistent with the purposes of Title VII, particularly given that this approach would
appear to place entirely outside the scope of regulation under Title VII transactions that pose
risks to a U.S. bank that are indistinguishable from those arising from transactions done directly
from the home office of that bank. 1467 We believe that excluding transactions conducted through
1463

See Section III.B.4, supra.

1464

See Sections II.A.2 and III.B.6, supra (discussing the dealing structures used by U.S.-based
entities).

1465

See Section II.A.3, supra (discussing the example of AIG FP).

1466

For example, treating the branch differently may remove the branch entirely from Title VII’s
rules. This could prevent regulation of capital adequacy and other risk mitigating requirements,
even though all of the risk from the transaction is residing within the entity as a whole, creating
risk for the U.S. financial system.

1467

Security-based swap activity conducted through a foreign branch poses risks to the entire entity to
which the branch belongs that are generally indistinguishable from those posed by security-based
swap activity conducted through an office. The experience of AIG FP demonstrates that the

445

foreign branches from the de minimis calculations would not achieve the programmatic benefits
intended by the Title VII requirements because it would leave unaddressed risks associated with
security-based swap dealing activity that occurs within the United States and therefore raises the
types of concerns with respect to the U.S. market that Title VII’s dealer requirements were
intended to address.
b. Calculation of Non-U.S. Persons’ Transactions for De Minimis
Exception (including transactions conducted within the United
States)
Our proposed application of the de minimis exception to non-U.S. persons engaged in
security-based swap dealing activity would require them to include in their de minimis
calculations any transactions with U.S. persons or any transactions otherwise conducted within
the United States, to the extent they are entered into in a dealing capacity. Given the focus on
Title VII on the stability and transparency of the U.S. financial system and the protection of
counterparties, 1468 we preliminarily believe that it is appropriate to require non-U.S. persons that
engage in dealing activity within the United States and therefore are likely to raise these types of
concerns to count such dealing activity toward their de minimis thresholds. To the extent that
the aggregate notional amount of transactions arising from a non-U.S. person’s dealing activity
involving U.S. persons or otherwise conducted within the United States exceeds the de minimis
threshold in the trailing 12-month period, we would require a non-U.S. person to register as a
security-based swap dealer.
In developing our proposed application of the de minimis threshold to non-U.S. persons,
we have considered alternatives suggested by commenters or proposed by the CFTC. We
declined to incorporate these alternatives into our approach.
Some commenters suggested that a non-U.S. person that engages in dealing activity with
U.S.-person counterparties through an affiliated U.S. intermediary should be permitted to register
in a limited capacity or should not be required to register as a security-based swap dealer. 1469
Specifically, some commenters suggested that the Commission adopt an approach that is
modeled on the Commissions’ existing regimes, permitting non-U.S. security-based swap dealers
to transact with U.S. persons without registering in the United States if those transactions are
intermediated by a U.S.-registered security-based swap dealer. 1470
security-based swap activity of a foreign office can lead to the default of the entire entity. See

22 (“Accordingly, as one alternative, we suggest that the Commissions adopt an approach that is

We preliminarily believe that the above alternative suggested by commenters would
potentially reduce the programmatic benefits intended by Title VII. To the extent that a non-U.S.
person engages in security-based swap dealing entirely with U.S. persons or within the United
States, that person’s security-based swap activity raises the concerns that security-based swap
dealer regulation under Title VII intends to address: First, the entity’s dealing activity raises
customer protection concerns, which the external business conduct standards and segregation
requirements of Title VII are intended to address; second, the entity’s dealing activity raises
financial responsibility concerns, which Title VII’s entity-level requirements applicable to
registered security-based swap dealers are intended to address; finally, the entity’s dealing
activity raises transparency, regulatory oversight, counterparty risk and systemic risk concerns,
which Title VII intends to address through its regulatory reporting, public reporting, mandatory
clearing, and mandatory trade execution requirements. Although the Commission recognizes
that some of these concerns might be addressed by regulating the intermediary, as in the brokerdealer context, we preliminarily believe that only if the non-U.S. person dealer itself is subject to
Title VII would it be possible to address the entire range of concerns that Title VII dealer
regulation is intended to address. 1471
The CFTC has proposed that non-U.S. persons that are guaranteed by U.S. persons be
required to include in their de minimis calculation all transactions carried out in a dealing
capacity with any counterparty, wherever that counterparty is located, just as a U.S. person
acting in a dealing capacity would be required to do. 1472 As discussed above, the Commission
recognizes that such guarantees of the security-based swap transactions of non-U.S. persons may
pose risk to the U.S. financial system; however, the Commission does not believe that the
security-based swap dealer regulation in Title VII is the appropriate vehicle for regulating the
dealing activity of non-U.S. persons occurring outside the United States with other non-U.S.
persons. 1473 As discussed above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the risk posed to
the U.S. markets by the dealing activity of non-U.S. persons outside the United States whose
performance under security-based swaps is guaranteed by a U.S. person does not necessarily
raise the full range of concerns that Title VII dealer regulation is intended to address. Such
activity may give rise to security-based swap positions that raise concerns within the United
States that are relevant to the purposes of Title VII if those positions are large enough to affect
the stability of the institution providing the guarantee and potentially the stability of the U.S.
financial system more generally. This risk, however, arises from attribution of security-based
swap positions to the guarantor due to the guarantee rather than the dealing activity per se. In
these circumstances, we preliminarily believe that the risks relating to these positions warrant
modeled on the Commissions’ existing regimes, permitting non-U.S. swap dealers to transact
with U.S. persons without registering in the U.S. if those transactions are intermediated by a U.S.registered swap dealer. This would be consistent with the approach adopted by the SEC under
Rule 15a-6 and prior interpretative precedents with respect to non-U.S. securities dealers.”).

registration only to the extent that the positions exceed the thresholds established for major
security-based swap participant registration. 1474
In light of the foregoing, we do not believe that requiring a non-U.S. person that is
guaranteed by a U.S. person to count every transaction entered into in a dealing capacity toward
its de minimis threshold and to register as a security-based swap dealer even if it engaged in no
dealing activity with U.S. persons or otherwise within the United States would materially
increase the programmatic benefits of the dealer registration requirements. Although it is likely
that such an approach would cause more entities to register as dealers than does our proposed
approach, to the extent that these entities were required to register as security-based swap dealers
even though they engaged in dealing activity only with non-U.S. persons outside the United
States, we preliminarily believe that this alternative would impose programmatic costs on these
entities without a corresponding increase of the programmatic benefits to the U.S. security-based
swap markets that are intended by the security-based swap dealer requirements in Title VII, as
we do not believe that the dealing activity of such persons (to the extent that it involves only
non-U.S. counterparties outside the United States) raises the types of concerns within the United
States that Title VII dealer registration was intended to address.
Another alternative to our proposed approach would be not to require non-U.S. persons
that engage in dealing activity with other non-U.S. persons through transactions conducted
within the United States to include such transactions in their de minimis calculations. 1475 As
noted above, Title VII is intended to promote accountability and transparency in the U.S.
financial system, 1476 and to do so, it is necessary to ensure that security-based swap dealing
activity that occurs within the United States is subjected to the requirements of Title VII, 1477
including those related to external business conduct protections and other transaction-level
requirements. Even if a non-U.S. person located outside the United States is engaging in dealing
activity with non-U.S. persons located in the United States, it is, among other things, providing
liquidity in the U.S. security-based swap market and thus engaging in dealing activity within the
United States. Excluding such dealing activity from Title VII would reduce the programmatic
benefits of security-based swap dealer regulation because it would reduce the transparency of the
U.S. market and deprive counterparties within the United States of the protections of Title VII.
We recognize that the ultimate programmatic benefits discussed here associated with the
application of the security-based swap dealer regulation in the cross-border context would be
affected by the substantive rules adopted by the Commission. The Commission is reopening the
comment periods for our outstanding rulemaking releases that concern security-based swaps and

Exchange Act, as amended by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act.
iii.

Aggregation of affiliate dealing activity

Our proposed rule regarding the application of the de minimis exception in the crossborder context also requires a U.S. person who enters into security-based swap transactions in a
dealing capacity, or non-U.S. person who enters into security-based swap transactions with U.S.
persons or transactions conducted within the United Sates in a dealing capacity, to count toward
such person’s de minimis threshold certain transactions of its affiliates. Specifically, such
persons would be required to include in the de minimis calculation the notional amount of (1) the
transactions entered into in a dealing capacity by all of their commonly controlled affiliates who
are U.S. persons and (2) the transactions with U.S. persons or transactions conducted within the
United States entered into in a dealing capacity by all of its commonly controlled affiliates who
are non-U.S. persons. However, such calculation would exclude any affiliate that is a registered
security-based swap dealer if such person who relies on the de minimis exception maintains
separate operations independent of any affiliate who is a registered security-based swap dealer
and does not involve, or act in concert with, any affiliate that is a registered security-based swap
dealer in any stage of a security-based swap transaction that arises out of its dealing activity. 1478
In developing this rule, we considered the approach proposed by the CFTC, which we
understand to permit non-U.S. persons to aggregate only the transactions carried out in a dealing
capacity by their commonly controlled affiliates that are also non-U.S. persons, rather than
including all such transactions by all commonly controlled affiliates, wherever located. As noted
above, 1479 we declined to follow the CFTC’s proposal in part out of concern that doing so could
confer competitive advantages on affiliated corporate groups that engage in security-based swap
dealing activity through both U.S. and foreign affiliates by allowing them to operate with an
effective de minimis threshold twice higher than the threshold applicable to security-based swap
dealers operating solely within the United States or solely in one or more foreign-based affiliates.
We recognize that our approach may require some persons to register that might not be
required to register under the CFTC’s approach and thus would impose programmatic costs on
those entities that they might not otherwise incur. It may also require more firms to engage in
assessment, as even those with activity levels far below the threshold will probably perform
these calculations, if they are part of a larger corporate family with a number of security-based
swap dealers. However, we believe that those corporate groups operating a centralized booking
model or centralized risk management should be able to have the central booking entity or
central risk management location perform the de minimis aggregation calculation for the entire
1478

See proposed Rule 3a71 under the Exchange Act. This approach is consistent with the
aggregation requirement described in the Intermediary Definitions Release. See Intermediary
Definitions Release, 77 FR at 30631 (requiring aggregation of dealing activity by commonly
controlled affiliates for purposes of de minimis calculation).

1479

See Section III.B.4.(c), supra.

449

corporate group. For purposes of this analysis, we have assumed that corporate groups are likely
to perform such assessments centrally. 1480
We preliminarily conclude that our proposed application of the aggregation requirement
to the de minimis calculation in the cross-border context is appropriate in light of the purposes of
Title VII and of dealer regulation in particular. The aggregation requirement is designed to
discourage evasion of the dealer registration requirement by a corporate group by engaging in
large volumes of dealing activity through multiple affiliates, none of which engages in activity
exceeding the de minimis threshold. 1481 Therefore, we have preliminarily determined that a
corporate group’s dealing activity should be considered as a whole.
Similarly, to be entitled to rely on the de minimis exception, an unregistered affiliate
within a corporate group must have an independent operation separate from any affiliate who is a
registered security-based swap dealer and must not act in concert with the registered affiliate in
any stage of a security-based swap transaction. The Commission preliminarily believes that this
requirement would have the benefit of preventing evasion.
(b) Major Security-based Swap Participants
Several commenters suggested that foreign government-related entities, such as
sovereign wealth funds and multilateral development institutions, should be excluded from the
major security-based swap participant definition. 1482 By potentially capturing fewer major
security-based swap participants, this alternative approach would correspondingly decrease the
programmatic costs and benefits associated with Title VII regulation of major security-based
swap participants. We preliminarily believe that security-based swap transactions entered into
by these types of foreign government-related entities with U.S. persons pose the same risks to the
U.S. security-based swap markets as transactions entered into by entities that are not foreigngovernment related. Moreover, as noted above, 1483 based upon our conversations with market
participants we understand that foreign government-related entities rarely enter into securitybased swap transactions (as opposed to other types of swap transactions) in amounts that would
trigger the obligation to register as a major security-based swap participant. Therefore, we
preliminarily believe that the proposed approach considering only security-based swap
transactions entered into with a U.S. person as counterparty in determining a non-U.S. person’s

1480

We understand, based on comment letters and our staff’s discussion with market participants, that
many market participants keep a global swap book and operate a central booking model. See,
e.g., Cleary Letter I at 9. If this is not the case with respect to a particular market participant, then
the number of entities that need to perform the de minimis calculation would increase. The
Commission currently does not have available information with respect to the number of market
participants active in the security-based swap market that utilize a central booking model.

status as a major security-based swap participant, regardless of whether such non-U.S. person is
a foreign government-related entity, is more appropriately tailored to the objectives of Title VII.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comments on all aspects of the economic analysis of the
alternatives to the proposed definition of U.S. person, the proposed application of the de minimis
exception and the proposed application of the major security-based swap participant definition in
the cross-border context. The Commission requests that commenters provide data and sources of
data to support any comments. In addition, the Commission requests commenters’ views on the
following:
•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the costs and benefits associated with
adopting the definition of U.S. person found in Regulation S? If not, please explain
why and provide information on how such costs and benefits should be assessed.

•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the costs and benefits associated with
adopting the same definition of U.S. person as proposed by the CFTC? If not, please
explain why and provide information on how such costs and benefits should be
assessed.

•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the costs and benefits associated with
adopting a rule to permit foreign branches of U.S. banks to exclude transactions
conducted through a foreign branch from their de minimis calculations? If not, please
explain why and provide information on how such costs and benefits should be
assessed.

•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the costs and benefits associated with
not requiring a non-U.S. person to count its transactions conducted within the United
States with non-U.S. persons towards its de minimis threshold? If not, please explain
why and provide information on how such costs and benefits should be assessed.

•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the costs and benefits associated with
requiring a non-U.S. person whose performance under security-based swaps is
guaranteed by a U.S. person to count all transactions connected to its security-based
swap dealing activity toward its de minimis threshold, even though such non-U.S.
person only conducts dealing activity with non-U.S. persons outside the United
States? If not, please explain why and provide information on how such costs and
benefits should be assessed.

•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the costs and benefits associated with
the proposed rule regarding aggregation of security-based swap transactions entered
into in a dealing capacity by a person and its affiliates under common control and
requiring that such aggregated notional amount be included in such person’s de
minimis calculation? If not, please explain why and provide information on how such
costs and benefits should be assessed. Should the Commission require operational
451

independence, from the cost and benefit point of view, as a condition to excluding
transactions of an affiliate that is a registered security-based swap dealer from a
person’s de minimis calculation?
•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the costs and benefits associated with
excluding foreign government-related entities, such as sovereign wealth funds and
multilateral development institutions, from the definition of major security-based
swap participant? If not, please explain why and provide information on how such
costs and benefits should be assessed.

•

Should the Commission take into account the potential impact of the Push-Out Rule
and the Volcker Rule in considering the approach to application of the Title VII
requirements to foreign branches of the U.S. banks? For example, what would the
costs and benefits be with respect to requiring foreign branches of U.S. banks to
include transaction conducted through a foreign branch in its de minimis calculation,
or requiring a non-U.S. person to include its transactions with foreign branches in its
major security-based swap participant calculation, after taking into account the effects
of the Push-Out Rule and the Volcker Rule on U.S. banks? Please explain how such
costs and benefits should be assessed.

E. Economic Analysis of the Proposed Application of the Entity-Level and Transaction-Level
Requirements to Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants
As stated above, persons who fall within the statutory definitions of security-based swap
dealer and major security-based swap participant, as further defined by the rules adopted in the
Intermediary Definition Adopting Release, will be required to register with the Commission and
comply with a host of ensuing substantive requirements. 1484 These requirements include entitylevel requirements 1485 and transaction-level requirements 1486 set forth in Sections 15F and 3E of
the Exchange Act and rules and regulations thereunder. 1487
1. Entity-Level Requirements
Section 764(a) of the Dodd Frank Act adds a new Section 15F(e) to the Exchange Act,
which imposes capital and margin requirements on security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants. 1488 These requirements are designed to reduce the probability
of these institutions’ failure, mitigate the consequences of these institutions failures, protect

customer assets, and contribute to the stability of the security-based swap market in particular
and the U.S. financial system more generally. 1489 The benefits of the capital and margin
requirements for security-based swap dealers are expected to include enhancing protection of
customer assets and mitigation of the consequences of a firm failure, while allowing securitybased swap dealers appropriate flexibility in how they conduct their security-based swaps
business. 1490 Similarly, the benefits of the capital and margin requirements for major securitybased swap participants are expected to include neutralization of the credit risk between a major
security-based swap participant and a counterparty, which would lessen the impact on the
counterparty if the major security-based swap participant failed. 1491 We believe the capital and
margin requirements strengthen the financial system by reducing the potential for defaults by
entities engaging in security-based swap activity and mitigating the impact of such defaults,
including the adverse spillover or contagion effect of a default by security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants. 1492
In addition, registered security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants are required to establish robust risk management systems adequate for managing
their day-to-day business, 1493 keep books and records and maintain daily trading records of the
security-based swaps they enter into, 1494 establish internal systems and controls, 1495 diligently
supervise the security-based swap business, 1496 designate a chief compliance officer, 1497 and
keep books and records open to inspection and examination by the Commission. 1498

These spillover effects could create instability for the financial markets more generally, such as
by limiting the willingness of market participants to extend credit to each other, and thus
substantially reduce liquidity and valuations for particular types of financial instruments. See,

The programmatic costs and benefits associated with the entity-level requirements
applicable to security-based dealers and major security-based swap participants under Title VII
are (or will be) addressed in more detail in connection with the applicable rulemakings
implementing Title VII. 1499
With respect to the application of the entity-level requirements in the cross-border
context, as stated above, the Commission preliminarily believes that it would be consistent with
the objective of Title VII to ensure the safety and soundness of registered security-based swap
dealers 1500 to require foreign security-based swap dealers to comply with the entity-level
requirements. 1501 Similarly, the Commission preliminarily does not believe that foreign major
security-based swap participants should be excluded from the application of any entity-level
requirements. 1502 However, the Commission recognizes the concerns raised by commenters
regarding the possibility that foreign security-based swap dealers may be subject to conflicting or
duplicative regulatory requirements and proposes to mitigate the costs associated with the
potential duplicative compliance obligations through the Commission’s proposed approach to
substituted compliance. 1503 We have considered the effect of the proposed rules regarding
substituted compliance on its effect on efficiency, competition and capital formation above 1504
and will discuss the economic considerations of the proposed rules regarding substituted
compliance more fully below. 1505
Alternative
The CFTC proposed to treat Title VII margin requirements with respect to non-cleared

they transact swaps with non-U.S. person counterparties whose performance obligations under
the swaps are not guaranteed by U.S. persons. 1506 The prudential regulators’ margin proposal
does not apply Title VII margin requirements to a foreign covered swap entity 1507 with respect to
foreign non-cleared swaps or foreign non-cleared security-based swaps. 1508 In practice, the
Commission’s proposed treatment of the margin requirements as an entity-level requirement
differs from the CFTC’s and the Prudential regulators’ proposals in that non-bank foreign
security-based swap dealers (regardless of whether their performance of obligations under
security-based swaps are guaranteed by U.S. persons) would be subject to the margin
requirements with respect to their transactions with non-U.S. person counterparties whose
performance obligations under the security-based swaps are not guaranteed by U.S. persons.
The Commission could have taken the CFTC’s approach to treat margin requirements as
transaction-level requirements by proposing not to apply margin to non-bank foreign securitybased swap dealers with respect to their transactions with non-U.S. person counterparties whose
performance obligations under the security-based swaps are not guaranteed by U.S. persons. We
also could have taken the prudential regulators’ approach by proposing not to apply margin to
foreign non-bank security-based swap dealers that are not controlled by a U.S. person with
respect to their transactions with non-U.S. person counterparties whose performance obligations
under the security-based swaps are not guaranteed by U.S. persons. Either approach would not
treat margin as an entity-wide requirement.

A “foreign covered swap entity” is defined as any entity prudentially regulated by the prudential
regulators and required to register as a swap dealer, major swap participant, security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant under section 4s of the Commodity Exchange Act
or section 15F of the Exchange Act that (i) is not a company organized under the laws of the
United States or any State; (ii) is not a branch or office of a company organized under the laws of
the United States or any State; (iii) is not a U.S. branch, agency or subsidiary of a foreign bank;
and (iv) is not controlled, directly or indirectly, by a company that is organized under the laws of
the United States or any State. See Prudential Regulator Margin and Capital Proposal, 76 FR at
27581.

1508

A “foreign non-cleared swap or foreign non-cleared security-based swap” is defined as a noncleared swap or non-cleared security-based swap with respect to which: (i) The counterparty to
the foreign covered swap entity is not a company organized under the laws of the United States or
any State, not a branch or office of a company organized under the laws of the United States or
any State, and not a person resident in the United States; and (ii) performance of the
counterparty’s obligations to the foreign covered swap entity under the swap or security-based
swap has not been guaranteed by an affiliate of the counterparty that is a company organized
under the laws of the United States or any State, a branch of a company organized under the laws
of the United States or any State, or a person resident in the United States. See Prudential
Regulator Margin and Capital Proposal, 76 FR at 27581.

for non-cleared security-based swaps. 1509 The margin requirements established by the
Commission with respect to non-cleared security-based swaps will operate in tandem with
mandatory clearing provisions in the Dodd-Frank Act. 1510 Registered clearing agencies that
operate as CCPs manage credit and other risks through a range of controls and methods,
including prescribed margin rules for their participants. 1511 Thus, the mandatory clearing
requirements in effect will establish margin requirements for cleared security-based swaps and,
thereby, complement the margin requirements for non-cleared security-based swaps established
by the Commission and the prudential regulators. 1512
In addition, margin requirements, along with the capital standards and segregation
requirements, are an integral part of the proposed financial responsibility requirements for
security-based swap dealers that are intended to enhance the financial integrity of these
entities. 1513 The margin requirements proposed by the Commission are intended to work in
tandem with the capital requirements to strengthen the financial system by reducing the potential
for default to an acceptable level and limiting the amount of leverage that can be employed by
security-based swap dealers and other market participants. 1514 For example, with respect to
cleared security-based swaps, for which margin requirements will not be established by the
Commission, the Commission proposed a capital charge that would apply if a nonbank securitybased swap dealer collects margin collateral from a counterparty in an amount that is less than
the deduction that would apply to the security-based swap if it was a proprietary position of the
non-bank security-based swap dealer. 1515 In addition, the Commission proposed capital charges
to address exceptions from the margin collection requirements with respect to non-cleared
security-based swaps, as an alternative to margin collateral by requiring a non-bank security-

transaction subject to the clearing mandate to post initial and variation margin to the CCP in
connection with that transaction.”).

based swap dealer to hold sufficient net capital to enable it to withstand losses if a counterparty
defaults. 1516
In the context of the statutory framework and the Commission’s proposed financial
responsibility program for non-bank security-based swap dealers, if the Commission were to
treat margin as a transaction-level requirement and apply margin to certain non-cleared
transactions but not others, any credit risk of such other transactions that are not collateralized by
mutually agreed contractual arrangement between a security-based swap dealer and its
counterparty would need to be addressed by imposing capital charges, which would increase the
amount of net capital a non-bank security-based swap dealer is required to set aside. While the
increased liquid capital would provide an additional buffer for a non-bank security-based swap
dealer to withstand losses resulting from a default of its counterparties, it also would increase
business costs. Depending on the size of a foreign security-based swap dealers’ foreign business
that is not collateralized, the size of the increased amount of the capital charge may be very
large. As discussed in the Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, if security-based
swap dealers are required to maintain an excessive amount of capital, that amount may result in
certain costs for the markets and the financial system, including the potential for the reduced
availability of security-based swaps for market participants who would otherwise use such
transactions to hedge the risks of their business, or engage in other activities that would promote
capital formation. 1517 End users also may incur increased transaction costs in connection with
the increased capital charges as security-based swap dealers are likely to pass on the financial
burden of any increased capital requirements to customers. 1518 If the transaction costs are too
high, end users may seek other cheaper alternatives, such as cleared security-based swaps or
voluntary collateral posting to reduce transaction pricing, or they may decide not to transact
security-based swaps at all.
In the cross-border context, the Commission is proposing not to apply the mandatory
clearing requirement to transactions between a foreign security-based swap dealer and non-U.S.
person counterparties whose performance obligations under security-based swaps are not
guaranteed by U.S. persons. Therefore, a foreign security-based swap dealer’s exposure to
counterparty credit risk arising from its transactions with these non-U.S. person counterparties
would not be addressed by the Title VII mandatory clearing requirement. If margin requirements
do not apply to these transactions, the counterparty credit risk arising from such transactions may
be left uncollateralized. In the event that non-U.S. counterparties experience financial
difficulties, and the foreign security-based swap dealer’s uncollateralized exposures to such
counterparties have grown exponentially due to severe market movement, the uncollateralized
foreign credit exposures may jeopardize the safety and soundness of the foreign security-based
swap dealer, whose failure would have negative impact on the U.S. security-based swap market
and present risk to the U.S. financial system. Such uncollateralized credit risk could be
addressed by imposing capital charges under the Commission’s proposed capital rule, but taking

this approach would result in increased costs and higher barrier for new foreign entrants into the
U.S. security-based swap market. To mitigate the cost of increased capital charges, a foreign
security-based swap dealer may choose to enter into credit support arrangements and request
some or all counterparties to post collateral. This would be particularly the case when a foreign
security-based swap dealer is transacting in a foreign market where collateral posting is a
common market practice to manage counterparty credit risk or in a foreign jurisdiction that
imposes margin requirements because the foreign security-based swap dealer would encounter
less resistance to posting margin from foreign counterparties. To the extent that the costs of
capital charges drive foreign security-based swap dealers to voluntarily collateralize their
exposures to counterparty credit risks, the differences in the economic consequences between
treating margin as an entity-level requirement as opposed to a transaction-level requirement
would narrow.
By contrast, under the proposed approach, the counterparty credit exposures arising from
a foreign non-bank security-based swap dealers transactions with non-U.S. persons whose
performance of obligations under non-cleared security-based swaps are not guaranteed by U.S.
persons would be collateralized but the collateral would not be segregated. 1519 The collateral
received would protect the foreign security-based swap dealer against the default risk of the
foreign counterparty and reduce the probability of the failure of the foreign security-based swap
dealer and the spillover and contagion risk of a foreign counterparty’s default that may impact
the U.S. financial system. In addition, such collateral could finance the business needs of the
foreign security-based swap dealer and increase its liquidity. The Commission preliminarily
believes that the proposed treatment of margin as an entity-level requirement would generate the
benefit of offsetting the greater risk to the foreign security-based swap dealer and the U.S.
financial system arising from the use of non-cleared security-based swaps and help ensure the
safety and soundness of the security-based swap dealers 1520 without imposing excessive capital
charges at the same time, which may raise the barrier for foreign dealers to enter the U.S.
security-based swap market. The proposed treatment of margin also may increase funds
available to finance a foreign security-based swap dealers’ business activity, which would
decrease the borrowing needs and lower the costs of business.
Commenters raised concerns about the potential costs and burdens of applying
duplicative margin collection requirements to foreign transactions. 1521 The Commission
1519

A foreign security-based swap dealer that is not a registered broker-dealer would not be required
to segregate assets held as collateral received from a non-U.S. person counterparty with respect to
non-cleared security-based swap transactions. A foreign security-based swap dealer that is a
registered broker-dealer would be required to segregate margin collateral received from all
counterparties. See proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(1) under the Exchange Act and discussion in Section
III.C.4(b).ii, supra.

preliminarily believes that the costs of complying with duplicative margin requirements can be
addressed by the proposed substituted compliance framework. As stated in our cost and benefit
analysis with respect to substituted compliance below, the Commission preliminarily believes
that substituted compliance would not substantially change the programmatic benefits intended
by the entity-level requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act, including margin
requirements; however, to the extent that substituted compliance eliminates duplicative
compliance costs, registered foreign security-based swap dealers that are eligible for a
substituted compliance determination may incur lower programmatic costs associated with
implementation or compliance with the specified Title VII requirements (including margin
requirements). 1522
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comments on all aspects of the economic analysis of the
alternatives to the proposed definition of U.S. person, the proposed application of the de minimis
exception and the proposed application of the major security-based swap participant definition in
the cross-border context. The Commission requests that commenters provide data and sources of
data to support any comments. In addition, the Commission requests commenters’ views on
particular issues below. Responses that are supported by empirical data and analysis provide
great assistance to the Commission in considering the economic consequences of the proposed
treatment of certain requirements as entity-level and other requirements as transaction-level
requirements.

2. Transaction-Level Requirements
With respect to the application of these transaction-level requirements to security-based
swap dealers active in the cross-border context, the Commission proposes Rule 3a71-3(c) under
the Exchange Act regarding application of customer protection requirements to security-based
swap dealers, 1523 Rule 18a-4(e) regarding application of segregation requirements to foreign
security-based swap dealers, 1524 Rule 3a67-10(b) regarding application of customer protection
requirements to foreign major security-based swap participants, 1525 and Rule 18a-4(f) regarding
application of segregation requirements to foreign major security-based swap participants. 1526 In
the following sections, we discuss the economic considerations of these proposed rules regarding
application of transaction-level requirements to security-based swap dealers or major securitybased swap participants in the cross-border context.
(a) Proposed Rule 3a71-3(c) – Application of Customer Protection Requirements
Title VII imposes certain external business conduct requirements on registered securitybased swap dealers that govern their interactions with counterparties to security-based swap
transactions. 1527 These provisions are intended to protect the counterparties of registered dealers
in such transactions by ensuring that security-based swap dealers, among other things, provide
adequate disclosures to their counterparties about the risks of the transaction. 1528
Proposed Rule 3a71-3(c) provides that registered security-based swap dealers, with
respect to their Foreign Business, shall not be subject to the requirements relating to business
conduct standards described in Section 15F(h) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, other than Section 15F(h)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations
thereunder. We are proposing to define “Foreign Business” as security-based swap transactions
entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on behalf of a foreign security-based swap dealer
or a U.S. security-based swap dealer in a dealing capacity that are not its “U.S. Business.” 1529

“U.S. Business” would be defined separately for foreign security-based swap dealers and
U.S. security-based swap dealers. With respect to a foreign security-based swap dealer, “U.S.
Business” would include any transaction entered into, or offered to be entered into, by or on
behalf of such foreign security-based swap dealer, with a U.S. person (other than a foreign
branch), or any transaction conducted within the United States. 1530 With respect to a U.S.
security-based swap dealer, “U.S. Business” would include any transaction by or on behalf of the
U.S. security-based swap dealer, wherever entered into or offered to be entered into, other than a
transaction conducted through a foreign branch with a non-U.S. person or another foreign
branch. 1531 With the exception of the exclusion of transactions conducted through a foreign
branch from the definition of a U.S. security-based swap dealer’s U.S. Business, these definitions
closely track the application of the de minimis exception to the transactions of U.S. persons and
non-U.S. persons under proposed Rule 3a71-3(b) under the Exchange Act. Moreover, whether a
transaction occurs within the United States or with a U.S. person, which are key elements of the
Foreign Business and U.S. Business definitions, would turn on the same factors that are used to
determine whether the de minimis exception applies to the security-based swap activity of a nonU.S. person engaged in dealing activity. 1532
In the External Business Conduct Standards Proposing Release, we have considered the
expected benefits and costs of the proposed rules regarding external business conduct standards
as they apply to dealers generally, and we expect to discuss the benefits and costs associated with
the final rules in our adopting release. In the proposing release, we noted that these rules may be
expected to benefit security-based swap dealers and other market participants in a number of
ways. For example, the requirement for security-based swap dealers to provide a daily mark
should enable counterparties to have a clearer picture of their relationship with security-based
swap dealers, including by providing a meaningful reference point for calculating variation
margin. 1533 Similarly, our proposed rules regarding security-based swap dealers’ obligations to
know their counterparties may be expected to help ensure that security-based swap dealers
recommend only transactions that are appropriate to the needs and resources of their
counterparties. 1534 Proposed rules regarding the standards of conduct in transactions involving
special entities should likewise help ensure that such business is awarded on the merits of the
transaction. 1535

We also noted that the proposed external business conduct rules would be likely to
impose certain costs on security-based swap dealers and other market participants. For example,
they would require security-based swap dealers to make various disclosures and establish
systems for monitoring compliance with these requirements. 1536
Because this proposing release does not change the substantive external business conduct
requirements but only potentially reduces the number of registered security-based swap dealers
and the number of transactions involving registered security-based swap dealers that would be
subject to the external business conduct requirements, our discussion below focuses on how
proposed Rule 3a71-3(c) affects the scope of application of these rules. This change in scope
will directly affect the resulting programmatic benefits and costs. We also discuss the
assessment costs associated with distinguishing Foreign Business from U.S. Business.
i.

Programmatic Benefits and Costs

Our proposed rules may affect the programmatic costs and benefits associated with
requirements regarding external business conduct standards in two ways. First, we are proposing
rules regarding application of the de minimis exception in the cross-border context that may be
expected to reduce the number of non-U.S. persons that would otherwise be required to register
as security-based swap dealers. 1537 Because the business conduct and conflict-of-interest rules
apply only to registered dealers, reducing the number of registered dealers would reduce the
number of entities required to comply with these dealer-specific rules. Second, we are proposing
not to require foreign or U.S. security-based swap dealers to comply with requirements relating
to external business conduct standards with respect to their Foreign Business, which would
reduce the proportion of registered dealers’ transactions that are required to comply with these
rules. We preliminarily believe that these proposed rules will not significantly affect the
programmatic benefits of the rules but should reduce programmatic costs that they impose on
market participants.
As already noted, Title VII is concerned directly with risk to the U.S. financial system,
transparency, and the protection of investors, 1538 and we preliminarily believe that our proposed
approach to applying requirements related to external business conduct standards is consistent
with these goals. As noted above in our discussion of the programmatic costs and benefits
associated with our application of the de minimis exception in the cross-border context, we
believe that our proposed approach to the de minimis calculation appropriately identifies those
entities whose dealing activity poses the type of stability, transparency, and counterpartyprotection concerns that Title VII is intended to address. 1539 To the extent that the number of
entities required to comply with these requirements relating to external business conduct
standards decline because the number of registered foreign security-based swap dealers declines,

within the United States falls below the de minimis threshold raise concerns no different from
those posed by U.S. security-based swap dealers whose security-based swap activity falls below
the threshold. We see no reason, therefore, for treating these two types of entities differently.
We also preliminarily believe that our proposal not to require compliance with these
requirements with respect to Foreign Business, even if a security-based swap dealer is registered,
will have an insignificant effect, if any, on programmatic benefits and should reduce
programmatic costs. We recognize that our proposed rule would not require foreign and U.S.
security-based swap dealers to comply with these rules with respect to a significant proportion of
their transactions. However, because Title VII is directed to the promoting the stability of the
U.S. financial system and protecting counterparties, we do not believe that this proposed
approach would reduce the programmatic benefits of our regulatory framework, given that such
transactions, including any customer-facing activity, occur entirely or in significant part outside
the United States where the parties typically do not expect U.S. customer-protection
requirements to apply. At the same time, our definition of U.S. Business should ensure that
registered dealers are required to comply with these requirements in their transactions with those
counterparties that are entitled to protection in light of the purposes of Title VII or that
reasonably expect to be protected in their dealings with registered security-based swap dealers.
We preliminarily believe that our proposed approach will reduce programmatic costs for
registered security-based swap dealers generally in proportion to their relative volume of Foreign
Business, although certain of the costs associated with policies and procedures established to
comply with these requirements are likely to remain fairly constant to the extent that a securitybased swap dealer has any U.S. Business. Permitting security-based swap dealers to enter into
transactions arising out of their Foreign Business without complying with these requirements
should reduce the costs of compliance with Title VII for such registered security-based swap
dealers and reduce the competitive effects of the Title VII dealer requirements by reducing
unnecessary disparities between registered and unregistered security-based swap dealers in their
foreign business.
ii.

Assessment Costs

The assessment costs associated with the proposed rules regarding these requirements
would primarily flow from the determination of whether a given transaction is part of a
registered security-based swap dealer’s U.S. Business or its Foreign Business. Both for U.S. and
foreign security-based swap dealers, “U.S. Business” is defined to capture largely the same
transactions that these entities are required to calculate in determining whether they are required
to register as security-based swap dealers. 1540 Because of this overlap with the information
1540

The sole exception is that, for U.S. security-based swap dealers, transactions conducted through a
foreign branch, which would be counted toward the U.S. person’s de minimis threshold, would
not be treated as U.S. Business for purposes of applying the external business conduct
requirements.

463

needed to perform the de minimis calculation, the incremental costs of these determinations for
registered security-based swap dealers should be minimal. We preliminarily believe that a
registered foreign security-based swap dealer would not incur additional assessment costs above
those already incurred in establishing and maintaining a system to identify and monitor the status
of its counterparties and transactions for purposes of the de minimis calculation, as described
above. 1541
U.S. security-based swap dealers would likely not have incurred these types of systems
costs in performing the de minimis calculation because our proposed approach would require
U.S. persons to count all of their dealing transactions toward their de minimis threshold.
However, U.S. security-based swap dealers who conduct some or all of their security-based swap
business through foreign branches and seek to rely on the Foreign Business exception to the
external business conduct requirement would likely establish a similar system to identify such
transactions. We believe that the costs of such a system would closely track the costs associated
with the systems that non-U.S. persons are likely to establish to perform the dealer de minimis
calculation and to determine whether a foreign security-based swap dealer must comply with
Title VII external business conduct requirements, as described above, as U.S. security-based
swap dealers conducting business through a foreign branch will also need to classify their
counterparties and transactions in order to determine whether external business conduct
requirements apply. 1542 Based on a review of DTCC-TIW data relating to single-name credit
default swap activity in 2011, there were no more than five U.S. security-based swap dealers that
conducted dealing activity through foreign branches. Assuming that all such entities elected to
establish a system to identify their Foreign Business, the total assessment costs associated with
our proposed rule would be approximately $85,200 in one-time annual programming costs and
$76,435 in ongoing annual costs. 1543
iii.

Alternatives

The Commission’s proposed approach to the application of the requirements relating to
external business conduct standards is similar to the CFTC’s proposed approach in certain
aspects but differs from the CFTC’s proposed approach in other aspects. With respect to U.S.
security-based swap dealers, both the Commission’s and the CFTC’s proposed approaches would
not apply the requirements relating to external business conduct standards to such U.S. securitybased swap dealers’ transactions conducted through a foreign branch outside the United States
with non-U.S. person counterparties. 1544 On the other hand, with respect to foreign security1541

See Section XV.D.2, supra.

1542

See Section XV.D.2(a), supra.

1543

As noted above in connection with the calculation of the de minimis threshold by foreign
security-based swap dealers, we estimate the per-entity one-time annual programming costs to
total approximately $17,040 and the per-entity ongoing annual costs to total $15,287. See note
1425, supra.

1544

See CFTC Cross-Border Proposal, 77 FR at 41230 and the text accompanying note 116.
However, the CFTC’s cross-border proposal did not address whether external business conduct

464

based swap dealers, the Commission’s proposed approach would apply the requirements relating
to external business conduct standards to such foreign security-based swap dealers’ transactions
conducted within the United States with all counterparties and transactions conducted outside the
United States with foreign branches while the CFTC’s proposed approach would not apply
external business conduct standards to non-U.S. swap dealers’ swap transactions with non-U.S.
person counterparties even though such transactions are conducted within the United States. 1545
The Commission could have proposed an approach to the application of the external
business conduct standards that is the same as the CFTC’s but instead, is proposing a territorial
approach with a focus on counterparty protection in the United States. The Commission
preliminarily believes that imposing external business conduct standards on U.S. security-based
swap dealers with respect to their transactions conducted outside the United States through
foreign branches would cause U.S. security-based swap dealers to incur compliance costs with
respect to their foreign business 1546 conducted through foreign branches, which would not be
incurred by foreign security-based swap dealers when foreign security-based swap dealers
conduct security-based swap transactions outside the United States in foreign markets.
The Commission recognizes that non-bank U.S. security-based swap dealers who do not
conduct transactions through foreign branches would be subject to the external business conduct
standards with respect to all transactions, including transactions with non-U.S. persons. The
Commission preliminarily believes that, unlike U.S. security-based swap dealers who are banks
and conduct foreign business through their foreign branches, a non-bank U.S. security-based
swap dealer may conduct dealing activity with non-U.S. persons directly from its U.S. location
or from its foreign offices that may not have separate operations that are subject to substantive
local financial regulation and may not operate for valid business reasons. Therefore, transactions
conducted by a non-bank U.S. security-based swap dealer with non-U.S. persons are an
inseparable part of such non-bank dealer’s security-based swap business. Consistent with our
traditional entity approach to the regulation of broker-dealers, the Commission preliminarily
believes that it is appropriate to apply the external business conduct standards to a non-bank U.S.
security-based swap dealer with respect to all transactions. To the extent that non-bank U.S.
security-based swap dealers conduct dealing activity with non-U.S. persons through foreign
affiliates, the proposed approach to application of the external business conduct standards would
not impose burdens on non-bank U.S. security-based swap dealers’ activity in the foreign
security-based swap markets and would achieve the benefits of protecting investors from abusive
financial services practices in the United States. The Commission requests comments on the
costs and benefits associated with the proposed application of external business conduct
standards to U.S. security-based swap dealers and whether the proposed approach would burden
bank and non-bank U.S. security-based swap dealers’ foreign dealing business.
standards would apply to transactions conducted through a foreign branch or agency of a U.S.
security-based swap dealer within the United States where the counterparty is a non-U.S. person.

See proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(2) and the discussion in Section III.C.4(a), supra.

465

With respect to foreign security-based swap dealers, the Commission proposes to apply
the external business conduct standards to their transactions with non-U.S. persons if such
transactions are conducted within the United States. As stated above, the proposed approach to
application of the external business conduct standards to transactions conducted within the
United States would generate the benefit of protecting investors from abusive financial services
practices. To permit registered foreign security-based swap dealers not to comply with the
external business conduct standards when they conduct transactions in the United States with
non-U.S. person may not adequately prevent abusive financial services practices in the U.S.
security-based swap market and would permit double standards in security-based swap dealings
in the United States. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed
territorial approach with a focus on counterparty protection in the United States is appropriate.
Request for Comment
•

The Commission requests data to assess the costs and benefits of the proposed rule
regarding application of external business conduct standards described above.
Specifically, the Commission requests comment on (1) whether the proposed rule not
to require a registered U.S. bank security-based swap dealer and foreign securitybased swap dealer to comply with the external business conduct standards with
respect to its foreign business would compromise counterparty protection from
abusive financial services practices in the United States; (2) whether the proposed
rule to require a registered non-bank U.S. security-based swap dealer to comply with
the external business conduct standards with respect to all transactions regardless of
whether the counterparties are U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons would affect its
foreign dealing business; and (3) the Commission’s estimate of the assessment costs
with respect to the proposed rule. Commenters should provide an assessment of these
costs and benefits, as well as any costs and benefits not already defined, that may
result from the adoption of the proposed rule. Commenters should provide analysis
and empirical data to support their views on the costs and benefits associated with the
proposals.
(b) Proposed Rule 18a-4(e) – Application of Segregation Requirements
i.

Programmatic Benefits and Costs
a. Pre-Dodd Frank Segregation Practice

Segregation is intended to protect customer assets by ensuring that cash and securities
that a registered security-based swap dealer holds for security-based swap customers are isolated
from the proprietary assets of the security-based swap dealer and identified as property of such
customers. 1547 Customer assets related to OTC derivatives are currently not consistently

1547

See Section III.C.4.(b)(2), supra. See also Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release
77 FR at 70274.

466

segregated from dealer proprietary assets in today’s OTC derivatives markets. 1548 With respect
to non-cleared derivatives, available information suggests that there is no uniform segregation
practice but that collateral for most accounts is not segregated. 1549 In the absence of a
segregation requirement, the likelihood that security-based swap customers would suffer losses
upon a security-based swap dealer’s default may be substantially higher than may be expected if
security-based swap dealers are subject to such a requirement. 1550
b. Benefits of the Segregation Requirements
Segregation requirements would limit the potential losses for security-based swap
customers if a registered security-based swap dealer fails. 1551 The extent to which assets are in
fact protected by proposed Rule 18a-4(a)-(d) would depend on how effective they are in practice
in allowing assets to be readily returned to customers. 1552 In the cross-border context, the
effectiveness of the segregation requirement with respect to foreign security-based swap dealers
in practice may depend on many factors, including the type and objective of the insolvency or
liquidation proceeding and how the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, SIPA, banking regulations, and
applicable foreign insolvency laws are interpreted by the U.S. bankruptcy court, SIPC, Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation, and relevant foreign authorities. In the Capital, Margin, and
Segregation Proposing Release, we stated that it would be difficult to measure the benefits of the
segregation requirements proposed by the Commission under Section 3E of the Exchange
Act; 1553 however, we believe that Rule 15c3-3, the existing segregation rule for broker-dealers,
would provide a reasonable template for crafting the segregation requirements for security-based
swap dealers. 1554 The ensuing increased confidence of market participants when transacting in

1548

See ISDA Margin Survey 2012. See also Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release,
77 FR at 70325.

1549

See generally ISDA Margin Survey 2012. According to this survey, where an independent
amount (initial margin) is collected, ISDA members reported that most (approximately 72.2%)
was commingled with variation margin and not segregated, and only 4.8% of the amount received
was segregated with a third party custodian. The survey also notes that while the holding of the
independent amounts and variation margin together continues to be the industry standard both
contractually and operationally, it is interesting to note that the ability to segregate has been made
increasingly available to counterparties over the past three years on a voluntary basis, and has led
to 26% of independent amount received and 27.8% of independent amount delivered being
segregated in some respects. See ISDA Margin Survey 2012 at 10. See also Capital, Margin, and

security-based swaps, as compared to the OTC derivatives market as it exists today, should
increase the desire to trade security-based swaps and generally benefit market participants. 1555
c. Costs of the Segregation Requirements
Segregation requirements also will impose certain costs on registered security-based
swap dealers as well as other market participants. The costs associated with individual account
segregation include fees charged by custodians to monitor individual account assets and to
account for potential legal risks and liabilities of custodians to account beneficiaries or dealers,
as well as operational costs to account for collateral on an individual customer basis. 1556 The
costs associated with omnibus segregation would include operational costs and increase in costs
of funds to dealers due to inability to use customer funds, 1557 compared to the baseline today that
dealers in general do not segregate customer collateral for security-based swaps, and to the
extent collateral is segregated, it is not done so on the terms that would be required by the
segregation rules proposed by the Commission in the Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Proposing Release. 1558 The operational costs include costs to establish qualifying bank accounts
and to perform the calculations required to determine the amount that is required at any one time
to be maintained in the reserve account. 1559 The increase in costs of funds to the extent that
collateral a dealer holds that could otherwise be rehypothecated to finance business activity
would no longer be permitted for that purpose could equal the borrowing costs of the dealer. The
extent of the increase of cost of funds to dealers would depend on how much collateral
associated with security-based swaps and held by dealers today consists of initial margin that
they can rehypothecate, i.e., that is not now segregated as would be required under the new Rules
1555

Id. at 70326.

1556

In the Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release, we stated that a commenter to the
CFTC raised concerns with the length of time and the costs to comply with an individual
segregation mandate. Specifically, the commenter raised concerns regarding the number of
collateral arrangements that would be required. The commenter estimated, based on discussion
with its members, that “a rough estimate of the time it would take to establish the necessary
collateral arrangements is 1 year and eleven months, with an associated cost of $141.8 million,
per covered swap entity.” See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release 77 FR at
70326.

1557

See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release 77 FR at 70326, citing SIFMA/ISDA
Comment Letter to the Prudential Regulators (“First, because the collateral cannot be
rehypothecated, and because the collateral amounts will be very large, CSEs will be limited to
investing very large amounts of eligible collateral in assets that generate low returns.”).

See proposed Rules 18a-4(a)-(d) under the Exchange Act and Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Proposing Release 77 FR at 70274-78.

1559

See section V.C. of the Capital, Margin, and Segregation Proposing Release for a discussion of
implementation costs. In cases where an SBSD is jointly registered as a broker-dealer, the costs
of adapting existing systems to account for security-based swap transactions may not be material
in light of the similarities between the systems and procedures required by Rule 15c3-3 and those
that would be required by proposed Rules 18a-4(a)-(d).

468

18a-4(a) - (d) proposed by the Commission in the Capital, Margin and Segregation Proposing
Release. 1560 The Commission currently does not have sufficient information to quantify the
increase of costs of funds to dealers as a result of the proposed segregation requirement and
seeks comment on the impact of the proposed application of segregation requirements on the
increase of costs of funds. 1561
d. Costs and Benefits of Proposed Rules 18a-4(e)(1) and (2)
Regarding Application of Segregation Requirements to Foreign
Security-Based Swap Dealers
Proposed Rules 18a-4(e)(1) and (2) would not apply segregation requirements to a
foreign security-based swap dealer in certain circumstances. Specifically, with respect to noncleared security-based swap transactions, a foreign security-based swap dealer that is not a
broker-dealer would not be subject to the segregation requirements set forth in Section 3E of the
Exchange Act and paragraphs (a)-(d) of the proposed Rule 18a-4 with respect to margin received
from non-U.S. person counterparties. 1562 Therefore, under the proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(1)(ii),
non-U.S. person counterparties to non-cleared security-based swaps with a registered foreign
security-based swap dealer that is not a registered broker-dealer would not be “customers” of
such registered foreign security-based swap dealer and would not be given the preferred priority
status with respect to the segregated assets in the omnibus account maintained by such foreign
security-based swap dealer in a stockbroker liquidation proceeding under the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code. 1563 With respect to a registered foreign security-based swap dealer that is not a foreign
bank with a branch or agency in the United States and is not a registered broker-dealer, the
proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(2)(ii) would subject such foreign security-based swap dealer to the
segregation requirements with respect to any assets posted by a non-U.S. person counterparty to
secure a cleared security-based swap transaction only if such foreign security-based swap dealer
accepts any assets from, for, or on behalf of a U.S. person counterparty to secure a security-based
swap. 1564 The proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(2)(iii) would not subject a registered foreign security1560

1561

The amount of initial margin collateral associated with security-based swaps posted to and held
by dealers today that they can rehypothecate is unknown to the Commission.

1562

See proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(1)(ii) under the Exchange Act. A foreign security-based swap dealer
that is a broker-dealer shall be subject to the segregation requirements set forth in Section 3E of
the Exchange Act and paragraphs (a) - (d) of the proposed Rule 18a-4 with respect to margin
received from any counterparties. See proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(1)(i) under the Exchange Act.

See Section III.C.4.(b)(2), supra.

swap dealer that is a registered broker-dealer shall be subject to the segregation requirements set

469

based swap dealer that is a foreign bank with a branch or agency in the United States to the
segregation requirements with respect to any assets posted by a non-U.S. person counterparty to
a security-based swap transaction. 1565
As stated above, the proposed Rules 18a-4(e)(1) and (2) regarding application of the
segregation requirements to foreign security-based swap dealers would focus on applying the
segregation requirements to provide customer protection to U.S. person counterparties and would
not extend the same customer protection to non-U.S. person counterparties unless not doing so
would result in losses to U.S. person counterparties. 1566 To the extent that a foreign securitybased swap dealer would not be subject to the segregation requirements, the programmatic
benefits described above, such as prompt return of customer assets and limiting the potential
losses for security-based swap customers in the event of a failure of a registered security-based
swap dealer, would not be extended to non-U.S. person counterparties. In addition, the benefits
of potential increased confidence of market participants when transacting in security-based
swaps, as brought about by the segregation requirements, would not occur in the markets where
such foreign security-based swap dealer transacts with non-U.S. person counterparties.
There also would be corresponding decrease in costs as a result of the proposed Rule 18a4(e)(1)(ii) not requiring a foreign security-based swap dealer that is not a registered brokerdealer to segregate assets collected from non-U.S. person counterparties as collateral to secure
non-cleared security-based swaps. A foreign security-based swap dealer would not need to
provide notice required pursuant to Section 3E(f)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act to a non-U.S.
person counterparty with respect to the right to elect individual account segregation. 1567 This
would save operational costs to account for collateral on an individual customer basis and save
fees charged by custodians as described above. 1568 A foreign security-based swap dealer that is
not a registered broker-dealer also would have cost-savings associated with omnibus segregation,
including less operational cost (such as the cost to perform the calculations required to determine
the amount that is required at any one time to be maintained in the reserve account) as described
forth in Section 3E of the Exchange Act and paragraphs (a)-(d) of the proposed Rule 18a-4 under
the Exchange Act with respect to margin received from any counterparties. See proposed Rule
18a-4(e)(2)(i) under the Exchange Act.

1567

See Section 3E(f)(1)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-5(f), and proposed Rule 18a-4(d)(1)
under the Exchange Act.

1568

Although the segregation requirements with respect to non-cleared security-based swaps
described in Section 3E(f) and the proposed Rule 18a-4(a)-(d) would not apply to a foreign
security-based swap dealer when such foreign security-based swap dealer transacts with a nonU.S. person counterparty, proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(1) does not prevent parties from making
segregation arrangements by contractual agreement under applicable local law. If parties were to
make segregation arrangements, certain benefits and costs would arise; however, these benefits
and costs would be outside the Title VII regulatory regime and would not be attributable to the
Title VII regulatory regime.

470

above, and may be able to rehypothecate non-U.S. person counterparty’s assets to finance its
business activity, which would result in borrowing cost savings. The extent of these cost savings
would depend on how much collateral posted by non-U.S. person counterparties and held by
dealers today to secure security-based swaps consisting of margin that is available for dealers to
use (i.e., that is not now segregated).
The Commission preliminarily believes that the above decreases in benefits and costs as a
result of the proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(1) and (2) are not those programmatic benefits and costs
intended by the segregation requirements set forth in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and the
rules and regulations thereunder. Such decreases reflect the exclusion of foreign security-based
swap dealers (that are not registered broker-dealers) from the segregation requirements when
they transact with non-U.S. persons in the foreign markets, which we believe is consistent with
the objective of the Dodd-Frank Act to protect the U.S. markets and participants in those
markets. 1569
e. Costs and Benefits of Proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3) Regarding
Disclosures
There would be new costs and benefits associated with compliance with the segregation
requirements for foreign security-based swap dealers due to the disclosures requirements in the
proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3). Specifically, proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3) would require a registered
foreign security-based swap dealer to disclose to its counterparty that is a U.S. person the
potential treatment of the assets segregated by such registered foreign security-based swap dealer
pursuant to Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, in
insolvency proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy law and any applicable foreign insolvency laws.
Such disclosure shall include whether the foreign security-based swap dealer is subject to the
segregation requirement set forth in Section 3E of the Exchange Act, and the rules and
regulations thereunder, with respect to the assets collected from the U.S. person counterparty
who will receive the disclosure, whether the foreign security-based swap dealer could be subject
to the stockbroker liquidation provisions in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, whether the segregated
assets could be afforded customer property treatment under the U.S. bankruptcy law, and any
other relevant considerations that may affect the treatment of the assets segregated under Section
3E of the Exchange Act in insolvency proceedings of the foreign security-based swap dealer.
The Commission preliminarily believes that such disclosure would greatly benefit U.S. person
counterparties and assist them in evaluating the legal risk in respect of posting collateral to a
foreign security-based swap dealer and the likely treatment of their assets held as collateral in the
event of insolvency or liquidation of the foreign security-based swap dealer whom they transact
with and post collateral to.
With respect to costs, the Commission preliminarily believes that a foreign security-based
swap dealer should be able to include such disclosure in the credit support agreement pursuant to
which assets would be posted to margin, guarantee, or secure a security-based swap transaction.
The costs associated with such disclosure may include legal costs related to consulting
1569

See Section III.C.4.(b)(2), supra.

471

bankruptcy counsels, both U.S. counsel and relevant foreign counsel, in respect of the potential
treatment of the segregated assets under U.S. bankruptcy law and applicable foreign insolvency
laws, the costs of drafting such disclosure, and the costs of updating such disclosure whenever
there is a material change of U.S. bankruptcy law or applicable foreign laws that may render the
prior disclosure inaccurate or misleading. The Commission preliminarily estimates that the
average costs associated with such disclosure would be less than $2,000,000 and a narrow range
could be between $760,000 and $920,000. 1570
ii.

Assessment Costs

The assessment cost associated with proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(1) and (2) should primarily
be related to inquiries about a counterparty’s U.S. person status, whether a security-based swap
is a cleared or non-cleared transaction, whether the foreign security-based swap dealer is a
registered broker-dealer, whether the foreign security-based swap dealer, whether the foreign
security-based swap dealer has a branch or agency in the United States, and whether the foreign
security-based swap dealer accepts any assets from, or on behalf of, a U.S. person counterparty
to security a security-based swap, in order to determine whether a transaction would be subject to
the segregation requirements. A security-based swap dealer should know whether it is a
registered broker-dealer and whether a particular transaction is submitted for clearing and should
not incur any assessment costs relating to determining whether a transaction is cleared or noncleared security-based swap. A foreign security-based swap dealer may need to make an internal
inquiry as to whether it has a branch or agency in the United States and whether it accepts
collateral from, or on behalf of, a U.S. person counterparty. Such inquiry should be a factual
1570

This estimate is based on staff experience in undertaking legal analysis of U.S. bankruptcy law
treatment of customer assets held by broker-dealers and assumes that foreign security-based swap
dealers would seek outside legal counsel to prepare the disclosures described in proposed Rule
18a-4(e)(3) and that the legal analysis of the treatment of customer property under a complex
foreign insolvency law regime may cost $50,000 per entity and the same legal analysis under a
less complex foreign insolvency law regime or the U.S. bankruptcy law regime may cost $30,000
per entity. We recognize that the complexity of the insolvency laws relating to liquidation of a
foreign security-based swap dealer may vary greatly, and that we do not have insight into various
insolvency law regimes such that we could reasonably determine what insolvency law regime
may be considered more or less complex for these purposes. Thus, based on our understanding of
the U.S. bankruptcy law analysis relating to liquidation of a broker-dealer, taking into account the
potential application of various foreign insolvency laws, we believe that an average of the costs
associated with more complex and less complex insolvency law regimes equaling $40,000 per
entity could reasonably approximate the average costs for a foreign security-based swap dealer to
prepare the disclosures required in proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3). We have estimated that the total
number of dealers that may be required to register under the proposed de minimis rule is 50 or
fewer entities, and if the criterion of three or more non-ISDA dealer counterparties is applied to
the analysis, we estimated that the total number of dealers that may be required to register is
between 27 and 31. See Section XV.D.1(b), supra. Out of these dealers, we estimated that the
number of non-U.S. domiciled dealers is between 19 and 23. Therefore, the aggregate costs of
the disclosure requirement could be $2,000,000 ($40,000 * 50) or less with a narrow range from
$760,000 ($40,000 * 19) to $920,000 ($40,000 * 23).

inquiry involving consulting the corporate secretary, in-house attorney or compliance manager
without the need for further research and, therefore, the cost of such inquiry should be minimal.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the costs associated with inquiring about a
counterparty’s U.S. person status should be subsumed in the assessment costs of the de minimis
rule and the requirements relating to the external business conduct standards since a securitybased swap dealer only needs to inquire about a counterparty’s U.S. person status and implement
systems to record and track the counterparty status once in order to assess and comply with all
the Title VII requirements that depend on such factual inquiry. Therefore, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the assessment costs associated with proposed Rules 18a-4(e)(1) and
(2) alone should be minimal.
The assessment cost associated with the disclosures in proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3) would
be related to inquiries about a counterparty’s U.S. person status, which also would be subsumed
in the assessment costs associated with proposed Rules relating to the de minimis exception and
the requirements relating to the external business conduct standards.
Request for Comment
•

Is it appropriate, from the cost and benefit point of view, not to require foreign
security-based swap dealers to comply with the segregation requirements when they
transact with non-U.S. person counterparties? Are there other costs and benefits not
mentioned above? Specifically, the Commission requests comment on (1) whether
the proposed approach to application of the segregation requirements to foreign
security-based swap dealers based on their status as a broker-dealer, foreign securitybased swap dealer that is a bank with a branch or agency in the United States, or
foreign security-based swap dealer that is not a broker-dealer and is not a bank with a
branch or agency in the United States would generate the benefit of effectively
administering the segregation requirement in practice and protecting U.S.
counterparties, (2) the costs of custodian fees, the operation costs and the costs
associated with increased costs of funds due to inability to use customer asserts as a
result of a foreign security-based swap dealer being required to comply with the
segregation requirements, (3) the costs of preparing the disclosures required in
proposed Rule 18a-4(e)(3) and (4) the assessment costs associated with the proposed
Rule 18a-4(e).

•

Is it appropriate, from the cost and benefit point of view, to require a foreign securitybased swap dealer to disclose potential treatment of the assets segregated by such
foreign security-based swap dealer in insolvency proceedings under U.S. bankruptcy
law and any applicable foreign insolvency laws? Are there other costs and benefits
not mentioned above?

•

Is it appropriate, from the cost and benefit point of view, to require a foreign securitybased swap dealer to disclose to its non-U.S. person counterparty that it is not subject
to the segregation requirements and that funds or property provided by such non-U.S.
person counterparty would not be treated as “customer property” as that term is
defined in 11 U.S.C. 741?

Economic Analysis of Application of Rules Governing Security-Based Swap Clearing in
Cross-Border Context

The Dodd-Frank Act amends the Exchange Act to require central clearing of securitybased swaps that the Commission determines should be cleared, 1571 and it directs entities that
perform clearing agency functions for security-based swaps to register with the Commission. 1572
In this section, we first discuss the costs and benefits resulting from clearing agency registration
and then consider the costs and benefits associated with the proposed rule regarding application
of the clearing agency registration requirement to foreign clearing agencies. Following this, we
discuss the costs and benefits that result from requiring security-based swap market participants
to centrally clear transactions and then examine the trade-offs associated with the proposed rule
implementing the mandatory clearing requirement in the cross-border context.
1. Programmatic Benefits and Costs Associated with the Clearing Agency
Registration
(a) Proposed Interpretive Guidance Regarding Clearing Agency Registration
(i) Current State of Clearing Agency Registration
At present, voluntary clearing of security-based swaps in the United States is limited to
CDS products. 1573 It began in December of 2008, when the Commission acted to facilitate the
clearing of OTC security-based swaps by permitting five clearing agencies, including three
foreign clearing agencies, 1574 to clear CDS on a temporary, conditional basis. 1575 In each
instance, these clearing agencies wanted to perform clearing functions with respect to CDS in the
United States by providing CCP services directly to U.S. persons. 1576 The temporary exemptive
orders granted to four of these clearing agencies (including two foreign clearing agencies) were
extended until July 16, 2011. 1577 Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act provides that (1) a depository

institution that cleared swaps as a multilateral clearing organization prior to the date of
enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act or (2) a derivatives clearing organization registered with the
CFTC that cleared swaps pursuant to an exemption from registration as a clearing agency prior
to the date of enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act is deemed registered as a clearing agency for the
purposes of clearing security-based swaps (“Deemed Registered Provision”). 1578 The Deemed
Registered Provision, along with other general provisions under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act,
became effective on July 16, 2011. 1579 As a result, three clearing agencies, i.e., ICE Clear
Europe, Limited, ICE Clear Credit LLC (formerly ICE Trust US LLC), and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange Inc., which were performing CCP functions with respect to CDS in the United States,
were deemed registered with the Commission on July 16, 2011. 1580
(ii) Programmatic Effect of the Proposed Interpretive Guidance
As stated above, 1581 the Commission is proposing interpretive guidance that a clearing
agency performing the functions of a CCP for security-based swaps within the United States
would be required to register pursuant to Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act. 1582 Under this
proposed interpretive guidance, a registration requirement pursuant to Section 17A(g) of the
Exchange Act would apply only to clearing agencies that provide CCP services directly to a U.S.
person with respect to security-based swaps, since these entities would be performing the
functions of a CCP within the United States. Three clearing agencies currently provide CCP

exemptions in connection with request of ICE Trust US LLC); LIFFE A&M and LCH.Clearnet
Ltd. allowed their order to lapse without seeking renewal.
1578

See 15 U.S.C. 78q-1(l). Under this Deemed Registered Provision, a clearing agency will be
required to comply with all requirements of the Exchange Act, and the rules thereunder,
applicable to registered clearing agencies to the extent it clears security-based swaps after the
effective date of the Deemed Registered Provision, including, for example, the obligation to file
proposed rule changes under Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act.

1579

See Section 774 of the Dodd-Frank Act (stating, “[u]nless otherwise provided, the provisions of
this subtitle shall take effect on the later of 360 days after the date of the enactment of this subtitle
or, to the extent a provision of this subtitle requires a rulemaking, not less than 60 days after
publication of the final rule or regulation implementing such provision of this subtitle.”).

1580

Eurex Clearing AG did not meet the criteria in the Deemed Registered Provision and is not
currently providing CCP services in the United States with respect to security-based swaps. See,
e.g., Order Granting Temporary Exemptions Under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in
Connection with the Pending Revision of the Definition of “Security” to Encompass SecurityBased Swaps, and Request for Comment, Exchange Act Release No. 64795 (July 1, 2011) at n.

services directly to U.S. persons with respect to swaps and security-based swaps. 1583 All of these
three clearing agencies are registered with the Commission under the Deemed Registered
Provision. Therefore, the proposed interpretation would not increase the number of domestic or
foreign clearing agencies required to register with the Commission until new clearing agencies
desire to enter the U.S. market to provide CCP services directly to U.S. persons with respect to
security-based swaps.
(iii) Costs and Benefits of the Proposed Interpretive Guidance
The Commission has considered the costs and benefits associated with the clearing
agency registration requirement in Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act 1584 in the cross-border
context through the lens of a key Title VII goal: systemic risk mitigation. We discuss below the
costs and benefits of the proposed interpretive guidance by looking at the role of the clearing
agency in the security-based swap market and how clearing agencies transfer financial risks.
The proposed interpretive guidance regarding clearing agency registration would
generate significant programmatic benefits. These benefits are tied to mandatory clearing. As
explained below, clearing agency registration promotes sound management of the counterparty
risk concentrated in CCPs, the importance of which is magnified by the application of a
mandatory clearing requirement. Registration would provide standards for CCPs’ management
of financial risks, including counterparty credit risk, legal risk and liquidity risk. Mandatory
clearing of security-based swaps is one means by which Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act seeks to
reduce systemic risk in the U.S. financial system. Under Title VII, security-based swaps,
“whenever possible and appropriate,” 1585 shall be centrally cleared through a clearing agency that
is registered or exempt from registration under the Exchange Act. 1586 In a world of bilateral
transactions in which each counterparty bears the other counterparty’s credit risk, a large
counterparty who transacts with many other counterparties and cumulates significant security-

agencies are ICE Clear Europe, Limited, ICE Clear Credit LLC, and Chicago Mercantile
Exchange, Inc.

See, e.g., S. Comm. on Banking, Hous., & Urban Affairs, The Restoring American Financial
Stability Act of 2010, S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 32 (“As a key element of reducing systemic risk
and protecting taxpayers in the future, protections must include comprehensive regulation and
rules for how the OTC derivatives market operates. Increasing the use of central clearinghouses,
exchanges, appropriate margining, capital requirements, and reporting will provide safeguards for
American taxpayers and the financial system as a whole.”); id. at 34 (“Some parts of the OTC
market may not be suitable for clearing and exchange trading due to individual business needs of
certain users. Those users should retain the ability to engage in customized, uncleared contracts
while bringing in as much of the OTC market under the centrally cleared and exchange-traded
framework as possible.”).

based swap positions may pose systemic risk when its failure would generate sequential
counterparty defaults. 1587
Central clearing through a CCP generally reduces counterparty risk by interposing a CCP
as counterparty to all cleared transactions. 1588 Where security-based swaps are subject to a
mandatory clearing requirement the role of the CCP becomes even more critical, as the volume
of positions in which the CCP is interposed and becomes the central counterparty will likely
increase. 1589
While central clearing may make sequential counterparty defaults less likely, it does not
eliminate systemic risk. CCPs concentrate counterparty risk. 1590 CCPs manage and reduce such
concentrated risk by applying mark-to-market pricing and margin requirements to cleared
transactions in a consistent manner 1591 and through netting (i.e., by reducing the amounts of
funds or other assets that must be exchanged at settlement). 1592 In the event of a clearing
member’s default in which the losses exceed the collateral posted to the CCP and other available
funds, residual losses will be mutualized among the other non-defaulting members. 1593 By
placing members under financial strain, mutualization may strain the entire financial system and

Papers Series, No. 1 (2011), at 6 (“Widespread defaults on derivatives contracts may harm more
than the counterparties on the defaulted contracts. The losses suffered by the victims of the
original defaults may be so severe as to force those victims into financial distress, which harms
those who have entered into financial contracts with them—including their creditors, and the
counterparties to derivatives on which they owe money. Such a cascade of defaults can result in a
systemic financial crisis.”).

1588

See Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, 77 FR at 66264 (“Central clearing facilitates
the management of counterparty credit risk among dealers and other institutions by shifting that
risk from individual counterparties to CCPs, thereby helping protect counterparties from each
other’s potential failures and preventing the buildup of risk in such entities, which could be
systemically important.”).

create systemic impact. 1594 Even in the absence of this feature of CCPs, the default of a CCP has
the potential to harm the market in all financial instruments cleared by that CCP, creating
liquidity constraints with respect to such financial instruments in the market. Such liquidity
constraints would affect all parties transacting in such instruments. 1595
Given the mutualization of losses, a CCP’s concentration of risk, and its responsibility for
risk management, the effectiveness of a CCP’s risk controls and the adequacy of its financial
resources are critical aspects of the infrastructure of the market it serves. 1596 Registration and
clearing agency standards are designed to address these considerations.
The Commission preliminarily believes its interpretation that a clearing agency that
provides CCP services for security-based swaps directly to U.S. persons must register pursuant
to Section 17A(g) of the Exchange Act 1597 generates the benefits of protecting the U.S. financial
system against systemic risk that may arise from central clearing functions performed in the
United States. In the case of a foreign clearing agency that provides CCP services directly to
U.S. persons, the Commission preliminarily believes that requiring such foreign clearing agency
to register with the Commission and comply with the Commission’s regulatory regime for
security-based swap clearing would generate the key benefit of reducing the magnitude of any
systemic risk flowing into or within the United States originating in the activities of other
members of a clearing agency.
Specifically, the clearing agency standards would provide the minimum standards for
CCPs’ management of financial risks, including counterparty credit risk, legal risk, and liquidity
risk. For example, the clearing agency standards established by the Commission are designed to
minimize the CCPs’ credit risk by, among other things, establishing eligibility standards for
clearing members and requiring registered clearing agencies to measure their credit exposures on
a daily basis. The Commission’s clearing agency standards also require a registered clearing
agency that acts as a CCP to collect initial and variation margin from members, and maintain
sufficient financial resources to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the participant family to
which it has the largest exposure in extreme but plausible market conditions and, with respect to
a registered clearing agency acting as a CCP for security-based swaps, maintain additional
financial resources sufficient to withstand, at a minimum, a default by the two participant

families to which it has the largest exposures in extreme but plausible market conditions. 1598 The
benefits and costs of the clearing agency standards have been discussed in detail in the Clearing
Agency Standards Adopting Release. 1599 The proposed interpretive guidance does not change
the benefits associated with the substantive registration requirement and clearing agency
standards. The aggregate programmatic benefits of the proposed interpretive guidance would
flow from its programmatic effect on the number of clearing agencies registered as discussed
above.
The proposed interpretive guidance would also entail certain costs, such as direct
registration and compliance costs on CCPs. 1600 The proposed interpretive guidance does not
change the costs associated with the substantive registration requirement and clearing agency
standards. As with the programmatic benefits, the aggregate programmatic costs of the proposed
interpretive guidance would flow from its programmatic effect on the number of clearing
agencies registered as discussed above.
(iv) Assessment Costs
A clearing agency would incur assessment costs to determine whether it would be
required to register by determining whether it provides CCP services directly to a U.S. person.
Such determination may be made as part of its clearing membership application approval
process. As part of the membership application, a prospective clearing member would be
required to provide corporate organization documents, such as certificates of incorporation or
articles of organization, which would enable the clearing agency to determine whether a
prospective clearing member is a U.S. person. Since corporate organization documents are part
of the clearing membership application package, 1601 the Commission preliminarily believes that
the assessment costs associated with the proposed interpretive guidance should be minimal.
(v) Alternatives
An alternative to the proposed interpretive guidance would be to require a clearing
agency to register if such clearing agency provides CCP services to non-U.S. intermediaries that
have U.S. persons as customers. Such an alternative would focus on the fact that intermediaries,
whose financial stress or failure would mostly likely affect the U.S. financial system, are

See Section V Economic analysis of the Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, 77 FR at
66263-84.

1600

The Commission previously estimated the costs for each registered clearing agency associated
with compliance with clearing agency standards adopted in the Clearing Agency Standards
Adopting Release could total approximately $3.7 million in initial costs and $10.1 million in
annual ongoing costs. See Clearing Agency Standards Adopting Release, 77 FR at 66273.

1601

2012), available at:
https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/clear_us/Clear_US_Member_Application.pdf.

479

exposed to the risk of CCPs, and also transmit that risk to their U.S. customers. However, the
Commission believes that the risk exposure that a U.S. customer could incur under its contractual
agreements with an intermediary is generally much lower than the risk exposure a U.S. member
could incur under a membership agreement with a CCP because a customer is only risking up to
the full amount of property entrusted to an intermediary, but is not under any obligation to
perform under the contractual agreements that the intermediary enters into with third parties.
Consequently, if a clearing agency provides CCP services to an intermediary that has a U.S.
person as a customer, the ripple effect of the failure of such clearing agency on the U.S. financial
system may not rise to the systemic level.
Alternatively, the Commission could have proposed to require a clearing agency to
register if such clearing agency has a member whose obligations under the clearing membership
agreement are guaranteed by a U.S. person. The Commission recognizes that guarantees may
expose the U.S. guarantor to the performance obligations under the clearing membership
agreement and represent conduits through which the risks associated with foreign CCP default
may transfer to the U.S. financial system. A non-U.S. member of a foreign CCP will still
participate in loss mutualization in the event of member default. In the presence of a guarantee,
the losses associated with mutualization may flow back to the guarantor.
However, the Commission preliminarily believes that interpreting a U.S. person
providing a guarantee to a non-U.S. clearing member with respect to obligations under a clearing
membership agreement as an indication of the clearing agency providing CCP services to a U.S.
person may lead to a result that is over-inclusive with respect to the statutory clearing agency
registration requirement. A U.S. person could guarantee its foreign affiliate’s obligations under a
clearing membership agreement with a foreign clearing agency that does not provide CCP
services to any U.S. persons. Therefore, as a matter of policy, the Commission declines to
propose such alternative interpretation at this time.
Finally, the Commission is not proposing to apply clearing agency registration
requirements to a clearing agency solely based on a U.S. domicile of the clearing agency. The
Commission believes that the domicile location of a clearing agency is not a sufficient indicator
of whether a CCP is performing the functions of a CCP in the United States and the transmission
of systemic risk across borders by providing CCP services directly to U.S. persons.
(b) Proposed Exemption of Foreign Clearing Agency from Registration
As discussed above, the Commission preliminarily believes that it may be appropriate to
consider an exemption as an alternative to application of the registration requirement to a foreign
clearing agency in circumstances where the foreign clearing agency is subject to comparable,
comprehensive supervision and regulation by appropriate government authorities in its home
country, and the nature of the clearing agency’s activities and performance of functions within
the United States suggest that registration is not necessary to achieve the Commission’s
regulatory objectives.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the benefits of considering such exemption
would be to increase the range of registered and exempt clearing agencies that could be used to
satisfy the mandatory clearing requirement. Since the exemption would be considered in
480

circumstances where the foreign clearing agency is subject to comparable, comprehensive
supervision and regulation in its home country, the Commission preliminarily believes that such
exemption would not compromise the programmatic benefits of the mandatory clearing
requirement and at the same time may decrease the costs to market participants associated with
the mandatory clearing requirement. In addition, to the extent that the exemption eliminates or
decreases duplicative compliance costs, a foreign clearing agency eligible for the exemption may
incur lower programmatic costs associated with implementation of, or compliance with, the
clearing agency registration requirements and clearing agency standards than it would otherwise
incur without the option of the proposed exemption.
On the other hand, in the case of an exemption order granted with Commission-imposed
conditions, it is possible that the programmatic costs may increase because market participants
would be required to incur costs to satisfy these conditions. However, the proposed availability
of an exemption from registration may enable a foreign clearing agency that would, due to
conflicting local laws, otherwise not be able to provide CCP services to U.S. market participants
in the absence of an exemption. In such cases, an exemption with Commission-imposed
conditions may increase the number of clearing agencies in the U.S. security-based swap market,
contributing to the programmatic benefits and costs that flow from the clearing agency
registration requirement.
(c) Programmatic Effects of Alternative Standards
As stated above, 1602 Section 17A(i) of the Exchange Act permits the Commission to
adopt rules for registered clearing agencies that clear security-based swaps and conform its
regulatory standards and supervisory practices to reflect evolving United States and international
standards.
The Commission preliminarily believes that this approach may be appropriate where the
Commission determines not to grant a general exemption from registration under Section 17A(k)
of the Exchange Act, but where consistency with some regulatory standards suggests that a
targeted regulatory approach is warranted. To avoid compromising the benefits of clearing
agency registration discussed above, the Commission would consider the costs and benefits of
applying such alternative standards when it contemplates such an action. The Commission
preliminarily believes that the alternative standards approach could provide great flexibility for
the Commission to promote a great range of registered and exempt clearing agencies for market
participants to satisfy the mandatory clearing requirement without compromising the benefit of
clearing agency registration by considering the adoption of targeted standards when warranted by
the circumstances.

2. Programmatic Benefits and Costs Associated with the Mandatory Clearing
Requirement of Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act
Prior to the Dodd-Frank Act, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe engaged in credit
default swap clearing activities pursuant to exemptive orders issued by the Commission.1603 In
part, the exemptive orders were conditioned on those CCPs making certain information available
to the Commission, including risk assessment reports and information regarding future changes
to risk management practices. 1604
Following the Dodd-Frank Act becoming effective, ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear
Europe were deemed to be registered with the Commission in July 2011as clearing agencies for
security-based swaps. 1605 ICE Clear Credit began clearing corporate single-name credit default
swaps in December 2009, 1606 and, as of December 14, 2012, had cleared a total $1.8 trillion
gross notional of single-name credit default swaps on 153 North American corporate reference
entities. 1607 ICE Clear Europe began clearing credit default swaps on single-name corporate
reference entities in December 2009, 1608 and, as of December 14, 2012, had cleared a total €1.5

See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 59527 (Mar. 6, 2009), 74 FR 10791 (Mar. 12, 2009) (“ICE

(July 29, 2009) (“ICE Clear Europe Exemptive Order”). In connection with those orders,
Commission staff considered a number of aspects of those CCPs’ clearing practices, including,
inter alia, their risk management methodologies.

Order, supra note 1603, at 37756–57.

Section 17A(l) of the Exchange Act provides in relevant part that a derivative clearing
organization registered with the CFTC that clears security-based swaps would be deemed to be
registered as a clearing agency under section 17A if, prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank
Act, it cleared swaps pursuant to an exemption from registration as a clearing agency.
Both ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe also are registered with the CFTC as Designated
Clearing Organizations.

1606

See Exchange Act Release No. 61662 (Mar. 5, 2010), 75 FR 11589, 11591 (Mar. 11, 2010)
(discussing ICE Clear Credit’s CDS clearing activities as of March 2010).
ICE Clear Credit (then known as ICE US Trust LLC) began clearing index-based CDS in March
2009. See Exchange Act Release No. 59527 (Mar. 6, 2009), 74 FR 10791 (Mar. 12, 2009) (order
granting temporary exemptions under the Exchange Act on behalf of ICE US Trust LLC).

ICE Clear Credit also has cleared a total of $19.1 trillion gross notional on 59 index CDS as of
December 14, 2012. See ICE Clear Credit, Volume of ICE CDS Clearing, available at:
https://www.theice.com/clear_credit.jhtml.
In addition to clearing single-name CDS on North American corporate reference entities, ICE
Clear Credit also clears CDS on certain non-U.S. sovereign entities, and on certain indices based
on North American reference entities.

1608

See Exchange Act Release No. 61973 (Apr. 23, 2010), 75 FR 22656, 22657 (Apr. 29, 2010)

482

trillion in gross notional of single-name credit default swaps on 121 European corporate
reference entities. 1609 The level of clearing activity appears to have steadily increased as more
CDS have become eligible to be cleared. 1610 To date, all of ICE Clear Credit’s and ICE Clear
Europe’s security-based swap clearing activity has involved proprietary transactions between
clearing members. 1611
The economic effects of mandatory clearing may be expected to vary depending on the
scope of the requirement and the financial instruments subject to mandatory clearing. Within the
subset of instruments that could be subject to a mandatory clearing requirement, a broader
clearing mandate may be expected generally to lead to more effective risk mitigation, but it may
also increase costs to market participants. The ultimate economic impact of the mandatory
clearing requirement in part will be affected by the total set of security-based swaps that will be
subject to mandatory clearing, following Commission determinations pursuant to Section 3C(b)
of the Exchange Act. 1612
Accordingly, this section does not seek to address the full range of economic
consequences of the mandatory clearing requirement and the proposed application of mandatory
clearing in the cross-border context that may result from the Commission’s determination to
require certain security-based swap transactions to be subject to mandatory clearing. Instead,
this section contains two subsections. The first discusses programmatic effects of the mandatory
clearing requirement and the second discusses costs and benefits that result from the mandatory
ICE Clear Europe commenced clearing index-based CDS in July 2009. See Exchange Act
Release No. 60372 (July 23, 2009), 74 FR 37748 (July 29, 2009) (order granting temporary
exemptions under the Exchange Act on behalf of ICE Clear Europe).
1609

ICE Clear Europe also has cleared a total of €9.7 trillion in gross notional on 44 index-based
CDS. See ICE Clear Europe, Volume of ICE CDS Clearing, available at:
https://www.theice.com/clear_credit.jhtml.
Aside from clearing single-name CDS on European corporate reference entities, ICE Clear
Europe also clears CDS on indices based on European reference entities, as well as futures and
instruments on OTC energy and emissions markets.

1610

See Clearing Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41636-38 (discussing the steady increase in
the volume of cleared CDS transactions).

1611

For purposes of the discussion here, “clearing members,” “clearing participants,” and similar
terms encompass market participants that are approved by a clearing agency to become the
clearing agency’s counterparty when a single-name CDS is cleared.

1612

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(b). Section 3C(b) of the Exchange Act includes two mandatory clearing
determination review processes. One is Commission-initiated review and the other is a swaps
submissions review processes. The mandatory clearing determinations to be made by the
Commission would have impact on the economic consequences of the mandatory clearing
requirement. For example, with respect to single-name CDS on certain corporate entities that
have high notional size outstanding but are not currently cleared on a voluntary basis, the
determination of clearing of these single-name credit default swaps would have impact on the
volume of security-based swap transactions subject to mandatory clearing.

clearing requirement generally. We consider these programmatic costs and benefits through
analyzing the potential programmatic effects of mandatory clearing based on the data of
voluntary clearing activity available to us and the assumptions stated below.
(a) Programmatic Effects of the Mandatory Clearing Requirement
As stated above, voluntary clearing of security-based swaps in the United Sates is
currently limited to the CDS products cleared by ICE Clear Credit and ICE Clear Europe. 1613
The level of clearing activity appears to have steadily increased over time as more products have
become eligible to be cleared. 1614 The notional volume of cleared transactions reported by ICE
Clear Credit for U.S.-index CDS products in 2009, 2010 and 2011 represented approximately
32%, 54% and 57% of the total notional volume of the U.S.-index CDS market, and the notional
volume of cleared transactions reported by ICE Clear Credit for single-name CDS products
referencing U.S. corporate in 2009, 2010 and 2011 represented approximately 0%, 16% and 25%
of the total notional volume of the single-name U.S. corporate CDS market. 1615 These figures
were calculated based on price-forming transactions submitted to the DTCC-TIW. 1616
Our prior analysis of the level of clearing activity also demonstrated steady increases of
CDS transaction volume in names accepted for clearing over time. 1617 Such analysis compared

See the discussion of levels of security-based swap clearing in Section XV.B.2(e) above. See also
Clearing Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41636 (noting that central clearing of securitybased swaps began in March 2009 for index-based CDS products, in December 2009 for singlename CDS products on corporate reference entities, and in November 2011 for single-name CDS
products on sovereign reference entities; also noting that at present, there is no central clearing in
the United States for security-based swaps that are not CDS products, such as those based on
equity securities).

1614

See Clearing Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41636-38 (discussing the steady increase in
the volume of cleared CDS transactions).

1615

These figures are based on information regarding names accepted for clearing reported by ICE
Clear Credit on its public Website and are calculated based on “price forming transactions”
submitted to the DTCC-TIW. See Section XV.B.2(e), supra. These figures include the clearing
of trades on the same day the trade was executed as well as the clearing of trades entered into in
prior years and submitted for clearing on retroactive basis. These figures do not include trades
that resulted from the compression of trades previously submitted for clearing. See id. The CME
Group also clears index CDS products and has reported clearing $144 billion in gross notional
volumes of transactions since inception, with $21 billion in open interest as of the end of 2011.
See CME Group, Cleared OTC Credit Default Swaps, available at:
http://www.cmegroup.com/trading/cds/. These volumes are small relative to total market activity
and are not included in the calculation of notional volume of cleared index CDS in 2011
performed by the Commission staff in the Clearing Procedures Adopting Release. See Clearing
Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41636.

1616

See Section XV.B.2(e) and note 1615, supra.

1617

See Clearing Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41637-38. The analysis there presents two
measures with respect to transaction volume accepted for clearing (which ultimately may have

484

two measures of transaction volumes in names accepted for clearing within a year and across
years and showed the increase in percentage from 2009 to 2011 in the volume of new
transactions in names that have “accepted for clearing” status. See Table 1 below.

been cleared or uncleared). The first measure includes all transaction volume in names accepted
for clearing at any time during the calendar year, whether or not a trade was accepted for clearing
at the time of its execution. The calculation of this measure was performed by staff in the
Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation by totaling the sum of price forming
transactions reported to DTCC-TIW in the calendar year for index-based and single-name
corporate CDS products that match the list of names accepted for clearing at ICE Clear Credit
during the same period. See ICE Clear Credit, Clearing Eligible Products, available at:
https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/clear_credit/ICE_Clear_Credit_Clearing_Eligible_Products.x
ls.
The second measure includes only transaction volume in names accepted for clearing at the time
of trade execution. The calculation of this measure was performed by staff in the Division of
Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation by totaling the sum of price forming transactions
reported to DTCC-TIW in the calendar year for index-based and single-name corporate CDS
products that match the list of names accepted for clearing at ICE Clear Credit, including only
those transactions executed following the accepted for clearing date reported by ICE Clear Credit.
This measure accounts for the fact that, although transactions executed in names prior to the name
being accepted for clearing can be cleared later in the same calendar year through a process
referred to as “backloading,” names accepted for clearing towards the end of the year allow less
time for this to occur. Backloading refers to the submission for clearing of pre-existing bilateral
trades that were not submitted for clearing on the date of the transaction. See Clearing
Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41637-38.

Although data suggested that clearing of security-based swaps has been increasing,
significant segments of the security-based swap market remain uncleared. 1618 Due in part to this
data, the Commission recognized in the Clearing Procedures Adopting Release that mandatory
clearing determinations made pursuant to Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 1619 could alter
current clearing practices at the time such determinations are made. One potential consequence
of mandatory clearing determinations that require mandatory clearing for certain security-based
swaps could be a higher level of clearing for security-based swaps than would take place under a
voluntary system. 1620 Where the amount of clearing taking place under a voluntary system is
significantly different from the level of clearing that would take place if trading in a product
were mandatory and where such difference marks a shift in existing market clearing practices,
the mandatory clearing determination could potentially have a material economic impact. 1621
(b) Programmatic Benefits and Costs of the Mandatory Clearing Requirement
A key benefit of mandatory clearing is reduction of counterparty credit risk. In a regime
with central clearing, the CCP is the counterparty to all trades. Central clearing mitigates
counterparty credit risk among dealers and other institutions by shifting that risk from individual
counterparties to CCPs, thereby helping protect counterparties from sequential default. CCPs
require that members apply mark-to-market pricing and margin requirements in a consistent
manner, and generally use liquid margin collateral to manage the risk of a member’s failure.
Accordingly, where CCPs operate under high standards relating to risk management,
counterparty credit risk can be lower than in a regime without CCPs where counterparties can
1618

Because clearing is voluntary, counterparties to the transaction have no obligation to clear and
may elect not to do so for various individual reasons. Further, if the counterparties choose to
transact in a reference entity that is accepted for clearing in a currency other than U.S. dollars, the
transaction is no longer eligible for clearing. In addition, because clearing was performed
exclusively on a backloading basis prior to April 2011, some transactions have not been cleared
because they may have been subject to portfolio compression or otherwise terminated prior to
when the option to submit the transactions for clearing became available. See Clearing
Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41638.

engage only in bilateral netting and face margin requirements that may vary significantly
between transactions. 1622
Although central clearing reduces counterparty risk, it is less certain whether a mandatory
requirement to centrally clear security-based swap transactions reduces the overall risks to the
financial system. Some have expressed the view that central clearing should be imposed
wherever possible to help control systemic risk; others, by contrast, have contended that
concentrating the default risk of numerous counterparties within a single CCP (or within a small
number of CCPs) could introduce new risks. 1623 For instance, those expressing concern about
the systemic effects of central clearing state that risk sharing between members of a CCP may
encourage excessive risk taking because the costs of imprudent decisions by one clearing
member are borne by other clearing members. This moral hazard concern may be exacerbated to
the extent that CCPs are viewed as too important to fail and thus would likely be subject to
bailout remedies that would benefit all CCP members. 1624
While lower counterparty credit risk benefits the financial system as a whole, it can also
make hedging less expensive for market participants. An environment in which central clearing
is common may see increased participation, greater liquidity, and more efficient risk sharing that
promotes capital formation. There also are circumstances under which central clearing can
increase participation costs for certain participants. In certain cases where counterparties to a
security-based swap transaction are exposed to one another in multiple asset markets, they may
face lower costs by bilaterally clearing new contracts against existing exposures instead of
clearing through a central counterparty. 1625

Mandatory clearing can play an important role in developing a strong infrastructure for
central clearing. 1626 For instance, mandatory clearing reduces operational risk by promoting the
standardization of contract terms. Standardization can simplify the valuation of security-based
swaps, increase the liquidity of security-based swaps contracts, and promote competition.
Standardized contract terms help avoid inefficiencies in contracting that result from human and
processing errors. Standardized terms also facilitate the development of infrastructure
technologies that facilitate the prompt and accurate clearance and settlement of security-based
swaps. 1627 Mandatory clearing may also have the effect of reducing total transaction costs by
eliminating obscured margin-related pricing that customers may otherwise incur in connection
with non-cleared instruments. As with standardization, this would promote inter-dealer
competition. However, dealers may take other actions to offset lost revenues resulting from the
shift from non-cleared to cleared instruments. Separate from these considerations, several
analyses have been conducted suggesting that mandatory clearing would increase the overall
margin costs associated with security-based swap transactions compared to the margin market
participants would post in the absence of a clearing requirement, though the estimates of the
aggregate cost to market participants vary widely. 1628

On the other hand, mandatory clearing of certain security-based swaps may reduce the
use of security-based swaps to manage the risks associated with other financial products or
commercial activity. This could occur if margin requirements prove too burdensome and make
cleared transactions expensive relative to alternative means of risk management.
3. Programmatic Benefits and Costs of Proposed Rule 3Ca-3
As discussed above, the Commission is proposing Rule 3Ca-3 to apply the mandatory
clearing requirement of Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 1629 to cross-border security-based
swap transactions. Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) specifies the security-based swap transactions to
which the mandatory clearing requirement would apply, and proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b) carves out
certain security-based swap transactions from application of the mandatory clearing
requirement. 1630
Specifically, under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a), the mandatory clearing requirement would
apply to a person that engages in a security-based swap transaction if such person engages in a
security-based swap transaction in the United States. The Commission would view a person to
be engaging in a security-based swap transaction in the United States if a security-based swap
transaction involves (i) a counterparty that is a U.S. person; (ii) a counterparty that is a non-U.S.
person whose performance under such security-based swap transaction is guaranteed by a U.S.
person (hereinafter referred to as a “guaranteed non-U.S. person”); or (iii) such security-based
swap transaction is a transaction conducted within the United States. 1631 Under proposed Rule
3Ca-3(b), the mandatory clearing requirement would not apply to (i) a security-based swap
transaction described in proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) that is not a transaction conducted within the
United States if (x) one counterparty is a foreign branch or a guaranteed non-U.S. person and (y)
the other counterparty to the transaction is a non-U.S. person whose performance under the
security-based swap is not guaranteed by a U.S. person (hereinafter referred to as “nonguaranteed non-U.S. persons”) and who is not a foreign security-based swap dealer as defined in
proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(3) under the Exchange Act, and would not apply to (ii) a security-based
amount to between $100 billion and $200 billion, and may be higher if mutual recognition is not
common among CCPs); see also Letter from Robert Pickel, Chief Executive Officer, ISDA, and
Kenneth Bentsen, EVP, Public Policy and Advocacy, SIFMA, to David Stawick, Secretary,
CFTC, at 35–37, Sept. 14, 2012 (estimating that the initial margin call for all swap products
would be $193 billion to financial entities and $428 billion to dealers, and that variation margin
calls would total $320 billion to financial entities and $80 billion to dealers, further noting that
anywhere from $20 to $228 billion in additional liquidity would be necessary to meet the
variation margin calls).

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(a)(1).

1630

This is similar to the proposed approach for the mandatory trade execution requirement. See
Section XV.G.4, infra.

1631

See proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) under the Exchange Act. The terms “transaction conducted within
the United States” and “U.S. person” would have the meanings set forth in proposed Rules 3a713(a)(5) and (7) under the Exchange Act.

489

swap transaction described in proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) that is a transaction conducted within the
United States if (x) both counterparties to the transaction are non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons
and (y) neither counterparty to the transaction is a foreign security-based swap dealer, as defined
in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(3) under the Exchange Act. 1632
Therefore, proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) and proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b) apply the mandatory
clearing requirement to security-based swap transactions in the cross-border context based on the
U.S.-person status of a counterparty, the existence of a guarantee provided by a U.S. person, the
registered security-based swap dealer status of a non-U.S. person counterparty, and the location
where the transaction is conducted. Taken together, proposed Rules 3Ca-3(a) and 3Ca-3(b)
would not apply the mandatory clearing requirement to (i) transactions conducted outside the
United States between two counterparties who are non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons, (ii)
transactions conducted outside the United States between a foreign branch or a guaranteed nonU.S. person, and a counterparty who is a non-guaranteed non-U.S. person and is not a foreign
security-based swap dealer, and (iii) transactions conducted within the United States between
two counterparties who are non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons and are not foreign security-based
swap dealers.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the combined effect of the proposed Rules
3Ca-3(a) and (b) described above would be that non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons who are not
security-based swap dealers may engage in security-based swap transactions with each other
both within and without the United States without being subject to the Commission’s mandatory
clearing requirement. These non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons that are not security-based swap
dealers may include non-U.S. persons that are swap dealers, major swap participants, major
security-based swap participants, commodity pools, private funds, employee benefit plans, or
persons predominantly engaged in activities that are banking or financial in nature, as defined in
Section 4(k) of the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956. 1633 Such non-U.S. persons would also
be able to engage in security-based swap transactions without being subject to the mandatory
clearing requirement when the transaction is conducted outside the United States with U.S.
persons that are foreign branches of U.S. banks or guaranteed non-U.S. persons or transacting
with a foreign security-based swap dealer whose performance under security-based swaps is not
guaranteed by a U.S. person. 1634 As discussed below, 1635 the Commission preliminarily believes

1632

See proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b) under the Exchange Act.

1633

12 U.S.C. 1843(k).

1634

In addition, transactions that are subject to the mandatory clearing requirement by operation of
the proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) and (b) may be excepted from the mandatory clearing requirement if
the end-user exception is applicable. See Section 3C(g)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c3(g)(1). Therefore, the combined effects of the proposed Rule 3Ca-3 may be affected by the
implementation of the end-user exception to the mandatory clearing requirement. The
Commission has proposed, but not yet adopted, Rule 3Cg-1 under the Exchange Act regarding
the end-user exception to mandatory clearing of security-based swaps. See End-User Exception
Proposing Release, 75 FR 79992.

490

that the exclusion of transactions between two non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons who are not
foreign security-based swap dealers could potentially reduce the aggregate programmatic costs
associated with the mandatory clearing requirement. However, these non-guaranteed non-U.S.
persons, despite their status of not being foreign security-based swap dealers, may be financial
entities that play significant roles in the U.S. or a foreign financial system and their failure may
present spillover effect on the stability of the U.S. financial system and security-based swap
market.
(a) Programmatic Effect of Proposed Rule 3Ca-3
It is not possible to quantify the potential programmatic effect of proposed Rule 3Ca-3 on
the future volume of security-based swap transactions when the mandatory clearing requirement
becomes effective partly because the Commission has not made any mandatory clearing
determinations, partly because the Commission has yet to finalize the end-user exception to the
mandatory clearing requirement, 1636 and partly because we do not know future trading volumes
of security-based swaps. However, the Commission has examined the data available to it to
analyze the potential programmatic effects of proposed Rule 3Ca-3. In particular, the
Commission has tried to analyze the effects of proposed Rule 3Ca-3 by looking at the portion of
single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions that may provide an indication of the size of the
security-based swap market that may be included in or excluded from the application of the
mandatory clearing requirement as a result of proposed Rule 3Ca-3.
A limitation we face when analyzing the data in order to estimate the size of the securitybased swap market that may be affected by proposed Rule 3Ca-3 is that the domicile
classifications in the DTCC-TIW database are not identical to the counterparty status or
transaction status, both of which are described in proposed Rules 3Ca-3(a) and (b) and would
trigger application of, or an exception from, the mandatory clearing requirement. Although the
information provided by the data in the DTCC-TIW does not allow us to identify the existence of
a guarantee provided by a U.S. person with respect to a counterparty to a transaction or the
location where the transaction is conducted, the Commission nevertheless preliminarily believes
that the approach taken below would provide the best available estimate of the size of the
security-based swap market that could be included in or excluded from the application of the
mandatory clearing requirement by proposed Rule 3Ca-3.
As a starting point, the Commission has examined all transactions in single-name CDS
during 2011 1637 and estimated that the notional amount of single-name CDS transactions

1635

See Section XV.F.3(b), infra (discussing the programmatic benefits and costs of proposed Rule
3Ca-3).

1636

See id.

1637

For purposes of analyzing the programmatic effect of proposed Rule 3Ca-3, we do not consider
historical data regarding the U.S. index-based CDS transactions. The statutory definition of
security-based swap in relevant part includes swaps based on single securities or on narrow-based
security indices. See Section 3(a)(68)(A) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78c(a)(68)(A). The

491

executed during 2011 is $2,400 billion.1638 Proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) provides that the mandatory
clearing requirement shall apply to a security-based swap transaction if (i) a counterparty to the
transaction is a U.S. person or a non-U.S. person whose performance under the security-based
swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person or (ii) such transaction is a transaction conducted within the
United States. In applying proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) to the $2,400 billion single-name CDS
transactions executed in 2011, the Commission uses account holders and their domicile
information in the DTCC-TIW database to determine the status of the counterparties. 1639
Because the Commission’s proposed definition of “U.S. person” is based primarily on the place
historical data regarding the U.S. index-based CDS transactions encompass broad-based index
CDS transactions that do not fall within the definition of security-based swaps.
1638

This estimate is based on the calculation by staff of the Division of Risk, Strategy and Financial
Innovation of all price-forming DTCC-TIW single-name CDS transactions that are based on
North American corporate reference entities, U.S. municipal reference entities, U.S. loans or
mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), using ISDA North American documentation, ISDA U.S.
Muni documentation, or other standard ISDA documentation for North American Loan CDS and
CDS on MBS, and are denominated in U.S. dollars and executed in 2011. Price-forming
transactions include all new transactions, assignments, modifications to increase the notional
amounts of previously executed transactions, and terminations of previously executed
transactions. Transactions terminated, transactions entered into in connection with a compression
exercise, and expiration of contracts at maturity are not considered price-forming and are
therefore excluded, as are replacement trades and all bookkeeping-related trades. See note 1312,
supra.
This figure differs from the single-name CDS notional volume calculated in the Clearing
Procedures Adopting Release, $2,800 billion, by $400 billion. See Clearing Procedures Adopting
Release, 77 FR at 41638; see also Section XV.F.2(a) (discussing the programmatic effects of the
mandatory clearing requirement), supra. This difference is primarily a result of removing the
notional amount of security-based swap terminations in 2011 from the set of $2,800 billion priceforming transactions.

1639

For purposes of the analysis here, the determination of an account holder’s domicile is based on
the “registered office location” and the “settlement location” self-reported by account holders in
DTCC-TIW. The registered office location typically represents the place of organization or
principal place of business of a DTCC-TIW account holder. The settlement location may
represent the parent, headquarter, or home office of a DTCC-TIW account holder. Staff in the
Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation has consistently observed that DTCC-TIW
recorded the place of organization of an account holder that is a foreign subsidiary of a U.S.
person or a foreign branch as such account holder’s registered office location and the parent
location or headquarter of the foreign branch (i.e., the United States) as such account holder’s
settlement location. For purposes of identifying a counterparty’s U.S. person status in the
analysis here, staff in the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation uses the registered
office location in DTCC-TIW as the domicile for a foreign subsidiary of a U.S. person and the
settlement office location in DTCC-TIW as the domicile for a foreign branch. It is possible that
some market participants may misclassify their “registered office location” and the “settlement
location” because the databases in DTCC-TIW do not assign a unique legal entity identifier to
each separate entity.

place of business and place of organization are usually in the same country, the Commission
believes that the domicile of a legal person is a reliable indicator of such person’s U.S.-person
status. In addition, based on the Commission’s understanding that the security-based swap
transactions of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. entities, unless sufficiently capitalized to have their
own independent credit ratings, are generally guaranteed by the most creditworthy U.S.-based
entity within the corporate group, i.e., the U.S. parent, the Commission preliminarily believes
that it is reasonable to assume that foreign subsidiaries of U.S.-domiciled entities are non-U.S.
persons whose performance under security-based swap transactions is guaranteed by a U.S.
person. Finally, the DTCC-TIW data do not provide sufficient information for us to identify
whether a transaction was conducted in the United States. Solely for purposes of this analysis,
we have assumed that transactions involving a U.S.-domiciled counterparty (excluding a foreign
branch) or a U.S. foreign branch counterparty were conducted in the United States. 1640
Based on these assumptions, we estimate that the subset of the single-name U.S.
reference CDS market that includes a U.S.-domiciled counterparty (excluding a foreign branch
of a U.S. bank), a foreign subsidiary of a U.S.-domiciled entity, or a U.S. branch of a foreign
bank as a counterparty is $1,900 billion notional amount of single-name U.S. reference CDS
transactions. 1641 The Commission preliminarily believes that this figure provides an indicative
level of the single-name U.S. reference CDS activity, which may present an indicative size of the
security-based swap market, that could become subject to mandatory clearing under proposed
Rule 3Ca-3(a) when the requirement becomes effective. 1642 In addition, we recognize that the

1640

Since the origination location of a transaction is not available in DTCC-TIW, the Commission
recognizes that its analysis here may undercount transactions conducted within the United States
because some transactions may be solicited, negotiated, or executed within the United States by
an agent other than U.S. branches of foreign banks (such as a non-U.S. person counterparty using
an unaffiliated third-party agent).

1641

Such $1,900 billion estimate does not capture transactions between two non-U.S. domiciled
counterparties involving an agent to solicit, negotiate and execute security-based swaps in the
United States and therefore, may be an underestimate of the aggregate notional amount of the
single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions that may be included in the application of the
mandatory clearing requirement under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) because of the assumption we
make herein regarding transactions conducted within the United States. By the same token, the
difference between the $1,900 billion subset included in the application of the mandatory clearing
requirement under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) and the $2,400 billion total single-name U.S.
reference CDS transactions (i.e., $500 billion or 20.8% of the $2,400 billion) may represent an
overestimate of single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions in notional amount that are not
included in the application of the mandatory clearing requirement under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a).

1642

The Commission recognizes that the security-based swap market includes single-name CDS,
CDS based on narrow-based indices, and other non-CDS security-based swaps, primary examples
of which are equity swaps and total return swaps based on single equities or narrow-based indices
of equities. As previously stated, we believe that the single-name CDS data are sufficiently
representative of the security-based swap market as roughly 82% of the security-based swap

493

level of the security-based swap activity that could become subject to mandatory clearing under
proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) may be affected by the final rules adopted by the Commission regarding
the end-user exception to mandatory clearing of security-based swaps. 1643
Next, we apply proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b) to the transactions described above in order to
estimate the portion of the single-name U.S. reference CDS activity, which may present an
indicative size of the security-based swap market, that would not be subject to the mandatory
clearing requirement under the proposed rule. We restate the assumptions described above with
respect to the counterparty status of a U.S. person and a non-U.S. person whose performance
under security-based swap transactions is guaranteed by a U.S. person, and the assumption with
respect to a transaction conducted within the United States. In addition, because of a lack of
information about the location of transactions, solely for assessing the effect of proposed Rule
3Ca-3(b)(i), we have assumed that transactions between a counterparty that is a foreign branch or
foreign subsidiary of a U.S.-domiciled entity and another counterparty that is a foreign-domiciled
entity that is not a subsidiary of a U.S.-domiciled entity or an ISDA-recognized dealer are not
transactions conducted within the United States; and solely for assessing the effect of proposed
rule 3Ca-3(b)(ii), we have assumed that transactions conducted between two foreign-domiciled
counterparties that are not ISDA-recognized dealers and are not foreign subsidiaries of U.S.domiciled entities are conducted within the United States. These assumptions likely overestimate
the notional volume carved-out by proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b). With respect to the counterparty
status as a registered security-based swap dealer, we recognize that as yet there are no dealers
designated as security-based swap dealers and subject to the registration requirement. Solely for
purposes of this analysis, we have assumed that those counterparties to CDS transactions that
were ISDA recognized dealers 1644 would be required to register as security-based swap dealers.
Based on the above assumptions, we have estimated that approximately 2.1% of the total
notional amount 1645 of single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions executed in 2011, would be
excluded from the scope of the application of the mandatory clearing requirement by proposed
market, as measured on a notional basis, appears likely to be single-name CDS. See Section
XV.B.2 and the text accompanying note 1301, supra.
1643

Solely for purposes of this analysis, we assume that the end-user exception is not available for
transactions included in the indicative volume estimated here.

1644

See note 1306, supra.

1645

Based on calculations by staff of the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation
applying the criteria provided in proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b) and the assumptions stated herein,
approximately $51 billion in notional amount, constituting approximately 2.1% of the total
notional amount, of single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions executed in 2011 would be
excluded from the application of the mandatory clearing requirement. Because of the
assumptions we make herein regarding transactions conducted within the United States and
transactions conducted outside the United States, the 2.1% may be an overestimate of the
aggregate notional amount of the single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions that may be
excluded from the application of the mandatory clearing requirement under proposed Rule 3Ca3(b) under the Exchange Act.

494

Rule 3Ca-3(b). Therefore, we preliminarily believe that 22.9% of the total size of the singlename U.S. reference CDS transactions in 2011 presents an indicative size of the U.S. securitybased swap market that could be excluded from the application of the mandatory clearing
requirement under proposed Rule 3Ca-3. 1646
The Commission preliminarily believes that this estimate provides the best available
proxy for the overall programmatic effect of the application of the mandatory clearing
requirement in the cross-border context in terms of the portion of the single-name U.S. reference
CDS activity that may be included or excluded in the scope of the application of the mandatory
clearing requirement, given the data limitations and the underlying assumptions described
above. 1647 The Commission is mindful that the above analysis represents only an indicative
estimate of the portion of the single-name U.S. reference CDS activity, which may present an
indicative size of the security-based swap market, that may be included or excluded from the
scope of the application of the mandatory clearing requirement as a result of the proposed Rule
3Ca-3. The Commission also recognizes that the above analysis represents an extrapolation from
the limited data that is currently available to the Commission.
(b) Programmatic Benefits and Costs of Proposed Rule 3Ca-3
The Commission’s approach to application of the mandatory clearing requirement
generally focuses on any person engaging in a security-based swap in the United States. As
stated above, the Commission would preliminarily interpret the statutory language “engage in a
security-based swap” to include transactions in which a counterparty performs any of the
functions that are central to carrying out a security-based swap transaction (i.e., solicitation,
negotiation, execution, or booking of the transaction) within the United States. The Commission
proposes to interpret that a transaction in which one of the counterparties is a U.S. person is a
security-based swap in the United States. The Commission also is proposing to interpret the
statutory language “engage in a security-based swap” to include transactions in which a U.S.
1646

The 22.9% estimate is the sum of the 20.8% estimate of the single-name U.S. reference CDS
transactions excluded from mandatory clearing under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a) and the 2.1%
estimate of the single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions excluded from mandatory clearing
under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b). The Commission reiterates that both 20.8% and 2.1% may
overestimate the size of the single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions excluded from the
application of the mandatory clearing requirement under proposed Rules 3Ca-3(a) and (b).
In addition, as stated above, this calculation is conducted using U.S. reference single-name CDS
transaction data in 2011. See the text accompanying notes 1637 and 1787, supra. The
Commission recognizes that the same calculation could generate a different result if both U.S.
reference and non-U.S. reference single-name CDS transaction data were used. However, with
respect to non-U.S. reference single-name CDS transaction data, the Commission currently does
not have access to the part of such data in DTCC-TIW regarding non-U.S. reference single-name
CDS transactions that do not involve a U.S. counterparty on either side of the transaction. See
Section XV.B.2, supra.

1647

The Commission reiterates that the assumptions made here are solely for purposes of this
economic analysis.

person provides a guarantee on a non-U.S. person’s performance under a security-based swap
because of the involvement of the U.S. person in the transaction. Therefore, the Commission is
proposing a rule that would apply the mandatory clearing requirements to a security-based swap
if (i) a counterparty to the security-based swap transaction is (x) a U.S. person or (y) a non-U.S.
person counterparty whose performance of obligations under the security-based swap is
guaranteed by a U.S. person, or (ii) such transaction is a transaction conducted within the United
States, subject to certain exceptions.
Economically, a U.S. person’s security-based swap activity poses risk to the U.S.
financial system because security-based swap transactions give rise to ongoing obligations on the
part of the U.S. person and at the same time the U.S. person is exposed to the credit risk of its
non-U.S. counterparties. Similarly, a guarantee provided by a U.S. person gives the counterparty
of the guaranteed entity direct recourse to the U.S. guarantor with respect to any obligations
owed by the guaranteed entity under the security-based swap. As a result, the U.S. guarantor
exposes itself to the security-based swap risk as if it were a direct counterparty. Therefore, the
Commission preliminarily believes that U.S. persons and non-U.S. person whose performance in
security-based swap transactions is guaranteed by U.S. persons serve as major conduits of
systemic risk to the U.S. financial system, and therefore, transactions involving U.S. persons and
non-U.S. persons whose performance under security-based swaps are guaranteed by U.S. persons
should fall within the scope of application of the mandatory clearing requirement, regardless of
where the security-based swap activity takes place.
On the other hand, as previously discussed, 1648 the Commission has acknowledged that
subjecting U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons whose performance in security-based swap
transactions is guaranteed by U.S. persons to these requirements may have key consequences for
competition, liquidity, and efficiency, and for U.S. persons’ access to the foreign security-based
swap market.
To the extent that foreign law does not subject participants in the foreign security-based
swap market to mandatory clearing or impose margin requirements on non-cleared securitybased swaps equivalent to margin that would be required by CCPs, this requirement under Title
VII may make it more costly for non-U.S. persons to transact with U.S. person and guaranteed
non-U.S. person counterparties because these transactions may be subject to higher margin
requirements imposed by CCPs than under foreign law. This may make it difficult for U.S.
persons and guaranteed non-U.S. persons to access foreign markets and liquidity provided by
non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons, and could generate incentives for U.S. persons and guaranteed
non-U.S. persons to restructure their security-based swap businesses to fall outside the scope of
Title VII. In such instances, the incentive to restructure operations may decrease if foreign
jurisdictions impose margin requirements on non-cleared security-based swaps. If these margin
requirements on non-cleared security-based swaps are economically equivalent to or higher than
CCP margin requirements for cleared security-based swaps, restructuring operations would
provide few private benefits for market participants.
1648

See Section XV.C, supra,

496

The Commission preliminarily believes that the carve-out in Rule 3Ca-3(b)(1) excludes
from the mandatory clearing requirement those transactions involving foreign branches and
guaranteed non-U.S. persons who are most likely to engage in transactions under foreign law.
Such a carve-out reduces potential disruption to the foreign business of U.S. persons and
guaranteed non-U.S. persons in the foreign security-based swap market. 1649 These benefits come
at the cost of increased systemic risk. The counterparty risk associated with non-cleared
transactions that involve foreign branches and guaranteed non-U.S. persons is ultimately borne
by the U.S. financial system.
The incremental increase in systemic risk would likely be small, since the carve-out in
proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b)(1) does not apply to security-based swap dealers. Moreover, as
mentioned before, the magnitude of these risks may be further reduced by subjecting non-cleared
security-based swap positions to margin requirements that are economically equivalent to margin
requirements imposed by a CCP. However, the transactions carved-out by proposed Rule 3Ca3(b)(1) remain a route over which systemic risk may enter the United States from abroad.
In addition, the Commission recognizes that, in the case of counterparty risk and central
clearing, the location of a transaction is not necessarily a proxy for the U.S. market’s exposure to
counterparty risk. As a result, proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b)(2) would except transactions conducted
within the United States between two non-U.S. persons who are not security-based swap dealers
and whose performance under security-based swap transactions are not guaranteed by U.S.
persons. The Commission preliminarily believes that such an exception could potentially reduce
the aggregate programmatic costs associated with the mandatory clearing requirement to nonU.S. participants that engage in security-based swap transactions within the United States. The
Commission recognizes that non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons who are not foreign securitybased swap dealers may include financial entities that are systemically important, such as major
swap participants or major security-based swap participants, or otherwise play an important role
in the U.S. or a foreign financial system or the derivatives market, such as swap dealers,
commodity pools, private funds, or banking entities that are financial holding companies. The
failure of such financial entities, although they are non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons, may have
spillover effects on the U.S. financial system. Such spillover effects may be mitigated by the
capital and margin requirements imposed on swap dealers, major swap participants, or major
security-based swap participants, the prudential regulators’ supervision under banking
regulations, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 1650 or other applicable law
and regulations.
On the other hand, the Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposed
application of the mandatory clearing requirement in the cross-border context would still
mitigate the U.S. financial system’s exposure to systemic risk since the carve-out in proposed
Rule 3Ca-3(b)(2) would not apply to participants that are registered security-based swap dealers
and those that carry U.S. guarantees on their performance in security-based swap transactions.

497

The Commission has separately considered the potential implications of this exception on
competition and efficiency in the security-based swap market. 1651 Specifically, the Commission
preliminarily believes that imposing mandatory clearing on U.S. persons, guaranteed non-U.S.
persons and foreign security-based swap dealers when they conduct security-based swaps in the
United States will mitigate the counterparty credit risk among trading counterparties and increase
confidence in trading security-based swaps, thereby increasing competition in the U.S. securitybased swap market.
(c) Alternatives
The Commission has considered several alternatives in proposing Rule 3Ca-3. First,
commenters proposed an alternative framework in which transactions that are “required to be
cleared under foreign law” not be “required to be cleared under [Title VII].” 1652 Commenters
noted, for example, that conflicts may arise between Title VII and “foreign laws that require
swaps to be cleared through local clearinghouses.” 1653 Another comment stated that mandatory
clearing “is not necessary to protect U.S. financial institutions, markets or customers” where
mandatory clearing requirements are imposed by foreign law because “the risks associated with
such transactions reside in the relevant foreign central clearing counterparty.” 1654
The Commission preliminarily believes that the commenters’ proposed approach to the
mandatory clearing of cross-border security-based swap transactions would not sufficiently
address the risk to the U.S. financial system posed by transactions being conducted by non-U.S.
persons, 1655 and accordingly seeks comment on whether this preliminary assessment is correct.
Whether a security-based swap transaction that is cleared under foreign law represents a risk to
the U.S. financial system depends upon whether the foreign jurisdiction has a robust legal
framework for the regulation of, and maintains adequate regulatory oversight over, CCPs.
Although the Commission recognizes that this alternative may reduce costs to counterparties, the
Commission cannot at this time assess the quality of regulation of foreign CCPs. Rather than
categorically exclude from the scope of the proposed rule any transaction required to be cleared
under foreign law, the Commission preliminarily believes that such transactions should be
captured by the rule to further the purposes of Title VII to, among other things, mitigate systemic
risk. Determinations regarding substituted compliance and determinations imposing mandatory
clearing could address whether and when to include or exclude transactions from the mandatory
clearing requirement based on the particular characteristics of the foreign regulatory regime,
counterparties, or swap instruments in question.

1655

The Commission notes that commenters’ concerns regarding a potential conflict arising between
foreign law requirements that security-based swaps be cleared locally and Title VII are, in part,
also addressed by the registration regime for clearing agencies proposed in Section V.B above.

498

Second, the Commission could have proposed to apply the mandatory clearing
requirement in the same way as the CFTC’s proposed interpretive guidance. The CFTC would
apply the mandatory clearing requirement to a transaction conducted outside the United States
between a foreign branch and a non-guaranteed non-U.S. person. Although we recognize that
the guarantees provided by U.S. persons remain a conduit for systemic risk to be transmitted to
the United States, the Commission preliminarily believes that subjecting such a transaction to
mandatory clearing would impede the ability of U.S.-based dealing entities to access foreign
markets and potentially promote market fragmentation.
Finally, and in lieu of the proposed rule, the Commission could have proposed Rule 3Ca3(a) only to apply the mandatory clearing requirement contained in Section 3C(a)(1) of the
Exchange Act, without also proposing the carve-out in proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b). The
Commission preliminarily believes, however, that proposed Rule 3Ca-3(a), acting alone, does
not sufficiently account for the proposed approach’s potential effect on competition between
security-based swap market participants, as required under Section 3C(b)(4) of the Exchange
Act. 1656 As discussed above, market participants seeking to avoid clearing of cross-border
security-based swaps may avoid doing business with members of clearing agencies registered
with the Commission, U.S. persons who provide guarantees on performance under such swaps,
or the foreign branches of U.S. persons, to avoid being subject to the mandatory clearing
requirement. This may also create dislocations in the security-based swap market, reducing the
anticipated risk-sharing benefits of clearing. As mentioned above, the Commission preliminarily
believes that these benefits would come at the cost of increased risk that counterparty failures in
foreign jurisdictions generate losses to U.S. financial market participants engaging in uncleared
security-based swap transactions under Rule 3Ca-3(b).
(d) Assessment Costs
The assessment costs associated with proposed Rule 3Ca-3 would be primarily related to
identification of counterparty status and where the transaction was conducted in order to
determine whether the mandatory clearing requirement would apply. The same assessment
would be performed not only in connection with the proposed application of the mandatory
clearing requirement in the cross-border context but also in connection with proposed application
of the SDR reporting, 1657 real-time reporting, 1658and mandatory trade execution requirements 1659
in the cross-border context, and therefore, would be part of overall Title VII compliance costs.
1656

See 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(b)(4) (requiring the Commission, in considering whether to impose a
mandatory clearing requirement for security-based swaps, to consider, among other factors, the
“effect on competition”).

1657

See proposed Rule 908(a) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section VIII.C.1, supra, and
Section XV.H.3(a), infra.

1658

See proposed Rule 908(b) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section VIII.C.2, supra, and
Section XV.H.3(c), infra.

1659

See proposed Rule 3Ch-1 under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section X.B, supra, and
Section XV.G.4, infra.

499

We preliminarily believe that market participants would request representations from
their transaction counterparties to determine the U.S.-person status of their counterparties. In
addition, if the transaction is guaranteed by a U.S. person, the guarantee would be part of the
trading documentation, and therefore the existence of the guarantee would be a readily
ascertainable fact. Similarly, market participants would be able to rely on their counterparty’s
representation as to whether a transaction is solicited, negotiated or executed by a person within
the United States. 1660 Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the assessment
costs associated with proposed Rule 3Ca-3 should be limited to the costs of establishing a
compliance policy and procedure for requesting and collecting representations from trading
counterparties and maintaining the representations collected as part of the recordkeeping
procedures. The Commission preliminarily believes that such assessment costs would be
approximately $15,160. 1661 The Commission preliminarily believes that requesting and
collecting representations would be part of the standardized transaction process reflected in the
policies and procedures regarding security-based swap sales and trading practices and should not
result in separate assessment costs. 1662
We also consider the likelihood that market participants may implement systems to
maintain information about counterparty status for purposes of future trading of security-based
swaps that are similar to, if not the same as, the systems implemented by market participants for
purposes of assessing security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
status. As stated above, we estimated that market participants that perceived the need to perform
the security-based swap dealer assessment or major security-based swap participant calculations
would incur one-time programming costs of 12,870. 1663 Therefore, the Commission estimates
1660

See proposed Rules 3a71-3(a)(4)(ii) and (a)(5)(ii) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in
Section III.B.6, supra.

1661

This estimate is based on an estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s time to
establish a procedure of requesting and collecting representations from trading counterparties,
taking into account that such representation may be built into the form of standardized trading
documentation. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour-work year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff
estimates that the average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379.

1662

There will be ongoing costs associated with processing representations received from
counterparties, including additional due diligence and verification to the extent that a
counterparty’s representation is contrary to or inconsistent with the knowledge of the collecting
party. The Commission believes that these would be compliance costs encompassed within the
programmatic costs associated with substituted compliance.

1663

This is based on an estimate of the time required for a programmer analyst to modify the software
to track the U.S.-person status of a counterparty and to record and classify whether a transaction
is a transaction conducted within the United States, including consultation with internal
personnel, and an estimate of the time such personnel would require to ensure that these
modifications conformed to proposed definitions of U.S. person and transaction conducted within
the United States. Using the estimated hourly costs described above, we estimate the costs as
follows: (Compliance Attorney at $310 per hour for 2 hours) + (Compliance Manager at $269 per

500

the total one-time costs per entity associated with proposed Rule 3Ca-3 could be $28,030. 1664 To
the extent that market participants have incurred costs relating to similar or the same assessments
with respect to counterparty status and location of the transactions for other Title VII
requirements, their assessment costs with respect to proposed Rule 3Ca-3 may be less.
Request for Comment
The costs and benefits of the proposed rule discussed above represent the Commission’s
preliminary view regarding the mandatory clearing requirement in the cross-border context. The
Commission seeks comment on the proposed rule in all aspects. Interested persons are
encouraged to provide supporting data and analysis and, when appropriate, suggest modifications
to proposed rule text and interpretations. Responses that are supported by data and analysis
provide great assistance to the Commission in considering the benefits and costs of proposed
requirements, as well as considering the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed
application. In addition, the Commission seeks comment on the following specific questions:
•

Are there any benefits and costs not discussed herein? If so, please identify, discuss,
analyze, and supply relevant data, information, or statistics regarding any such costs
or benefits?

•

Are the benefits and costs discussed herein accurate? If not, how can the
Commission most accurately assess the benefits and costs arising from the mandatory
clearing requirement and the proposed rule?

•

Are there quantifiable costs associated with either the mandatory clearing requirement
generally or the proposed rule specifically that have not been addressed and should
be? If so, identify and describe them as thoroughly as possible, using relevant data
and statistics where available.

•

To what extent, if any, do the benefits and costs change when comparing the
application of mandatory clearing to security-based swap transactions occurring
within the United States and outside the United States? Is there relevant data not
considered here that would assist the Commission in assessing such potentially
disparate benefits and costs? If so, supply the relevant data, information, or statistics.

dealer? Would the benefits and costs differ significantly if we applied mandatory
clearing requirements to a person who is a member of a registered clearing agency?
Is there relevant data not considered here that would assist the Commission in
assessing such disparate costs and benefits? If so, supply the relevant data,
information, or statistics.

•

(i) The CFTC has proposed to apply the mandatory clearing requirement to all
transactions entered into by U.S.-based swap dealers, including foreign branches and
transactions entered into by foreign affiliates of U.S. persons or non-U.S.-based swap
dealer with U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons guaranteed by U.S. persons, without
differentiating where the swap transactions are conducted within the United States or
outside the United States. Should the Commission adopt the CFTC’s approach to
application of the mandatory clearing requirement in the cross-border context from
the cost and benefit perspective? What are the cost and benefit considerations
associated with taking the CFTC’s approach? (ii) The Commission’s proposed
approach to application of the mandatory clearing requirement differentiates
transactions conducted within the United States and transactions conducted outside
the United States. Is such differentiation appropriate from the cost and benefit
perspective? Has the Commission appropriately considered the costs and benefits
associated with such differentiation? (iii) Are there any other approaches to
application of the mandatory clearing requirement that the Commission should
consider adopting from a cost and benefit perspective?

•

To what extent, if any, should the Commission consider the characteristics of the
underlying reference entity in assessing the benefits and costs flowing from the
mandatory clearing requirement? Are there any other characteristics of a securitybased swap transaction not discussed here that might affect an assessment of the
benefits and costs of imposing a mandatory clearing requirement?
Has the Commission appropriately considered the benefits and costs of the alternative
approaches discussed above for application of the mandatory clearing requirement in
the cross-border context? In answering this question, consider addressing whether the
Commission has appropriately valued the benefits and costs of possible duplicative
clearing requirements and whether the Commission has appropriately valued the
benefits and costs of creating overlap in the regulatory regimes of the United States
and a foreign regulator. Also consider whether the Commission has appropriately
valued the benefits and costs of the possible effects on the competitiveness of persons
subject to the mandatory clearing requirement and those persons carved out or
otherwise excluded from the requirement.

G. The Economic Analysis of Application of Rules Governing Security-Based Swap Trading
in the Cross-Border Context
A key goal of the Dodd-Frank Act is to increase the transparency and oversight of the
OTC derivatives market by, among other things, bringing trading of security-based swaps onto
regulated markets. 1665 Section 763 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the Exchange Act by adding a
mandatory trade execution requirement 1666 and various new statutory provisions governing SB
SEFs. 1667 Specifically, Section 3D(a)(1) of the Exchange Act states that no person may operate a
facility for the trading or processing of security-based swaps, unless the facility is registered as a
SB SEF or as a national securities exchange under that section. 1668 In addition, Section 3C(h)(1)
of the Exchange Act requires, with respect to transactions involving security-based swaps subject
to the mandatory clearing requirement of Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, that
counterparties execute such transactions on an exchange or a SB SEF that is registered under
Section 3D of the Exchange Act or is exempt from registration under Section 3D(e) of the
Exchange Act, 1669 subject to the exceptions set forth in Section 3C(h)(2) of the Exchange
Act. 1670
This portion of the economic analysis addresses the programmatic benefits and costs
associated with these statutory requirements and their proposed application in the cross-border
context. Specifically, this section addresses the programmatic benefits and costs of: (1) the
Commission’s proposed interpretation of the application of the registration requirements of
Section 3D of the Exchange Act to foreign security-based swap markets; (2) the potential
availability to foreign security-based swap markets of exemptive relief from the registration
requirements; (3) the mandatory trade execution requirement of Section 3C(h) of the Exchange

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, § 763(a) (adding Section 3D(a)(1) of the Exchange Act). The
Commission views this requirement as applying only to facilities that meet the definition of

SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10949 n.10.

1669

See 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(h)(1). Section 3D(e) of the Exchange Act states that the Commission may
exempt, conditionally or unconditionally, a SB SEF from registration under Section 3D if the
Commission finds that the facility is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and
regulation on a consolidated basis by the CFTC. 15 U.S.C. 78c-4(e).

1670

Section 3C(h)(2) provides two exceptions to compliance with the mandatory trade execution
requirement: (i) if no exchange or SB SEF makes the security-based swap available to trade; or
(ii) for security-based swap transactions subject to the clearing exception under Section 3C(g) of
the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(h)(2). Security-based swaps that are not subject to the
mandatory trade execution requirement would not have to be traded on a registered SB SEF and
could be traded in the OTC market for security-based swaps. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76
FR at 10949 n.10.

Act; and (4) proposed Rule 3Ch-1 regarding application of the mandatory trade execution
requirement in the cross-border context.
1. Programmatic Benefits and Costs of the Proposed Application of the Registration
Requirements of Section 3D of the Exchange Act to Foreign Security-Based
Swap Markets
As discussed above, the Commission has proposed herein to interpret when the
registration requirements of Section 3D of the Exchange Act 1671 would apply to a foreign
security-based swap market. 1672 The Commission is endeavoring to draw the appropriate lines
for the application of those requirements to foreign security-based swap markets when they act in
capacities that meet the definition of “security-based swap execution facility” under the DoddFrank Act. 1673 As stated above, not all foreign security-based swap markets would be subject to
the registration requirements of Section 3D of the Exchange Act and the rules proposed
thereunder. The Commission preliminarily believes that only those foreign security-based swap
markets that engage in certain activities with respect to U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located
in the United States, would be subject to the registration requirements. 1674
The Commission preliminarily believes that the lines the Commission is proposing to
draw with respect to the application of Section 3D’s registration requirements in the cross border
context would result in programmatic benefits for the U.S. security-based swap market as a
whole that are intended by Title VII, i.e., increased pre-trade transparency, increased
competition, and improved oversight. 1675 The Commission also is mindful, however, that certain
costs would be associated with our proposal. The Commission’s consideration and discussion of
the programmatic benefits and costs of the formation and registration of a SB SEF in the SB SEF
Proposing Release did not differentiate between domestic and foreign security-based swap
markets. The Commission notes, however, that the SB SEF Proposing Release contemplated
that foreign security-based swap markets would seek to register as SB SEFs and proposed certain

1671

15 U.S.C. 78c-4.

1672

See Section VII.B., supra. A foreign security-based swap market that would be subject to the
registration requirement of Section 3D of the Exchange Act also would be subject to the proposed
registration rules for SB SEFs, if adopted. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10949.

1673

See Pub. L. No. 111-203, § 761(a) (adding Section 3(a)(77) of the Exchange Act to define
“security-based swap execution facility,” 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(77)). Entities that do not meet the
definition of SB SEF may nonetheless be required to register in another capacity under the
Exchange Act.

1674

See Section VII.B, supra, for the non-exhaustive discussion of activities that the Commission
preliminarily believes would warrant the application of the SB SEF registration requirements to a
foreign security-based swap market.

requirements specifically for non-resident 1676 persons seeking to register as a SB SEF. 1677 The
Commission received no comments on the SB SEF Proposing Release indicating that the
benefits and costs associated with SB SEF registration would be different for foreign and
domestic security-based swap markets. 1678 Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes
that the programmatic benefits and costs associated with a security-based swap market registered
with the Commission as a SB SEF and subject to the requirements set forth in Section 3D of the
Exchange Act, and the proposed rules and regulations thereunder, would be substantially the
same for both a domestic and a foreign security-based swap market. 1679
(a) Programmatic Benefits
The Commission preliminarily believes that application of the statutory registration
requirements and Regulation SB SEF to foreign security-based swap markets that engage in the
activities noted above with respect to U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United
States, 1680 would generate programmatic benefits similar to those described in the SB SEF
Proposing Release with respect to the registration and regulation of SB SEFs, i.e., enhanced
transparency, competition, and oversight of security-based swaps, 1681 which are discussed
below. The Commission also believes that our proposed application of the statutory registration
requirements and Regulation SB SEF to foreign security-based swap markets is appropriately
tailored to extend these benefits to the security-based swap activity that is most likely to raise the
concerns that Congress intended to address in Title VII. 1682 In the Commission’s preliminary
view, a different application could undermine these goals. By way of example and without
1676

See note 834, supra (noting that usage of the term “non-resident,” as well as the term “foreign,” in
connection with a security-based swap market refers to a security-based swap market that is not a
U.S. person).

1677

See note 1697, infra, and accompanying text.

1678

In the SB SEF Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that as many as 20 security-based
swap trading platforms or systems could seek to register with the Commission as SB SEFs. See
SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 11023. No commenter indicated that the Commission’s
estimate was erroneous.

1679

A more detailed description of the benefits and costs associated with the formation and
registration of SB SEFs is set forth in the SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 11035-48. As set
forth in the Request for Comment section below, the Commission invites comment on whether
the benefits and costs associated with SB SEF registration would be the same for domestic and
foreign security-based swap markets.

1680

See Section VII.B, supra.

1681

See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 11036. One commenter on the SB SEF Proposing
Release stated that certain benefits would result from the trading of security-based swaps
occurring on SB SEFs, including narrower bid-ask spreads and lower transaction costs as a result
of increased competition and pre-trade price transparency. See SDMA Letter I at 8-9 and SDMA
Letter II at 2; see also Section XXII, infra.

limitation, if a foreign security-based swap market could provide proprietary electronic trading
screens for the execution or trading of security-based swaps by, or grant membership or
participation in the foreign security-based swap market to, U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons
located in the United States, without being required to register under Section 3D, there could be
security-based swap trading venues available to U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the
United States, that are not subject to Commission regulation and oversight. The regulatory
benefits that the Commission believes Title VII intends to bring to the U.S. security-based swap
market would not be fully realized in such a scenario.
Improved Transparency. The trading of security-based swaps on regulated markets, such
as SB SEFs, should help bring more transparency to the U.S. marketplace for security-based
swaps. Increased pre-trade transparency should help alleviate informational asymmetries that
may exist today in the security-based swap market and allow an increased number of market
participants to see the trading interest of other market participants prior to submitting trades,
which should lead to increased price competition among market participants. 1683 As such, the
Commission preliminarily believes that proposed Regulation SB SEF should lead to more
efficient pricing in the security-based swap market, 1684 but is mindful that, under certain
circumstances, pre-trade transparency also could discourage the provision of liquidity by some
market participants, as discussed in more detail below. 1685
Improved Competition. The Commission preliminarily believes that registration and
regulation of SB SEFs, as described in the SB SEF Proposing Release, also would foster greater
competition in the trading of security-based swaps by increasing access to security-based swap
trading venues. 1686 The proposed SB SEF rules would require SB SEFs to permit all eligible
persons that meet the requirements for becoming participants, as set forth in the SB SEF’s rules,
to become participants in the SB SEF. 1687 The proposed SB SEF rules would require each SB

essentially represent free options to other traders).

1687

Id. at 11037. Proposed Rule 809(a) in Regulation SB SEF would require SB SEFs to permit a
person to become a participant in the SB SEF only if such person is registered with the
Commission as a security-based swap dealer, major security-based swap participant, or broker (as
defined in Section 3(a)(4) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(4)), or if such person is an

506

SEF to establish fair, objective and not unreasonably discriminatory standards for granting
impartial access to trading on the SB SEF. 1688 These proposed requirements are designed to
provide market participants with impartial access. 1689 Having impartial access should, in turn,
promote greater participation by liquidity providers and increased competition on each SB
SEF. 1690 Impartial access requirements also should help guard against the potential for certain
participants in a SB SEF (who also might be owners of the SB SEF) to seek to limit the number
of other participants in the SB SEF as a way to reduce competition and increase their own
profits. 1691
Improved Oversight. As set forth in the SB SEF Proposing Release, the proposed
registration rules for SB SEFs would incorporate the requirement under the Dodd-Frank Act that
a SB SEF, to be registered and maintain registration, must comply with the 14 Core Principles
governing SB SEFs in Section 3D(d) of the Exchange Act 1692 (“Core Principles”) and any
requirement that the Commission may impose by rule or regulation. 1693 The proposed SB SEF
rules and proposed Form SB SEF are intended to implement the statutory registration
requirements and assist the Commission in overseeing and regulating the security-based swap
market. 1694 The information to be provided on proposed Form SB SEF (and the exhibits thereto)
is designed to enable the Commission to assess whether an applicant seeking to become a
registered SB SEF has the capacity and the means to perform the duties of a SB SEF and to
comply with the Core Principles and other requirements governing registered SB SEFs. 1695 In
addition, the amendments, supplemental information and notices that the Commission proposed
to require registered SB SEFs to file pursuant to Rules 802, 803, and 804 of proposed Regulation
SB SEF are designed to further the ability of the Commission to efficiently monitor SB SEFs’
compliance with the provisions of the Exchange Act and to oversee the marketplace for security-

eligible contract participant (as defined in Section 3(a)(65) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(65)).

based swaps and, specifically, the trading of security-based swaps on SB SEFs. 1696 Moreover, as
discussed in the SB SEF Proposing Release, any non-resident persons seeking to register as a SB
SEF must comply with certain requirements, including that such non-resident persons provide
assurances that they are legally permitted to provide the Commission with prompt access to their
books and records and to be subject to inspection and examination by the Commission.1697
Registration and regulation of SB SEFs would require SB SEFs to maintain an audit trail
and surveillance systems to monitor trading. 1698 Proposed Regulation SB SEF also would
require comprehensive reporting and recordkeeping by SB SEFs. 1699 These requirements would
put in place a structure that would provide the SB SEF with information to better enable it to
oversee trading on its market by its participants, including detecting and deterring fraudulent and
manipulative acts. 1700 The proposed rules for SB SEFs also would provide the Commission with
greater access to information on the trading of security-based swaps to support its responsibilities
to oversee the security-based swap market. 1701 Further, the proposed rules for SB SEFs would
enable the Commission to share that information with other federal financial regulators,
including in instances of broad market turmoil. 1702
Improved regulatory oversight could encourage participation in the U.S. security-based
swap market by investors who could benefit from such participation but currently choose to
avoid transacting in that market in part because the market is opaque and largely has not been
subject to oversight by U.S. regulatory authorities. Indeed, to the extent that market participants
consider a well-regulated market as significant to their investment decisions, trust, which is a
component of investor confidence, is improved and market participants may be more willing to
participate in the U.S. security-based swap market. 1703

(b) Programmatic Costs
Although the Commission believes that application of the registration requirements of
Section 3D and proposed Regulation SB SEF to foreign security-based swap markets would
result in significant benefits to the U.S. security-based swap market, the Commission recognizes
that foreign security-based swap markets also would incur significant costs to comply with the
proposed registration requirements for foreign security-based swap markets similar to those that
domestic SB SEFs would incur, as discussed in the Regulation SB SEF proposal. 1704 These costs
are summarized below.
SB SEF Formation. According to industry sources consulted by Commission staff in
connection with the issuance of the SB SEF Proposing Release, the monetary cost of forming a
SB SEF is estimated to range from approximately $15 million to $20 million per SB SEF for the
first year of operation, if an entity were to establish a SB SEF without the benefit of modifying
an already existing trading system. 1705 The industry sources consulted by Commission staff
estimated at that time that, for the SB SEF’s first year of operation, the cost of software and
product development would range from approximately $6.5 million to $10.5 million per SB
SEF. 1706 The technological costs would be expected to decline considerably during the second
and subsequent years of operation, with an estimated range of $3 million to $4 million per year
per SB SEF. 1707
For entities that currently own and/or operate platforms for the trading of security-based
swaps, the cost of forming a SB SEF would be more incremental, given that these entities
already have viable technology that could be modified to comply with the requirements that the

1704

See id. 11040-48. A detailed breakdown of the cost estimates associated with all aspects of SB
SEF formation and compliance with the rules proposed under proposed Regulation SB SEF are
contained in the SB SEF Proposing Release. See id. Moreover, the Commission notes that it has
received comment letters on those cost estimates. See MarketAxess Letter and UBS Letter. One
commenter remarked on the cost estimates in the SB SEF Proposing Release for many of the
individual aspects of SB SEF formation, noting that, in its view, some cost estimates were high
and others were low. See MarketAxess Letter at 15-17. The commenter stated that generally the
estimates in the SB SEF Proposing Release were realistic and that accurate estimates of the true
expected costs of establishing and operating a SB SEF and the hourly rates relied upon for the
estimates were broadly consistent with industry standards. Id. Another commenter urged the
Commission to consider the impact of the Regulation SB SEF proposal on broker-dealers and the
potential costs that could result. See UBS Letter at 3. Neither of these commenters indicated that
the costs associated with SB SEF formation and registration would be different for foreign
security-based swap markets as compared to domestic security-based swap markets.

Commission may impose for SB SEFs. 1708 According to industry sources consulted by
Commission staff in connection with the issuance of the SB SEF Proposing Release, the
incremental costs of enhancing a trading platform to be compatible with any SB SEF
requirements ultimately established by the Commission would range from as low as $50,000 to
as much as $3 million per SB SEF, depending on the enhancements needed to make a particular
platform compatible with the final Commission rules governing SB SEFs. 1709 As noted in the
SB SEF Proposing Release, the annual ongoing cost of maintaining the technology and any
improvements is estimated to be in the range of $2 million to $4 million.1710
In the SB SEF Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that the cost
for an applicant to file Form SB SEF, including all exhibits thereto, would be approximately
$675,297 per SB SEF. 1711
Complying with Core Principles. As is also discussed in the SB SEF Proposing Release,
the regulatory requirement that SB SEFs comply with the statutory Core Principles would
increase the ongoing regulatory obligations of SB SEFs with respect to their operations and
oversight. 1712 Industry sources consulted by Commission staff in connection with the issuance of
the SB SEF Proposing Release estimated that the cost to a SB SEF to comply with the rules
relating to surveillance and oversight that they expect the Commission to propose would be in
the range of $1 million to $3 million annually, with initial costs likely to be at the higher end of
that range, since a SB SEF would need to create the technology necessary to monitor and surveil
its market participants, as well as establish a rulebook that reflects the Core Principles and
related rules. 1713 The ongoing annual compliance costs estimated by those same industry sources
would be approximately $1 million, which would include the salary of a Chief Compliance
Officer and at least two junior compliance personnel, who are expected to be attorneys. 1714
Unquantifiable Costs. The Commission also has considered some costs relating to
registered SB SEFs that are difficult to quantify precisely. 1715 Security-based swaps traded on
registered SB SEFs may be perceived to be subject to increased costs, monetary and otherwise.
1708

Id. Several commenters on the SB SEF Proposing Release that currently operate swap trading
facilities have indicated their intention to register as SB SEFs. See, e.g., Bloomberg Letter; GFI
Letter; MarketAxess Letter; and Tradeweb Letter.

For example, some industry participants expressed their belief that any proposed pre-trade
transparency requirement would force market participants to reveal valuable information
regarding their trading interest more broadly than they believed would be economically prudent,
which in their view could discourage participation in the security-based swap market. 1716 There
are perceived costs associated with frontrunning, if customers or dealers were required to show
their trading interest before a trade is executed. 1717 These potential costs of pre-trade
transparency could change market participants’ trading strategies, which could result in their
working more orders or finding ways to hide their interest. 1718
If market participants viewed the Commission’s proposed Regulation SB SEF as too
burdensome with respect to pre-trade transparency, security-based swap dealers could be less
willing to supply liquidity for security-based swaps that trade on SB SEFs, thus reducing
liquidity and competition. 1719 On the other hand, if the requirement with respect to pre-trade
transparency were too loose, the result could be that there would be no substantive change from
the status quo, and thus no potential reduction in asymmetric information, increase in price
competition, or improvement in executions, beyond the changes in response to the other
requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1720
The import of this concern depends on the degree of pre-trade transparency required and
the characteristics of the trading market. 1721 The proposed rules for SB SEFs are intended to
provide for greater pre-trade transparency than currently exists without requiring pre-trade
transparency in a manner that would cause participants to avoid providing liquidity on SB
SEFs. 1722
An additional unquantifiable cost could result if foreign security-based swap markets
perceive the Commission’s proposed requirements for SB SEFs as too burdensome or
detrimental to their security-based swap business. A foreign security-based swap market that has
such a view and that currently operates in a manner that would cause it to be subject to the SB
SEF registration requirements could decide to restructure its security-based swap business such
that it would not be subject to the SB SEF registration requirements. This result could have
several potential negative implications for participants in the U.S. financial system such as,
among other things, fewer registered venues on which security-based swaps could be executed,
1716

Id. Several commenters on the SB SEF Proposing Release expressed concerns about pre-trade
transparency requirements in the context of block trades. See ABC Letter at 2, 4-5; MFA Letter
III at 7; ISDA SIFMA Letter II at 7; SIFMA AMG Letter II at 4-5; Blackrock Letter at 8; Cleary
Letter III at 20; CME Letter at 3-4; Phoenix Letter at 3-4.

less competition between the remaining SB SEFs, and thus potentially higher costs for such
executions. If restructuring raises trading costs in the domestic security-based swap market,
liquidity could flow away from SB SEFs and U.S. participants could find fewer trading
opportunities and potentially decreased liquidity in the domestic security-based swap market.
(c) Alternatives
The Commission could have proposed a different interpretation regarding registration of
foreign security-based swap markets. For example, the Commission could have interpreted
Section 3D of the Exchange Act broadly to apply the registration requirement to a foreign
security-based swap market that meets the definition of “security-based swap execution
facility,” 1723 regardless of whether such foreign security-based swap market has engaged in any
of the activities, discussed above, with respect to U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the
United States. 1724 The Commission preliminarily believes that, if a foreign security-based swap
market is not engaging in such activities with respect to U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons
located in the United States, then it would not trigger the registration requirements under Section
3D of the Exchange Act.
In addition, the Commission could have interpreted Section 3D of the Exchange Act
more narrowly than proposed herein, such that, for example, the registration requirement would
not apply to a foreign security-based swap market even if it meets the definition of “securitybased swap execution facility” and provides U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the
United States, with proprietary electronic trading screens or similar devices for executing or
trading security-based swaps on its market. The Commission preliminarily believes that such a
narrow interpretation would not accommodate the evolving technological innovation of
electronic trading and the availability of global access to electronic trading platforms, and
therefore could result in U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United States, having
the ability to directly execute or trade security-based swaps on a foreign security-based swap
market that is not subject to the SB SEF registration requirements. As discussed above in this
section, the Commission preliminarily believes that this, in turn, could result in the intended
programmatic benefits of the SB SEF registration requirements, i.e., increased pre-trade
transparency, increased competition, and improved oversight, not being extended to all of the
security-based swap activity that the Commission believes is most likely to raise the concerns
that Congress intended to address in Title VII. 1725
2. Programmatic Benefits and Costs of the Potential Availability of Exemptive
Relief to Foreign Security-Based Swap Markets
As discussed above, the Commission may consider exempting a foreign security-based
swap market from registration as a SB SEF under Section 3D of the Exchange Act if the foreign

security-based swap market is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation
by the appropriate governmental authorities in its home country. 1726 Any foreign security-based
swap market granted such an exemption would be subject to supervision and regulation as a
registered security-based swap market in its home jurisdiction that the Commission has
determined to be comparable to the supervision and regulation of registered SB SEFs. As a
result, the Commission preliminarily believes that the programmatic benefits and costs, as
discussed above, 1727 that would result from subjecting registered SB SEFs to the Commission’s
supervision and regulation also would be realized by any exempted foreign security-based swap
market because of the comparable supervision and regulation of that foreign market by its home
jurisdiction.
While a number of foreign jurisdictions are in the process of developing standards for the
regulation of security-based swaps and the security-based swap market, few foreign jurisdictions
have adopted such standards as yet. 1728 As a result, at this time, the Commission believes that it
does not have a sufficient basis to provide an estimate as to how many foreign security-based
swap markets would be required to register as SB SEFs and potentially be eligible for an
exemption from that requirement because the Commission currently has no basis to determine
whether such foreign security-based swap markets would be subject to comparable,
comprehensive supervision and regulation in their home jurisdictions.
Nevertheless, the Commission believes that certain additional programmatic benefits and
costs could result specifically from an exempted foreign security-based swap market not having
to register as a SB SEF under Section 3D of the Exchange Act while continuing to serve U.S.
security-based swap market participants. These additional benefits and costs are discussed
below.
(a) Programmatic Benefits
Facilitating Cross Border Security-Based Swap Transactions. As discussed above, 1729
following the publication of the SB SEF Proposing Release, the Commission received comments
from the public expressing concerns about the requirements and implications of Section 3D of
the Exchange Act and the Commission’s proposed rules governing SB SEFs for foreign-securitybased swap markets and the global security-based swap market generally. 1730 Several
commenters urged the Commission to work with foreign regulators to develop harmonized rules

for the trading of security-based swaps. 1731 As noted above, the Commission currently is in
discussions with its foreign counterparts to explore steps toward such harmonization. 1732 The
Commission is proposing, as a means to facilitate cross-border security-based swap transactions,
that it may consider exempting a foreign security-based swap market from the registration
requirements under Section 3D in the circumstances described above. 1733 The Commission
preliminarily believes that the potential availability of such an exemption should provide foreign
security-based swap markets operating in the United States with appropriate flexibility with
respect to SB SEF registration when they are subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision
and regulation in their home markets. In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that
the programmatic benefits associated with registration and other requirements for SB SEFs under
Section 3D of the Exchange Act, and rules and regulations thereunder, would not be diminished
as a result of the proposed exemptive relief. Therefore, those U.S. financial system participants
that opt to trade on any exempted foreign security-based swap market operating in the United
States would remain adequately protected because such an exempted foreign market would be
subject to oversight and regulation in a manner comparable to the Commission’s proposed
requirements for SB SEFs.
Reduction in Programmatic Costs Associated with Registration. The Commission
preliminarily believes that the availability of an exemption from SB SEF registration
requirements based on comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation in the foreign
security-based swap market’s home country could serve to reduce any potentially duplicative or
conflicting regulatory burdens faced by security-based swap markets that operate on a crossborder basis and that otherwise would be required to register in both their home country and the
United States. Therefore, to the extent that such foreign security-based swap markets would
qualify for and pursue such an exemption, there could be a reduction in the programmatic costs
that those foreign security-based swap markets otherwise would incur.
One commenter on the SB SEF Proposing Release stated that harmonized rules for
trading security-based swaps would reduce potentially duplicative or conflicting regulatory
burdens. 1734 As noted above, few foreign jurisdictions have enacted legislation or adopted
standards for the regulation of security-based swaps markets, although a number of foreign
jurisdictions are in the process of developing such standards. 1735 As the process of developing
legislation or regulation regarding security-based swaps continues in other jurisdictions, the
Commission believes that the availability of an exemption from the U.S. registration
requirements is a reasonably designed measure to address the potential for conflicting or

unnecessarily duplicative regulatory burdens that could arise from requiring dual registration in
the United States and in a comparably regulated foreign jurisdiction.
For example, a foreign security-based swap market that is registered in a foreign
jurisdiction and that provides U.S. persons, or non-U.S. persons located in the United States, the
ability to execute or trade security-based swaps, or that facilitates the execution or trading of
security-based swaps, on its market could be required to incur the cost of full registration
twice—once to register in the foreign jurisdiction and once more to register as a SB SEF in the
United States—if there was no possibility of obtaining an exemption from the U.S. registration
requirements. As a further example, such a foreign security-based swap market, as a result of its
registration as a SB SEF, would be required to establish rules governing the operation of its
trading facility, including rules specifying trading procedures to be used in entering and
executing orders traded or posted on the facility. 1736 A conflict could arise if, for example, the
U.S. requirements for SB SEFs require the foreign market’s trading rules to allow trading interest
in security-based swaps to be expressed or responded to in a manner that is different from, and
that makes it impossible also to comply with, the foreign jurisdiction’s requirements regarding
trading rules. These examples are not meant to be exhaustive, but rather to be illustrative of
scenarios involving potentially conflicting or unnecessarily burdensome regulation that foreign
security-based swap markets could face, absent an exemption. The Commission preliminarily
believes that the availability of an exemption from registration as a SB SEF should help mitigate
the potential impact of such scenarios. At the same time, as discussed above, the Commission
believes that granting such an exemption to a foreign security-based swap market would not
reduce the programmatic benefits achieved by requiring security-based swap markets to register
as a SB SEF because any exempted foreign market would be comparably supervised and
regulated by its home country.
As stated above, few jurisdictions have adopted standards for the regulation of securitybased swap markets and therefore the Commission does not have a sufficient basis to provide an
estimate as to how many foreign security-based swap markets would request, and potentially
receive, an exemption from registration. 1737 The Commission preliminarily believes that the
estimate in the SB SEF Proposing Release of programmatic costs associated with registration as
a SB SEF would apply equivalently to a foreign security-based swap market that is subject to
Section 3D’s registration requirement.
Any potential exemption from registration (even though the foreign security-based swap
market would incur costs associated with compliance with the comparable regulation in its home
country), could result in minimizing the burden of the programmatic costs associated with
registration as a SB SEF, and so these programmatic costs constitute an upper bound for the
potential cost savings from any such exemption. However, the Commission is not able to
estimate the aggregate reduction in programmatic costs that would be associated with reliance on
any proposed exemption by foreign security-based swap markets.

(b) Programmatic Costs
Compliance with Potential Conditions of Exemption. As discussed above, any grant of
an exemption from the SB SEF registration requirements may be subject to certain appropriate
conditions, which could include, but not be limited to, requiring the exempted foreign securitybased swap market to provide the Commission with prompt access to its books and records,
including, for example, data related to orders, quotes and transactions, as well as providing an
opinion of counsel that, as a matter of law, it is able to provide such access. 1738 The
Commission also could require that the foreign security-based swap market appoint an agent for
service of process in the United States. 1739
The Commission preliminarily believes that the costs associated with a commitment by
the foreign security-based swap market to provide the Commission with access to books and
records would be part of the Commission’s $1 million to $3 million estimate of the annual cost
to a SB SEF to comply with the Commission’s proposed rules relating to surveillance and
oversight, 1740 but would be difficult to quantify separately at this time. The foreign securitybased swap market would maintain books and records in the ordinary course of its business and
in conformance with the requirements of its appropriate regulatory authority. 1741 If, after
issuance of any such exemptive relief, the Commission considered it necessary to have access to
the foreign security-based swap market’s books and records, there would be costs to the foreign
security-based swap market in granting such access, for example, in copying the requested books
and records and supplying them to Commission staff. However, the circumstances that would
prompt any Commission request for access to the foreign security-based swap market’s books
and records and the exact scope of any such request would not be known at the time the

1738

Id.

1739

Id. These potential conditions of an exemption from SB SEF registration requirements for a
foreign security-based swap market – granting the Commission access to its books and records,
providing an opinion of counsel that such access can be granted under the foreign jurisdiction’s
law, and appointing a process agent in the United States – are proposed requirements of SB SEF
registration. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 11000. Thus, a foreign security-based
swap market that is required to register as a SB SEF would incur the costs associated with
complying with these requirements, which costs are included in the estimate provided in Section
XV.G.1(b) above of the cost for an applicant to file Form SB SEF, including all exhibits thereto.
See id. at 11016-17, 11041-42. A foreign security-based swap market that is granted an
exemption from SB SEF registration requirements also could incur the costs of complying with
these requirements to the extent that the Commission imposes them as conditions to the
exemption.

1740

See note 1713 and accompanying text, supra,; see also SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at
11041.

1741

Prior to the issuance of any exemption the foreign security-based swap market could, however,
need to incur the cost of obtaining an opinion of counsel letter stating that it is able to provide
access to its books and records. See Section XV.G.2(d), infra.

516

Commission were to grant an exemption from the requirements of Section 3D of the Exchange
Act.
The Commission believes that the costs for a foreign security-based swap market to
appoint an agent for service of process in the United States would be minimal in circumstances
in which the foreign security-based swap market has a subsidiary or staff in the United States
that is capable of receiving service of process and acting as the foreign market’s appointed agent.
In circumstances in which a foreign security-based swap market must appoint a third party as its
process agent, Commission staff estimates, based on an industry source that provides process
agent services, that the cost to do so would be approximately $400 for the first year and
approximately $300 annually thereafter.
The Commission also believes that an exempted foreign market could incur costs in
complying with any additional conditions that accompany the grant of the exemption, but the
scope of these conditions and the costs associated with them would depend on the specific
circumstances for which the exemption is granted and could vary from foreign jurisdiction to
foreign jurisdiction. As a result, the Commission cannot provide an estimated dollar value of the
costs that would be associated with such additional conditions at this time.
(c) Alternatives
Harmonization with Foreign Counterparts. Apart from interpreting Section 3D of the
Exchange Act to apply to foreign security-based swap markets that engage in certain activities
with respect to U.S. persons or non-U.S. persons located in the United States, 1742 and potentially
providing an exemption from the SB SEF registration requirements for qualifying foreign
security-based swap markets that are covered by Section 3D, 1743 the Commission could adopt the
approach of harmonizing our rules with the rules of foreign jurisdictions. As noted above, few
foreign jurisdictions have enacted legislation or adopted standards for the regulation of securitybased swaps markets, although a number of foreign jurisdictions are in the process of developing
such standards. Accordingly, the Commission preliminarily believes that our proposal to
consider exemptive relief from SB SEF registration for foreign security-based swap markets that
are subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation is a reasonable measure at
this time that acknowledges the cross-border nature of the security-based swap market.
Not Consider Exemptive Relief. The Commission could have determined not to consider
making exemptive relief from Section 3D’s registration requirements available. In such a
scenario, a foreign security-based swap market subject to Section 3D’s registration requirements
would be required to register as a SB SEF—and incur the costs attendant to such registration—
even if it is subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation in its home
jurisdiction. Moreover, without the availability of an exemption, the Commission believes that
there would be a greater potential for such a dually-registered foreign security-based swap
market to face duplicative or conflicting regulatory burdens. The Commission preliminarily
1742

See Section VII.B, supra.

1743

See Section VII.C, supra.

517

believes that considering exemptive relief is a more cost-effective and, for the reasons stated
above, reasonable measure given the cross-border nature of the security-based swap market.
(d) Assessment Costs
A foreign security-based swap market would incur costs in submitting a request or
application for an exemption from the SB SEF registration requirement. The Commission
estimates that the costs of submitting such a request or application would be approximately
$110,320. 1744 The use of internal counsel in lieu of outside counsel would reduce this estimate.
An additional assessment cost that a foreign security-based swap market could incur in
connection with submitting such an exemption request or application would be obtaining an
opinion of counsel letter stating that the foreign security-based swap market is able to give
access to its books and records to the Commission, if the Commission were to include such a
condition in any exemptive relief. The Commission estimates that the cost associated with
obtaining such a letter would be approximately $25,000. 1745
1744

The Commission preliminarily believes that the costs of submitting a request or application for
the proposed exemption would be similar to the costs associated with submitting a request for a
substituted compliance determination, i.e., $110,320. See Section XV.I.3, infra. This estimate is
based on information regarding the average costs associated with preparing and submitting an
application to the Commission for a Commission order for exemptive relief under Section 36 of
the Exchange Act in accordance with the procedures set forth in 17 CFR § 240.0-12. The
Commission estimates that preparation of the request would require approximately 80 hours of
in-house counsel time and 200 hours of outside counsel time. Such estimate takes into account
the time required to prepare supporting documents necessary for the Commission to make a
substituted compliance determination, including, without limitation, information regarding
applicable requirements established by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities, as
well as the methods used by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities to monitor
compliance with these rules. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hourwork-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead), the staff estimates that the average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is
$379. The Commission estimates the costs for outside legal services to be $400 per hour.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates the cost to be $110,320 ($30,320 (based on 80 hours of
in-house counsel time * $379) + $80,000 (based on 200 hours of outside counsel time * $400)) to
submit a request for a substituted compliance determination.

1745

This estimate is based on prior Commission estimates of the cost of obtaining an opinion of
counsel, and assumes that foreign security-based swap dealers would seek outside legal counsel
to prepare the letter at an hourly rate of $400. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 11025,
11042; Registration Proposing Release, 76 FR at 65811; see also note 1744, supra. In the SB
SEF Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that the average initial
paperwork cost for a non-resident SB SEF to provide an opinion of counsel that the SB SEF can,
as a matter of law, provide the Commission with access to its books and records and submit to
onsite inspection and examination by representatives of the Commission would be one hour and
$900 in outside legal costs per non-resident SB SEF. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at

security-based swap entity could provide the Commission with access to its books and records
and submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. See Registration Proposing

the Commission access to books and records given the research and legal analysis that the

3. Programmatic Benefits and Costs Associated With the Mandatory Trade
Execution Requirement of Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act

Unlike the markets for cash equity securities and listed options, the market for securitybased swaps currently is characterized by bilateral negotiation in the OTC swap market and is
largely decentralized. 1746 The lack of uniform rules concerning the trading of security-based
swaps and the historical one-to-one nature of trade negotiation in security-based swaps has
resulted in the formation of distinct types of trading venues and execution practices, ranging
from bilateral negotiations carried out over the telephone, 1747 to single-dealer RFQ platforms, 1748
to multi-dealer RFQ platforms, 1749 to central limit order books, 1750 and brokerage trading. 1751
1746

See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10951.

1747

“Bilateral negotiation” refers to the execution practice whereby one party uses the telephone, email or other communications to contact directly a potential counterparty to negotiate and execute
a security-based swap. The bilateral negotiation and execution practice provides no pre-trade or
post-trade transparency because only the two parties to the transaction are aware of the terms of
the negotiation and the final terms of the agreement. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at
10951; see also Section II.A.5, supra.

1748

A single-dealer RFQ platform refers to an electronic trading platform where a dealer may post
indicative quotes for security-based swaps in various asset classes that the dealer is willing to
trade. Only the dealer’s approved customers would have access to the platform. When a
customer wishes to transact in a security-based swap, the customer requests an executable quote,
the dealer provides one, and if the customer accepts the dealer’s quote, the transaction is executed
electronically. This type of platform generally provides pre-trade transparency in the form of
indicative quotes on a pricing screen, but only from one dealer to its customer. See SB SEF
Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10951; see also Section II.A.5, supra.

1749

A multi-dealer RFQ electronic trading platform refers to a multi-dealer RFQ system whereby a
requester can send an RFQ to solicit quotes on a certain security-based swap from multiple
dealers at the same time. After the RFQ is submitted, the recipients have a prescribed amount of
time in which to respond to the RFQ with a quote. Responses to the RFQ are firm. The requestor
then has the opportunity to review the responses and accept the best quote. A multi-dealer RFQ
platform provides a certain degree of pre-trade transparency, depending on its characteristics.
See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10952; see also Section II.A.5, supra.

1750

A limit order book system or similar system refers to a trading system in which firm bids and
offers are posted for all participants to see, with the identity of the parties withheld until a

520

These various trading venues and execution practices provide different degrees of pre-trade
transparency and different levels of access. While the Commission currently does not have
sufficient information with respect to the volume of security-based swap transactions executed
across these different trading venues and execution practices, a common thread to these
transactions is that they have all been executed in the unregulated OTC derivatives market.
Thus, for purposes of analyzing the economic impact of the statutory mandatory trade execution
requirement, as well as proposed Rule 3Ch-1, the Commission is starting from a baseline in
which no security-based swaps are currently traded in the United States on an exchange or on a
system or platform that otherwise meets the statutory definition of “security-based swap
execution facility,” the statutory Core Principles governing SB SEFs, and the Commission’s
proposed requirements governing SB SEFs, if they were to be adopted by the Commission. 1752
As noted above, this section XV.G.3 addresses the programmatic effect, and benefits and
costs of, the mandatory trade execution requirement of Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act
generally. Section XV.G.4 further below addresses the programmatic effect, and benefits and
costs of, the proposed application of this requirement to cross-border security-based swap
transactions, as delineated by proposed Rule 3Ch-1. The Commission preliminarily believes that
proposed Rule 3Ch-1 is appropriately tailored to extend the regulatory benefits intended by the
mandatory trade execution requirement—i. e., enhanced transparency and competition, which are
discussed below—to the security-based swap activity that the Commission believes is most
likely to raise the concerns that Congress intended to address in Title VII. 1753 In the
transaction occurs. Bids and offers are then matched based on price-time priority or other
established parameters and trades are executed accordingly. The quotes on a limit order book
system are firm. In general, a limit order book system provides greater pre-trade transparency
than the three platforms described above because all participants can view bids and offers before
placing their bids and offers. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10952; see also Section
II.A.5, supra. Currently, limit order books for the trading of security-based swaps in the United
States are utilized by inter-dealer brokers for dealer-to-dealer transactions.
1751

“Brokerage trading” refers to an execution practice used by brokers to execute security-based
swaps on behalf of customers, often in larger sized transactions. In such a system, a broker
receives a request from a customer (which may be a dealer) who seeks to execute a specific type
of security-based swaps. The broker then interacts with other customers to fill the request and
execute the transaction. This model often is used by dealers that seek to transact with other
dealers through the use of an interdealer broker as an intermediary. In this model, there may be
pre-trade transparency to the extent that participants are able to see bids and offers of other
participants. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10952; see also Section II.A.5, supra.

1752

Several commenters on the SB SEF Proposing Release that currently operate swap trading
facilities have indicated their intention to register as SB SEFs. See note 1708, supra. The
Commission believes that it is likely that these entities would have to revise their operations to
meet the definition of “security-based swap execution facility,” the statutory Core Principles
governing SB SEFs, and the proposed requirements set forth in the SB SEF Proposing Release, if
they were to be adopted by the Commission.

1753

See Sections II.B., supra.

521

Commission’s preliminary view, a different rule, and in particular a rule that would not apply the
mandatory trade execution requirement to all such security-based swap activity, could undermine
these goals.
(a) Programmatic Effect of the Statutory Mandatory Trade Execution
Requirement
As discussed above, to increase the transparency and oversight of the OTC derivatives
market, Section 763(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act by adding the
mandatory trade execution requirement of Section 3C(h). 1754 Security-based swap transactions
subject to Section 3C(h)’s mandatory trade execution requirement cannot be executed over-thecounter, but instead must be executed on an exchange or SB SEF that is registered or exempt
from registration under the Exchange Act, unless an applicable exception applies. 1755 As such,
the mandatory trade execution requirement is important in helping to bring the trading of
security-based swaps onto more transparent, regulated markets, from the unregulated OTC swap
markets. 1756
Consequently, the Commission preliminarily believes that an overall programmatic—and
positive—effect of the mandatory trade execution requirement would be the potential for a large
volume of security-based swap transactions that are currently executed in the OTC market to
become subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement and, therefore, be required to be
executed on a regulated platform, such as an exchange or SB SEF. Moreover, because the
programmatic benefits and costs attendant to the mandatory trade execution requirement, which
are discussed below, would be realized for the volume of security-based swap transactions that
are executed on exchanges or SB SEFs, the Commission preliminarily believes that the extent to
which those benefits and costs could be realized may best be demonstrated by generating an
indicative volume estimate of security-based swap transactions that may potentially be subject to
the mandatory trade execution requirement.
As stated above, because the Commission currently does not have comprehensive
information regarding the volume of security-based swap transactions currently executed on
security-based swap trading platforms, 1757 to estimate the volume of such transactions that could
become subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement, as a starting point, the
Commission relies on clearing data for single-name CDS transactions, which the Commission
believes is currently the best available data for providing an indicative level of security-based
1754

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(h).

While several commenters on the SB SEF Proposing Release that currently operate swap trading
facilities in the OTC market have indicated their intention to register as SB SEFs, see note 1708,
supra, as is currently the case for the security-based swap market as a whole, the Commission
does not have comprehensive information regarding the volume of security-based swap
transactions currently executed on security-based swap trading platforms.

522

swap transaction volume subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement. 1758 The
Commission utilizes this data regarding single-name CDS transactions to generate an indicative
volume of security-based swap transactions in the U.S. security-based swap market that could be
subject to the mandatory clearing requirement of Section 3C(a) of the Exchange Act. 1759 Given
that the mandatory trade execution requirement of Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act 1760 could
apply to any security-based swap that is subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in Section
3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, 1761 the Commission preliminarily believes that the volume of
single-name CDS transactions that could be subject to the mandatory clearing requirement 1762
presents an indicative level of the volume of security-based swap transactions that potentially
could be subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement if these security-based swaps are
made available to trade on an exchange or SB SEF.
The Commission notes that it has not yet determined the criteria for assessing whether an
exchange or SB SEF has made a security-based swap available to trade. The Commission,
however, recognizes that the “made available to trade” determination is an essential element of
the mandatory trade execution requirement. Any analysis of the benefits and costs flowing from
the full complement of the mandatory trade execution requirement, when it is implemented,
would need to take into consideration the Commission’s determination of the scope of securitybased swaps that would be “made available to trade,” as well as the cross-border rules that may
be adopted by the Commission regarding application of the mandatory trade execution
requirement. As a result, the “made available to trade” determination, when made by the
Commission, will affect the ultimate benefits and costs associated with the mandatory trade

1758

For purposes of the analysis of the programmatic effect of the mandatory trade execution
requirement, we do not consider the historical data regarding the clearing level of U.S. index CDS
transactions. The statutory definition of security-based swap in relevant part includes swaps
based on single securities or on narrow-based security-indices. See Section 3(a)(68)(A) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C.78c(a)(68)(A). The historical data regarding the clearing level of U.S.
index CDS transactions encompass broad-based index CDS transactions that do not fall within
the definition of security-based swaps. The Commission recognizes that the security-based swap
market includes not only single-name CDS, but also CDS based on narrow-based indices, and
other non-CDS security-based swaps, primary examples of which are equity swaps and total
return swaps based on single equities or narrow-based indices of equities. As previously stated,
we believe that the single-name CDS data are sufficiently representative of the security-based
swap market. See note 1301, supra.

As previously stated, the estimate of the volume of single-name CDS transactions that could be

mandatory clearing determination and the final rules regarding the end-user exception to the

execution requirement discussed in this release. 1763 Solely for purposes of analyzing herein the
volume of security-based swap transactions that could be subject to the mandatory trade
execution requirement, the Commission is assuming that all security-based swaps that would be
subject to mandatory clearing also would be deemed made available to trade and hence could be
subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement.
As stated above, due in part to the data of the level of clearing activity during the years of
2009 to 2011, the Commission has recognized that mandatory clearing determinations made
pursuant to Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act could alter current clearing practices at the
time such determinations are made and potentially could result in a higher level of clearing for
security-based swaps than would take place under a voluntary system. 1764 Therefore, the
Commission preliminarily estimates that 33% of the $2,800 billion total gross notional volume of
the total U.S. single-name CDS market 1765 would provide an indicative volume of the U.S.
single-name CDS transactions that may be subject to the mandatory clearing requirement. 1766
1763

The Commission has indicated its preliminary view that the decision as to when a security-based
swap would be considered to be “made available to trade” should be made pursuant to objective
measures to be established by the Commission. See SB SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 10969.

1764

As stated above, due in part to the data of the level of clearing activity during the years of 2009 to
2011, the Commission has recognized that mandatory clearing determinations made pursuant to
Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(a)(1), could alter current clearing
practices at the time such determinations are made and potentially could result in a higher level of
clearing for security-based swaps than would take place under a voluntary system. See Section
XV.F.2(a), supra, and the Clearing Procedures Adopting Release, 77 FR at 41638.

1765

The Commission previously calculated three measures to represent the clearing level of the U.S.
single-name CDS transactions. The first measure is the gross notional volume of cleared U.S.
single-name CDS transactions reported by ICE Clear Credit in 2011, which represents
approximately 25% of the total $2,800 billion notional U.S. single-name CDS market. The
second measure is the gross notional volume of U.S. single-name CDS accepted for clearing at
any time during the calendar year of 2011, which represents approximately 33% of the total
$2,800 billion notional U.S. single-name CDS market. The third measure is the gross notional
volume of U.S. single-name CDS accepted for clearing at the time of execution, which represents
approximately 29% of the total $2,800 billion notional U.S. single-name CDS market. For
reasons stated above, the Commission preliminarily believes that the highest measure among
these three would provide an indicative volume of the U.S. single-name CDS transaction that may
be subject to the mandatory clearing requirement. See the text accompanying Table 1 in Section
XV.F.2(a), supra.

1766

The Commission recognizes that, even if a transaction is determined to be subject to mandatory
clearing, such transaction may be excepted from clearing pursuant to the end-user clearing
exception under Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78c-3(g). However, based on
the available data, the Commission estimated that commercial end users that are eligible for the
clearing exception currently participate in the security-based swap market on a very limited basis.
Data compiled by the Commission’s Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial Innovation on
credit default transactions from the DTCC-TIW between January 1, 2011 and December 31, 2011
suggest that the total percentage of trades between buyer and seller principals during the calendar
year 2011 for single name credit default swaps was only 0.03% of the total trade counterparty

524

Because the mandatory trade execution requirement of Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act 1767
could apply to any security-based swap that is subject to the mandatory clearing requirement in
Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, subject to the “made available to trade” determination,
this estimate may provide an indicative volume of U.S. single-name CDS transactions that could
have been subject to the “made available to trade” determination in Section 3C(h)(2) of the
Exchange Act (if such determination had been made in 2011) and, therefore, subject to the
mandatory trade execution requirement. 1768
The Commission is mindful that this estimate is only an indicative volume of U.S. singlename CDS transactions that may be subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement in
Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act, 1769 as the Commission currently does not have reliable
information available with respect to security-based swap transactions due to the fact that such
transactions are currently executed on trading platforms that are not exchanges or SB SEFs.
However, the Commission preliminarily believes that the statutory mandatory trade execution
requirement, together with the statutory definition of SB SEF 1770 and the Commission’s
proposed interpretation, 1771 when implemented, could alter existing security-based swap
execution practices. As more security-based swap products are determined to be mandatorily
cleared and once the Commission addresses how to determine whether such security-based
swaps are made available for trading on an exchange or SB SEF, the level of trade execution in
security-based swaps taking place on such exchanges or SB SEFs should be higher than in the
current trading environment, in which no security-based swaps are traded on exchanges or SB
SEFs. As a result, the mandatory trade execution requirement could have a material
programmatic impact on execution practices in the U.S. security-based swap market by
increasing the volume of transactions executed on an exchange or SB SEF.

Requirement

distribution for non-financial end users, which are composed of non-financial companies and
family trusts. See Capital, Margin and Segregation Proposing Release, 77 FR at 70302, in
particular, n.960. For purposes of the analysis and estimate here, we assume that the volume of
transactions subject to the end user clearing exception under Section 3C(g) of the Exchange Act
is negligible.
1767

15 U.S.C. 78c-3(h).

1768

As stated earlier in this Section XV.G.3(a), this indicative volume estimate is based on an
assumed scenario in which all mandatorily cleared security-based swaps are deemed made
available to trade. The Commission reiterates that this assumption is being made solely for
purposes of analyzing herein the volume of security-based swap transactions that could be subject
to the mandatory trade execution requirement.

525

Given that exchanges and SB SEFs are the essential infrastructure for implementing the
mandatory trade execution requirement, there are additional benefits—separate from the fact that
a large volume of security-based swap transactions would become subject to that requirement—
flowing from the mandatory trade execution requirement that inevitably would overlap with the
benefits associated with SB SEF registration, as described in the SB SEF Proposing Release.
These benefits would be realized for the volume of security-based swap transactions that become
subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement and are summarized below.
Increased Pre-Trade Price Transparency. One of the primary benefits of the mandatory
trade execution requirement is to bring increased pre-trade transparency to the currently opaque
security-based swap market. Increased pre-trade transparency should: (i) help reduce
informational asymmetries that may exist today in the security-based swap market, often to the
benefit of large dealers who observe order flow; 1772 (ii) allow an increased number of market
participants to see the trading interest of other market participants prior to trading, which should
lead to increased price competition among market participants; and, in turn, (iii) lead to more
efficient pricing in the security-based swap market. 1773
Impartial Access and Competitive Security-Based Swaps Market. The Dodd-Frank Act’s
mandate to bring security-based swaps that are subject to the mandatory clearing requirement
onto regulated markets, unless the security-based swap is not made available to trade, coupled
with the proposed access requirements for SB SEFs in Regulation SB SEF, 1774 should help foster
greater competition in the trading of security-based swaps by increasing access to security-based
swap trading venues. 1775 Such increased competition could lead to more efficient pricing in the
security-based swap market. 1776
(c) Programmatic Costs of the Statutory Mandatory Trade Execution
Requirement
The Commission is mindful that programmatic costs also would be incurred for securitybased swap transactions that become subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement. 1777

The Commission’s consideration of the programmatic costs associated with setting up a SB SEF
in the SB SEF Proposing Release and further discussion of such costs in the context of discussing
when the SB SEF registration requirements would apply to foreign security-based swap markets
and in considering the proposed availability of an exemption to foreign security-based swap
markets from the registration requirements could be relevant to the costs associated with the
mandatory trade execution requirement given that security-based swaps subject to the mandatory
trade execution requirement would be required to be traded on an exchange or a SB SEF that is

526

The Commission preliminarily believes that there would be transaction costs, such as fees and
connectivity costs, that trading counterparties would incur in executing or trading security-based
swaps subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement on SB SEFs. The Commission
believes that a potential increase in transaction costs could result if the fees and connectivity
costs associated with utilizing SB SEFs to secure trading interest and execute security-based
swap transactions are higher than the current fees and costs associated with such practices in the
OTC market. However, the Commission currently does not have information available to
estimate the fees and costs that would be associated with transacting on SB SEFs, as no
registered SB SEFs currently exist. Likewise, although unregulated trading venues exist in
today’s OTC derivatives market, the Commission does not have information regarding what, if
any, fees and connectivity costs are associated with transacting on these unregulated trading
venues.
In addition, studies suggest that pre-trade transparency can be costly for block trades as
prices are likely to move adversely if the existence of a large unexecuted order becomes
known. 1778 As mentioned earlier, pre-trade transparency could also produce concerns about
information leakage and frontrunning of trades. These effects could cause market participants to
alter their trading strategies in order to hide their interest, potentially reducing liquidity on SB
SEFs. 1779
4. Programmatic Benefits and Costs of Proposed Rule 3Ch-1 Regarding Application
of the Mandatory Trade Execution Requirement in Cross-Border Context
As discussed above, 1780 the Commission is proposing Rule 3Ch-1 to clarify the
applicability of the mandatory trade execution requirement of Section 3C(h) of the Exchange
Act 1781 with respect to cross-border transactions in security-based swaps. Proposed Rule 3Ch1(a) would identify the circumstances in which the mandatory trade execution requirement
registered under Section 3D of the Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration. See SB
SEF Proposing Release, 76 FR at 11040-48; see also Sections XV.G.1 and XV.G.2, supra.

Financial Studies, Vol. 10, No. 1 (1997) (analyzing data from equity block trades on components
of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, the authors find that while the cost reductions for block
trades on NYSE’s “upstairs” market are economically small, the “upstairs markets allow trades
that may not otherwise occur”); Terrence Henderschott and Ananth Madhavan, “Click or Call?
Auction versus Search in the Over-the-Counter Market,” Working Paper (2012) (using data from
an electronic auction market, the authors find evidence that, controlling for venue selection, much
of the cost savings from electronic platforms relative to dealer markets comes from small trades
whereas coefficient estimates suggest that for large orders, the cost advantage of electronic
auctions relative to the OTC market may be reversed).

would apply, and proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b) then would carve out certain security-based swap
transactions involving non-U.S. persons from the mandatory trade execution requirement. 1782
Specifically, under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a), the mandatory trade execution requirement
would apply to a person that engages in a security-based swap transaction if: (1) a counterparty
to the transaction is (i) a U.S. person, or (ii) a non-U.S. person whose performance under such
security-based swap transaction is guaranteed by a U.S. person (“guaranteed non-U.S. person”);
or (2) such transaction is a transaction conducted within the United States. 1783 Under proposed
Rule 3Ch-1(b), the mandatory trade execution requirement would not apply to: (1) a securitybased swap transaction described in proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a) that is not a transaction conducted
within the United States if (i) one counterparty is a foreign branch or a guaranteed non-U.S.
person, and (ii) the other counterparty to the transaction is a non-U.S. person whose performance
under the security-based swap is not guaranteed by a U.S. person (hereinafter referred to as
“non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons”) and who is not a foreign security-based swap dealer; or (2)
a security-based swap transaction described in proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a) that is a transaction
conducted within the United States if (i) neither counterparty to the transaction is a U.S. person,
(ii) neither counterparty’s performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S.
person; and (iii) neither counterparty to the transaction is a foreign security-based swap
dealer. 1784
Therefore, proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a) and proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b) apply the mandatory
trade execution requirement to security-based swap transactions in the cross-border context
based on the U.S.-person status of a counterparty, the existence of a guarantee provided by a
U.S. person, the registered security-based swap dealer status of a counterparty, and the location
where the transaction is conducted. Taken together, proposed Rules 3Ch-1(a) and 3Ch-1(b)
would not apply the mandatory trade execution requirement to: (i) transactions conducted
outside the United States between two counterparties who are non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons,
(ii) transactions conducted outside the United States between a foreign branch or a guaranteed
non-U.S. person, and another counterparty who is a non-guaranteed non-U.S. person and is not a
foreign security-based swap dealer, and (iii) transactions conducted within the United States
between two counterparties who are non-guaranteed non-U.S. persons and are not foreign
security-based swap dealers. As stated above, 1785 the Commission preliminarily believes that
proposed Rule 3Ch-1 is appropriately tailored to extend the regulatory benefits intended by the
mandatory trade execution requirement to the security-based swap activity that the Commission
preliminarily believes is most likely to raise the concerns that Congress intended to address in
1782

This is identical to the proposed approach for the mandatory clearing requirement. See Sections
IX and XV.F.3, supra.

1783

See proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a) under the Exchange Act. The term “U.S. person” and “transaction
conducted within the United States” would have the meanings set forth in proposed Rule 3a713(a) under the Exchange Act.

Title VII. 1786
The analysis in Section XV.G.4(a) below utilizes the best available information with
respect to these criteria to assess the overall programmatic effect of proposed Rules 3Ch-1(a) and
3Ch-1(b) by estimating the size of the security-based swap market that would be subject to the
mandatory trade execution requirement as a result of proposed Rules 3Ch-1(a) and 3Ch-1(b).
The Commission then discusses in Section XV.G.4(b) below the benefits and costs that would
flow from proposed Rule 3Ch-1 regarding application of the mandatory trade execution
requirement in the cross border context.
(a) Programmatic Effect of Proposed Rule 3Ch-1
It is not possible to quantify the potential programmatic effect of proposed Rule 3Ch-1 by
estimating the future volume of security-based swap transactions when the mandatory trade
execution requirement becomes effective partly because no “made available to trade”
determinations have been made and partly because we do not know future trading volumes of
security-based swaps. However, the Commission has examined the data available to it to
analyze the potential programmatic effects of proposed Rule 3Ch-1. In particular, the
Commission has tried to analyze the potential effects of proposed Rule 3Ch-1 by looking at the
portion of the single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions that may provide an indication of the
size of the security-based swap market that may be included in or excluded from the application
of the mandatory trade execution requirement as a result of proposed Rule 3Ch-1.
A limitation we face when analyzing the data in order to estimate the size of the securitybased swap market that may be affected by proposed Rule 3Ch-1 is that the domicile
classifications in the DTCC-TIW database are not identical to the counterparty statuses that are
described in proposed Rules 3Ch-1(a) and 3Ch-1(b), which would trigger application of, or an
exception from, the mandatory trade execution requirement. Although the information provided
by the data in the DTCC-TIW database does not allow us to identify the existence of a guarantee
provided by a U.S. person with respect to a counterparty in a transaction, the registered securitybased swap dealer status of a counterparty, or the location where the transaction is conducted, the
Commission nevertheless preliminarily believes that the approach taken below would provide
the best available estimate of the size of the security-based swap market that could be included in
or excluded from the mandatory trade execution requirement by proposed Rule 3Ch-1.
As stated above, the commission has examined all transactions in single-name CDS
during 2011 calendar year 1787 and estimated that the notional amount of the single-name CDS
transactions executed during the 2011 calendar year is $2,400 billion. 1788 Proposed Rule 3Ch1786

See Section II.B, supra.

1787

See note 1637, supra, and the accompanying text in Section XV.F.2(a), supra.

1788

This estimate is based on the calculation by staff of the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial
Innovation of all price-forming DTCC-TIW single-name CDS transactions that are based on
North American corporate reference entities, U.S. municipal reference entities, U.S. loans or
mortgage-backed securities (“MBS”), using ISDA North American documentation, ISDA U.S.

529

1(a) provides that the mandatory trade execution requirement shall apply to a security-based
swap transaction if (1) a counterparty to the transaction is a U.S. person or a non-U.S. person
whose performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed by a U.S. person or (2) such
transaction is a transaction conducted within the United States. In applying proposed Rule 3Ch1(a) to the $2,400 billion single-name CDS transactions executed in 2011, the Commission uses
account holders and their domicile information in the DTCC-TIW database to determine the
status of the counterparties. 1789 Because the Commission’s proposed definition of “U.S. person”
is based primarily on the place of organization or principal place of business of a legal person
and a legal person’s principal place of business and place of organization are usually in the same
country, the Commission believes that the domicile of a legal person is a reliable indicator of
such person’s U.S.-person status. In addition, based on the Commission’s understanding that the
security-based swap transactions of foreign subsidiaries of U.S. entities, unless sufficiently
capitalized to have their own independent credit ratings, are generally guaranteed by the most
creditworthy U.S.-based entity within the corporate group, i.e., the U.S. parent, the Commission
preliminarily believes that it is reasonable to assume that foreign subsidiaries of U.S.-domiciled
entities are non-U.S. persons whose performance under security-based swap transactions is
guaranteed by a U.S. person. Finally, the DTCC-TIW data do not provide sufficient information
for us to identify whether a transaction was conducted in the United States. Solely for purposes
of this analysis, we have assumed that transactions involving a U.S.-domiciled counterparty
(excluding foreign branch) or a U.S. branch counterparty were conducted in the United
States. 1790
Based on these assumptions, we estimate that the subset of the size of the single-name
U.S. reference CDS market that includes a U.S.-domiciled counterparty (excluding a foreign
branch of a U.S. bank), a foreign subsidiary of a U.S.-domiciled entity, or a U.S. branch of a
foreign bank as a counterparty is $1,900 billion notional amount. 1791 The Commission
Muni documentation, or other standard ISDA documentation for North American Loan CDS and
CDS on MBS, and are denominated in U.S. dollars and executed in 2011. Price-forming
transactions include all new transactions, assignments, modifications to increase the notional
amounts of previously executed transactions, and terminations of previously executed
transactions. Transactions terminated, transactions entered into in connection with a compression
exercise, and expiration of contracts at maturity are not considered price-forming and are
therefore excluded, as are replacement trades and all bookkeeping-related trades. See notes 1312
and 1638, supra.
1789

See note 1639, supra, in Section XV.F.2(a) for explanations of the determination of an account
holder’s domicile by the Commission staff in the Division of Risk, Strategy, and Financial
Innovation using information in the DTCC-TIW.

1790

Since the origination location of a transaction is not available in DTCC-TIW, the Commission
recognizes that its analysis here may undercount transactions conducted within the United States
because some transactions may be solicited, negotiated, or executed within the United States by
an agent other than U.S. branches of foreign banks (such as a non-U.S. person counterparty using
an unaffiliated third-party agent).

1791

Such $1,900 billion estimate does not capture transactions between two non-U.S. domiciled
counterparties involving an agent to solicit, negotiate and execute security-based swaps in the

530

preliminarily believes that this figure provides an indicative level of the single-name U.S.
reference CDS activity that may represent an indicative size of the security-based swap market
that could become subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement under proposed Rule
3Ch-1(a) when the requirement becomes effective. 1792 In addition, we recognize that the level of
the security-based swap activity that could become subject to mandatory trade execution under
proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a) may be affected by the “made available to trade” determination by the
Commission.1793
Next, we apply proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b) to the transactions included in the analysis
described above regarding proposed Rule 3Ch-1 in order to estimate the portion of the singlename U.S. reference CDS activity that may represent an indicative size of the security-based
swap market that would not be subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement under the
proposed rule. We reiterate the assumptions described above with respect to the counterparty
status of a U.S. person and a non-U.S. person whose performance under security-based swap
transactions is guaranteed by a U.S. person, and the assumption with respect to a transaction
conducted within the United States. In addition, because of the lack of information about the
location of transactions, solely for assessing the effect of proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b)(1), we have
assumed that transactions between a counterparty that is a foreign branch or foreign subsidiary of
a U.S.-domiciled entity and another counterparty that is a foreign-domiciled entity that is not a
subsidiary of a U.S.-domiciled entity or an ISDA-recognized dealer are not transactions
conducted within the United States; and solely for purposes of assessing the effect of proposed
rule 3Ch-1(b)(2), we have assumed that transactions conducted between two foreign-domiciled
counterparties that are not ISDA-recognized dealers and are not foreign subsidiaries of U.S.domiciled entities are not conducted within the United States. These assumptions likely result in
an overestimate of the notional volume carved-out by proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b). With respect to
counterparty status as a registered security-based swap dealer, we recognize that as yet there are
United States and therefore, may be an underestimate of the aggregate notional amount of the
single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions that may be included in the application of the
mandatory trade execution requirement under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a) because of the assumption
we make herein regarding transactions conducted within the United States. By the same token,
the difference between the $1,900 billion subset included in the application of the mandatory
trade execution requirement under proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a) and the $2,400 billion total singlename U.S. reference CDS transactions (i.e., $500 billion or 20.8% of the $2,400 billion) may
represent an overestimate of single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions in notional amount that
are not included in the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement under proposed
Rule 3Ch-1(a).
1792

The Commission recognizes that the security-based swap market includes single-name CDS,
CDS based on narrow-based indices, and other non-CDS security-based swaps, primary examples
of which are equity swaps and total return swaps based on single equities or narrow-based indices
of equities. As previously stated, we believe that the single-name CDS data are sufficiently
representative of the security-based swap market as roughly 82% of the security-based swap
market, as measured on a notional basis, appears likely to be single-name CDS. See Section
XV.B.2 and the text accompanying note 1301, supra.

1793

See note 1763 and accompanying text, supra.

531

no dealers designated as security-based swap dealers and subject to the registration requirement.
Solely for purposes of this analysis, we have assumed that those counterparties to CDS
transactions that were ISDA recognized dealers 1794 would be required to register as securitybased swap dealers.
Based on the above assumptions, we have estimated that approximately 2.1% of the total
notional amount 1795 of single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions executed in 2011 would be
excluded from the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement by proposed Rule
3Ch-1(b). Therefore, we preliminarily believe that 22.9% of the total size of the single-name
U.S. reference CDS transactions in 2011 presents an indicative size of the U.S. security-based
swap market that could be excluded from the application of the mandatory trade execution
requirement under proposed Rule 3Ch-1. 1796
The Commission preliminarily believes that this estimate provides the best available
proxy for the overall programmatic effect of the application of the mandatory trade execution
requirement in the cross-border context in terms of the portion of the single-name U.S. reference
CDS market that may be included in or excluded from the scope of the application of the
mandatory trade execution requirement, given the data limitations and the underlying
1794

See note 1306, supra.

1795

Based on calculations by the staff of the Division of Risk, Strategy and Financial Innovation
applying the criteria provided in proposed rule 3Ch-1(b) and the assumptions stated herein,
approximately $51 billion in notional amount, constituting approximately 2.1% of the total
notional amount, of single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions executed in 2011 would be
excluded from the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement. Because of the
assumptions we made herein regarding transactions conducted within the United States and
transactions conducted outside the United States, the 2.1% may be an overestimate of the
aggregate notional amount of the single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions that may be
excluded from the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement under proposed Rule
3Ch-1(b).

1796

The 22.9% estimate is the sum of the 20.8% estimate of the single-name U.S. reference CDS
transactions excluded from the mandatory trade execution requirement under proposed Rule 3Ca3(a) and the 2.1% estimate of the single-name U.S. reference CDS transactions excluded from the
mandatory trade execution requirement under proposed Rule 3Ca-3(b). The Commission
reiterates that both 20.8% and 2.1% may overestimate the size of the single-name U.S. reference
CDS transactions excluded from the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement
under proposed Rules 3Ch-1(a) and (b).
In addition, this calculation is conducted using U.S. reference single-name CDS transaction data
in 2011. See the text accompanying notes 1637 and 1787, supra. The Commission recognizes
that the same calculation could generate a different result if both U.S. reference and non-U.S.
reference single-name CDS transaction data were used. However, with respect to non-U.S.
reference single-name CDS transaction data, the Commission currently does not have access to
the part of such data in DTCC-TIW regarding non-U.S. reference single-name CDS transactions
that do not involve a U.S. counterparty on either side of the transaction. See Section XV.B.2,
supra.

532

assumptions described above. 1797 The Commission is mindful that the above analysis represents
only an indicative estimate of the portion of the single-name U.S. reference CDS activity that
may represent an indicative size of the security-based swap market that may be included in or
excluded from the application of the mandatory trade execution requirement as a result of
proposed Rule 3Ch-1. The Commission also recognizes that the above analysis represents an
extrapolation from the limited data that is currently available to the Commission.
(b) Programmatic Benefits and Costs of Proposed Rule 3Ch-1
The Commission preliminarily believes that, in addition to the programmatic effect of a
large volume of cross-border security-based swap transactions becoming subject to the
mandatory trade execution requirement as a result of proposed Rule 3Ch-1, certain benefits and
costs that overlap with the benefits and costs associated with SB SEF registration, as described in
the SB SEF Proposing Release, would flow from proposed Rule 3Ch-1 because cross-border
security-based swaps covered by proposed Rule 3Ch-1 would have to be executed or traded on
SB SEFs or exchanges. Indeed, these benefits and costs would be realized for the volume of
cross-border security-based swap transactions, estimated in Section XV.G.4(a) above, 1798 that
would be covered by proposed Rule 3Ch-1(a) (and not excepted by proposed Rule 3Ch-1(b))
and, therefore, subject to the mandatory trade execution requirement. 1799 These benefits and
costs, which are more fully described in the SB SEF Proposing Release, are summarized
above. 1800
(c) Alternatives
The Commission has considered alternatives to proposed Rule 3Ch-1. The Commission
could propose to apply the mandatory trade execution requirement in the same way as the
CFTC’s proposed interpretive guidance. The major difference between the CFTC’s proposed
application of the mandatory trade execution requirement and the Commission’s proposed Rule
3Ch-1 is that the CFTC would apply the mandatory trade execution requirement to a transaction
conducted outside the United States between a foreign branch and a non-guaranteed non-U.S.
person. The Commission preliminarily believes that subjecting such a transaction to mandatory
1797

The Commission reiterates that the assumptions made here are solely for purposes of this
economic analysis.

1798

See Section XV.G.4(a), supra.

1799

To the extent that the estimated volume of security-based swap transactions that would be subject
to the cross-border application of the statutory mandatory trade execution requirement in
proposed Rules 3Ch-1(a) and 3Ch-1(b) (as analyzed in Section XV.G.4(a) above) differs from the
estimated upper bound volume of the security-based transactions that would be subject to the
statutory requirement (as set forth in Section XV.G.3(a) above), such differential reflects the
aggregate programmatic effect of proposed Rules 3Ch-1(a) and 3Ch-1(b), and that the volume of
security-based swap transactions that would be subject to those proposed cross-border rules is a
subset of the upper bound volume estimate of transactions subject to the statutory requirement,
which is not limited to the cross-border context.

1800

See Sections XV.G.3(b) and (c), supra.

533

trade execution may hinder a foreign branch’s ability to access the foreign local market to a
degree that fails to justify the pre-trade transparency benefits to the U.S. financial market.
(d) Assessment Costs for Proposed Rule 3Ch-1
The assessment costs associated with proposed Rule 3Ch-1 would be related primarily to
identification of the counterparty status and origination location of the transaction to determine
whether the mandatory trade execution requirement would apply. The same assessment would
be performed not only in connection with the proposed application of the mandatory trade
execution requirement in the cross border context, but also in connection with the proposed
application of the reporting, 1801 public dissemination, 1802 and mandatory clearing 1803
requirements in the cross-border context and, therefore, would be part of the overall Title VII
compliance costs.
The Commission preliminarily believes that market participants would request
representations from their transaction counterparties to determine the U.S.-person status of their
counterparties. In addition, if the transaction is guaranteed by a U.S. person, the guarantee
would be part of the trading documentation and, therefore, the existence of the guarantee would
be a readily ascertainable fact. Similarly, market participants would be able to rely on their
counterparties’ representations as to whether a transaction is solicited, negotiated or executed by
a person within the United States. 1804 Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the
assessment costs associated with proposed Rule 3Ch-1 should be limited to the costs of
establishing a compliance policy and procedure of requesting and collecting representations from
trading counterparties and maintaining the collected representations as part of the market
participants’ recordkeeping procedures. The Commission preliminarily believes that such
assessment costs would be approximately $15,160. 1805 The Commission preliminarily believes
that requesting and collecting representations would be part of the standardized transaction

and Section XV.H, infra.

This estimate is based on an estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s time to
establish a procedure of requesting and collecting representations from trading counterparties,
taking into account that such representations may be built into a form of standardized trading
documentation. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff
estimates that the average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379.

process reflected in the policies and procedures regarding security-based swap sales and trading
practices and should not result in separate assessment costs. 1806
The Commission also considers the likelihood that market participants may implement
systems to keep track of counterparty status for purposes of future trading of security-based
swaps that are similar to, if not the same as, the systems implemented by market participants for
purposes of assessing security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant status.
As stated above, the Commission estimated that market participants that perceived the need to
perform the security-based swap dealer assessment or major security-based swap participant
calculations would incur one-time programming costs of $12,870. 1807 Therefore, the
Commission estimates the total one-time costs per entity associated with proposed Rule 3Ch-1
could be $28,030. 1808 To the extent that market participants have incurred costs relating to
similar or the same assessments with respect to counterparty status and transaction location for
other Title VII requirements, their assessment costs with respect to proposed Rule 3Ch-1 may be
less.

H. Application of Rules Governing Security-Based Swap Data Repositories in Cross-Border
Context
SDRs are intended to play a critical role in enhancing transparency in the security-based
swap market, bolstering market efficiency and liquidity, promoting standardization, and reducing
systemic risks by serving as centralized recordkeeping facilities that collect and maintain
information relating to security-based swap transactions. 1809 More broadly, the goal of the
Dodd-Frank Act is, among other things, to promote the financial stability of the United States by
improving accountability and transparency in the financial system. 1810 In furtherance of these
goals, the Dodd Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to require the reporting of security-based
swaps (whether cleared or uncleared) to an SDR registered with the Commission, 1811 and to
require certain persons that perform the functions of an SDR to register with the Commission.1812
SDRs that are registered with the Commission are subject to Section 13(n) of the Exchange
Act 1813 and the rules and regulations thereunder (collectively, “SDR Requirements”), as well as

other requirements applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission.1814 In this section, the
Commission first discusses the benefits and costs of the Commission’s proposed interpretive
guidance regarding the application of the SDR Requirements and exemption from the SDR
Requirements. The Commission then discusses the benefits and costs of the Commission’s
proposed interpretive guidance regarding relevant authorities’ access to security-based swap
information and exemption from the statutory indemnification requirement that could hinder
such access. Finally, the Commission discusses the benefits and costs associated with the
Commission’s re-proposed Regulation SBSR, which sets forth the reporting obligations of
counterparties to security-based swaps in the cross-border context.
1. Benefits and Costs Associated with Application of the SDR Requirements in the
Cross-Border Context
(a) Benefits of Proposed Approach to SDR Requirements
As discussed above, 1815 the Commission proposes that any U.S. person that performs the
functions of an SDR would be required to register with the Commission pursuant to Section
13(n)(1) of the Exchange Act 1816 and previously proposed Rule 13n-1 thereunder. As further
discussed above, 1817 the Commission further proposes that, to the extent that any non-U.S.
person performs the functions of an SDR within the United States, it would be required to
register with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(n)(1) of the Exchange Act 1818 and
previously proposed Rule 13n-1 thereunder, absent an exemption. The Commission also is
proposing new Rule 13n-12 under the Exchange Act, which provides that a non-U.S. person that
performs the functions of an SDR within the United States is exempt from the SDR
Requirements, provided that each regulator with supervisory authority over such non-U.S. person
has entered into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other arrangement with the Commission
that addresses the confidentiality of data collected and maintained by such non-U.S. person,
access by the Commission to such data, and any other matters determined by the Commission
(“SDR Exemption”). 1819
The Commission has considered the benefits and costs associated both with the
Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance regarding U.S. persons and non-U.S. persons that
would be required to register with the Commission as an SDR and with the SDR Exemption in
light of the transparency and other objectives that the Dodd-Frank Act is intended to achieve.
The Commission preliminarily believes that our proposed approach would be consistent with
achieving these intended benefits of the SDR Requirements, but would avoid imposing the

i.

Programmatic Benefits of Proposed Guidance Regarding Registration

The Commission preliminarily believes that there are a number of programmatic benefits
to our proposal to require U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR and non-U.S.
persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States to register with the
Commission and to comply with the other SDR Requirements. These requirements are intended
to help ensure that SDRs function in a manner that will further the transparency and other goals
of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1820 The SDR Requirements, including requirements that SDRs register
with the Commission, retain complete records of security-based swap transactions, maintain the
integrity and confidentiality of those records, and provide effective access to those records to
relevant authorities and the public in line with their respective information needs, are intended to
help ensure that the data held by SDRs is reliable and that the SDRs provide information that
contributes to the transparency of the security-based swap market while protecting the
confidentiality of information provided by market participants. 1821
Enhanced transparency should produce market-wide benefits by, for example, promoting
stability in the security-based swap market, 1822 and it should indirectly contribute to improved
stability in related financial markets, including equity and bond markets. 1823 Enhanced
transparency in the security-based swap market would assist the Commission and other relevant
authorities in fulfilling their regulatory mandates and legal responsibilities such as performing
market surveillance and detecting market manipulation, fraud, and other market abuses by
providing the Commission and other relevant authorities with greater access to security-based
swap information. 1824 Increased regulatory effectiveness should improve the integrity and
transparency of the market and improve the confidence of market participants. 1825

The Commission preliminarily believes that requiring U.S. persons performing the
functions of an SDR to register with the Commission as SDRs and comply with the SDR
Requirements, as well as other requirements applicable to SDRs registered with the
Commission,1826 would further the goals of the SDR Requirements and contribute to enhanced
transparency in the security-based swap market in the United States. The Commission
preliminarily believes that U.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR will play a key role
in ensuring that security-based swap transactions affecting the transparency of the security-based
swap market within the United States are reported; properly maintained; and made available to
the Commission, other relevant authorities, and the public. 1827 Requiring such U.S. persons to
comply with the SDR Requirements would help ensure that they maintain data and make it
available in a manner that advances the transparency benefits that Title VII is intended to
produce.
Non-U.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR within the United States also may
affect the transparency of the security-based swap market within the United States, even if
transactions involving U.S. persons or U.S. market participants are being reported to such nonU.S. persons in order to satisfy the reporting requirements of a foreign jurisdiction (and not those
of Title VII). The Commission preliminarily believes that, to the extent that non-U.S. persons
are performing the functions of an SDR within the United States, they will likely receive data
relating to transactions involving U.S. persons and other U.S. market participants. Ensuring that
such data is maintained and made available in a manner consistent with the SDR Requirements
would likely contribute to the transparency of the U.S. market and reduce potential confusion
that may arise from discrepancies in transaction data due to, among other things, differences in
the operational standards governing persons who perform the functions of an SDR in other
jurisdictions (or the absence of such standards for any such persons that are not subject to any
regulatory regime). Moreover, given the sensitivity of reported security-based swap data and the
potential for market abuse and subsequent loss of liquidity in the event that a person performing
the function of an SDR within the United States fails to maintain the privacy of such data, 1828 the
Commission preliminarily believes that requiring non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of
an SDR within the United States to register with the Commission would help ensure that data
relating to transactions involving U.S. persons or U.S. market participants is handled in a manner
consistent with the confidentiality protections applicable to such data, thereby reducing the risk
both of the loss or disclosure of proprietary or other sensitive data and of market abuse arising
from the misuse of such data.

trading activity; (iii) aggregate trade information for publication on market-wide activity; and (iv)

ii.

Programmatic Benefits of the SDR Exemption

As noted above, the Commission is proposing new Rule 13n-12 under the Exchange Act
to provide an exemption from the SDR Requirements for non-U.S. persons that perform the
functions of an SDR within the United States, provided that each regulator with supervisory
authority over any such non-U.S. person has entered into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or
other arrangement with the Commission that addresses the confidentiality of data collected and
maintained by such non-U.S. person, access by the Commission to such data, and any other
matters determined by the Commission.1829
The Commission preliminarily believes that this SDR Exemption would not significantly
reduce the programmatic benefits associated with the SDR Requirements. Although the
proposed approach would potentially reduce the number of persons performing the functions of
an SDR that are registered with the Commission,1830 data relating to transactions involving U.S.
persons and U.S. market participants would still be required to be reported, pursuant to
Regulation SBSR, to an SDR registered with the Commission and subject to all SDR
Requirements, absent other relief from the Commission. 1831
Moreover, the SDR Exemption would be conditioned on a supervisory and enforcement
MOU or other arrangement with each regulator with supervisory authority over the non-U.S.
person that seeks to rely upon the SDR Exemption. This MOU or arrangement would address
the Commission’s interest in having access to security-based swap data involving U.S. persons
and other U.S. market participants that is maintained by non-U.S. persons that perform the
functions of an SDR within the United States and in protecting the confidentiality of such data.
Further, proposed Rule 13n-12 should not impair the integrity and accessibility of security-based
swap data. The Commission, therefore, preliminarily believes that exempting certain non-U.S.
persons performing the functions of an SDR within the United States, subject to the condition
described above, would likely not significantly affect the programmatic benefits that the SDR
Requirements were intended to achieve. 1832
1829

Proposed Rule 13n-12(b) under the Exchange Act.

1830

It appears that, as of April 2013, there were several non-U.S. persons performing the functions of
an SDR or intending to do so in the future. See FSB Progress Report April 2013 at 20-21, 63-65.
The Commission, however, does not possess data regarding how many, if any, of these persons
perform the functions of an SDR within the United States.

1831

See discussion of Regulation SBSR in Section VIII, supra and discussion of substituted
compliance in Section XI, supra.

1832

The Commission also anticipates that non-U.S. persons that avail themselves of the SDR
Exemption would be subject to the regulatory requirements of one or more foreign jurisdictions.
The SDR Exemption would help ensure that such persons do not incur costs arising from being
required to comply with duplicative regulatory regimes while also ensuring, through the condition
that each regulator with supervisory authority enter into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or
other arrangement with the Commission, that they are subject to regulatory requirements that
would prevent them from undermining the transparency and other purposes of the Title VII SDR

540

(b) Costs of Proposed Approach to SDR Requirements
i.

Programmatic Costs of the Commission’s Proposed Approach

Registering with the Commission and complying with the SDR Requirements will
impose certain costs on an SDR. 1833 The Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and SDR
Exemption do not change the costs associated with any particular SDR Requirement, but the
Commission preliminarily believes that the SDR Exemption may reduce the costs for certain
non-U.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR within the United States without reducing
the expected benefits of the SDR Requirements. 1834 The Commission preliminarily believes that
such persons would likely be performing the functions of an SDR in order to permit
counterparties to satisfy reporting requirements under foreign law. An exemption, if available,
would allow these non-U.S. persons to continue to perform this function within the United
States, potentially reducing costs to U.S. market participants that have reporting obligations
under foreign law and reducing the incentive for non-U.S. persons performing the functions of an
SDR within the United States to restructure their operations to avoid registration with the
Commission.
The Commission recognizes that making the exemption available subject to a condition
may delay the availability of the exemption to certain non-U.S. persons. In some cases, the
Commission may be unable to enter into an MOU or other arrangement with each regulator with
supervisory authority over a non-U.S. person performing the functions of an SDR within the
United States. The resulting delay or unavailability of the exemption may lead some of these
non-U.S. persons to exit the U.S. market by, for example, restructuring their business so that they
perform the functions of an SDR entirely outside the United States, potentially resulting in
business disruptions in the security-based swap market.
ii.

Assessment Costs

Under the Commission’s proposed approach, non-U.S. persons that perform the functions
of an SDR may be expected to incur certain assessment costs related to determining whether they

Requirements, for example, by failing to protect the confidentiality of data relating to U.S.
persons and other U.S. market participants.
1833

See SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77354-64.

1834

As noted above, the data currently available to the Commission does not indicate how many nonU.S. persons performing the functions of an SDR perform such functions within the United
States. See note 1830, supra. However, even if counterparties with reporting obligations under
Regulation SBSR reported their transactions to a non-U.S. person that performs the functions of
an SDR within the United States but is exempt from registration, they would still be required to
report transactions under Regulation SBSR to an SDR registered with the Commission.

541

can rely on the SDR Exemption and, if not, whether they perform the functions of an SDR within
the United States. 1835
With respect to determining the availability of the SDR Exemption, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the costs for a non-U.S. person that performs the functions of an SDR
to determine whether the condition for the availability of the SDR Exemption has been satisfied
with respect to it would arise from confirming whether the Commission and each regulator with
supervisory authority over such non-U.S. person have entered into a supervisory and
enforcement MOU or other arrangement. The Commission preliminarily believes that, given
that this information generally should be readily available, 1836 the cost involved in making such
assessment should not exceed one hour of in-house counsel’s time or $379 per person, 1837 for an
aggregate one-time cost of $7,580. 1838
If the condition for the SDR Exemption has not been satisfied with respect to any
authority with supervisory authority over such non-U.S. person, that person may determine to
analyze where it performs its SDR functions in order to determine whether it performs such
functions within the United States. This analysis may involve two separate sets of costs: costs
associated with determining whether it has entered into contracts, including user or technical
agreements, with a U.S. person to enable the U.S. person to report security-based swap data to it,
and costs associated with determining whether it otherwise performs the functions of an SDR
within the United States, for example, by maintaining certain operations within the United States.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the assessment costs associated with
determining the U.S. person status of parties to agreements with the non-U.S. person that
performs the functions of an SDR should be primarily one-time costs of establishing a practice or
compliance procedure of requesting and collecting representations from the parties to such
agreements and maintaining the representations collected as part of the recordkeeping procedures
1835

The Commission recognizes that some non-U.S. persons that perform the functions of an SDR
may do so entirely outside the United States and thus may determine that they do not need to
incur any assessment costs related to the Commission’s proposed approach.

1836

As a general matter, the Commission provides a list of MOUs and other arrangements, which are
available at the following link:
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_cooparrangements.shtml.

1837

Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry
2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff estimates that the
average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379.

1838

This total is based on the assumption that as many as 20 non-U.S. persons that perform the
functions of an SDR would seek outside legal counsel to determine the nature of any operations
or other activity performed within the United States. Although there appear to be fewer than 10
such persons that are currently accepting and reporting on security-based swaps (see FSB
Progress Report April 2013 at 20-21, 63-65), our estimate that as many as 20 such persons may
perform this analysis is intended to account for the possibility that new market entrants may seek
to provide such services in the future.

542

and limited ongoing costs associated with requesting and collecting representations. The
Commission preliminarily believes that such one-time per-person costs would be approximately
$15,160, 1839 with aggregate one-time costs of approximately $303,200.
The assessment costs associated with determining whether the non-U.S. person otherwise
performs the functions of an SDR within the United States would likely involve an analysis of
the location of the non-U.S. person’s various operations and, with respect to any operations that
occur within the United States, a determination of whether such operations constitute the
performance of the functions of an SDR. The Commission preliminarily believes that the
aggregate one-time costs associated with this analysis would be approximately $500,000. 1840
(c) Alternative to Proposed Approach
In developing our approach to the application of the SDR Requirements to non-U.S.
persons that perform the functions of an SDR, the Commission considered requiring such
persons that perform the functions of an SDR within the United States to comply with the SDR
Requirements, including registering with the Commission, as well as other requirements
applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission. 1841 In such a scenario, a non-U.S. person
performing the functions of an SDR within the United States would be required to register as an
SDR and incur the costs associated with the SDR Requirements, 1842 as well as other
requirements applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission.1843 The Commission
preliminarily believes that the marginal benefit of requiring all non-U.S. persons that perform the
functions of an SDR within the United States to register with the Commission, even where
similar objectives could be achieved through an exemption conditioned on a supervisory and
enforcement MOU or other arrangement with each regulatory authority with supervisory
authority over such non-U.S. persons, would be insignificant, particularly in light of the costs
that such non-U.S. persons would incur in complying with the SDR Requirements, as well as
other requirements applicable to SDRs registered with the Commission.1844

This estimate is based on estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s time to
establish a procedure of requesting and collecting representations from trading counterparties,
taking into account that such representation may be built into form of standardized trading
documentation. As noted above, the staff estimates that the average national hourly rate for an inhouse attorney is $379. See note 1426, supra.

1840

We have estimated that this analysis would cost an average of $25,000 per person and that as
many as 20 non-U.S. persons may incur such costs. This estimate is based on staff experience in
undertaking legal analysis of status under federal securities laws.

The Commission seeks comment on the proposed interpretive guidance and SDR
Exemption, and alternatives to our proposed approach, in all aspects. Interested persons are
encouraged to provide supporting data and analysis and, when appropriate, suggest modifications
or alternatives to the proposed interpretive guidance and SDR Exemption. In addition, the
Commission seeks comment on the specific questions below.
•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the expected programmatic benefits of
our proposed interpretive guidance and SDR Exemption? If not, please explain why
and provide information on how such costs and benefits should be assessed.

•

Are the programmatic benefits and costs discussed above accurate? If not, why not?
How should the Commission assess the benefits and costs associated with our
proposed interpretive guidance and SDR Exemption compared to their anticipated
benefits of increasing transparency in the security-based swap market?

•

Are there quantifiable programmatic benefits or costs associated with the
Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and the SDR Exemption that are not
discussed above, but that the Commission should consider? If so, please identify and
describe them as thoroughly as possible, using relevant data and statistics where
available.

•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the benefits and costs of the alternative
approach to the Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and SDR Exemption?
In answering this question, consider addressing whether the Commission has
appropriately considered the benefits and costs of duplicative regulatory regimes,
including duplicative requirements governing SDRs.

•

How would the Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and the SDR
Exemption affect efficiency, competition, and capital formation, including the
competitive or anticompetitive effects that such guidance and exemption may have on
market participants? Are there other existing or proposed laws, rules, or regulations
affecting SDRs in particular jurisdictions that affect efficiency, competition, and
capital formation that the Commission should consider? If so, please identify and
describe these effects as thoroughly as possible.

•

Are there costs in fulfilling the condition in the SDR Exemption that the Commission
has not discussed above? If so, what?

•

Would the condition requiring a supervisory and enforcement MOU with a foreign
supervisory regulator impose costs on non-U.S. persons performing the functions of
an SDR within the United States? Further, would delay in entering into a supervisory
and enforcement MOU or other arrangement (or the inability to enter into such MOU
or arrangement) impose costs on such non-U.S. persons or market participants more
generally? Would it have adverse consequences for liquidity in the security-based
swap market?

•

Should the Commission consider other alternatives to our proposed interpretive
guidance and the SDR Exemption? What would be the benefits and costs of such
alternative approaches?
2. Relevant Authorities’ Access to Security-Based Swap Information and the
Indemnification Requirement

One key function that SDRs will perform is making available to the Commission and
other relevant authorities information relating to security-based swap transactions. As described
above, 1845 Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 1846 and previously proposed Rule 13n4(b)(9) thereunder provide that an SDR shall on a confidential basis, pursuant to Section 24 of
the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder, upon request, and after notifying the
Commission (“Notification Requirement”), make available all data obtained by the SDR,
including individual counterparty trade and position data, to certain domestic authorities and any
other person that the Commission determines to be appropriate, including, but not limited to,
foreign financial supervisors (including foreign futures authorities), foreign central banks, and
foreign ministries. Section 13(n)(5)(H) of the Exchange Act 1847 and previously proposed Rule
13n-4(b)(10) further provide that before sharing information with any entity described in Section
13(n)(5)(G) 1848 or previously proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(9), respectively, an SDR must obtain a
written agreement from the entity stating that the entity shall abide by the confidentiality
requirements described in Section 24 of the Exchange Act, 1849 and the rules and regulations
thereunder, relating to the information on security-based swap transactions that is provided; in
addition, the entity shall agree to indemnify the SDR and the Commission for any expenses
arising from litigation relating to the information provided under Section 24 of the Exchange
Act 1850 and the rules and regulations thereunder (“Indemnification Requirement”).
(a) Benefits and Costs of Relevant Authorities’ Access to Security-Based Swap
Data under the Dodd-Frank Act
As discussed above, 1851 the Commission believes that Sections 13(n)(5)(G) and
13(n)(5)(H) of the Exchange Act 1852 are intended to, among other things, obligate SDRs to make
available security-based swap information to relevant authorities and maintain the confidentiality

of such information. More broadly, the Dodd-Frank Act is intended to, among other things,
promote the financial stability of the U.S. financial system by improving accountability and
transparency in the financial system. 1853 To the extent that SDRs fulfill these statutory goals, the
Commission preliminarily believes that certain benefits and costs will result.
i.

Benefits of Relevant Authorities’ Access to Security-Based Swap Data

As discussed below, the Commission preliminarily believes that there are a number of
benefits associated with providing relevant authorities with access to security-based swap data
maintained by SDRs registered with the Commission (“SDR Data”).
First, the Commission preliminarily believes that providing relevant authorities with such
access would increase transparency in the security-based swap market, thereby facilitating
oversight of the security-based swap market. SDRs are expected to retain complete records of
security-based swap transactions and maintain the integrity of those records. 1854 To the extent
that SDRs provide relevant authorities with effective access to those records in line with the
respective information needs arising out of the authorities’ regulatory mandates and legal
responsibilities, SDRs will play a key role in increasing transparency in the security-based swap
market. In having such effective access, these authorities will likely be better positioned to
prevent market manipulation, fraud, and other market abuses; monitor the financial responsibility
and soundness of market participants; perform market surveillance and macroprudential
(systemic risk) supervision; resolve issues and positions after an institution fails; monitor
compliance with relevant regulatory requirements; and respond to market turmoil. 1855
Second, the Commission preliminarily believes that providing relevant foreign authorities
with access to SDR Data may minimize fragmentation of security-based swap data among trade
repositories globally. If relevant foreign authorities are unable to access SDR Data, then they
may establish trade repositories in their jurisdictions to ensure access to data that they need to

1853

1854

See SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307; see also Section 13(n)(5)(C) of the Exchange Act
(requiring SDRs to maintain security-based swap data), as added by Section 763(i) of the DoddFrank Act, and proposed Rules 13n-5(b)(3) and (4) under the Exchange Act (requiring SDRs to
establish, maintain, and enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that
transaction data and positions are accurate and to maintain the transaction data and positions for
specified periods of time).

1855

See, e.g., SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307, 77356, as corrected at 76 FR 79320 (“The
data maintained by an SDR may also assist regulators in (i) preventing market manipulation,
fraud, and other market abuses; (ii) performing market surveillance, prudential supervision, and
macroprudential (systemic risk) supervision; and (iii) resolving issues and positions after an
institution fails . . . . [I]ncreased transparency on where exposure to risk reside in financial
markets . . . will allow regulators to monitor and act before the risks become systemically
relevant. Therefore, SDRs will help achieve systemic risk monitoring.”).

546

perform their regulatory mandates and legal responsibilities.1856 By minimizing such
fragmentation, relevant authorities would likely be able to access, aggregate, and analyze
relevant data more efficiently, which should, in turn, enhance regulatory effectiveness.
Third, the Commission preliminarily believes that providing relevant foreign authorities
with access to SDR Data may reduce costs to market participants by reducing the potential for
duplicative security-based swap transaction reporting requirements in multiple jurisdictions. The
Commission anticipates that relevant foreign authorities will likely impose their own reporting
requirements on market participants that fall within their jurisdiction; given the global nature of
the security-based swap market and the large number of cross-border transactions, the
Commission recognizes that it is likely that such transactions may be subject to the reporting
requirements of at least two jurisdictions. The Commission preliminarily believes, however, that
if relevant authorities are able to access security-based swap data in trade repositories outside
their jurisdiction, such as SDRs registered with the Commission, as needed, then relevant
authorities may be more inclined to permit market participants involved in such transactions to
fulfill their reporting requirements by reporting the transactions to a single trade repository,
rather than to separate trade repositories in each applicable jurisdiction, thereby potentially
reducing market participants’ compliance costs associated with establishing multiple reporting
systems to multiple SDRs. Similarly, market participants would likely be able to access,
aggregate, and analyze their data more efficiently in a single trade repository, than if they were
required to report data to separate trade repositories in each applicable jurisdiction.
ii.

Costs of Relevant Authorities’ Access to Security-Based Swap Data

The Commission preliminarily believes that although there are benefits to SDRs
providing access to relevant authorities to SDR Data, such access will likely involve certain
costs, or more specifically, risks. For example, the Commission expects that SDRs will maintain
data that is proprietary and highly sensitive 1857 and that is subject to strict confidentiality
requirements. 1858 Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act, however, requires an SDR to make
available data obtained by the SDR to authorities identified in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the
Exchange Act. 1859 Extending access to SDR Data to anyone, including relevant authorities,

1856

Cf. Cleary Letter IV at 31 (The Indemnification Requirement “could be a significant impediment
to effective regulatory coordination, since non-U.S. regulators may establish parallel
requirements for U.S. regulators to access swap data reported in their jurisdictions.”).

1857

As the Commission has noted in the SDR Proposing Release, such data could include information
about a market participant’s trades or its trading strategy; it may also include nonpublic personal
information. See 75 FR at 77339.

1858

See Section 13(n)(5)(F) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(F), as added by Section 763(i)
of the Dodd-Frank Act, and proposed Rules 13n-4(b)(8) and 13n-9 under the Exchange Act.

1859

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act; see also proposed
Rules 13n-4(b)(9) and (b)(10) under the Exchange Act.

547

increases the risk of the confidentiality of SDR Data not being preserved. 1860 A relevant
authority’s inability to maintain the confidentiality of SDR Data could erode market participants’
confidence in the integrity of the security-based swap market, thereby leading to reduced
liquidity in the security-based swap market, hindering price discovery, and impeding the capital
formation process. 1861
To help mitigate these risks, Sections 13(n)(5)(G) and (H) of the Exchange Act impose
certain conditions on access to SDR Data by relevant authorities. 1862 Specifically, Section
13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 1863 limits the authorities that may access SDR Data to an
enumerated list of domestic authorities and any other persons, including foreign authorities,
determined by the Commission to be appropriate and requires that an SDR notify the
Commission when the SDR receives a request for SDR Data from an authority. Section
13(n)(5)(H) of the Exchange Act 1864 requires that, before an SDR shares security-based swap
information with a relevant authority, the SDR must receive a written agreement from a relevant
authority that it will abide by the confidentiality requirements described in Section 24 of the
Exchange Act relating to the information provided by the SDR, and the relevant authority will
agree to indemnify the SDR and the Commission for any expenses arising from litigation relating
to the information provided under Section 24 of the Exchange Act. 1865
(b) Benefits and Costs of Proposed Guidance and Exemptive Rule
As discussed above, the Commission is (1) proposing interpretive guidance to specify
how SDRs may comply with the Notification Requirement, (2) specifying how it proposes to
determine whether a relevant authority is appropriate for purposes of receiving SDR Data, and
(3) proposing the Indemnification Exemption.1866 The Commission is proposing each of these to
facilitate access to SDR Data by relevant authorities and to enable SDRs to fulfill their

proposed Rules 13n-4(b)(9) and 13n-4(b)(10) in a manner consistent with relevant authorities’
need to have access to SDR Data that will enable them to carry out their regulatory mandates and
legal responsibilities effectively and efficiently. 1868 The Commission preliminarily believes that
our proposed guidance and the Indemnification Exemption would help realize the anticipated
benefits of access to SDR Data by relevant authorities, as discussed above in Section XV.H.2(a)i,
while at the same time mitigating the risks and other costs associated with such access, as
discussed above in Section XV.H.2(a)ii. The Commission also preliminarily believes that, taken
together, our proposed guidance and the Indemnification Exemption will enable the Commission
and SDRs to respond promptly and flexibly to the needs of relevant authorities.
i.

Notification Requirement

The Commission preliminarily believes that an SDR can comply with the Notification
Requirement in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 1869 and previously proposed Rule 13n4(b)(9) thereunder by notifying the Commission, upon the initial request for security-based swap
data by a relevant authority, that such relevant authority has made a request for security-based
swap data from the SDR, and maintaining records of the initial request and all subsequent
requests. 1870 Under this proposed interpretation, where an SDR complies with the above, the
Commission will consider the notice provided and records maintained as satisfying the
Notification Requirement.
In the Commission’s preliminary view, SDRs would be less burdened under this
interpretation of the Notification Requirement than under an interpretation that would require
SDRs to provide the Commission with actual notice of all requests for SDR Data by relevant
authorities because SDRs would have to actually notify the Commission only one time for each
relevant authority. The Commission estimates that approximately 200 relevant authorities may
make requests for SDR Data from SDRs. 1871 Based on the Commission’s experience in making
1867

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G) and (H), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

See SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77356.

1869

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

1870

See Section VI.C.3(a), supra.

1871

The Commission preliminarily believes that each of the entities in the United States that is
specifically listed in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G), as added
by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act, may request SDR Data from SDRs. Section
13(n)(5)(G) specifically lists each appropriate prudential regulator (which includes the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, the
Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the Farm Credit Administration, and the Federal Housing
Finance Agency), the Financial Stability Oversight Council, the CFTC, and the Department of
Justice. The Commission also preliminarily expects that certain SROs and registered futures
associations may request SDR Data from SDRs. Therefore, the Commission estimates that
approximately 10 relevant authorities in the United States may request SDR Data from SDRs.
The Commission also estimates that each of the G20 countries will have no more than 10 relevant

549

requests for security-based swap data from trade repositories, the Commission estimates that
each relevant authority may make about 12 requests for SDR Data per year. An alternative
interpretation that would require SDRs to provide the Commission with actual notice of all
requests for SDR Data by relevant authorities would naturally increase the burden on SDRs to
notify the Commission. Therefore, over the course of a year, under the Commission’s proposed
interpretation of the Notification Requirement, the Commission estimates that an SDR would
provide the Commission with actual notice approximately 200 times, whereas under an
interpretation that would require SDRs to provide the Commission with actual notice of all
requests for SDR Data by relevant authorities, the Commission estimates that the SDR would
provide the Commission with actual notice approximately 2400 times. Because SDRs would be
required to provide actual notification to the Commission only upon the first request of a relevant
authority, rather than upon every request, SDRs should be able to respond to requests for SDR
Data by relevant authorities more promptly and at lower cost than requiring SDRs to notify the
Commission of every request.
The Commission’s proposed interpretation would also minimize an impediment to
relevant authorities’ direct access to SDR Data to fulfill their regulatory mandates and legal
responsibilities because SDRs would not be required to provide the Commission with actual
notice of every request prior to providing access to the requesting relevant authority. If SDRs
had to actually notify the Commission every time that a relevant authority requested access to
SDR Data (following the initial request), this could interfere with the ability of relevant
authorities to obtain efficiently security-based swap data from SDRs to fulfill their own
regulatory mandate or legal responsibilities. Such an impediment could be a factor in leading
certain relevant authorities to seek to promote the establishment of trade repositories in their own
jurisdictions, which would lead to fragmentation of security-based swap data and SDRs
geographically. By reducing a potential barrier to relevant authorities’ access to SDR Data and
reducing the likelihood of fragmentation of data among trade repositories, the Commission’s
proposed interpretation of the Notification Requirement should enhance the ability of SDRs to
perform their intended functions and thereby increase market transparency and regulatory
effectiveness. Because SDRs would still be required to maintain records of relevant authorities’
requests for SDR Data, the proposed interpretation would also allow the Commission to obtain
this information as needed.
The Commission is aware that our proposed interpretation of the Notification
Requirement will not provide the Commission with actual notice of all relevant authorities’
requests for SDR Data prior to an SDR fulfilling such requests. The Commission preliminarily
believes, however, that the benefits of receiving such notice does not justify the additional costs
that SDRs would incur in providing such notice and the potential delay in relevant authorities
receiving SDR Data that they need to fulfill their regulatory mandates and legal responsibilities.

authorities that may request SDR Data from SDRs. Thus, the Commission estimates that there
will be a total of no more than 200 relevant domestic and foreign authorities that may request
SDR Data from SDRs.

550

ii.

Determination of Appropriate Regulators

The Commission is proposing an approach to determining whether an authority, other
than those expressly identified in Section 13(n)(5)(G) of the Exchange Act 1872 and previously
proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(9) thereunder, should be determined to be appropriate for purposes of
requesting SDR Data. As described above, the Commission preliminarily envisions that this
process will involve consideration of, among other things, the scope of the relevant authority’s
regulatory mandate and legal responsibilities, the authority’s ability to provide the Commission
with reciprocal assistance in securities matters within the Commission’s jurisdiction, and a
supervisory and enforcement MOU or other arrangement that would be designed to protect the
confidentiality of any SDR Data provided to the authority. 1873
The Commission preliminarily believes that our proposed approach has the benefit of
appropriately limiting access to SDR Data by relevant authorities in order to seek to protect the
confidentiality of SDR Data. 1874 The Commission expects that relevant authorities from a wide
range of jurisdictions may seek to obtain a determination by the Commission that they may
appropriately have access to SDR Data. Each of these jurisdictions may have a distinct approach
to supervision, regulation, or oversight of its financial markets or market participants and to the
protection of proprietary and other confidential information. The Commission preliminarily
believes that the process that it is contemplating has the benefit of enabling the Commission to
determine whether an authority has a legitimate interest in the SDR Data, based on its regulatory
mandate or legal responsibilities, and whether the authority is capable of protecting the
confidentiality of SDR Data provided to it. In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes
that this process will allow the Commission to be able to revoke its determination in certain
instances, including, for example, if a relevant authority fails to keep confidential data that an
SDR provides to the authority.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that our proposed approach will reduce the
potential for fragmentation of security-based swap data among trade repositories because it will
reduce the risks of improper disclosure, misappropriation, or misuse of SDR Data. Concerns
about these risks could prompt relevant authorities to promote the development and maintenance
of SDRs in their own jurisdictions rather than entrusting data reported by persons within their
jurisdictions to consolidated trade repositories. As described above, the Commission envisions
that any determination order by the Commission will likely be conditioned on a relevant
authority and the Commission entering into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other
arrangement, which will likely address the confidentiality of SDR Data obtained by the
authority. 1875 Because the Commission’s determination process will likely address
1872

15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(G) (permitting access to SDR Data by “any other person that the
Commission determines to be appropriate”), as added by Section 763(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

1873

See Section VI.C.3(b), supra.

1874

See ESMA Letter at 2 (noting that relevant authorities must ensure the confidentiality of securitybased swap data provided to them).

See Section VI.C.3(b), supra.

551

confidentiality concerns, the Commission preliminarily believes that our proposed approach
would increase relevant authorities’ confidence in the preservation of the confidentiality of SDR
Data shared with the authorities’ counterparts in other jurisdictions, and, in conjunction with the
Commission’s approach to ensuring access to SDR Data by relevant authorities discussed
above, 1876 may reduce incentives for relevant authorities to seek to promote the establishment
and maintenance of SDRs in other jurisdictions. If concerns over confidentiality reduce relevant
authorities’ incentives to promote the establishment and maintenance of SDRs in their own
jurisdictions and market participants operating in those jurisdictions conclude that they may,
under applicable foreign law, use SDRs registered with the Commission for reporting purposes
and therefore do so, then the Commission preliminarily believes that this will improve market
transparency and regulatory efficiency.
Furthermore, the Commission preliminarily believes that our proposal represents an
efficient approach to the determination process that will promote the intended benefits of access
by relevant authorities to SDR Data, as discussed above in Section XV.H.2(a)i. The
Commission routinely negotiates MOUs or other arrangements with foreign authorities in order
to secure mutual assistance or for other purposes, and the Commission preliminarily believes that
the approach that it is proposing is generally consistent with this practice. As such, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the burden of entering into supervisory and enforcement
MOUs or other arrangements with relevant authorities during the Commission’s determination
process will be outweighed by the benefits to relevant authorities in gaining access to SDR Data
to carry out their regulatory mandates or legal responsibilities.
iii.

Exemptive Relief from the Indemnification Requirement

Finally, the Commission is proposing the Indemnification Exemption, which would
provide SDRs registered with the Commission with the option of permitting relevant authorities
to obtain SDR Data without agreeing to indemnify the SDR and the Commission, subject to three
conditions. The first two conditions would limit the exemption to (1) requests by a relevant
authority for security-based swap information made to fulfill a regulatory mandate and/or legal
responsibility of the requesting authority, and (2) requests pertaining to a person or financial
product subject to the jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight of the requesting authority. 1877 The
third condition would require the relevant authority to have entered into a supervisory and
enforcement MOU or other arrangement with the Commission that addresses the confidentiality
of the security-based swap information provided and any other matters as determined by the
Commission.1878 The Commission preliminarily believes that the benefits of the Indemnification
Exemption would include the benefits associated with permitting relevant authorities to access
SDR Data, as discussed in Section XV.H.2(a)i above.

1876

See Section VI.C., supra.

1877

See Section VI.C.3(c), supra.

1878

See id.

552

As discussed above, the Commission preliminarily believes that a rigid application of the
Indemnification Requirement could prevent some relevant domestic authorities and some
relevant foreign authorities from obtaining security-based swap information from SDRs because
they cannot provide an indemnification agreement. 1879 Effectively prohibiting access to SDR
Data by authorities other than the Commission would greatly reduce the ability of an SDR to
provide the market transparency and regulatory efficiency benefits intended under Title VII. 1880
Although relevant authorities could obtain SDR Data from the Commission, 1881 it would likely
be less efficient for relevant authorities to do so than obtaining access to SDR Data directly from
SDRs, particularly in periods of market stress and particularly since SDRs are likely to have
expertise in, and business incentives for, providing such data to relevant authorities efficiently.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that a rigid application of the
Indemnification Requirement could reduce the amount of data held by SDRs registered with the
Commission, thereby potentially reducing the usefulness of such SDRs to relevant authorities
and market participants. To the extent that relevant foreign authorities are effectively limited in
obtaining SDR Data, the relevant authorities may seek to promote the development and
maintenance of SDRs in their own jurisdictions, which would likely lead to fragmentation of
security-based swap data among trade repositories in multiple jurisdictions.1882 Such
fragmentation could result in higher reporting costs for market participants, 1883 who may be
subject to duplicative security-based swap transaction reporting requirements in multiple

1880

See SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77307 (describing expected benefits of SDRs, including
the market transparency benefits of access by regulators); id. at 77356 (“The ability of the
Commission and other regulators to monitor risk and detect fraudulent activity depends on having
access to market data.”).

1881

See Section VI.C.1, supra; see also SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77319.

1882

Cf. Cleary Letter IV at 31 (The Indemnification Requirement “could be a significant impediment
to effective regulatory coordination, since non-U.S. regulators may establish parallel
requirements for U.S. regulators to access swap data reported in their jurisdictions.”).

1883

In the SDR Proposing Release, the Commission noted that multiple SDRs per asset class would
allow for market competition to determine how data is collected. 75 FR at 77358. Although the
Commission continues to recognize that multiple SDRs may in some circumstances increase
competition and lower costs associated with reporting and other Title VII requirements, the
Commission preliminarily believes that fragmentation of security-based swap data among trade
repositories under the circumstances described here would not likely increase competition or
reduce costs. In a jurisdictionally-fragmented global market, an increase in the number of trade
repositories in one jurisdiction may not increase the number of alternative trade repositories in
another jurisdiction to which a counterparty may report. In such a market, counterparties to
security-based swap transactions occurring wholly within one jurisdiction would likely not be
free to choose to report to a trade repository in another jurisdiction to satisfy applicable reporting
requirements. Similarly, cross-border transactions subject to the reporting requirements of two or
more jurisdictions would likely be required to be reported to trade repositories in each of the
jurisdictions that require the transactions to be reported.

jurisdictions, and would likely increase other costs that both relevant authorities and market
participants may incur, including, for example, their inability to aggregate data across multiple
SDRs. 1884
The Commission preliminarily believes that, in addition to addressing the concerns raised
by a rigid application of the Indemnification Requirement, the Indemnification Exemption is
beneficial because it would mitigate the risks associated with permitting relevant authorities to
obtain access to SDR Data, as discussed above in Section XV.H.2(a)ii. The Indemnification
Exemption would be available only for requests that are consistent with each requesting
authority’s regulatory mandate or legal responsibilities and only for SDR Data pertaining to a
person or financial product subject to the requesting authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or
oversight. The Commission preliminarily believes that these conditions significantly reduce the
confidentiality concerns relating to relevant authorities’ access to SDR Data, 1885 as authorities
are likely to be sensitive to the need for confidentiality of data, particularly if the data pertains to
matters in which they have an interest, i.e., data within their own regulatory mandates or legal
responsibilities and to persons and financial products under their own jurisdiction, supervision,
or oversight. Similarly, because the Indemnification Exemption is voluntary, the SDR may
choose not to rely on the Indemnification Exemption, such as under circumstances where the
risks associated with providing access to SDR Data may be unreasonably high – for example,
where a relevant authority has a previous history of weak protections for preserving the
confidentiality of SDR Data. Further, even where the SDR opts to rely on the Indemnification
Exemption, the Commission will have an opportunity to evaluate the confidentiality protections
provided by the relevant authority in the context of negotiations of a supervisory and
enforcement MOU or other arrangement. 1886
The Commission envisions that, to meet the first two conditions in the Indemnification
Exemption, an SDR may incur costs in determining whether a relevant authority’s request for
data falls within its regulatory mandate or legal responsibilities and pertains to a person or
1884

See SDR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 77358. The costs associated with aggregating the data of
multiple SDRs would likely be significantly higher under the circumstances described here, as
different jurisdictions are likely to impose different requirements regarding how data is to be
reported and maintained.

1885

See, e.g., ESMA Letter at 2 (noting that relevant authorities must ensure the confidentiality of
security-based swap data provided to them).

1886

For the Indemnification Exemption to apply to the requests of a particular requesting authority,
the Commission would be required to enter into a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other
arrangement with such authority, which would enable the Commission to determine, prior to
operation of the Indemnification Exemption, that the authority has a regulatory mandate or legal
responsibilities to access SDR Data, that it agrees to protect the confidentiality of any securitybased swap information provided to it, and that it will provide reciprocal assistance in securities
matters within the Commission’s jurisdiction. See Section VI.C.3(c), supra. In addition, if an
SDR determines that it would prefer not to invoke the exemption, it would have the option to
require an indemnification agreement from a relevant authority that seeks to access SDR Data.
See Section VI.C.3(c), supra.

financial product subject to the authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or oversight. The
Commission preliminarily believes, however, that an SDR’s costs for meeting the first two
conditions in the Indemnification Exemption would be minimal, if any, in light of the burden
already imposed by an SDR’s statutory duty to maintain the privacy of security-based swap
information that it receives. 1887 With respect to the third condition in the Indemnification
Exemption, the Commission preliminarily believes that the costs for an SDR to confirm whether
the Commission and a relevant authority have entered into a supervisory and enforcement MOU
or other arrangement would be minimal because such information should generally be readily
available. 1888
1887

See Section 13(n)(5)(F) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78m(n)(5)(F), as added by Section 763(i)
of the Dodd-Frank Act; see also proposed Rule 13n-4(b)(8) under the Exchange Act (requiring
SDRs to maintain the privacy of any and all security-based swap transaction information that the
SDR receives from a security-based swap dealer, counterparty, or certain registered entity) and
proposed Rule 13n-9 under the Exchange Act (requiring an SDR to protect the privacy of
security-based swap transaction information that the SDR receives by, among other things,
establishing safeguards, policies, and procedures that are reasonably designed to protect such
information and that address, without limitation, the SDR limiting access to confidential
information, material, nonpublic information, and intellectual property). The Commission
preliminarily believes that in order to comply with an SDR’s statutory privacy duty, the SDR will
most likely decide that it is reasonable to consider whether a relevant authority’s request for
security-based swap information is within its regulatory mandate or legal responsibilities and
pertains to a person or financial product within the authority’s jurisdiction, supervision, or
oversight before the SDR provides the information. If so, then the Commission preliminarily
believes that the SDR’s costs for meeting the first two conditions in the Indemnification
Exemption would be minimal, if any, because these conditions will most likely be already
addressed in the SDR’s policies and procedures required by previously proposed Rule 13n-9
under the Exchange Act. As discussed in the SDR Proposing Release, the Commission
anticipated that the primary costs to SDRs for complying with proposed Rule 13n-9 would be
derived from developing, maintaining, and ensuring compliance with the required policies and
procedures. 75 FR at 77363. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional
Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hourwork-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead), the Commission now estimates that the average initial paperwork cost associated with
proposed Rule 13n-9 would be 630 hours and $60,000 in outside legal costs for each SDR. The
Commission also estimates that the average ongoing paperwork cost would be 180 hours per year
for each SDR and that assuming a maximum of ten SDRs, the aggregate one-time estimated
dollar cost to comply with proposed Rule 13n-9 would be $2,553,000, which is calculated as
follows: ($60,000 for outside legal services + (Compliance Attorney at $310 per hour for 630
hours)) * 10 registrants = $2,553,000. The Commission further estimates that the aggregate
ongoing estimated dollar cost per year to comply with proposed Rule 13n-9 would be $558,000,
which is calculated as follows: (Compliance Attorney at $310 per hour for 180 hours) * 10
registrants = $558,000.

1888

As a general matter, the Commission provides a list of MOUs and other arrangements, which are
available at the following link:
http://www.sec.gov/about/offices/oia/oia_cooparrangements.shtml.

555

Even if all the conditions in the Indemnification Exemption are satisfied, SDRs would
have the option to seek to obtain an indemnification agreement from a relevant authority. The
Commission recognizes that the conditions in the Indemnification Exemption would not
necessarily provide SDRs that invoke the exemption with the same level of protection that an
indemnification agreement would provide (i.e., coverage for any expenses arising from litigation
relating to information provided to a relevant authority) and thus, SDRs may decide to weigh the
potential risks in not seeking an indemnification agreement from a relevant authority with the
benefits of invoking the exemption.
The Commission preliminarily believes, however, that the conditions in the exemption
would provide an additional layer of protection of the confidentiality of SDR Data—albeit
different from the protection provided by an indemnification agreement—and that in cases where
SDRs choose the exemption, such SDRs presumably believe that the benefits of the exemption,
as discussed above, justify the costs of invoking the exemption. However, even in cases where
the exemption is not chosen, the availability of the option is valuable to SDRs because the
exemption would provide SDRs with an alternative to the Indemnification Requirement and an
opportunity to choose the lower cost alternative.
(c) Alternatives to Proposed Guidance and Exemptive Relief
i.

Notification Requirement

The Commission considered requiring SDRs to provide actual notice to the Commission
of all requests for SDR Data by relevant authorities prior to SDRs fulfilling such requests. The
Commission preliminarily believes, however, that the benefits of receiving actual notice for each
and every request does not justify the additional costs imposed on SDRs to provide such notice
and the potential delay in relevant authorities receiving SDR Data that they need to fulfill their
regulatory mandates and legal responsibilities. The Commission also preliminarily believes that
our proposed approach is the most efficient way to interpret the Notification Requirement and
would allow the Commission access to the information needed.
ii.

Determination of Appropriate Regulators

The Commission considered prescribing by rule a specific process to determine whether a
relevant authority is appropriate for purposes of receiving security-based swap data directly from
SDRs that would require, for example, a supervisory and enforcement MOU or other
arrangement. 1889 The Commission preliminarily believes, however, that such a rule is not
necessary because our process for determining an appropriate authority provides the Commission
and relevant authorities greater flexibility to consult on appropriate terms of access to SDR Data,
confidentiality commitments, and reciprocal access commitments on a case-by-case basis.

1889

See, e.g., CFTC Rule 49.17(b), 17 CFR § 49.17(b) (requiring “Appropriate Foreign Regulators”
to have an MOU or similar type of information sharing agreement, or as the CFTC determines on
a case-by-case basis).

556

iii.

Exemptive Relief from the Indemnification Requirement

The Commission considered whether to not propose any exemptive relief from the
Indemnification Requirement. For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes that
the Indemnification Exemption is a better, and more appropriate, alternative to a rigid application
of the Indemnification Requirement. 1890
The Commission preliminarily believes that a rigid application of the Indemnification
Requirement may reduce the expected benefits associated with relevant authorities’ access to
SDR Data, as discussed in Section XV.H.2(a)i above. In particular, the Indemnification
Requirement may prevent some relevant authorities from accessing SDR Data directly from
SDRs registered with the Commission.1891 Although relevant authorities could obtain SDR Data
from the Commission, 1892 it would likely be less efficient for relevant authorities to do so than
obtaining SDR Data access directly from SDRs, particularly in periods of market stress and
particularly since SDRs are likely to have expertise in, and business incentives for, providing
such data to relevant authorities efficiently.
Moreover, the inability of relevant foreign authorities to obtain direct access to SDR Data
from SDRs registered with the Commission would likely increase the risk of data fragmentation
among trade repositories, as many foreign authorities may require establishment and
maintenance of trade repositories in their jurisdictions if such authorities determine that they are
unable to satisfy the Indemnification Requirement; such fragmentation may lead to higher
reporting costs for market participants and less transparency in the security-based swap
market. 1893
The Commission also considered whether to prescribe additional conditions in or
limitations to the Indemnification Exemption, but decided against it. Any additional conditions
or limitations to the Indemnification Exemption would likely impose additional costs on SDRs
that the Commission preliminarily believes are not warranted at this time. The Commission
presently believes that the Indemnification Exemption strikes the right balance in furthering the
goals of the Dodd-Frank Act by providing relevant authorities with access to SDR Data to fulfill
their regulatory mandates and legal requirements while incorporating appropriate limitations to
such access to guard against over-broad or unfettered access to all SDR Data as well as certain
mechanisms to seek to preserve the confidentiality of the SDR Data.

Requirement would frustrate the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act).

the reduction of information accessible to regulators on a timely basis and would greatly diminish

Request for Comment
The Commission requests comments on all aspects of the economic analysis of our
proposed interpretive guidance, Indemnification Exemption, and alternatives to our proposed
approach. Interested persons are encouraged to provide supporting data and analysis and, when
appropriate, suggest modifications to the Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and
Indemnification Exemption. Responses that are supported by data and analysis provide great
assistance to the Commission in considering the benefits and costs of proposed alternatives, as
well as considering the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed alternatives. In addition,
the Commission requests commenters’ views on the following:
•

Has the Commission appropriately considered the expected programmatic benefits
and costs of our proposed interpretative guidance and Indemnification Exemption? If
not, please explain why and provide information on how such benefits and costs
should be assessed.

•

Are the programmatic benefits and costs discussed above accurate? If not, why not
and how can the Commission more accurately describe such benefits and costs?

•

Are there quantifiable programmatic benefits or costs associated with the
Commission’s proposed interpretive guidance and Indemnification Exemption that
are not discussed above, but that the Commission should consider? If so, please
discuss, analyze, and supply relevant data, information, or statistics regarding any
such benefits or costs. For example, how many relevant authorities will likely request
SDR Data from SDRs? What is the average number of requests for SDR Data that an
SDR may receive from relevant authorities per year?

•

Are there costs in fulfilling any of the conditions in the Indemnification Exemption
that the Commission has not discussed above? If so, what?

•

Do you agree that an SDR’s costs for meeting the first two conditions in the
Indemnification Exemption would be minimal, if any, because these conditions will
most likely be already addressed in the SDR’s policies and procedures required by
previously proposed Rule 13n-9 under the Exchange Act? If not, please explain.

•

Do SDRs have appropriate incentives to rely on the Indemnification Exemption? Are
there circumstances in which an SDR may rely on an Indemnification Exemption
when it is inappropriate to do so? Conversely, would SDRs have incentives to
require indemnification despite the availability of the Indemnification Exemption?
Please explain.

•

What kinds of legal frameworks will relevant authorities operate under? Will some
relevant authorities operate under legal frameworks that do not impose confidentiality
restrictions on the use of data that are comparable to those governing SDRs and those
applicable to the Commission?

Has the Commission appropriately considered the benefits and costs of the alternative
approaches to the Commission’s interpretive guidance and Indemnification
Exemption? If not, why not?
3. Economic Analysis of the Re-proposal of Regulation SBSR

As discussed above, although the Commission is re-proposing all of Regulation SBSR,
the new elements of the re-proposal relate directly to cross-border issues, are conforming
changes necessitated by those larger changes, or are technical changes designed to facilitate
understanding of those other changes. However, since Regulation SBSR was proposed but has
not yet been adopted, the discussion below will include costs and benefits of the initial proposal
from a pre-statutory baseline and then consider the changes to the initial assessments of costs and
benefits implied by the re-proposal.
Broadly, the Commission continues to believe, as described in the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release, that Regulation SBSR taken as a whole would result in improved market
quality, improved risk management, greater efficiency, and improved Commission oversight. 1894
Today’s re-proposal of Regulation SBSR is intended to further these goals while further limiting,
to the extent practicable, the overall costs associated with security-based swap reporting and
public dissemination in cross-border situations. As described in more detail below, the proposed
revisions were suggested by many commenters to the initial proposal and are designed, among
other things, to better align reporting duties with larger entities that have greater resources and
capability to report 1895 and to reduce the potential for duplicative reporting. 1896 These revisions

See, e.g., SIFMA AMG Letter at 2 (stating that, due to their commercial interests and
technological expertise, non-U.S. security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants would be as likely as U.S. security-based swap dealers and major security-based
swap participants to comply with the reporting obligations, or would be best positioned to
develop at the lowest cost the necessary technological infrastructure or relationships with third
party service providers); Vanguard Letter at 6 (stating that requiring U.S. end users to report
security-based swaps would be costly and burdensome for end users, particularly for end users
that enter into security-based swaps on an isolated basis); MarkitSERV Letter I at 9 (noting that,
in light of end users’ resources and the operational and technical challenges of security-based
swap reporting, it will often be most efficient for a U.S. end user to delegate reporting to its nonU.S. security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant counterparty); DTCC
Letter II at 27 (stating that the Commission’s failure to encourage arrangements through which
non-U.S. dealers could submit transaction reports for customers that are U.S. persons would
impose significant burdens and costs on U.S. money managers, which likely would be passed to
individual investors, pension funds, and state and local governments); Cleary Letter IV at 28
(stating that requiring U.S. end users to report security-based swaps entered into with non-U.S.
security-based swap dealers would be unduly burdensome for end users and could negatively
impact the competitiveness of affected U.S. markets); ISDA/SIFMA Letter I at 19 (the end-user

should help to maximize the benefits and minimize the potential costs of regulatory reporting and
public dissemination of security-based swaps faced by market participants.
The Commission seeks public comment on the costs and benefits that re-proposed
Regulation SBSR would entail. The Commission encourages commenters to identify, discuss,
analyze, and supply relevant data, information, or statistics regarding any such costs or benefits.
In particular, the Commission seeks comment on the following:
•
•
•
•

Taken together, what are the costs and benefits of re-proposed Regulation SBSR?
Would the revisions contained in re-proposed Regulation SBSR result in benefits or
costs not identified by the Commission? If so, please describe.
Has the Commission accurately identified and described all relevant benefits and
costs associated with re-proposed Regulation SBSR?
Could re-proposed Regulation SBSR be further enhanced, consistent with the DoddFrank Act, to maximize aggregate benefits and minimize costs to the security-based
swap market?
(a) Modifications to “Reporting Party” Rules and Jurisdictional Reach of
Regulation SBSR – Re-proposed Rules 901(a) and 908(a)
i.

Initial Proposal

Rule 901(a), as initially proposed, set forth three scenarios for assigning the duty to report
a security-based swap transaction. Proposed Rule 901(a)(1) would provide that, where only one
counterparty to a security-based swap is a U.S. person, the U.S. person would be the reporting
party. Proposed Rule 901(a)(2) would assign reporting responsibilities as follows:
•

With respect to a security-based swap in which only one counterparty is a securitybased swap dealer or major security-based swap participant, the security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant would be the reporting party;

•

With respect to a security-based swap in which one counterparty is a security-based
swap dealer and the other counterparty is a major security-based swap participant, the
security-based swap dealer would be the reporting party; and

reporting requirement could result in the inadvertent exclusion of non-U.S. security-based swap
dealers, which could increase systemic risk by decreasing liquidity and further concentrating the
U.S. security-based swap market); Cleary Letter II at 18 (end users and other unregistered
counterparties might refuse to enter into security-based swaps with foreign security-based swap
dealers or major security-based swap participants to avoid the costs of developing the necessary
reporting systems, thereby potentially reducing price competition).
1896

See notes 1136-1141, supra.

560

•

With respect to any other security-based swap not described in the first two cases, the
counterparties to the security-based swap would select a counterparty to be the
reporting party.

Proposed Rule 901(a)(3), as originally proposed, would provide that, if neither party is a U.S.
person but the security-based swap is executed in the United States or through any means of
interstate commerce, or is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal place of
business in the United States, the counterparties to the security-based swap would be required to
select a counterparty to be the reporting party.
Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, would delineate the scope of the security-based swap
market that would be subject to regulatory reporting and public dissemination under Regulation
SBSR. Proposed Rule 908(a) provided that a security-based swap would be subject to these
requirements if the security-based swap: (1) has at least one counterparty that is a U.S. person;
(2) is executed in the United States or through any means of interstate commerce; or (3) is
cleared through a registered clearing agency having its principal place of business in the United
States. If a security-based swap met any of the tests in proposed Rule 908(a), the counterparties
would then look to proposed Rule 901(a) to determine which of them would be required to report
the security-based swap. Rule 908(a), as initially proposed, would not impose reporting
requirements in connection with a security-based swap solely because one of the counterparties
is guaranteed by a U.S. person.
Rule 902, as initially proposed, would require the public dissemination of security-based
swaps that met the scope requirements of proposed Rule 908(a). Proposed Rule 902(a) set out
the core requirement that a registered SDR, immediately upon receiving a transaction report of a
security-based swap, would be required to publicly disseminate information about that securitybased swap consisting of all the information reported by the reporting party pursuant to proposed
Rule 901(c), plus any indicator(s) contemplated by the registered SDR’s policies and procedures
that would be required by proposed Rule 907. 1897
a. Programmatic Benefits of Initial Proposal
The Regulation SBSR Proposing Release discussed various benefits that could result
from proposed Rule 901. 1898 For example, the Commission anticipated that proposed Rule 901
1897

Block trades would be subject to special dissemination rules. Section 13(m)(1)(E) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78(m)(1)(E), provides that, with respect to cleared security-based
swaps, the rule promulgated by the Commission related to public dissemination shall contain
provisions that “specify the criteria for determining what constitutes a large notional securitybased swap transaction (block trade) for particular market and contracts” and “specify the
appropriate time delay for reporting large notional security-based swap transactions (block trades)
to the public.” The Commission in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release did not propose how
to define a “block trade.” As noted in Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
intends to do so in a separate proposal. See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at
75228.

1898

561

would provide the Commission with a better understanding of the security-based swap market
generally, including the size and scope of that market, as the Commission would have access to
data held by SDRs. 1899 Such access is designed to promote more effective systemic regulation,
and provide the Commission with better information to examine for improper market behavior
and to take enforcement actions. Furthermore, specifying general types of information to be
reported and publicly disseminated could increase the efficiency and level of standardization in
the security-based swap market. Proposed Rule 901 also could facilitate the reports about the
security-based swap marketplace that the Commission is required to provide to Congress. 1900
The Commission anticipated that proposed Rule 901 would likely require reporting
parties to establish and maintain order management systems (“OMSs”) for capturing and
transmitting data about their security-based swap transactions. Such systems would be necessary
to report data within the timeframes set forth in proposed Rules 901(c) and 901(d), because it is
unlikely that manual processes could capture and report in real time the numerous required data
elements relating to a security-based swaps. There could be substantial benefits in the form of
reduced operational risk in requiring all reporting parties to have such capability, as more timely
capture and storage at firm level of all security-based swap transaction information would
support effective risk management. Counterparties, SDRs, clearing agencies (in some cases),
and regulators would obtain accurate knowledge of new security-based swap transactions more
quickly. Reporting parties that obtain such systems could see additional benefits in being able to
process and manage risk or to exploit operational efficiency gains to expand their participation in
the security-based swap market.
The information reported by reporting parties pursuant to proposed Rule 901(c) would be
used by registered SDRs to publicly disseminate real-time reports of security-based swap
transactions under proposed Rule 902. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the
Commission highlighted numerous benefits of the public dissemination requirement in proposed
Rule 902. Among other things, the Commission stated that “[b]y reducing information
asymmetries, post-trade transparency has the potential to lower transaction costs, improve
confidence in the market, encourage participation by a larger number of market participants, and
increase liquidity in the security-based swap market.” 1901 The Commission noted the opacity of
the current security-based swap market and stated that “[m]arket participants, even dealers, lack
an effective mechanism to learn the prices at which other market participants transact.” 1902
Requiring prompt dissemination of last-sale information would provide all market participants
with more extensive and more accurate information on which to make trading and valuation
determinations. Moreover, the Commission noted that post-trade pricing and volume
information “could allow valuation models to be adjusted to reflect how [security-based swap]

electronic access to their data).

counterparties have valued a [security-based swap] instrument at a specific moment in time” 1903
and that public, real-time dissemination of last-sale information “also could aid dealers in
deriving better quotations, because they would know the prices at which other market
participants have recently traded.” 1904 Post-trade transparency of security-based swap
transactions also could improve market participants’ ability to value security-based swaps,
especially in opaque markets or markets with low liquidity where recent quotations or last-sale
prices may not exist or, if they do exist, may not be widely available. Better valuations could
create a benefit in the form of more efficient capital allocation and ultimately could reduce
systemic risks. 1905
b. Programmatic Costs of Initial Proposal
The proposed security-based swap reporting requirements would also impose initial and
ongoing costs on reporting parties. In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
stated our preliminarily belief that certain of these costs would be a function of the number of
reportable events 1906 and the data elements required to be submitted for each reportable event.
The Commission preliminarily estimated that security-based swap market participants would
face three categories of costs to comply with proposed Rule 901. First, each reporting party
would have to develop an internal OMS capable of capturing relevant security-based swap
transaction information so that it could be reported. Second, each reporting party would have to
implement a reporting mechanism. Third, each reporting party would have to establish an
appropriate compliance program and support for operating the OMS and reporting
mechanism. 1907 The Commission preliminarily estimated that up to 1,000 entities could be
reporting parties under proposed Rule 901(a) and that the first-year aggregate costs associated
with proposed Rule 901 would be $511,013 per reporting party, for a total of $511,013,000 for
all reporting parties. 1908 The Commission preliminarily estimated that the ongoing aggregate
annualized costs associated with proposed Rule 901 would be $316,116 per reporting party, for a
total of $316,116,000 for all reporting parties. 1909 These cost estimates all relied on the
Commission’s preliminary estimate of 1,000 reporting parties. In the Regulation SBSR
Proposing Release, the Commission did not break down the costs of Rule 901 by each paragraph
of Rule 901, but instead calculated costs arising from proposed Rule 901 as a whole.

A reportable event would include both an initial security-based swap transaction, required to be
reported pursuant to proposed Rule 901(b) and the data elements of which would be set forth in
proposed Rule 901(c), as well as a life cycle event, the reporting of which is governed by
proposed Rule 901(e). See id. at 75264-66.

The Commission noted that the costs associated with required reporting pursuant to
proposed Regulation SBSR could represent a barrier to entry for new, smaller firms that might
not have the ability to comply with the proposed reporting requirements or for whom the
expected benefits of compliance might not justify the costs of compliance. To the extent that
proposed Regulation SBSR might deter new firms from entering the security-based swap market,
this would be a cost of the proposal and could negatively impact competition. Nevertheless, the
Commission preliminarily believed that the proposed reporting requirements would not impose
insurmountable barriers to entry, as firms that were reluctant to acquire and build reporting
infrastructure would be able to engage with third-party service providers that carry out any
reporting duties that they incurred under Regulation SBSR. 1910
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
the initial one-time aggregate costs for registered SDRs to develop and implement the systems
needed to disseminate the required transaction information would be $40,004,000, which
corresponds to $4,000,400 per SDR. Further, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
aggregate annual costs on registered SDRs for systems and connectivity upgrades associated
with real-time public dissemination would be $24,002,400, which corresponds to $2,400,240 per
SDR. Overall, the initial aggregate costs associated with proposed Rule 901 for all SDRs were
estimated to be $64,006,400, which corresponds to $6,400,640 per registered SDR. 1911
ii.

Re-proposal

For the reasons discussed above, the Commission is now re-proposing certain provisions
of Regulation SBSR that would extend the scope of security-based swaps that would be subject
to regulatory reporting and public dissemination and, in some cases, to shift the duty to report to
a different counterparty. This re-proposal is being made, in part, to reflect the Commission’s
preliminary belief that in many cases the reporting and public dissemination requirements of
Regulation SBSR should extend to security-based swaps executed outside the United States but
having a U.S. person as an indirect counterparty. The Commission also is revising our approach
to assigning the duty to report to minimize consideration of the domicile of the counterparties,
and to focus more on their registration status (i.e., whether or not a counterparty is a securitybased swap dealer or major security-based swap participant).
To facilitate these revisions, the Commission is proposing to add certain new terms and
definitions and to redefine other terms contained in Rule 900. First, the Commission is now
proposing to redefine the term “counterparty” as “a direct or indirect counterparty of a securitybased swap.” Re-proposed Rule 900 would define “direct counterparty” as “a person that enters
directly with another person into a contract that constitutes a security-based swap” and “indirect
counterparty” as “a person that guarantees the performance of a direct counterparty to a securitybased swap or that otherwise provides recourse to the other side for the failure of the direct
counterparty to perform any obligation under the security-based swap.” Second, re-proposed
1910

564

Rule 900 would eliminate the term “reporting party” and replace it with “reporting side,” and
define “reporting side” as “the side of a security-based swap having the duty to report
information in accordance with §§ 242.900-911 to a registered security-based swap data
repository, or if there is no registered security-based swap data repository that would receive the
information, to the Commission.” “Side” would be defined as “a direct counterparty and any
indirect counterparty that guarantees its performance on the security-based swap.”
The Commission’s revisions would leave much of Rule 901, as initially proposed,
substantially unchanged. Importantly, the Commission is not proposing to modify the basic duty
to report security-based swap transactions to a registered SDR, as set forth in proposed Rule
901(b). Nor is the Commission proposing to add, delete, or substantively change any of the
specific data elements set forth in proposed Rules 901(c) and 901(d) that reporting sides would
be required to report. 1912 Rather, in this re-proposal, the Commission’s substantive revisions to
Rule 901 occur only in paragraph (a), which governs who must report security-based swap
transactions. As described in more detail below, these changes are intended to better align
reporting duties with larger entities that have greater resources and capability to report.
Specifically, re-proposed Rule 901(a) would provide that a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant that is not a U.S. person could incur the duty to report a securitybased swap in various cases. Re-proposed Rule 901(a) would now provide as follows:

1912

•

If both sides of the security-based swap include a security-based swap dealer, the
sides would be required to select the reporting side.

•

If only one side of the security-based swap includes a security-based swap dealer, that
side would be the reporting side.

•

If both sides of the security-based swap include a major security-based swap
participant, the sides would be required to select the reporting side.

•

If one side of the security-based swap includes a major security-based swap
participant and the other side includes neither a security-based swap dealer nor a
major security-based swap participant, the side including the major security-based
swap participant would be reporting side.

•

If neither side of the security-based swap includes a security-based swap dealer or
major security-based swap participant: (i) If both sides include a U.S. person or
neither side includes a U.S. person, the sides would be required to select the reporting
side; and (ii) If only one side includes a U.S. person, that side would be the reporting
side.

However, re-proposed Rules 901(c) and 901(d) under the Exchange Act include certain
conforming changes due to the use of new and revised terms in re-proposed Rule 900 under the
Exchange Act.

565

In conjunction with the proposed changes to Rule 901(a), the Commission also is now
proposing to modify Rule 908(a) to extend the reporting requirement to all security-based swaps
that are guaranteed by a U.S. person and all security-based swaps of security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants, regardless of whether or not they are U.S.
persons. 1913 To reflect these changes, re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1) would provide that a securitybased swap is subject to regulatory reporting if:
•

The security-based swap is a transaction conducted within the United States;

•

There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either side of the
transaction;

•

There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant on either side of the transaction; or

•

The security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States.

Re-proposed Rule 908(a)(2) would provide that a security-based swap shall be subject to
public dissemination if:
•

The transaction is conducted within the United States;

•

There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on each side of the
transaction;

•

At least one direct counterparty is a U.S. person (except in the case of a transaction
conducted through a foreign branch);

•

One side includes a U.S. person and the other side includes a non-U.S. person that is a
security-based swap dealer; or

•

The security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States.

Taken together, these changes to Rule 901(a) and 908(a) would have the cumulative
effect of substantially preserving the reporting hierarchy contemplated in Section 766 of the
Dodd-Frank Act while also taking into account the existence of indirect counterparties that could
affect how the reporting duty is allocated. Thus, the new approach set forth in re-proposed Rule
901(a) would focus more on the status of an entity (i.e., whether it is a security-based swap
dealer or major security-based swap participant), and less on whether or not the counterparties
are U.S. persons. Moreover, re-proposed Rule 908(a)(1) would extend the requirement for
1913

However, the Commission also preliminarily believes that certain of these security-based swaps
need not be subject to public dissemination. See Section VIII.C.1, supra.

566

regulatory reporting to all security-based swaps that are guaranteed by a U.S. person or executed
by security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, regardless of
whether or not they are U.S. persons.
As discussed above, the Commission is re-proposing Rule 902(a) to provide that certain
security-based swaps would be subject to regulatory reporting but not publically disseminated.
Therefore, the Commission is re-proposing Rule 902(a) to provide that a registered SDR would
have no obligation to publicly disseminate a transaction report for any such security-based swap.
The remainder of Rule 902 is substantively unchanged. 1914 However, as result of the
modifications to Rule 908(a)(2), certain transactions involving non-U.S. person security-based
swap dealers, non-U.S. person major swap participants, and/or U.S. person indirect
counterparties that would not have been subject to public dissemination under the initial proposal
would be required to be publicly disseminated under re-proposed Regulation SBSR.
a. Programmatic Benefits
Re-proposed Rule 901(a) would, relative to the initial proposal, change which
counterparty to a security-based swap transaction would be required to report the transaction in
some instances, as the Commission is refocusing the reporting duty primarily on the status of the
counterparties, rather than on whether or not they are U.S. persons. The remainder of the rule
(aside from technical and conforming changes) would remain unchanged from the original
proposal. The Commission preliminarily believes that the benefits identified in the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release associated with proposed Rule 901 would continue to be applicable to
re-proposed Rule 901. These include providing a means for the Commission to gain a better
understanding of the security-based swap market; facilitating public dissemination of securitybased swap transaction information, thus enabling market participants and regulatory authorities
to know the current state of the security-based swap markets and track those markets over time;
and improving risk management by security-based swap counterparties, which would need to
capture and store their transactions in security-based swaps to facilitate reporting.
The Commission preliminarily believes that requiring reporting of security-based swap
transactions that are guaranteed by U.S. persons would provide benefits beyond those under Rule
908(a), as originally proposed. As discussed above, the Commission’s access to such additional
information could facilitate more thorough and complete monitoring of individual security-based
swap market participants and more accurate systemic risk monitoring across the security-based
swap market. In addition, expanding the reach of the security-based swap reporting regime in
this manner is designed to mitigate certain unintended consequences of the original proposal,
such as market participants shifting business to other jurisdictions to avoid reporting obligations.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the benefits identified in the Regulation
SBSR Proposing Release associated with proposed Rule 902 would continue to be applicable to
re-proposed Rule 902. Specifically, the Commission continues to believe that post-trade
1914

However, re-proposed Rule 902 under the Exchange Act includes some conforming changes due
to the use of new and revised terms in re-proposed Rule 900 under the Exchange Act.

567

transparency has the potential to lower transaction costs, improve confidence in the market,
encourage participation by a larger number of market participants, and increase liquidity in the
security-based swap market. 1915 Furthermore, the Commission continues to believe that public,
real-time dissemination of last-sale information could aid dealers in deriving better quotations,
because they would know the prices at which other market participants have recently traded. 1916
In addition, the Commission continues to believe that requiring prompt dissemination of last-sale
information would provide all market participants with more extensive and more accurate
information on which to make trading and valuation determinations and could allow valuation
models to be adjusted to reflect how security-based swap counterparties have valued a securitybased swap instrument at a specific moment in time. 1917 Such information, when made publicly
available, could enhance market participants’ ability to value security-based swaps, especially in
opaque markets or markets with low liquidity where recent quotations or last-sale prices may not
exist or are not widely available. Better valuations could create a benefit in the form of more
efficient capital allocation and ultimately could help reduce systemic risks. 1918
b. Programmatic Costs
Because the majority of proposed Rule 901 is not being revised and the overall emphasis
of the rule and the majority of its specific provisions would not change under the re-proposal, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the infrastructure-related costs identified in the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release associated with proposed Rule 901, on a per-entity basis,
would not change. These include the costs for each reporting party: (i) to develop an OMS
capable of capturing relevant security-based swap transaction information so that it can be
reported; (ii) to implement a reporting mechanism; and (iii) to establish an appropriate
compliance program and support for the operation of the OMS and reporting mechanism. 1919
The bulk of the costs resulting from Regulation SBSR derive from the infrastructure-related
costs of complying with reporting obligations, which include establishing and maintaining the
systems necessary to capture, store, and report transaction information; the establishment and
maintenance of appropriate policies and procedures; and employing and training the necessary
compliance personnel. 1920 The Commission preliminarily estimated and continues to believe that
the marginal burden of reporting additional transactions once a respondent’s reporting
infrastructure and compliance systems are in place would be de minimis when compared to the
costs of putting those systems in place. This is because the only additional costs of reporting an
individual transaction would be entering the required data elements into the firm’s OMS, which

could subsequently deliver the required transaction information to a registered SDR. In many
cases, particularly with standardized instruments and instruments traded electronically,
transaction information could be generated and maintained in electronic form, which could then
be provided to a registered SDR through wholly automated processes.
Re-proposed Rule 901(a) is designed to reduce the number of instances where a
counterparty that is not a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant
would bear the responsibility to report a security-based swap transaction under Regulation
SBSR. In other words, re-proposed Rule 901(a) is designed to assign the reporting duty to the
larger counterparties that have greater resources and operational capability to carry out the
reporting function. Consequently, re-proposed Rule 901(a) could result in each reporting
counterparty being required to report, on average, more security-based swap transactions than
envisioned under the original proposal, although smaller unregistered counterparties that
previously would have been required to report a small number of security-based swap
transactions under the original proposal would, under re-proposed Rule 901(a), be less likely to
have to incur reporting duties under Regulation SBSR, and thus less likely to have to incur the
initial infrastructure-related costs of reporting. 1921 The counterparties that would continue to
have the reporting duty under re-proposed Rule 901(a)—primarily security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants—would have the reporting duty for nearly all
security-based swap transactions. Security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants, whether or not they are U.S. persons, typically have greater resources and
operational capability than non-registered U.S. counterparties and are likely to already have the
reporting infrastructure, policies and procedures, and staff that could be adapted to carry out the
reporting obligations under Regulation SBSR. The Commission preliminarily agrees with
certain commenters 1922 that basing the reporting duty primarily on status as a security-based
swap dealer or major security-based swap participant rather than on whether or not the entity is a
U.S. person would, in the aggregate, reduce costs to the security-based swap market, as
discussed in more detail below.
In addition, in re-proposing Rule 901(a), the Commission is proposing to revise the term
“reporting party” to “reporting side.” Under the re-proposal, a reporting side could consist of
multiple entities: the direct counterparty to the transaction and any guarantor of the direct
counterparty. Although this has the potential to increase the number of counterparties that could
incur a duty to report—by placing such duty on both the direct counterparty and any indirect
counterparty—the Commission preliminarily believes that this would not be the result. The
1921

The Commission notes, however, that non-reporting sides would be required to provide certain
information about a reportable transaction on a non-real-time basis. See Rule 906(a), as
originally proposed (requiring reporting, if applicable, of participant ID, broker ID, desk ID, and
trader ID). See also Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75221 (discussing rationale
for proposed Rule 906(a)).

1922

See, e.g., DTCC I at 8; ICI Letter at 5; Multiple Firms Letter at 31. See also Vanguard Letter at
6; Multiple Firms Letter at 28 (stating that requiring U.S. end users to report security-based swaps
entered into with non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers would be unduly burdensome for
end users and could negatively impact the competitiveness of affected U.S. markets).

569

Commission preliminarily believes instead that, in practice, large groups that engage in securitybased swaps transactions would likely centralize the reporting function for all entities within the
group into a single operational unit. Thus, even if two counterparties on the reporting side each
incurred the legal duty under re-proposed Rule 901(a) to report a security-based swap
transaction, only one entity (either one of the counterparties itself or one of its affiliates) would
in fact carry out the reporting function.
Although the Commission preliminarily estimated that there would be 1,000 reporting
entities, 1923 the Commission is now revising that estimate to 300. 1924 In the original proposal, the
Commission preliminarily estimated that the initial, aggregate annualized costs associated with
proposed Rule 901 would be $511,013 per reporting party, and that the ongoing aggregate
annualized costs associated with proposed Rule 901 would be $316,116 per reporting party. 1925
The Commission continues to preliminarily believe that these per-respondent costs are
appropriate. Given the same per-respondent costs—but adjusting for the decreased estimate of
the number of respondents—the Commission now preliminarily believes that the total one-time
costs of re-proposed Rule 901 would be $153,303,900, 1926 and the annual ongoing costs would
be $94,834,800. 1927 The Commission seeks comment on and data to quantify these estimated
costs.
It is possible that certain smaller market participants that are currently active in the
security-based swap market could reduce their trading activity or exit the market completely, if
they believed the compliance costs of re-proposed Regulation SBSR to be too high. This could
result in adverse impacts on competition if there were fewer participants competing in the
market. However, the Commission preliminarily believes that this outcome would be unlikely,
given that the re-proposal is designed to further limit the instances where non-registered U.S.
persons would be required to incur the infrastructure-related costs of reporting. The Commission
preliminarily believes instead that, by focusing the reporting duty more on the status and away
from whether or not entities are U.S. persons, re-proposed Rule 901(a) would lower the incentive
of non-registered U.S. persons to reduce their participation in the market out of fear of incurring
the infrastructure-related costs of complying with Regulation SBSR.
Furthermore, although the Commission is now proposing to extend the reach of the
security-based swap reporting requirements, as described in re-proposed Rule 908(a), to all
transactions guaranteed by a U.S. person, the Commission preliminarily believes that this would
not result in a significant increase in the number of entities that incur reporting duties. The
Commission preliminarily believes that organizations that operate through foreign subsidiaries
that are guaranteed by a U.S. parent are likely to be large financial institutions that already were

included in the Commission’s estimate of reporting parties in the Regulation SBSR Proposing
Release. Furthermore, these organizations are the most likely to have robust risk management
systems that extend across business units and across geographic boundaries, and likely already
have a presence in the United States and currently are engaging in transactions that they are
reporting (on a voluntary basis) to the DTCC-TIW. Thus, such entities were included in the
Commission’s initial estimate of reporting parties in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release.
Re-proposing Rule 908(a) to require non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants to report all of their transactions to a registered SDR would
likely not impose any additional infrastructure-related costs beyond those that were already
assessed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release. However, this aspect of the re-proposal
could impose small additional costs on a per-reporting entity basis in the form of having to report
additional transactions using that existing infrastructure.
The Commission notes that there may be a small number of entities that are in the
business, or contemplate entering the business, of guaranteeing security-based swaps. Such
entities may not have been included in the Commission’s original analysis of potential reporting
parties, because as indirect counterparties they may not have appeared in the TIW’s records as
counterparties. Under re-proposed Rule 908, any U.S. person that guarantees a security-based
swap could incur the duty to report under re-proposed Regulation SBSR. However, based on
consultation with market participants, the Commission preliminarily believes that the net effect
on the number of reporting sides would be de minimis and would not impact the Commission’s
revised estimate of 300 reporting counterparties, discussed above. To the extent that there could
be entities that act only as an indirect counterparty to security-based swap transactions and would
not otherwise have been required to report their security-based swap transactions, the
Commission preliminarily believes that our estimate takes these entities into account.
In addition, the Commission preliminarily believes that there may be a slight increase in
costs for those reporting counterparties that continue to incur the reporting duty, as each such
reporting counterparty would be required to report, on average, a larger percentage of the total
number of reportable events than under the initial proposal. Under re-proposed Rule 901(a),
smaller unregistered counterparties that previously would have been required to report a small
number of security-based swap transactions under the original proposal would, under the reproposal, be less likely to incur the reporting duty under re-proposed Rule 901(a). Under reproposed Rules 901(a) and 908(a)(1)(iii), non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and major
security-based swap participants, rather than unregistered U.S. persons, would have the reporting
duty for most of these transactions. Nonetheless, under the re-proposal, the per-transaction
reporting cost should not change from what was originally proposed. Moreover, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the additional cost for non-U.S. person security-based
swap dealers and major security-based swap participants absorbing the costs of reporting these
additional transactions should be de minimis, since these larger market participants have likely
already taken significant steps to establish and maintain the systems, processes and procedures,
and staff resources to report security-based swap transactions to existing data repositories.
In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission preliminarily estimated that
1,000 reporting parties would be required to report approximately 15.5 million security-based
swap transactions at a total cost, exclusive of the infrastructure-related costs, of approximately
571

$5,400,000. 1928 The Commission preliminarily believes that nothing in the re-proposal would
affect the initial estimate of the cost of an individual reportable event. However, the
Commission now is revising our assumptions about the number of reportable events covered by
re-proposed Regulation SBSR. Since issuing the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the
Commission has obtained additional and more granular data regarding participation in the
security-based swap market from DTCC-TIW. These historical data suggest that the
Commission overestimated the number of security-based swap transactions that would be subject
to regulatory reporting in the future. As a result, the Commission now estimates that 300
reporting counterparties would be required to report approximately 5 million security-based
swap transactions per year. 1929
As discussed in the PRA section above, the Commission now preliminarily estimates that
each reporting side would incur, on average, a burden of 83.3 hours per year—not including any
infrastructure-related costs—to report individual security-based swap transactions to a registered
SDR. 1930 In the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission estimated that each
reporting party would spend $5,400 to report specific security-based swap transactions to a
registered SDR as required by proposed Rule 901. 1931 Given the Commission’s revised estimate
of the number of reportable events per year, the Commission also now preliminarily estimates
that each reporting side would, on average, incur costs of $5,630 to report specific security-based
swap transactions and life cycle events to a registered SDR. 1932
The Commission further notes two factors that could serve to limit the per-transaction
costs across all affected entities. First, to the extent that security-based swap instruments become
1928

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75265.

1929

Data provided by the DTCC-TIW indicate that there were approximately 4,000,000 transactions
in single-name CDS in 2012. The Commission believes that the single-name CDS data are
sufficiently representative of the security-based swap market. See Section XV.B.2 and note 1301
and accompanying text, supra. The Commission believes that single-name CDS transactions
account for 82% of the security-based swap market. As a result, the Commission preliminarily
estimates that there were 4.88 million (i.e., 4,000,000/0.82) security-based swap transactions in
2012, and is basing its estimate of the future number of transactions on recent historical activity.

1930

The Commission estimates: (5 million * 0.005) / (300 reporting sides) = 83.3 burden hours per
reporting counterparty, or 25,000 total burden hours for all reporting counterparties.

1931

See Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, 75 FR at 75265. In arriving at this figure, the
Commission preliminarily estimated that 1,000 reporting parties would be responsible for
reporting 15,458,824 security-based swap transactions at a total cost of approximately
$5,400,000. The Commission is not revising its initial estimate of the average cost of reporting
an individual security-based swap transactions. However, the Commission now estimates that
approximately 300 reporting sides will have the duty to report approximately 5 million securitybased swap transactions per year.

1932

The Commission estimates: ((Compliance Clerk (41.7 hours) at $59 per hour) + (Sr. Computer
Operator (41.7 hours) at $76 per hour)) * 300 reporting sides = $1,688,850 for all reporting sides,
or $5,630 per reporting side. See also note 1270, supra.

572

more standardized and trade more frequently on electronic platforms (rather than manually), the
act of reporting transactions to a registered SDR should become less costly. Together, these
trends are likely to reduce the number of transactions that would necessitate the manual capture
of bespoke data elements, which is likely to take more time and be more expensive than
electronic capture. Second, the larger entities that would incur additional reporting duties under
re-proposed Rules 901(a) and 908(a)(1)(iii)—i.e., non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers
and major security-based swap participants—can benefit from certain economies of scale in
carrying out reporting duties might elude smaller, unregistered counterparties. The Commission
preliminarily believes that, all other things being equal, a larger reporting counterparty is likely
to handle a greater number of reportable events, including those requiring manual data capture,
than a smaller counterparty and thus would develop greater expertise and greater speed in
reporting transactions. Moreover, a larger reporting counterparty is likely to have greater
incentive and ability to develop systems that support the reporting function, and the fixed cost of
this infrastructure can be spread across the larger number of transactions handled by the larger
counterparty. The extent of these effects, however, is difficult to quantify. The Commission
seeks comments on the extent of these effects and their impact on average per-transaction
reporting costs.
The Commission preliminarily believes that re-proposed Rule 901(a) would not increase
the previously estimated costs for registered SDRs. The Commission preliminarily believes,
rather, that the estimated costs for registered SDRs might be less than the original estimate, for
two reasons. First, given that the Commission now estimates that there would be fewer entities
incurring the duty to report (300 rather than the original estimate of 1,000), there would be fewer
entities that would have to establish linkages to a registered SDR and thus fewer relationships for
a registered SDR to manage. Second, given the Commission’s reduced estimates of the number
of reportable events, the Commission preliminarily believes that registered SDRs could face
slightly lower costs because they would have fewer transactions to process than originally
estimated. The extent of these effects, however, is difficult to quantify. The Commission seeks
comments on the extent of these effects and their impact on average per-transaction costs.
Finally, the Commission has no reason to believe and sees no reason to expect that re-proposed
Rules 901(a) and 908(a)(1)(iii) would result in the registration of additional SDRs. Thus, given
any fixed costs than any entity registering as a registered SDR might incur under re-proposed
Regulation SBSR, the Commission is not increasing our cost estimates to account for a larger
number of entities anticipated to incur those per-entity costs.
Furthermore, the Commission preliminarily believes that extending the scope of
transactions that would be subject to public dissemination, as reflected in re-proposed Rules
908(a)(2) and 902(a), would not significantly increase or decrease the previously estimated costs
for registered SDRs identified in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release. The Commission
preliminarily believes that these revisions would not result in the registration of additional SDRs
or require them to bear the costs of connecting to additional reporting sides. Even if there would
be a slight increase in the percentage of security-based swap transactions subject to public
dissemination as a result of the applicability of the re-proposed Regulation SBSR to a larger
universe of transactions involving non-U.S. entities and/or U.S. indirect counterparties, given the
573

Commission’s reduced estimates of the overall number of reportable events, 1933 the Commission
now estimates that registered SDRs would be required to publicly disseminate fewer transactions
than estimated in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release. The Commission further notes that
our original estimate of the costs of public dissemination was not calculated on a per-transaction
basis, but represented instead the one-time aggregate estimated costs associated with
development and implementation of the necessary infrastructure, as well as the aggregate annual
estimated costs for supporting and upgrading that infrastructure as necessary. 1934
The Commission continues to believe that the preliminary estimates contained in the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release are valid, and that implementing and complying with the
real-time public dissemination requirement of Rule 902 would add 20% to the start-up and
ongoing operational expenses that would otherwise be required of a registered SDR. 1935 In
particular, the Commission continues to estimate that the initial one-time aggregate costs for
development and implementation of the systems needed to disseminate the required transaction
information would be $40,004,000, which corresponds to $4,000,400 per registered SDR.
Further, the Commission continues to estimate that aggregate annual costs for systems and
connectivity upgrades associated with real-time public dissemination would be $24,002,400,
which corresponds to $2,400,240 per registered SDR. Thus the initial aggregate costs associated
with proposed Rule 902 are estimated to be $64,006,400, which corresponds to $6,400,640 per
registered SDR.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on the costs and benefits of re-proposed Rules 901,
902, and 908(a) discussed above, as well as any costs and benefits not already described that
could result. The Commission also requests data to quantify any potential costs or benefits. In
addition, the Commission requests comment on the following:
•

How can the Commission more accurately assess the costs and benefits of reproposed Rule 901?

•

How many entities would be affected by re-proposed Rule 901? How many
transactions would be subject to re-proposed Rule 901?

•

Are there additional costs involved in complying with re-proposed Rule 901 that have
not been identified? What are the types and amounts of those costs?

•

Do the reporting requirements in re-proposed Rule 901(a), by potentially placing the
duty to report upon a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap

(b) Proposed Modification of the Definition of “U.S. Person”

Regulation SBSR, as originally proposed, would have defined a “U.S. person” as “a
natural person that is a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident or a legal person that is organized under the
corporate laws of any part of the United States or has its principal place of business in the United
States.” In this re-proposal, the Commission is proposing a new definition of “U.S. person” that
is consistent with usage in our other Title VII proposals. 1936 The Commission preliminarily
believes that these Title VII rules would benefit from having the same terms throughout and
could, therefore, reduce assessment costs for market participants that might be subject to the
proposed rules. Furthermore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the revised definition
of “U.S. person” is intended to clarify application of Regulation SBSR and would not
significantly change the number of entities that would be subject to Regulation SBSR. The
Commission preliminarily believes that the revised definition of “U.S. person” would not entail
any material costs to market participants, nor would it intrinsically impose any obligation or duty
on market participants. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the new definition
would not increase the aggregate compliance costs of re-proposed Regulation SBSR.
1936

Specifically, the re-proposed definition provides that the term “U.S. person” would have the same
meaning as set forth in proposed Rule 3a71-3(a)(7) under the Exchange Act.

575

Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on the costs and benefits of the re-proposed
definition of “U.S. person” as used in re-proposed Regulation SBSR, and data to support those
comments. In particular, the Commission requests comment on the following:
•

Would the re-proposed definition of “U.S. person” as used in Regulation SBSR result
in any costs or benefits not discussed here? Please distinguish any costs and benefits
stemming from the re-proposed definition itself, rather than any costs or benefits
attributable to other provisions of Regulation SBSR in which the term appears, such
as re-proposed Rules 901, 902, and 908(a).
(c) Revisions to Proposed Rule 908(b)
i.

Initial Proposal

Rule 908(b), as initially proposed, attempted to clarify when reporting duties would be
imposed on counterparties of security-based swaps that are not U.S. persons when some
connections to the United States might be present. Proposed Rule 908(b) provided that no duties
would be imposed on a counterparty unless one of the following conditions were true:
•

the counterparty is a U.S. person;

•

the security-based swap is executed in the United States or through any means of
interstate commerce; or

•

the security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States.
ii.

Re-proposal

As described above, the Commission now believes, in light of other revisions being made
to Regulation SBSR, that certain conforming revisions to Rule 908(b) are appropriate.
Specifically, Rule 908(b) is being re-proposed to account for the possibility that a non-U.S.
person security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant could incur a duty to
report. In addition, the “interstate commerce clause” is being replaced with the new concept of a
“transaction conducted within the United States.”
a. Programmatic Benefits
The Commission now preliminarily believes that there are benefits to requiring all
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap participants, whether or not they are
U.S. persons, to report their security-based swap transactions pursuant to re-proposed Regulation
SBSR. Having access to security-based swaps of all such entities through data reported to a
registered SDR would give the Commission greater ability to supervise such entities and assess
the overall security-based swap market. Furthermore, requiring all such entities to report
security-based swap information would help provide the Commission and other regulators with
576

detailed, up-to-date information both about positions of particular entities and financial groups,
as well as positions held by multiple market participants in particular instruments.
b. Programmatic Costs
The Commission preliminarily believes that the revisions to Rule 908(b) would not result
in any significant increase in the overall cost of compliance for affected entities. The
Commission preliminarily believes, rather, that many unregistered U.S. persons that participate
in the security-based swap market would face lower costs, as they could be more likely to avoid
entirely having to incur the infrastructure-related costs of reporting security-based swap
transactions. Furthermore, to the extent that non-U.S. person security-based swap dealers and
major security-based swap participants would be required to report security-based swap
transactions, such entities were already included in the estimate of 1,000 reporting parties used in
the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release and are also included in the new estimate of 300
reporting sides becoming subject to re-proposed Regulation SBSR. Although the number of
security-based swap transactions that these reporting sides would be required to report would
increase, the Commission preliminarily does not believe that they would be required to expand
their systems capabilities to account for the additional transaction volume.
Request for Comment
The Commission requests comment on the costs and benefits of re-proposed Rule 908(b)
and data to assess any potential costs or benefits. In addition, the Commission requests comment
on the following:
•

Would re-proposed Rule 908(b) result in any benefits or costs that the Commission
has not considered?

•

Are there methods to minimize the costs associated with re-proposed Rule 908(b)?

•

Would re-proposed Rule 908(b) create any additional costs not discussed here? If so,
please identify and quantify these costs.
(d) Other Technical Revisions in Re-proposed Regulation SBSR

In addition to the revisions described above, the Commission is re-proposing certain
technical or conforming changes to other rules contained in Regulation SBSR. Specifically,
certain changes are required to re-proposed Rules 901(c) and 901(d), which address the data
elements to be reported to a registered SDR, to reflect the re-proposal’s approach that certain
security-based swaps may be subject to regulatory reporting but not public dissemination. The
introductory language to Rule 901(c) is being re-proposed as follows: “For any security-based
swap that must be publicly disseminated pursuant to §§ 242.902 and 242.908 and for which it is
the reporting side, the reporting side shall report the following information in real time. If a
security-based swap is required by §§ 242.901 and 242.908 to be reported but not publicly
disseminated, the reporting side shall report the following information no later than the time that
the reporting side is required to comply with paragraph (d) of this section:” Re-proposed Rule
901(c) would be retitled “Primary trade information”—since not all information reported
577

pursuant to Rule 901(c) would be required to be provided in real time—and re-proposed Rule
901(d) would be retitled “Secondary trade information.” The Commission also is re-proposing
Rule 901(c)(10) as follows: “If both sides of the security-based swap include a security-based
swap dealer, an indication to that effect.” The re-proposed rule clarifies that a security-based
swap dealer might be a direct or indirect counterparty to a security-based swap. Rule
901(d)(1)(ii) is also being re-proposed to require reporting of the broker ID, desk ID, and trader
ID, as applicable, only of the direct counterparty on the reporting side. Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) is
being re-proposed to require reporting of a description of the terms and contingencies of the
payment streams only of each direct counterparty to the other. The word “direct” is necessary to
avoid extending Rule 901(d)(1)(iii) to indirect counterparty relationships, where payments might
not (except in unusual circumstances) flow to or from an indirect counterparty.
Additional technical or conforming revisions include changes to Rule 901(e), which sets
forth provisions for reporting life cycle events of a security-based swap. The Commission is reproposing Rule 901(e) to provide that the duty to report would switch to the other side only if the
new side did not include a U.S. person (as in the originally proposed rule) or a security-based
swap dealer or major security-based swap participant (references to which are being added to
Rule 901(e)). Re-proposed Rule 908 contemplates situations where a security-based swap would
be required to be reported to a registered SDR but not publicly disseminated. Therefore, the
Commission is re-proposing Rule 902(a) to provide that a registered SDR would have no
obligation to publicly disseminate a transaction report for any such security-based swap.
Re-proposed Rules 903, 905, 906, 907, 910, and 911 are each conformed to incorporate
the use of the term “side,” while re-proposed Rules 904, 905, 906, and 907 each replace “§§
242.900 through 242.911” with “§§ 242.900-911.”
Rule 905(b)(2) is being re-proposed to clarify that, if a registered SDR receives corrected
information relating to a previously submitted transaction report, it would be required to publicly
disseminate a corrected transaction report only if the initial security-based swap was subject to
public dissemination.
As originally proposed, Rule 907(a)(6) would require a registered SDR to establish and
maintain written policies and procedures “[f]or periodically obtaining from each participant
information that identifies the participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any other participant(s) which
the counterparty is affiliated, using ultimate parent IDs and participant IDs.” The Commission
now is re-proposing Rule 907(a)(6) with the word “participant” in place of the word
“counterparty.”
Rule 910(b)(4), as originally proposed, would provide that, in Phase 4 of the Regulation
SBSR compliance schedule, “[a]ll security-based swaps reported to the registered security-based
swap data repository shall be subject to real-time public dissemination as specified in §
242.902.” As noted above, certain security-based swaps would be subject to regulatory reporting
but not public dissemination. Therefore, the Commission is re-proposing Rule 910(b)(4) to
provide that, “All security-based swaps received by the registered security-based swap data
repository shall be handled consistent with §§ 242.902, 242.905, and 242.908.”
578

Because the changes discussed above are technical in nature, the Commission
preliminarily believes that they would not have any significant impact, negative or positive, on
re-proposed Regulation SBSR. Nonetheless, the Commission preliminarily believes that, to the
extent these changes clarify the application of certain aspects of Regulation SBSR, they could
enhance consistency, reduce potential uncertainties related to the interpretation and application
of Regulation SBSR, and thus reduce assessment costs. The Commission solicits comment on
that preliminary view.
(e) Aggregate Total Quantifiable Costs
Based on the foregoing, the Commission preliminarily estimates that re-proposed
Regulation SBSR would impose an estimated total first-year cost of approximately $511,243 1937
per reporting counterparty for a total first-year cost of $153,372,900. 1938 The Commission
preliminarily estimates that re-proposed Regulation SBSR would impose ongoing annualized
aggregate costs of approximately $316,346 1939 per reporting side, for a total aggregate
annualized cost of $94,903,800. 1940
As noted above, the Commission preliminarily believes that re-proposed Regulation
SBSR would not significantly change the costs of registered SDRs, as estimated in the
Regulation SBSR Proposing Release. The Commission preliminarily believes that the revisions
contained in re-proposed Rules 901, 902, and 908(a) would not result in the registration of
additional SDRs or require them to bear the costs of connecting to additional reporting sides. To
the extent that the re-proposal would assign reporting responsibilities to fewer respondents,
registered SDRs could face lower costs to support their connectivity.
In total, the Commission preliminarily estimates the total first-year cost of re-proposed
Regulation SBSR to be $681,307,400. 1941 The Commission preliminarily estimates the total
1937

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($511,013 (per entity total first-year
cost of Regulation SBSR) - ($5,400 (entity transaction reporting cost of Regulation SBSR) $5,630 (revised reporting side transaction reporting cost))) = $511, 243. See notes 1908, 1931,
and 1932 and accompanying text, supra.

1938

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($511,243 * 300 reporting sides) =
$153,372,900.

1939

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($316,116 (per entity annualized cost
of Regulation SBSR) - ($5,400 (entity transaction reporting cost of Regulation SBSR) - $5,630
(revised reporting side transaction reporting cost))) = $316,346. See notes 1909, 1931, and 1932
and accompanying text, supra.

1940

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($316,346 * 300 reporting sides) =
$94,903,800.

1941

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($1,038,947,500 (total first-year cost of
Regulation SBSR) - $511,013,000 (Regulation SBSR Rule 901 first-year costs on reporting
parties) + $153,372,900 (re-proposed Regulation SBSR Rule 901 first-year costs on reporting
sides)) = $681,372,900.

579

ongoing annual cost of re-proposed Regulation SBSR to be $481,935,340. 1942 The compliance
costs attributable to re-proposed Regulation SBSR could be significantly reduced to the extent
that foreign jurisdictions are deemed comparable in a substituted compliance order, which would
enable market participants to comply with the foreign jurisdiction’s rules relating to regulatory
reporting and public dissemination and thus would relieve them of their primary obligations—
and the associated costs—under Regulation SBSR.
I. Economic Analysis of Substituted Compliance
The Commission is proposing a policy and procedural framework that would allow for
the possibility of substituted compliance with respect to four categories of rules in recognition of
the potential, in a market as global as the security-based swap market, for security-based swap
market participants to be subject to conflicting or duplicative compliance obligations. These four
categories are: (i) requirements applicable to registered security-based swap dealers in Section
15F of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder; (ii) requirements relating to
regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps; (iii) requirements relating
to clearing for security-based swaps; and (iv) requirements relating to trade execution for
security-based swaps. 1943 Specifically, the Commission is proposing rules and interpretative
guidance in this release to provide that: (i) the Commission may, conditionally or
unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination with respect to a foreign
regulatory system that compliance with specific requirements under such foreign regulatory
system by a registered foreign security-based swap dealer (or class thereof) may satisfy the
corresponding requirements in Section 15F of the Exchange Act, 1944 and the rules and
regulations thereunder, that would otherwise apply to such foreign security-based swap dealer
(or class thereof); 1945 (ii) the Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make
a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public dissemination
of security-based swaps in a foreign jurisdiction if such foreign jurisdiction’s requirements for
the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps are comparable to
otherwise applicable requirements under Section 13A(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, 1946 Section
13(m)(1)(G) of the Exchange Act 1947 and Section 13(m)(1)(C) of the Exchange Act, 1948 and the

1942

The Commission derived its estimate from the following: ($703,147,540 (total ongoing
annualized cost of Regulation SBSR) - $316,116,000 (Regulation SBSR Rule 901 annual
ongoing costs on reporting sides) + $94,903,800 (re-proposed Regulation SBSR Rule 901 annual
ongoing costs on reporting sides)) = $481,935,340.

mandatory clearing requirement in Section 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act 1950 if the relevant
security-based swap transaction is submitted to a foreign clearing agency that is the subject of a
substituted compliance determination by Commission order; 1951 and (iv) the Commission may,
conditionally or unconditionally, by order, make a substituted compliance determination with
respect to a foreign jurisdiction to permit a person subject to the mandatory trade execution
requirement in Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act to execute such transaction, or have such
transaction executed on their behalf, on a security-based swap market (or class of markets) that is
neither registered under the Exchange Act nor exempt from registration under the Exchange Act
if the Commission determines that such security-based swap market (or class of markets) is
subject to comparable, comprehensive supervision and regulation by a foreign financial
regulatory authority or authorities in such foreign jurisdiction. 1952
1. Programmatic Benefits and Costs
The Commission recognizes that the programmatic costs and benefits of substituted
compliance may vary depending on the specific nature of a particular substituted compliance
determination. If the Commission imposes conditions on a substituted compliance
determination, such conditions may have effects on the programmatic costs and benefits. The
proposed rules and interpretive guidance regarding substituted compliance described above
provide that the Commission would only make a determination that substituted compliance is
permitted if the foreign regulatory system in a particular area, taking into consideration any
relevant principles, regulations, or rules in other areas of the foreign regulatory system to the
extent they are relevant to the analysis, achieves the regulatory outcomes that are comparable to
the regulatory outcomes of the relevant provisions of the Exchange Act.
The Commission preliminarily believes that substituted compliance would not
substantially change the programmatic benefits intended by the requirements in Section 15F of
the Exchange Act, the programmatic benefits intended by the regulatory reporting and public
dissemination requirements in Section 13(m)(1)(G), Section 13(m)(1)(C), and Section 13A(a)(1)
of the Exchange Act, the programmatic benefits intended by the mandatory clearing requirement
in Sections 3C(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, or the programmatic benefits intended by the
mandatory trade execution requirement set forth in Section 3C(h) of the Exchange Act. To the
extent that substituted compliance eliminates duplicative compliance costs, registered foreign
security-based swap dealers or market participants entering into security-based swap transactions
that are eligible for substituted compliance may incur lower programmatic costs associated with
implementation or compliance with the specified Title VII requirements than they would
otherwise incur without the option of substituted compliance available, either because such

1951

See Section XI.E, supra.

1952

See proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(1) under the Exchange Act, as discussed in Section XI.F, supra.

581

registered foreign security-based swap dealers may have implemented or begun to implement the
foreign regulatory requirements that are determined comparable by the Commission, or because
parties to a security-based swap transaction eligible for substituted compliance determination do
not need to duplicate compliance with two sets of comparable requirements.
In the case of a substituted compliance determination made with Commission-imposed
conditions in order to achieve comparable programmatic benefits intended by the applicable Title
VII requirements, we cannot preclude the possibility that substituted compliance may increase
programmatic costs because market participants would be required to incur costs to satisfy those
conditions. On the other hand, substituted compliance also may enable certain foreign market
participants subject to comparable foreign regulation to enter or stay in the U.S. security-based
swap market. These are participants that would, due to conflicting local laws, otherwise not be
able to participate under Title VII regulation in the absence of substituted compliance. In such
cases, substituted compliance may either increase the number of market participants in the U.S.
security-based swap market or prevent certain existing market participants from exiting the
market, thereby contributing to the programmatic benefits and costs that flow from Title VII
requirements.
The decision to request substituted compliance is purely voluntary. Market participants
would choose to make a request for a substituted compliance determination only if, in their own
assessment, compliance with applicable requirements under a foreign regulatory system were
less costly than compliance with both the foreign regulatory regime and the relevant Title VII
requirement. Even after a substituted compliance determination is made, market participants
would only choose substituted compliance if the private benefits they expect to receive from
participating in U.S. markets exceeds the private costs they expect to bear, including any
conditions the Commission may attach to the substituted compliance determination. Therefore,
the proposed rules regarding substituted compliance are based on the consideration that the net
programmatic benefits associated with specific Title VII requirements could be increased by the
Commission making the substituted compliance option available. Where substituted compliance
increases the number of market participants in the U.S. security-based swap market or prevents
existing participants from leaving the U.S. security-based swap market, there may be
contributions to both programmatic benefits and costs associated with the applicable Title VII
requirements.
2. Alternatives
The Commission could have proposed that substituted compliance determinations with
respect to regulatory reporting, public dissemination and mandatory trade execution apply to all
cross-border transactions involving at least one foreign counterparty or foreign branch of a U.S.
bank. However, we propose in Rule 908(c)(2), the interpretive guidance regarding substituted
compliance with the mandatory clearing requirement, and Rule 3Ch-2(b)(1) that substituted
compliance would not be available to a security-based swap transaction that involves persons
within the United States in executing, soliciting or negotiating the terms of such transaction on
both sides of a transaction, even though at least one counterparty to the transaction is a non-U.S.

582

person or foreign branch. 1953 In other words, if both counterparties to a security-based swap
transaction conduct such transaction within the United States, it is a transaction in the United
States. One of the primary objectives of making substituted compliance available to cross-border
security-based swap transactions is to accommodate the global nature of the security-based swap
market and cross-border security-based swap activity. In circumstances where both parties to a
security-based swap are transacting in the United States, either from a U.S. office or U.S. branch,
or using an affiliate or agent, to conduct the security-based swap, we do not believe that
substituted compliance would be necessary or appropriate. Both parties (or their respective
agents) to the transaction are conducting a transaction in the United States and should be able to
satisfy the applicable Title VII requirements by reporting the transaction to a registered SDR or
executing the transaction on a registered exchange of SB SEF in the United States without the
need to rely on substituted compliance. In addition, because both parties (or their respective
agents) are conducting a transaction in the United States, there is a strong public interest to
subject such transaction to the Title VII mandatory execution, regulatory reporting, and public
dissemination requirements. Therefore, the Commission does not believe that it would be
appropriate to provide substitute compliance with respect to a transaction where both parties (or
their agents) conduct the transaction within the United States.
3. Assessment Costs
The assessment costs associated with the proposed rules regarding substituted compliance
would, in part, flow from the assessment of whether a registered security-based swap dealer is a
foreign security-based swap dealer and whether a transaction counterparty is a non-U.S. person
or a foreign branch and whether a transaction involves a person within the United States in
soliciting, negotiating, or execution. The status of a foreign security-based swap dealer would be
determined by analyzing the U.S. person definition, which may be done by an in-house counsel
reviewing readily ascertainable information, such as the foreign security-based swap dealer’s
certificate of incorporation or formation or other internal documents evidencing residence, place
of incorporation, or principal business location. The Commission preliminarily believes that the
cost involved in making such assessment should not exceed one hour of in-house counsel’s time
or $379. 1954
The assessment costs associated with proposed Rule 908(c), proposed interpretive
guidance with respect to substituted compliance with the mandatory clearing requirement, and
proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c)(2)(ii) would involve costs of determining a transaction counterparty’s
U.S. person status, as well as determining whether counterparty conducts the security-based
1953

See proposed Rule 908(c)(2) under the Exchange Act, interpretive guidance regarding substituted
compliance with the mandatory clearing requirement, and proposed Rule 3Ch-2(b)(1) under the
Exchange Act, as discussed in Section XI.D – XI.F, supra.

Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry
2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to
account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff estimates that the
average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379.

583

swap in the United States or involves any persons in the United States to solicit, negotiate or
execute a security-based swap transaction.
The Commission preliminarily believes that market participants would likely incur costs
arising from the need to identify and maintain records concerning the U.S.-person status of their
counterparties and the location of their transactions. We anticipate that potential applicants for
substituted compliance are likely to request representations from their transaction counterparties
to determine the counterparties’ U.S.-person status and whether the transaction was conducted
within the United States. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the assessment
costs associated with determining the status of counterparties and the location of transactions
should be primarily one-time costs of establishing a practice or compliance procedure of
requesting and collecting representations from trading counterparties and maintaining the
representations collected as part of the recordkeeping procedures and limited ongoing costs
associated with requesting and collecting representations. Consistent with the analysis of the
assessment costs associated with the de minimis exception relating to the security-based swap
dealer definition that involves determining the status of counterparties and the location of
transactions, 1955 the Commission preliminarily believes that such one-time costs would be
approximately $15,160. 1956 The Commission preliminarily believes that requesting and
collecting representations would be part of the standardized transaction process reflected in the
policies and procedures regarding security-based swap sales and trading practices and should not
result in separate assessment costs. 1957 To the extent that market participants have incurred costs
relating to similar or same assessments with respect to the counterparty status and location of the
transactions for other Title VII requirements, their assessment costs with respect to substituted
compliance may be less.
In addition, a registered security-based swap dealer or a security-based swap transaction
eligible for a substituted compliance determination would incur costs in submitting a request to
the Commission for a substituted compliance determination. The Commission preliminarily
estimates the costs of submitting such request pursuant to proposed Rule 3a71-5(c), proposed
Rule 908(c), proposed interpretive guidance with respect to substituted compliance with the
1955

See Section XV.D.2(a), supra.

1956

This estimate is based on estimated 40 hours of in-house legal or compliance staff’s time to
establish a procedure of requesting and collecting representations from trading counterparties,
taking into account that such representation may be built into form of standardized trading
documentation. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff
estimates that the average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379.

1957

There will be ongoing costs associated with processing representations received from
counterparties, including additional due diligence and verification to the extent that a
counterparty’s representation is contrary to or inconsistent with the knowledge of the collecting
party. The Commission believes that these would be compliance costs encompassed within the
programmatic costs associated with substituted compliance.

584

mandatory clearing requirement, or proposed Rule 3Ch-2(c)(2)(ii) would be approximately
$110,320. 1958 Once such request is made, however, other market participants that seek to
request a substituted compliance determination with respect to the same area of a foreign
regulatory system relevant to the requirements in Section 15F or regulatory reporting and public
dissemination, the same foreign clearing agency, or the same foreign regulatory regime that a
foreign exchange or SB SEF is subject to, would be able to rely on the Commission’s substituted
compliance determination. Accordingly, the assessment costs would only need to be incurred
once with respect to the same area of a foreign regulatory system or the same foreign clearing
agency.
Request for Comment
The Commission seeks comment on the costs and benefits associated with substituted
compliance in all aspects. Responses that are supported by data and analysis provide great
assistance to the Commission in considering the benefits and costs of the substituted compliance
policy framework. In addition, the Commission seeks comment on the following specific
questions:
•

1958

Would substituted compliance reduce costs associated with the applicable Title VII
requirements? Would the analysis of the benefits and costs of substituted compliance

This estimate is based on information indicating that the average costs associated with preparing
and submitting an application to the Commission for a Commission order for exemptive relief

240.0-12. The Commission recognizes that a substituted compliance determination request made
pursuant to proposed Rule 3a71-5(c), proposed Rule 908(c), proposed interpretive guidance with
respect to substituted compliance with the mandatory clearing requirement, and proposed Rule
3Ch-2(c)(2)(ii) would be made under proposed Rule 0-13 under the Exchange Act, which
establishes procedures similar to those used by the Commission in considering exemptive order
applications under Section 36 of the Exchange Act. The staff estimates that costs associated with
a request pursuant to these proposed rules would be approximately $110,320. The Commission
estimates that preparation of the request would require approximately 80 hours of in-house
counsel time and 200 hours of outside counsel time. Such estimate takes into account the time
required to prepare supporting documents necessary for the Commission to make a substituted
compliance determination, including, without limitation, information regarding applicable
requirements established by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities, as well as the
methods used by the foreign financial regulatory authority or authorities to monitor compliance
with these rules. Based upon data from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2012 (modified by the SEC staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and
multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead), the staff
estimates that the average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379. The Commission
estimates the costs for outside legal services to be $400 per hour. Accordingly, the Commission
estimates the cost to be $110,320 ($30,320 (based on 80 hours of in-house counsel time * $379) +
$80,000 (based on 200 hours of outside counsel time * $400)) to submit a request for a
substituted compliance determination.

differ between the case of regulatory duplication or overlap and the case of regulatory
conflict?
•

Does a substituted compliance determination based on comparability achieve the
same benefits intended by Title VII? Could there be significant economic
consequences if the Commission permitted substituted compliance in cases in which
the foreign requirements are not identical, but, as contemplated, only comparable to
the applicable Title VII requirements? What would those effects be? In cases where
substituted compliance were granted but where requirements were comparable and
not identical, are there certain differences, or types of differences, in regulation that
would have more significant economic effects than others? Are there particular areas
of Title VII regulation in which the effects of differences between comparable and
identical standards would be more pronounced than in others?

•

Could there be significant economic consequences, including effects on competition,
if a substituted compliance determination is made conditionally? What would those
effects be?

•

Could market participants be prompted to restructure in anticipation of substituted
compliance determinations? What effects on market structure and competition might
result? Are there other potential spillovers from strategic restructuring related to
substituted compliance determinations?

•

Do commenters agree with the preliminary estimates of the assessment costs and the
costs to request a substituted compliance determination discussed above? Are there
any other assessment costs not considered here? Specifically, the Commission
requests comment on (i) the assessment costs of determining whether a market
participant or a transaction is eligible for substituted compliance, and (ii) the costs of
preparing and submitting a request for a substituted compliance determination.

J. General Request for Comments
In responding to the specific requests above for comment on the economic effects of our
proposed rules, interested persons are encouraged to provide supporting data and analysis and,
when appropriate, identify alternative models for assessing the costs and benefits of our proposed
rules, as well as their expected effect on efficiency, competition and capital formation.
Responses that are supported by data and analysis provide great assistance to the Commission in
considering the economic effects of proposed new requirements, including the associated
benefits and costs.
In addition to the specific requests for comment set forth above, the Commission also
seeks comment on the expected economic effects of the interplay between our rules and those
[adopted/proposed] by the CFTC. In particular, to the extent that the Commission’s proposed
rules and interpretations take a different approach from the CFTC’s approach to the application
of Title VII requirements in the cross-border context, what would be the economic impact,
including the costs and benefits, of these differences on market participants and the U.S.
586

security-based swap market as a whole? What effect would such differences have on efficiency,
competition and capital formation in the U.S. security-based swap market? Commenters should
provide analysis and empirical data to support their views on the costs, benefits and other
economic effects associated with the differences between the Commission’s proposed approach
and the CFTC’s approach.
The Commission also seeks comment on the relevant economic considerations for the
Commission if we modify our proposed approach to conform to the CFTC’s [proposed/final]
guidance. Similarly, what would the economic considerations be for the Commission to adopt
any cross-border interpretations proposed by the CFTC, but not proposed by the Commission?

587

XVI. Consideration of Impact on the Economy
For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996
(“SBREFA”) 1959 the Commission must advise the OMB whether the proposed regulation
constitutes a “major” rule. Under SBREFA, a rule is considered “major” where, if adopted, it
results or is likely to result in: (1) an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more
(either in the form of an increase or a decrease); (2) a major increase in costs or prices for
consumers or individual industries; or (3) significant adverse effect on competition, investment
or innovation. If a rule is “major,” its effectiveness will generally be delayed for 60 days
pending Congressional review.
The Commission requests comment on the potential impact of these proposed rules on
the economy on an annual basis, on the costs or prices for consumers or individual industries,
and on competition, investment, or innovation. Commenters are requested to provide empirical
data and other factual support for their view to the extent possible.

XVII. Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification
The Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 1960 requires Federal agencies, in promulgating
rules, to consider the impact of those rules on small entities. Section 603(a) of the
Administrative Procedure Act, 1961 as amended by the RFA, generally requires the Commission to
undertake a regulatory flexibility analysis of all proposed rules, or proposed rule amendments, to
determine the impact of such rulemaking on “small entities.” 1962 Section 605(b) of the RFA 1963
provides that this requirement shall not apply to any proposed rule or proposed rule amendment
which, if adopted, would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of
small entities.
For purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, a small entity
includes: (1) when used with reference to an “issuer” or a “person,” other than an investment
company, an “issuer” or “person” that, on the last day of its most recent fiscal year, had total
assets of $5 million or less; 1964 or (2) a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus
subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its
audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d) under the Exchange
Act, 1965 or, if not required to file such statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth
plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or
in the time that it has been in business, if shorter); and is not affiliated with any person (other
than a natural person) that is not a small business or small organization. 1966 Under the standards
adopted by the Small Business Administration, small entities in the finance and insurance
industry include the following: (i) for entities engaged in credit intermediation and related
activities, entities with $175 million or less in assets; 1967 (ii) for entities engaged in nondepository credit intermediation and certain other activities, entities with $7 million or less in
annual receipts; 1968 (iii) for entities engaged in financial investments and related activities,

1961

5 U.S.C. 603(a).

1962

Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits agencies
to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for the term “small
entity” for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with the RFA. Those
definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule 0-10 under the Exchange
Act, 17 CFR § 240.0-10. See Exchange Act Release No. 18451 (Jan, 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215 (Feb,
4, 1982) (File No. AS-305).

589

entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts; 1969 (iv) for insurance carriers and entities
engaged in related activities, entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts; 1970 and (v) for
funds, trusts, and other financial vehicles, entities with $7 million or less in annual receipts. 1971
Based on feedback from industry participants and our own information about the
security-based swap markets, the Commission preliminarily believes that non-U.S. entities that
would be required to register and be regulated as security-based swap dealers and major securitybased swap participants exceed the thresholds defining “small entities” set out above. Thus, the
Commission preliminarily believes it is unlikely that the proposed rules regarding registration of
security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap market participants would have a
significant economic impact any small entity.
In addition, based on the Commission’s own information about the cross-border securitybased swap market, the Commission believes that only persons or entities with assets
significantly in excess of $5 million participate in the security-based swap market, and such
persons or entities would thus not qualify as “small entities.” Therefore, the Commission
preliminarily believes that the application of the mandatory clearing requirement to cross-border
security-based swap transactions is unlikely to impact any small entities. Moreover, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the entities likely to register as a security-based swap
clearing agency located outside the United States are not likely to qualify as a “small entity” as
defined above. Thus, the Commission preliminarily believes it is unlikely that the proposed rules
regarding registration of security-based swap clearing agencies located outside the United States
would have a significant economic impact any small entity.
In addition, as discussed in the Regulation SBSR Proposing Release, the Commission
believes that the number of security based swap transactions involving a “small entity” is de
minimis. Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that the application of the mandatory
trade reporting requirement to cross-border security-based swap transactions is unlikely to
impact any small entities. Moreover, the Commission preliminarily believes that the entities
likely to register as a SDR located outside the United States are not likely to qualify as a “small
entity” as defined above. Thus, the Commission preliminarily believes it is unlikely that the
proposed rules regarding registration of SDRs located outside the United States would have a
significant economic impact any small entity.
In addition, based on the Commission’s own information about the cross-border securitybased swap market, the Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed application of the
mandatory trade execution requirement to cross-border security-based swap transactions is not
likely to impact any small entities. Moreover, as discussed in the SB SEF Proposing Release,
based on our understanding of the market and conversations with industry sources, the
Commission preliminarily believes that approximately 20 SB SEFs could be subject to the
1969

See id. at Subsector 523.

1970

See id. at Subsector 524.

1971

See id. at Subsector 525.

590

requirements of proposed Regulation SB SEF. Based on the Commission’s existing information
about the security-based swap market and the entities likely to register as SB SEFs, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the entities likely to register as SB SEFs would not be
considered small entities. The Commission preliminarily believes that most, if not all, of the SB
SEFs would be large business entities or subsidiaries of large business entities, and that all SB
SEFs would have assets in excess of $5 million and annual receipts in excess of $7,000,000.
Therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that none of the potential SB SEFs would be
considered small entities.
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission certifies that the proposed rules would not
have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities for purposes of the
RFA. The Commission encourages written comments regarding this certification. In particular,
the Commission encourages written comments regarding the Commission’s preliminary belief
that the proposed application of the mandatory clearing requirement and the mandatory trade
reporting requirement to cross-border security-based swap transactions is unlikely to impact any
small entities. The Commission requests that commenters describe the nature of any impact on
small entities and provide empirical data to illustrate the extent of the impact.

Add § 240.0-13 to read as follows:

§ 240.0-13—Commission procedures for filing applications to request a substituted
compliance order under the Exchange Act.
(a) The application shall be in writing in the form of a letter, must include any supporting
documents necessary to make the application complete, and otherwise must comply with §
592

240.0-3. All applications must be submitted to the Office of the Secretary of the Commission.
Requestors may seek confidential treatment of their applications to the extent provided under §
200.81 of this chapter. If an application is incomplete, the Commission, through the Division of
Trading and Markets, may request that the application be withdrawn unless the applicant can
justify, based on all the facts and circumstances, why supporting materials have not been
submitted and undertakes to submit the omitted materials promptly.
(b) An applicant may submit a request electronically. The electronic mailbox to use for
these applications is described on the Commission's website at www.sec.gov in the "Exchange
Act Substituted Compliance Applications" section. In the event electronic mailboxes are revised
in the future, applicants can find the appropriate mailbox by accessing the “Electronic Mailboxes
at the Commission” section.
(c) All filings and submissions filed pursuant to this rule must be in the English
language. If a filing or submission filed pursuant to this rule requires the inclusion of a
document that is in a foreign language, a party must submit instead a fair and accurate English
translation of the entire foreign language document. A party may submit a copy of the
unabridged foreign language document when including an English translation of a foreign
language document in a filing or submission filed pursuant to this rule. A party must provide a
copy of any foreign language document upon the request of Commission staff.
(d) An applicant also may submit a request in paper format. Five copies of every paper
application and every amendment to such an application must be submitted to the Office of the
Secretary at 100 F Street, NE, Washington, DC 20549-1090. Applications must be on white
paper no larger than 8½ by 11 inches in size. The left margin of applications must be at least 1½
inches wide, and if the application is bound, it must be bound on the left side. All typewritten or
printed material must be set forth in black ink so as to permit photocopying.
(e) Every application (electronic or paper) must contain the name, address, telephone
number, and email address of each applicant and the name, address, telephone number, and email
address of a person to whom any questions regarding the application should be directed. The
Commission will not consider hypothetical or anonymous requests for a substituted compliance
order. Each applicant shall provide the Commission with any supporting documentation it
believes necessary for the Commission to make such determination, including information
regarding applicable requirements established by the foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities, as well as the methods used by the foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities to monitor compliance with such rules. Applicants should also cite to and discuss
applicable precedent.
(f) Amendments to the application should be prepared and submitted as set forth in these
procedures and should be marked to show what changes have been made.
(g) After the filing is complete, the Division of Trading and Markets will review the
application. Once all questions and issues have been answered to the satisfaction of the Division
of Trading and Markets, the staff will make an appropriate recommendation to the Commission.
After consideration of the recommendation by the Commission, the Commission's Office of the
Secretary will issue an appropriate response and will notify the applicant.
593

(h) The Commission, in its sole discretion, may choose to publish in the Federal Register
a notice that the application has been submitted. The notice would provide that any person may,
within the period specified therein, submit to the Commission any information that relates to the
Commission action requested in the application. The notice also would indicate the earliest date
on which the Commission would take final action on the application, but in no event would such
action be taken earlier than 25 days following publication of the notice in the Federal Register.
(i) The Commission may, in its sole discretion, schedule a hearing on the matter
addressed by the application.

information required under this section in a format required by the registered security-based
swap data repository, and in accordance with any applicable policies and procedures of the
registered security-based swap data repository.
(i) Reporting of pre-enactment and transitional security-based swaps. With respect to any
pre-enactment security-based swap or transitional security-based swap, the reporting side shall
report all of the information required by paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section, to the extent such
information is available.
§ 242.902 Public dissemination of transaction reports.
(a) General. Unless a security-based swap is a block trade or a cross-border securitybased swap that is required to be reported but not publicly disseminated, a registered securitybased swap data repository shall publicly disseminate a transaction report of the security-based
swap immediately upon receipt of information about the security-based swap, or upon reopening following a period when the registered security-based swap data repository was closed.
The transaction report shall consist of all the information reported pursuant to § 242.901, plus
any indicator or indicators contemplated by the registered security-based swap data repository’s
policies and procedures that are required by § 242.907.
(b) Dissemination of block trades. A registered security-based swap data repository shall
publicly disseminate a transaction report of a security-based swap that constitutes a block trade
immediately upon receipt of information about the block trade from the reporting side. The
transaction report shall consist of all the information reported by the reporting side pursuant to
§ 242.901(c), except for the notional size, plus the transaction ID and an indicator that the report
represents a block trade. The registered security-based swap data repository shall publicly
disseminate a complete transaction report for such block trade (including the transaction ID and
the full notional size) as follows:
(1) If the security-based swap was executed on or after 05:00 UTC and before 23:00 UTC
of the same day, the transaction report (including the transaction ID and the full notional size)
shall be disseminated at 07:00 UTC of the following day.
(2) If the security-based swap was executed on or after 23:00 UTC and up to 05:00 UTC
of the following day, the transaction report (including the transaction ID and the full notional
size) shall be disseminated at 13:00 UTC of that following day.
(3) Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a registered security-based swap data repository is
in normal closing hours or special closing hours at a time when it would be required to
disseminate information about a block trade pursuant to this section, the registered securitybased swap data repository shall instead disseminate information about the block trade
immediately upon re-opening.
613

(c) Non-disseminated information. A registered security-based swap data repository shall
not disseminate:
(1) The identity of either counterparty to a security-based swap;
(2) With respect to a security-based swap that is not cleared at a registered clearing
agency and that is reported to the registered security-based swap data repository, any information
disclosing the business transactions and market positions of any person; or
(3) Any information regarding a security-based swap reported pursuant to § 242.901(i).
(d) Temporary restriction on other market data sources. No person other than a registered
security-based swap data repository shall make available to one or more persons (other than a
counterparty) transaction information relating to a security-based swap before the earlier of 15
minutes after the time of execution of the security-based swap; or the time that a registered
security-based swap data repository publicly disseminates a report of that security-based swap.
§ 242.903 Coded information.
The reporting side may provide information to a registered security-based swap data
repository pursuant to § 242.901 and a registered security-based swap data repository may
publicly disseminate information pursuant to § 242.902 using codes in place of certain data
elements, provided that the information necessary to interpret such codes is widely available on a
non-fee basis.
§ 242.904 Operating hours of security-based swap data repositories.
A registered security-based swap data repository shall have systems in place to
continuously receive and disseminate information regarding security-based swaps pursuant to §§
242.900 through 242.911, subject to the following exceptions:
(a) A registered security-based swap data repository may establish normal closing hours
during periods when, in its estimation, the U.S. market and major foreign markets are inactive.
A registered security-based swap data repository shall provide reasonable advance notice to
participants and to the public of its normal closing hours.
(b) A registered security-based swap data repository may declare, on an ad hoc basis,
special closing hours to perform system maintenance that cannot wait until normal closing hours.
A registered security-based swap data repository shall, to the extent reasonably possible under
the circumstances, avoid scheduling special closing hours during periods when, in its estimation,
the U.S. market and major foreign markets are most active; and provide reasonable advance
notice of its special closing hours to participants and to the public.
(c) During normal closing hours, and to the extent reasonably practicable during special
closing hours, a registered security-based swap data repository shall have the capability to
receive and hold in queue information regarding security-based swaps that has been reported
pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.911.
614

(d) When a registered security-based swap data repository re-opens following normal
closing hours or special closing hours, it shall disseminate transaction reports of security-based
swaps held in queue, in accordance with the requirements of § 242.902.
(e) If a registered security-based swap data repository could not receive and hold in queue
transaction information that was required to be reported pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.911,
it must immediately upon re-opening send a message to all participants that it has resumed
normal operations. Thereafter, any participant that had an obligation to report information to the
registered security-based swap data repository pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.911, but
could not do so because of the registered security-based swap data repository’s inability to
receive and hold in queue data, must immediately report the information to the registered
security-based swap data repository.
§ 242.905 Correction of errors in security-based swap information.
(a) Duty of counterparties to correct. Any counterparty to a security-based swap that
discovers an error in information previously reported pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.911
shall correct such error in accordance with the following procedures:
(1) If a side that was not the reporting side for a security-based swap transaction
discovers an error in the information reported with respect to such security-based swap, the
counterparty shall promptly notify the reporting side of the error; and
(2) If the reporting side for a security-based swap transaction discovers an error in the
information reported with respect to a security-based swap, or receives notification from its
counterparty of an error, the reporting side shall promptly submit to the entity to which the
security-based swap was originally reported an amended report pertaining to the original
transaction report. If the reporting side reported the initial transaction to a registered securitybased swap data repository, the reporting side shall submit an amended report to the registered
security-based swap data repository in a manner consistent with the policies and procedures
contemplated by § 242.907(a)(3).
(b) Duty of security-based swap data repository to correct. A registered security-based
swap data repository shall:
(1) Upon discovery of the error or receipt of a notice of the error from the reporting side,
verify the accuracy of the terms of the security-based swap and, following such verification,
promptly correct the erroneous information regarding such security-based swap contained in its
system; and
(2) If such erroneous information relates to a security-based swap that the registered
security-based swap data repository previously disseminated and falls into any of the categories
of information enumerated in § 242.901(c), publicly disseminate a corrected transaction report of
the security-based swap promptly following verification of the trade by the counterparties to the
security-based swap, with an indication that the report relates to a previously disseminated
transaction.
§ 242.906 Other duties of participants and guarantors.
615

(a) Reporting by non-reporting-side. A registered security-based swap data repository
shall identify any security-based swap reported to it for which the registered security-based swap
data repository does not have the participant ID and (if applicable) the broker ID, desk ID, and
trader ID of each direct counterparty. Once a day, the registered security-based swap data
repository shall send a report to each participant identifying, for each security-based swap to
which that participant is a counterparty, the security-based swap(s) for which the registered
security-based swap data repository lacks participant ID and (if applicable) broker ID, desk ID,
and trader ID. A participant that receives such a report shall provide the missing information to
the registered security-based swap data repository within 24 hours.
(b) Duty to provide ultimate parent and affiliate information. Each participant of a
registered security-based swap data repository shall provide to the registered security-based swap
data repository information sufficient to identify its ultimate parent(s) and any affiliate(s) of the
participant that also are participants of the registered security-based swap data repository, using
ultimate parent IDs and participant IDs. A participant shall promptly notify the registered
security-based swap data repository of any changes to that information.
(c) Policies and procedures of security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants. Each participant that is a security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap
participant shall establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and procedures that are
reasonably designed to ensure that it complies with any obligations to report information to a
registered security-based swap data repository in a manner consistent with §§ 242.900 through
242.911 and the registered security-based swap data repository’s applicable policies and
procedures. Each such participant shall review and update its policies and procedures at least
annually.
§ 242.907 Policies and procedures of registered security-based swap data repositories.
(a) General policies and procedures. With respect to the receipt, reporting, and
dissemination of data pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.911, a registered security-based swap
data repository shall establish and maintain written policies and procedures:
(1) That enumerate the specific data elements of a security-based swap or a life cycle
event that the reporting side must report, which shall include, at a minimum, the data elements
specified in §§ 242.901(c) and (d);
(2) That specify one or more acceptable data formats (each of which must be an opensource structured data format that is widely used by participants), connectivity requirements, and
other protocols for submitting information;
(3) For specifying how reporting sides are to report corrections to previously submitted
information, making corrections to information in its records that is subsequently discovered to
be erroneous, and applying an appropriate indicator to any transaction report required to be
disseminated by § 242.905(b)(2) that the report relates to a previously disseminated transaction;
(4) Describing how reporting sides shall report and, consistent with the enhancement of
price discovery, how the registered security-based swap data repository shall publicly
616

disseminate, reports of, and adjustments due to, life cycle events; security-based swap
transactions that do not involve an opportunity to negotiate any material terms, other than the
counterparty; and any other security-based swap transactions that, in the estimation of the
registered security-based swap data repository, do not accurately reflect the market;
(5) For assigning:
(i) A transaction ID to each security-based swap that is reported to it; and
(ii) UICs established by or on behalf of an internationally recognized standards-setting
body that imposes fees and usage restrictions that are fair and reasonable and not unreasonably
discriminatory (or, if no standards-setting body meets these criteria or a standards-setting body
meets these criteria but has not assigned a UIC to a particular person, unit of a person, or
product, using its own methodology); and
(6) For periodically obtaining from each participant information that identifies the
participant’s ultimate parent(s) and any participant(s) with which the participant is affiliated,
using ultimate parent IDs and participant IDs.
(b) Policies and procedures regarding block trades. (1) A registered security-based swap
data repository shall establish and maintain written policies and procedures for calculating and
publicizing block trade thresholds for all security-based swap instruments reported to the
registered security-based swap data repository, in accordance with the criteria and formula for
determining block size as specified by the Commission.
(2) Exceptions. Notwithstanding the above, a registered security-based swap data
repository shall not designate as a block trade any security-based swap:
(i) That is an equity total return swap or is otherwise designed to offer risks and returns
proportional to a position in the equity security or securities on which the security-based swap is
based; or
(ii) Contemplated by Section 13(m)(1)(C)(iv) of the Exchange Act ((15 U.S.C. §
78m(m)(1)(C)(iv)).
(c) Public availability of policies and procedures. A registered security-based swap data
repository shall make the policies and procedures required by §§ 242.900 through 242.911
publicly available on its website.
(d) Updating of policies and procedures. A registered security-based swap data
repository shall review, and update as necessary, the policies and procedures required by §§
242.900 through 242.911 at least annually. Such policies and procedures shall indicate the date
on which they were last reviewed.
(e) A registered security-based swap data repository shall have the capacity to provide to
the Commission, upon request, information or reports related to the timeliness, accuracy, and
completeness of data reported to it pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.911 and the registered
security-based swap data repository’s policies and procedures thereunder.
617

§ 242.908 Cross-border matters.
(a) Application of Regulation SBSR to cross-border transactions.
(1) Regulatory reporting. A reporting side shall report a security-based swap if:
(i) The security-based swap is a transaction conducted within the United States;
(ii) There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on either side of the
transaction;
(iii) There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a security-based swap dealer or major
security-based swap participant on either side of the transaction; or
(iv) The security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States.
if:

(2) Public dissemination. A security-based swap shall be subject to public dissemination

(ii) There is a direct or indirect counterparty that is a U.S. person on each side of the
transaction;
(iii) At least one direct counterparty is a U.S. person (except in the case of a transaction
conducted through a foreign branch);
(iv) One side includes a U.S. person and the other side includes a non-U.S. person that is
a security-based swap dealer; or
(v) The security-based swap is cleared through a clearing agency having its principal
place of business in the United States.
(b) Limitation on counterparty duties. Notwithstanding any other provision of §§
242.900 through 242.911, a counterparty to a security-based swap shall not incur any obligation
under §§ 242.900 through 242.911 unless it is:
(1) A U.S. person;
(2) A security-based swap dealer or major security-based swap participant; or
(3) A counterparty to a transaction conducted within the United States.
(c) Substituted compliance.
(1) General. Compliance with the regulatory reporting and public dissemination
requirements in sections 13(m) and 13A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78m(m) and 78m-1), and the rules
and regulations thereunder, may be satisfied by compliance with the rules of a foreign
jurisdiction that is the subject of a Commission order described in paragraph (c)(2) of this
618

section, provided that with respect to at least one of the direct counterparties to the securitybased swap:
(i) Such counterparty is either a non-U.S. person or a foreign branch; and
(ii) The security-based swap transaction is not solicited, negotiated, or executed by a
person within the United States on behalf of such counterparty.
(2) Procedure. (i) The Commission may, conditionally or unconditionally, by order,
make a substituted compliance determination regarding regulatory reporting and public
dissemination of security-based swaps with respect to a foreign jurisdiction if that jurisdiction’s
requirements for the regulatory reporting and public dissemination of security-based swaps are
comparable to otherwise applicable requirements.
(ii) Any person that executes security-based swaps that would, in the absence of a
substituted compliance order, be required to be reported pursuant to §§ 242.900 through 242.911
may file an application, pursuant to the procedures set forth in § 240.0-13 of this chapter,
requesting that the Commission make a substituted compliance determination regarding
regulatory reporting and public dissemination with respect to a foreign jurisdiction the rules of
which also would require reporting and public dissemination of those security-based swaps.
Such application shall include the reasons therefor and such other information as the
Commission may request.
(iii) In making such a substituted compliance determination, the Commission shall take
into account such factors as the Commission determines are appropriate, such as the scope and
objectives of the relevant foreign regulatory requirements, as well as the effectiveness of the
supervisory compliance program administered, and the enforcement authority exercised, by the
foreign financial regulatory authority to support oversight of its regulatory reporting and public
dissemination system for security-based swaps. The Commission shall not make such a
substituted compliance determination unless it finds that:
(A) The data elements that are required to be reported pursuant to the rules of the foreign
jurisdiction are comparable to those required to be reported pursuant to § 242.901;
(B) The rules of the foreign jurisdiction require the security-based swap to be reported
and publicly disseminated in a manner and a timeframe comparable to those required by §§
242.900 through 242.911;
(C) The Commission has direct electronic access to the security-based swap data held by
a trade repository or foreign regulatory authority to which security-based swaps are reported
pursuant to the rules of that foreign jurisdiction; and
(D) Any trade repository or foreign regulatory authority in the foreign jurisdiction that
receives and maintains required transaction reports of security-based swaps pursuant to the laws
of that foreign jurisdiction is subject to requirements regarding data collection and maintenance;
systems capacity, resiliency, and security; and recordkeeping that are comparable to the
requirements imposed on security-based swap data repositories by §§ 240.13n-5 through
240.13n-7 of this chapter.
619

(iv) Before issuing a substituted compliance order pursuant to this section, the
Commission shall have entered into a supervisory and enforcement memorandum of
understanding or other arrangement with the relevant foreign financial regulatory authority or
authorities under such foreign financial regulatory system addressing oversight and supervision
of the applicable security-based swap market under the substitute compliance determination.
(v) The Commission may, on its own initiative, modify or withdraw such order at any
time, after appropriate notice and opportunity for comment.
§ 242.909 Registration of security-based swap data repository as a securities information
processor.
A registered security-based swap data repository shall also register with the Commission

623

Appendix A: Application of Subtitle B of Title VII in the Cross-Border Context
The following tables summarize the Commission’s proposed approach to applying
requirements in Subtitle B of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act in the cross-border context. 1972
Specifically, as explained more fully in the main body of the release, the tables show how the
entity-level requirements in Title VII apply to various dealing entities (identified in row 1 of
each of the tables). 1973 The tables also show how various transaction-level requirements in Title
VII apply to transactions between such dealing entities and various transaction counterparties
(identified in row 8 of each of the tables), depending on the location of the dealer or the dealer’s
agent (identified in row 7). For the sake of completeness, these tables may include transaction
scenarios that are unlikely to occur in practice.
Guide to Reading the Title VII Tables
The following provides a guide to reading the tables below.
•

“Yes”—Indicates that the Commission is proposing to apply a particular transactionlevel requirement in Title VII to a security-based swap transaction between the
dealing entity identified in row 1 and the transaction counterparty identified in row 8,
or that the Commission is proposing to apply a particular entity-level requirement in
Title VII to the dealing entity identified in row 1, and that substituted compliance
would not be permitted.

•

“No”—Indicates that the Commission is not proposing to apply the particular Title
VII requirement.

•

“N/A”—Indicates that the Title VII requirement is not applicable because it applies
only to registered security-based swap dealers.

•

“Substituted Compliance” (or “Sub Comp”)—Indicates that the Commission is
proposing to apply the Title VII requirement, but that we also are proposing to
establish a policy and procedural framework under which we would consider
permitting compliance with comparable regulatory requirements in a foreign
jurisdiction to substitute for compliance with requirements of the Exchange Act, and
the rules and regulations thereunder, relating to security-based swaps.

•

“Location of Dealer/Agent”—Refers to the location of the dealing entity booking the
transaction or its agent.

1972

The tables in this appendix are only a summary of the rules and interpretations proposed in this
release and are provided for ease of reference. They do not supersede, and should be read in
conjunction with, the proposed rules and interpretations discussed in the release. All defined
terms used in the tables have the same meaning as set forth in the release, unless otherwise
indicated.

1973

Tables III and V also apply to non-U.S. dealers and other non-U.S. market participants.

624

o Table I describes the application of Title VII to registered U.S. security-based
swap dealers and is divided between security-based swap transactions that are
conducted:


Other than through a U.S. bank’s foreign branch (columns 2 through
6); or



Through a U.S. bank’s foreign branch (columns 7 through 11). 1974

o Tables II – V are divided between transactions in which the dealing entity or
its agent is:

•



“Within the U.S.”—Indicates that a person within the United States
acting on behalf of such non-U.S. dealer has solicited, negotiated,
executed, or booked the transaction within the United States; or



“Outside the U.S.”—Indicates that such non-U.S. dealer has solicited,
negotiated, executed, and booked the transaction, without involving
any person within the United States acting on its behalf. 1975

“Transaction counterparty”—Refers to the counterparty with which the dealing entity
(identified in row 1) enters into a transaction and whose counterparty credit risk the
dealing entity ultimately bears. Therefore, the transaction counterparty is the booking
location or booking entity of the trading counterparty with which the dealing entity
transacts. A transaction counterparty may use personnel or an agent in a different
location than the booking location or booking entity to negotiate the transaction with
the dealing entity. The five transaction counterparties identified in the tables are as
follows:
o “U.S. Person (other than Foreign Branch)”—Indicates the transaction
counterparty of the dealing entity (identified in row 1) is a U.S. person (other
than a foreign branch of a U.S. bank);
o “Non-U.S. Person Within the U.S.”—Indicates the transaction counterparty of
the dealing entity (identified in row 1) is a non-U.S. person and the securitybased swap transaction is conducted (i.e., solicited, negotiated, executed, or
booked) by or on behalf of the non-U.S. person transaction counterparty

1974

The transactions identified in columns 7 and 8 of Table I are transactions in which a foreign
branch of a U.S. bank is the counterparty to the transaction, but such transactions would not fall
within the definition of “transaction conducted through a foreign branch” in proposed Rule 3a713(a)(4) under the Exchange Act.

1975

A transaction in which the non-U.S. dealing entity and its agent are outside the United States may
still be a “transaction conducted within the United States,” as defined in proposed Rule 3a713(a)(5) under the Exchange Act. For example, the non-U.S. dealing entity may direct its
solicitation activity to a U.S. or non-U.S. person counterparty located within the United States.

625

within the United States. This includes a non-U.S. person counterparty that
uses its own personnel in its U.S. branch or office to conduct the transaction
or that uses a U.S. affiliate or third party acting as its agent to conduct the
transaction on its behalf; 1976
o “Foreign Branch of U.S. Bank”—Indicates the transaction counterparty of the
dealing entity (identified in row 1) is a foreign branch of a U.S. bank and the
security-based swap transaction is conducted (i.e., solicited, negotiated,
executed, and booked) by or on behalf of such foreign branch without
involving any person within the United States acting on behalf of the foreign
branch;
o “Non-U.S. Person w/ U.S. Guarantee Outside the U.S.”—Indicates the
transaction counterparty of the dealing entity (identified in row 1) is a nonU.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap is guaranteed
by a U.S. person (the “U.S. Guarantor”) such that its counterparty has direct
recourse to the U.S. Guarantor for performance of obligations owed by such
non-U.S. person (i.e., the guaranteed entity) under the security-based swap,
and the security-based swap transaction is conducted (i.e., solicited,
negotiated, executed, and booked) by or on behalf of such non-U.S. person
counterparty without involving any person within the United States acting on
behalf of such non-U.S. person; and
o “Non-U.S. Person w/o U.S. Guarantee Outside the U.S.”—Indicates the
transaction counterparty of the dealing entity (identified in row 1) is a nonU.S. person whose performance under the security-based swap is not
guaranteed by a U.S. person, and the security-based swap transaction is
conducted (i.e., solicited, negotiated, executed, and booked), by or on behalf
of such non-U.S. person counterparty, without involving any person within
the United States acting on behalf of such non-U.S. person. 1977

1976

If the non-U.S. person transaction counterparty is a registered security-based swap dealer, see
Table II or IV for application of other transaction-level requirements. If the non-U.S. person
transaction counterparty is an unregistered dealer or market participant that receives a U.S.
guarantee, see Table II or III for application of other transaction-level requirements.

1977

If the non-U.S. person counterparty is a registered security-based swap dealer, see Table IV for
application of other transaction-level requirements.

Appendix B: Registration of Security-Based Swap Dealers
This table shows the Commission’s proposed approach to applying the de minimis
threshold in the security-based swap dealer definition in the cross-border context. 1978
Specifically, it indicates whether a potential security-based swap dealer listed along the top of
the table would be required to count a transaction conducted in a dealing capacity with the
various counterparties listed along the left hand column of the table toward its de minimis
threshold.

1978

This table in this appendix is only a summary of the rules and interpretations proposed in this
release and is provided for ease of reference. It does not supersede, and should be read in
conjunction with, the proposed rules and interpretations discussed in the release. All defined
terms used in this table have the same meaning as set forth in the release, unless otherwise
indicated.

Appendix D: List of Commenters
Market participants, foreign regulators, and other interested parties have submitted to the
Commission (and the CFTC) numerous written comment letters that address the application of
Title VII to cross-border activities. Because of the interdisciplinary nature of cross-border
issues, these comments were filed in connection with several rulemakings and following the joint
public roundtable regarding the application of Title VII to cross-border activities held by the
Commission and the CFTC on August 1, 2011. The Commission has provided the legend and
table below to facilitate the public’s ability to access and review these comment letters.
