ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17026
In the Matter of
EASYLINK INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CO., LTD. ORDER

On December 23, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, alleging that
Respondent has securities registered with the Commission and is delinquent in its periodic filings. On
January 19, 2016, I held a telephonic prehearing conference at which only the Division of Enforcement
appeared. On February 3, I found that service of the OIP on Respondent had not yet been established
and ordered the Division to provide an update on the status of service by February 24, 2016. Easylink
Info. Tech. Co., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3574, 2016 SEC LEXIS 385.
On February 19, the Division filed a declaration concerning service. The declaration notes that
Respondent is a British Virgin Islands corporation with a registered agent there, that the registered
agent received the OIP by Federal Express on February 15, 2016, and that an employee of the
registered agent confirmed by phone that it is still the registered agent of Respondent and had received
the OIP on February 15. The declaration further states that under Sections 101(1) and (2) of the BVI
Business Companies Act, 2004, and Section 31(1) of the BVI Business Companies (Amendment)
Regulations, 2015, service of a document may be effected on a British Virgin Islands company by
mailing the document to the company’s registered agent. Moreover, the declaration notes that the
British Virgin Islands is part of the United Kingdom, a signatory to the Hague Convention, of which
Article 10(a) provides that unless a country objects, parties may send judicial documents directly to
persons abroad through postal channels, and that the United Kingdom does not object to such service.
I find that service of the OIP on Respondent, in accordance with 17 C.F.R. § 201.141(a)(2)(iv),
occurred on February 15, 2016. See China Tech. Glob. Corp., Exchange Act Release No. 62305, 2010
SEC LEXIS 1960, at *1-3 (ALJ June 17, 2010); see also EOI Corp. v. Med. Mktg. Ltd., 172 F.R.D.
133, 142-43 (D.N.J. 1997). Respondent’s answer is due by February 29, 2016. See OIP at 2; 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.160(b), .220(b). If Respondent fails to timely file an answer or otherwise defend the
proceeding, I will deem it in default, determine the proceeding against it, and revoke the registration of
its securities. OIP at 2-3; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
