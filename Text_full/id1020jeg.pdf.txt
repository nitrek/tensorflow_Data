INITIAL DECISION

BRETT A. COOPER

APPEARANCES:

Stephen T. Kaiser and Timothy N. England for the Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission
Brett A. Cooper, pro se

BEFORE:

James E. Grimes, Administrative Law Judge
Summary

In this initial decision, I grant the Division of Enforcement’s motion for summary
disposition. Respondent Brett A. Cooper is barred from associating with a broker, dealer,
investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal adviser, transfer agent, or nationally
recognized statistical rating organization.
Procedural Background
The Commission initiated this proceeding in November 2015, when it issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) under Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. OIP
at 1; see 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b). This proceeding follows the injunctive action the Commission
brought in SEC v. Cooper, No. 13-cv-5781 (D.N.J. filed Sept. 27, 2013). The Division alleges
the following in the OIP. Cooper has never been registered with the Commission as a broker or
dealer and has never been associated with a registered broker or dealer. OIP at 1-2. The
Commission filed a complaint in district court alleging that from 2008 through 2011, Cooper
convinced investors to invest in “Prime Bank” or “High-Yield” investment contracts with the
promise of extraordinary returns. Id. at 2. The complaint alleged Cooper induced at least ten
investors1 to invest roughly $2.1 million. Id.

1

While the OIP states that the complaint in the underlying civil proceeding alleges “at
least 11 investors,” see OIP at 2, the complaint itself alleges Cooper defrauded “at least 10”
investors, Ex. 1 ¶ 17. The district court’s opinion found that Cooper defrauded “at least 10”

In November 2015, the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey
permanently enjoined Cooper from committing future violations of Section 17(a) of the
Securities Act of 1933, Sections 10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule
10b-5, and from “participating directly or indirectly in the issuance, offer, or sale of certain
securities.” OIP at 2. According to the OIP:
The district court found that Respondent Cooper acted with a high
degree of scienter and engaged in multiple, recurrent and egregious
violations of the securities laws. The court also found that Cooper
has never admitted his role in his fraudulent schemes nor taken
responsibility for his actions. The court also found that Cooper
committed a “Finder’s Fee” scheme after being sued for fraud,
after being named as a defendant in another prime bank case, and
after becoming aware of the Commission’s investigation which led
to the civil action in this matter.
Id.
I held a telephonic prehearing conference on December 15, 2015, which was attended by
counsel for the Division and Cooper, who was unrepresented. Brett A. Cooper, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3402, 2015 SEC LEXIS 5098, at *1 (ALJ Dec. 15, 2015). During the
conference, I instructed the Division to establish when Cooper was served with the OIP. Id. I
also set a schedule for filing motions for summary disposition. Id. at *1-2.
In early January 2016, the Division submitted a letter establishing that Cooper was not
served until December 26, 2015. See Brett A. Cooper, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3466,
2016 SEC LEXIS 22, at *1 (ALJ Jan. 5, 2016). As a result, I informed Cooper that his answer to
the OIP was due January 15, 2016. Id. I also modified the motions schedule. Id. at *1-2.
The Division timely filed its motion in January 2016. It asks that I issue an order barring
Cooper from “associating with any broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities
dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization.”
Mot. at 1. The Division’s motion is supported by nine exhibits, including: the Commission’s
injunctive complaint, Ex. 1; the district court’s opinion, Ex. 2; the district court’s final judgment,
Ex. 3; the Commission’s statement of undisputed material facts filed in district court in
conjunction with the Commission’s motion for summary judgment, Ex. 8; and the report of the
Commission’s expert, James E. Byrne, Ex. 9.
Cooper did not file an answer to the OIP or an opposition to the Division’s motion for
summary disposition. See Brett A. Cooper, Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3698, 2016 SEC
LEXIS 963, at *1 (ALJ Mar. 11, 2016). On March 11, 2016, I ordered him to show cause by

investors, see Ex. 2 at 29-30, while the statement of facts notes at least eleven investors gave
Cooper money to invest, Ex. 8 at 15.

March 21, 2016, why this proceeding should not be determined against him. Id. Cooper did not
respond to the order to show cause.
Summary Disposition Standard
An administrative law judge “may grant [a] motion for summary disposition if there is no
genuine issue with regard to any material fact and the party making the motion is entitled to a
summary disposition as a matter of law.” 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(b). Summary disposition is
generally appropriate in “follow-on” proceedings—administrative proceedings instituted
following a conviction or entry of an injunction—in circumstances where the only real issue
involves the determination of the appropriate sanction.2 Summary disposition is appropriate here
because the only issue is whether Cooper’s conduct warrants imposition of the bars the Division
seeks.
Findings of Fact
The findings and conclusions in this initial decision are based on the record and on facts
officially noticed under Rule of Practice 323, 17 C.F.R. § 201.323. Because Cooper did not file
an answer to the OIP or respond to the Division’s dispositive motion, he is in default.3 See 17
C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). As a result, I have accepted as true the factual allegations in
the OIP. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a). In making the findings below, I have applied
preponderance of the evidence as the standard of proof.4
Cooper’s case concerns “prime bank” fraud. Ex. 2 at 4. Generally, perpetrators of prime
bank schemes induce investment by promising incredible returns with little or no risk. See
Anthony Fields, CPA, Investment Advisers Act of 1940 Release No. 4028, 2015 WL 728005, at
*3 (Feb. 20, 2015); Ex. 9 at 11-13. Victims are often told that their investment will fund the
purchase of “instruments supposedly representing obligations of well-known international
banks—which the promoters call ‘prime banks’—at a steep discount.” Anthony Fields, CPA,
2015 WL 728005, at *2. The “association with reputable financial institutions” in combination
with “the use of complex-sounding jargon,” boosts the promoter’s credibility. Id. Prime bank

Cooper may move to set aside the default in this case. Rule 155(b) permits the
Commission, at any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and
on such conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a
default shall be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or
defend, and specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.

fraud promoters typically invoke a purported need for secrecy, which “mak[es] it impossible to
verify the claims with the banks themselves.” Id.; see Ex. 9 at 29-30.
From 2008 through 2011, Cooper was the sole managing member of Global Funding
Systems LLC, Dream Holdings, LLC, and PWD Philadelphia Unit, LLC. OIP at 1. PWD
Philadelphia Unit was the general partner of Peninsula Waterfront Development, L.P. Id.
Cooper was also the founder and sole principal of Fortitude Investing, LLC and the sole director
of REOP Group Inc. Id. These entities were fictional; they did not observe corporate formalities
and existed simply as devices to further Cooper’s fraudulent schemes. Ex. 2 at 27-28; Ex. 3 at
3-6. None of the entities has ever been registered with the Commission and Cooper has never
been registered as a broker or dealer nor associated with a registered broker or dealer. OIP at
1-2; Ex. 2 at 3, 29-30.
Acting through the above entities, Cooper induced investors to invest by promising
fantastical returns within a short period with little or no risk.5 Cooper told investors they were
investing in bank instruments “from major international banks,” and that the instruments would
be “monetized” or “traded” in secret transactions. Ex. 2 at 4-5; Ex. 8 at 17-18, 27-28, 39-40, 44.
In fact, the bank instruments did not exist and Cooper invested his victims’ money in nothing
more than his own lavish lifestyle. Ex. 2 at 7, 21-23, 28; see Ex. 8 at 18-19, 24, 30, 33, 38, 42,
46. During the relevant period, Cooper induced at least ten investors to invest over $2.1 million.
Ex. 2 at 29-30; Ex. 8 at 15. With one exception, all investors lost everything they invested. Ex.
2 at 17; see Ex. 8 at 33.
Cooper induced investment through a web of lies. He told investors that their money was
safe and would be returned if the deal he conceived fell through. Ex. 2 at 21; Ex. 8 at 27-28,
31-32, 44. But this was clearly untrue because the bank instruments did not exist and Cooper
planned to steal investors’ funds without actually investing anything. Ex. 2 at 21-22.
In addition, Cooper pretended to use an escrow agent in order to provide the appearance
of legitimacy. Ex. 2 at 21. But the escrow agent did not exist—Cooper posed as the agent,
created a fake website and personnel for the agent, and tricked investors into wiring their money
to accounts Cooper controlled. Id. at 21-24; Ex. 8 at 18, 22, 24, 28-29, 32, 40-42. When asked
by an investor about whether he had been involved with frauds in the past, Cooper lied and said
that he had not. Ex. 2 at 22; Ex. 8 at 45. When he needed to supply investors with account
statements, Cooper invented facts. Ex. 2 at 23-24; see Ex. 8 at 24-25. Finally, after being sued
for fraud, Cooper forged a letter showing that he was entitled to a $50,000 finder’s fee for
services he did not actually render. Ex. 2 at 25-26, 31; Ex. 8 at 48-50.
In September 2013, the Commission filed an injunctive complaint against Cooper and
five of his fictitious alter-ego entities. Ex. 1. In November 2015, the United States District
Court for the District of New Jersey granted summary judgment against Cooper and permanently

investment within thirty days), 35-36 ($900,000 return on $150,000 investment), 44-45 (1000%

enjoined him from committing future violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Sections
10(b) and 15(a) of the Exchange Act, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5, and from “participating
directly or indirectly in the issuance, offer, or sale of any securities.” Ex. 2 at 1-2; Ex. 3 at 1-5.
The district court found Cooper and his alter-ego entities jointly and severally liable for
disgorgement of $2,146,160 plus $301,479 in prejudgment interest. Ex. 3 at 5. The court also
ordered Cooper to pay a civil penalty of $2,447,639. Id. at 7.
Conclusions of Law
Section 15(b)(6) of the Exchange Act gives the Commission authority to impose a
collateral bar against Cooper if, among other things, (1) he was associated with or seeking to
become associated with a broker or dealer at the time of the misconduct at issue; (2) he was
enjoined from engaging in or continuing conduct in connection with the purchase or sale of any
security; and (3) imposing a bar is in the public interest. 15 U.S.C. § 78o(b)(4)(C), (6)(A)(iii).
The first two factors are met in this case. First, a broker is a “person engaged in the
business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of others.” 15 U.S.C.
§ 78c(a)(4)(A). Cooper acted as a broker during his misconduct, because, “[f]or nearly four
years, [he] effected transactions in securities, or induced the purchase or sale of securities.” Ex.
2 at 29. While it is true that Cooper never registered with the Commission, the definition of the
term “broker” is not limited to those who register with the Commission.6 Cooper, therefore, was
associated with a broker—himself—at the time of his misconduct.7
Second, the district court enjoined Cooper from committing future violations of the
antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws, and from “participating directly or indirectly
in the issuance, offer, or sale of any securities.” Ex. 3 at 4. This meets the requirement of
Section 15(b)(4)(C)—being enjoined from engaging in or continuing conduct in connection with
the purchase or sale of any security—and thus Section 15(b)(6)(A)(iii)—being “enjoined from
any action, conduct or practice specified in” paragraph (4)(C).
To determine whether the public interest supports imposition of a collateral bar, I must
consider the public interest factors described in Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir.
1979), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). See Toby G. Scammell, Advisers Act Release
No. 3961, 2014 WL 5493265, at *5 (Oct. 29, 2014). The public interest factors include:
the egregiousness of the respondent’s actions, the isolated or
recurrent nature of the infraction, the degree of scienter involved,
the sincerity of the respondent’s assurances against future

violations, the respondent’s recognition of the wrongful nature of
his conduct, and the likelihood that the respondent’s occupation
will present opportunities for future violations.
David R. Wulf, Exchange Act Release No. 77411, 2016 WL 1085661, at *4 (Mar. 21, 2016).
Other relevant factors include the degree of harm resulting from the violation8 and the deterrent
effect of administrative sanctions.9 The public interest “inquiry . . . is . . . flexible . . . and no one
factor is dispositive.” Conrad P. Seghers, Advisers Act Release No. 2656, 2007 WL 2790633, at
*4 (Sept. 26, 2007), pet. denied, 548 F.3d 129 (D.C. Cir. 2008).
Before imposing a collateral bar, an administrative law judge must determine, based on
the evidence presented, “whether such a remedy is necessary or appropriate to protect investors
and markets.” Ross Mandell, Exchange Act Release No. 71668, 2014 WL 907416, at *2 (Mar.
7, 2014). I must therefore “‘review [Cooper’s] case on its own facts’ to make findings regarding
[his] fitness to participate in the industry in the barred capacities.” Id. (quoting McCarthy v.
SEC, 406 F.3d 179, 188 (2d Cir. 2005)). A decision to impose a collateral bar “should be
grounded in specific ‘findings regarding the protective interests to be served’ by barring the
respondent and the ‘risk of future misconduct.’” Id. (quoting McCarthy, 406 F.3d at 189-90).10
The Commission has explained that “because ‘[f]idelity to the public interest requires a
severe sanction when a respondent’s misconduct involves fraud,’ in most fraud cases the
Steadman factors, such as egregiousness, scienter, and opportunity for future misconduct, will
weigh in favor of a bar.”11 In some measure, this is a reflection of the fact that the securities
industry must “depend[] very heavily on the integrity of its participants”12 because those
participants are “present[ed] [with] continual opportunities for dishonesty and abuse.”13

The facts of this case leave little doubt that a full collateral bar is warranted. Cooper
worked hard to lie to every investor with whom he interacted. And his lies were sophisticated.
He created a fake escrow company, complete with a website and personnel. He created false
account documents. He even created investments that did not exist. Cooper compounded these
falsehoods by lying to investors and telling them that their investments were safe and that they
would earn ridiculous returns. And he offered these latter lies while knowing he had no intention
of investing in anything other than his lifestyle. Cooper set out to steal investors’ money and
succeeded in taking over $2.1 million from at least ten investors. Given Cooper’s conduct, a
collateral bar is necessary to protect the investing public.
By any measure, Cooper’s conduct was egregious. See Ex. 2 at 31 (holding that Cooper
“acted with a high degree of scienter and engaged in multiple, recurrent and egregious violations
of the securities laws”). Cooper set out to steal investors’ money. He induced investment by
convincing investors that their money was safe. But their money was not safe because Cooper
did not invest it and instead spent it on himself. See, e.g., id. at 7.
Cooper’s conduct was not isolated. See Ex. 2 at 34 (“Defendants’ securities violations
were egregious, repeated, and carried a high degree of scienter.”). He did not simply lie to one
investor about a fake investment and a fake escrow agent; he lied for over three years to at least
ten investors who invested over $2 million.
Cooper acted with scienter. See Ex. 2 at 31. Cooper carried out a premediated scheme.
It was no accident that his investment and escrow agent were fictitious. Cooper did not
accidently use his investors’ money to fund clothes, hotels, cars, first-class travel, vacations, and
gambling trips to Las Vegas, Atlantic City, and the Bahamas. Id. at 7, 22-23, 28. He did all of
these things and more as part of a plan to steal investors’ money.
Cooper has neither made assurances against future violations nor shown that he
recognizes the wrongful nature of his conduct. See Ex. 2 at 31, 35. During depositions in the
underlying civil matter, he refused to answer questions, relying on his privilege against
self-incrimination. Id. at 5, 13. And he did not file an answer to the OIP, oppose the Division’s
motion, or respond to the order to show cause.
Cooper’s occupation will present opportunities for future violations. The Commission
has held that “the existence of a violation raises an inference that” the acts in question will recur.
Tzemach David Netzer Korem, 2013 WL 3864511, at *6 n.50 (quoting Geiger v. SEC, 363 F.3d
481, 489 (D.C. Cir. 2004)). During the time Cooper was perpetrating his scheme, “[h]e had no
gainful employment.” Ex. 2 at 35. And even after being sued for fraud and learning that the
Commission was investigating him, Cooper continued to engage in fraud. Id. at 31. Given
Cooper’s actions and his unrepentant attitude, it is apparent that if he were to continue working
in the securities industry, his occupation would “present[] opportunities for future illegal conduct
in th[is] . . . industry.” John W. Lawton, 2012 WL 6208750, at *11.
Considering Cooper’s actions, the harm he caused, and his failure or inability to
recognize the wrongfulness of his actions, it is clear that Cooper is unfit to participate in the
securities industry. Because there is a great risk that Cooper will engage in future misconduct,
7

the goal of protecting the investing public weighs heavily in favor of imposing a collateral bar
against Cooper. The public interest thus favors imposing a collateral bar.14

Imposing a bar will hopefully serve as a deterrent to those who might seek to follow
Cooper’s example. See David R. Wulf, 2016 WL 1085661, at *4 (noting that among other
factors, the Commission “consider[s] the extent to which sanctions will have a deterrent effect”).
