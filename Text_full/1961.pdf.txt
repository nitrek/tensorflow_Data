Earl F. Hastings

1908-1961
We wish to express here our profound regret at the death of Earl F.
Hastings on September 8, 1961, shortly after his retirement for
reasons of health while serving his second term as a member of the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
As Director of Securities for the Arizona Corporation Commission in
the years 1949 to 1956, and thereafter as a member of this Commission, he served his State and Nation well as an able and just
administrator, bringing to the public service a broad experience in
mining and industrial engineering. His fairness in the administration of the law, his staunch advocacy of the cause of investor protection, and his dedication to the objectives for which the Commission was established have left an indelible impression upon those
members who served with him and upon the staff.
"Ve shall miss his wise and forthright counsel, and his warm and
courteous personality. To the members of his family we extend our
deepest sympathy.
William L. Cary
Byron D. Woodside

CURRENT

PROBLEMS

BEFORE

THE COMMISSION

The High Level of Activity and Changing Conditions in the Securities Markets

The activity in the security markets of the Nation continued to increase and reached a new peak in fiscal year 1961. This is shown
graphically in the chart on page 2, which portrays the successive
significant increases that have occurred in recent years in the flotation
of new issues of securities for sale to the public. A similar increase
has occurred in the volume of trading on the national securities exchanges. In the fiscal year 1961 such trading reached a new peak of
1.97 billion shares with a dollar volume of $57 billion.
These figures reflect a marked growth of public participation in
the securities markets. A study made by the New York Stock Exchange shows that during the period 1952-59 the number of shareholders doubled, and that in the last 3 years of that period the number
increased by nearly 1113 million a year. Correspondingly there has
been a large increase in the number of broker-dealers, in the number
of their salesmen and in the number of branch officeswhich they have
opened. At the end of the 1961 fiscal year there were 5,500 brokers
and dealers registered with the Commission as compared with 3,930
in 1950. The number of customer's men registered with the New
York Stock Exchange increased from 10,608 in 1950 to 27,896 in 1961
and the number of customer's men registered with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., increased from 28,794 to 93,351
in the same period. The number of branch offices maintained by
member firms of the New York Stock Exchange increased from 1,661
in 1950 to 3,166 at the end of 1960. Some member firms have trebled
their retail outlets.
Thus, concomitantly with the influx of a large number of new
and presumably inexperienced investors into the market, there has
been an influx of new and inexperienced salesmen. At the same time,
the increase in the number of branch offices has tended to result in
less effective supervision of the salesmen. The problem of supervision is aggravated by the employment of part-time salesmen and
salesmen who operate from their private residences. These factors
have made more difficult the task of the Commission and the exchange
and securities association disciplinary bodies in attempting to insure

that prospective investors receive adequate information and proper
advice as to the suitability of particular securities to meet their personal investment needs.
Investment companies have assumed an increasing importance. The
number of investment companies registered with the Commission has
increased from 366 in 1950 to 663 at the close of the 1961 fiscal year
and in the same period the estimated market value of their assets
increased from $4.7 billion to $29 billion. In the 1961 fiscal year such
companies registered $4.5 billion of new securities for sale to the
public, as compared with the total of $19 billion of new securities
issues registered for sale by all corporations. In the sale of investment company securities to a larger number of persons, door-to-door
salesmen have been utilized and plans are provided whereby such
securities may be purchased by a series of periodic payments.

TWENTY-SEVENTH

Another phenomenon which has manifested itself is the strong
public appeal of new issues of securities and many new issues have
moved up sharply in price above the initially established offering
price almost from the moment first marketed. In an effort to detect
any manipulative or other fraudulent practices contributing to such
price increases, the Commission has conducted more market quizzes
this year than in any prior year in its history. Detection of such
practices is made difficult by the lack of any systematic reporting of
prices and volume of transactions in the over-the-counter market such
as is available concerning transactions on security exchanges.
Study of Trading and Marketing Practices in the Exchange and Over-theCounter Markets

In view of the tremendous growth and many new developments in
the securities markets, the Commission has welcomed the authorization and special appropriation granted by H.J. Res. 438, enacted
shortly after the close of the fiscal year, directing a study of trading
and marketing practices on the national securities exchanges and in
the over-the-counter market to determine whether exchange and securities association rules, including rules for the expulsion, suspension,
or disciplining of members, are adequate for the protection of investors ill the light of present conditions, whether the administration
of these rules is sufficient and whether additional rules or legislation
are required. This study will result in the obtaining and evaluation
of much valuable overall information as to distribution and trading
practices both on and off the exchanges. The Commission is directed
to report the result of its study on or before January 3, 1963, and will
promptly submit to the Congress any recommendations for legislation
in particular areas which may be shown to be required in the course
of the study.
Study of the Implications of the Growth of Investment Companies

As reported in previous reports, the Commission entered into a
contract with the Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the
University of Pennsylvania for the preparation of a study of the
problems created by the growth in size of investment companies. As
discussed in part IX below, a report has now been received covering
such subjects as organization and control of open-end investment
companies, growth of investment companies, portfolio company control, investment policy, performance, and impact of investment companies on the stock market. A further report dealing with the relationships between open-end investment companies and their
investment advisers and principal underwriters is expected to be
received by the end of the calendar year 1961. It is anticipated that
the information developed in this report will assist in providing a basis

4

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

for determination by the Commission of the action which should be
taken concerning the problems in these fields and whether specific
legislative recommendations should be made by the Commission to
the Congress.
The portion of the report yet to be received is of particular interest
in view of the stockholders suits, some 50 in number, which have been
instituted in the courts during the past 2 years against 18 registered
investment companies and in which it is alleged, inter alia, that the
management or advisory fees paid by the investment companies are
grossly excessive.
The Commission has participated in several of these suits as amicus
curiae in support of plaintiffs' position that the act affords a private
Federal right of action for violation of various provisions of the act 1
but has not taken any direct action with respect to merits of the
matters involved in the litigation.
Variable Annuity Contracts

The Commission has under study the many problems arising under
the Investment Company Act of 1940 in connection with the issuance
and sale of variable annuity contracts. On September 26, 1961, after
the close of the fiscal year, the President vetoed H.R. 7482, which
would have amended the Life Insurance Act of the District of Columbia to permit District life insurance companies to establish certain
voting and management procedures with respect to variable annuity
contracts. The passage of the bill had been opposed by the Commission. In his veto message the President pointed out that the purchaser
of a variable annuity depends largely upon the efficiency and skill of
the management in selecting and managing the underlying portfolio
securities for the return upon his investment. He stated that the bill
failed to give adequate recognition to the basic principle. recognized
in the Investment Company Act, that the investor have a voice in the
control of his company. He pointed out further that the bill did not
resolve the problems under the act and indicated his confidence that
the Commission would in the near future be in a position to offer a
suggested program for solution of the problem of reconciling with the
provisions of the Investment Company Act the operations of life
insurance companies which desire to sell variable annuities.
Enforcement Activity

The high level of public interest and participation in the securities
markets has offered a fertile field for unscrupulous operators and promoters. To counter fraudulent and other illegal practices in the sale
and purchase of securities, the Commission is pursuing a vigorous en1See the discussion
of Brown v. Bullock and Brouk v. Managed Funtl8 under "Litigation
under the Investment Company Act" in pt. IX ot this report.

forcement program. During the fiscal year, 546 antifraud and other
regulatory investigations were instituted. Injunction actions were
brought in 92 cases, a greater number than in any previous year. In
criminal prosecutions 126 convictions were obtained in 45 cases, the
largest number of convictions in any fiscal year since the earliest days
of the Commission. Inspections were made of 1,627 broker-dealer
firms, and the registrations of 55 firms "ere revoked. Examinations
or investigations were initiated in 16 cases to determine whether stop
order proceedings should be brought with respect to registration statements filed with respect to new security offerings, and 14 investigations were instituted to determine whether other information filed
with the Commission was accurate and adequate. Orders suspending the exemption from registration provided for small security issues
were issued in 54 instances. Inspections were conducted of 56 registered investment companies. The most significant of these actions
are described in the parts of this report which follow.
Operations from foreign bases continue to plague our enforcement
efforts. Despite excellent cooperation from Canadian authorities, it
is most difficult to combat fraudulent activities carried on from vantage points outside our jurisdiction.
Registration of New Security Offerings

One of the primary duties of the Commission is the examination of
registration statements filed under the Securities Act of 1933 with
respect to new security issues proposed to be offered to the public. The
unprecedented number of registration statements filed in recent years
has taxed the capacity of the Commission's staff to the utmost. The
number of such statements filed increased again in the fiscal year 1961
to a new high of 1,830, representing a 12 percent increase over last
year. This number may be compared with the total number of registration statements filed in fiscal 1950of 496.
The problem for the Commission arises not only from the volume
of statements, but more particularly from their character. Of the
1,830 statements filed in fiscal 1961, 52 percent, amounting to a record
number of 958, were filed by companies that had not previously registered a securities offering. This compares with 28 percent as recently
as 1958. The letter of comment technique whereby inadequacies
in the registration statement are called to the issuer's attention by
our staff and appropriate amendments filed is described in part IV of
this report. Needless to say this processing technique is more time
consuming where the issuer has had no previous experience in complying with the registration requirements.
The increases in the numbers and change in character of registration statements filed in recent years has far outstripped increases in
examining personnel and the median time required to process regis-

6

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tration statements has crept upwards year by year, reaching 55
days from initial filing to effective date in fiscal 1961. For fiscal
1962, under a further increased budget, it has been possible to allocate
a personnel increase to the Division of Corporation Finance which it
is hoped will result in a decrease in the time required in the examination process.
Management

Survey

During the fiscal year the management consulting firm of Booz,
Allen & Hamilton conducted a survey of the Commission under contract with the Bureau of the Budget with the consent of the Commission. The general purpose of the survey was to appraise the
Commission's organization and operations and to recommend
improvements where appropriate.
The survey began on July 18, 1960,
and the factfinding aspects were completed by October 31, 1960.
Printed copies of the survey were made available by the Bureau of
the Budget on January 16, 1961, for distribution to appropriate committees of the Congress, interested members of the public, the members
and staff of the Commission, and the press.
The report contains the following principal conclusions: (1) the
Commission is effectively carrying out the mission assigned to it by
the Congress, but additional manpower is required in order to prevent
deterioration of regulatory standards; (2) there is an urgent need
for a minimum 11 percent increase in manpower above the allocation for fiscal 1961 to meet the increased workload; and (3) certain
procedural and organizational changes should be made.
The report encompasses a total of 101 recommendations, 13 outlining the need for additional manpower to permit the Commission to
process its workload, 74 relating to procedural changes, 11 pertaining
to organizational changes, and 3 pertaining to training of new
personnel.
As of August 31, 1961, 82 recommendations had been implemented
or otherwise acted upon, and the remaining 19 were under study.
It may be noted that the appropriation for fiscal 1962 provides for
an average employment approximately 14 percent above that in 1961.

PARTll
LEGISLATIVE ACTIVITIES
Statutory Amendments in the 86th Congress

At the beginning of the fiscal year, amendments to the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940 and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 were
enacted by the 86th Congress and signed by the President, becoming
Public Laws 86-750 and 86-760, respectively.
Public Law 86-750 amends the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
by expanding the bases for disqualification of a registrant because
of prior misconduct, authorizing the Commission by rule to require
the keeping of books and records and the filing of reports, permitting periodic examination of a registrant's books and records, empowering the Commission by rule to define and prescribe means
reasonably designed to prevent fraudulent practices, extending criminal liability for a willful violation of a rule or order of the Commission, making it clear that aiders and abettors may be responsible
in injunctive and administrative proceedings, and modifying the definition of the term "control" in the statute and the conditions under
which an investment adviser may call himself an "investment
counsel."
Public Law 86-760 amends section 304( c) of the Trust Indenture
Act of 1939. Under that section the Commission was required to
grant an exemption from one or more of the provisions of the act
if, at the time the application for exemption was filed, securities were
outstanding under the indenture involved which were outstanding
within 6 months of the enactment of the act, that is by February 4,
1940, and if compliance would require consent of the holders of outstanding securities, or would impose an undue burden of the issuer,
having due regard for the public interest and the interests of investors.
As amended, section 304(c) now requires the Commission to grant the
exemption in the same situation if there are securities outstanding
under the indenture which were outstanding either on February 4,
1940, or such securities were outstanding on January 1, 1959.
The Commission had originally made a number of proposals to the
86th Congress for amendment of the Federal securities law. The proposals were intended to strengthen the safeguards and protections
afforded the public by tightening jurisdictional provisions, correcting
certain inadequacies revealed through administrative experience and
facilitating criminal prosecutions and other enforcement activities.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Hearings on the bills were held and modifications of the proposals
were passed by the Senate and reported out by the Committee on
Interstate and Foreign Commerce of the House of Representatives.
'Vith the exceptions noted above, however, they were not enacted into
law. The Commission's proposals and the action taken by Congress
concerning them are discussed in the 25th annual report, pages 9-11
and the 26th annual report, pages 9-10.
An amendment enacted to section 4 (a) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 provides that a member of the Commission, after the
expiration of his term, shall continue in officeuntil his successor is
appointed and qualified, except that he may not continue beyond the
expiration of the next session of Congress subsequent to the expiration of his term in office.'
Congressional Action and Hearings in the 87th Congress

1. H.J. Res. -438.-0n June 27,1961, Chairman Cary and other members of the Commission appeared before the Subcommittee on Commerce and Finance of the Committee on Interstate and Foreign
Commerce, House of Representatives, to testify on H.J. Res. 438. The
resolution, which was introduced by Representative Peter Mack, provided for the amendment of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to
authorize and direct the Commission to make a study and investigation
of the adequacy, for the protection of investors, of the rules of national securities exchanges and national securities associations, including rules for the expulsion, suspension, or disciplining of members
for conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade.
The resolution also directed the Commission to report to the Congress
on or before January 3, 1963,the results of its study and investigation,
together with its recommendations, including recommendations for
such legislation as the Commission deems advisable. An appropriation of $750,000 with which to carry out the study and investigation
was authorized and $412,000 was appropriated for this purpose for
the 1962 fiscal year.
Chairman Cary testified that the Commission supported the resolution and was of the opinion that a thorough study of the over-thecounter market and of the exchanges is desirable. He pointed out
that the Commission's present budget is not enough to support such
a study and investigation and that the Commission is virtually forced
to concentrate all of its funds and manpower upon immediate
problems.
Chairman Cary discussed, as tentative areas of inquiry under the
study and investigation, the over-the-counter market generally, the
lack of information concerning over-the-counter securities, the rules

of the exchanges, the growth of public participation and trading
volume, the changes in methods of distribution and marketing, and
certain problems in connection with the employment of credit in the
securities markets and distribution of securities through the facilities
of the exchanges.
A modification suggested by Chairman Cary was incorporated in
the resolution and after the end of the fiscal year it was passed by the
House of Representatives and the Senate and was signed by the
President.
2. Reorganization Plan No.1 and S. Â£U35.-Chairman Cary and
other members of the Commission appeared before various committees
of the Senate and House of Representatives in connection with hearings on Reorganization Plan No.1, which concerned the Commission's authority to delegate, by rule or order, any of its functions.
Testimony was given on May 18, 1961, before a subcommittee of the
Committee on Government Operations, House of Representatives, on
June 2, 1961, before a subcommittee of the Senate Committee on
Banking and Currency and on June 6, 1961, before the Committee
on Government Operations of the Senate.
In substance, Chairman Cary testified that he believed that the plan
would serve to relieve the Commission from dealing with many matters of lesser importance and thus conserve its time for the consideration of major matters of policy and planning, that under the plan the
rights of any party appearing before the Commission would continue
to be preserved, that the Commission would retain the right to review
any delegated action and that the plan would expand and clarify the
Commission's already existing powers of delegation.
Reorganization Plan No. 1 was disapproved by the Senate, and on
June 22, 1961, Senator Harrison A. Williams, Jr. (for himself and
for Senator Jacob K. Javits), introduced S. 2135, which also dealt
with the Commission's authority to delegate its functions, but which
differed in certain respects from Reorganization Plan No. 1. Although
no hearings were held on S. 2135, the Commission submitted comments on the bill in which it suggested amendments which it believed
would improve the bill, and indicated that it favored the adoption
of S. 2135 subject to the suggested amendments. On August 24,1961,
the Committee on Banking and Currency, U.S. Senate, favorably reported S. 2135 with amendments as suggested by the Commission, and
on September 1, 1961, the Senate passed the bill as reported.

Commission appeared before the Committee on Interstate and Foreign

Proposals

in the 87th

Congress

The following bills relating to the Federal securities laws were
introduced in the 87th Congress during the fiscal year 1961.
S. 755, introduced by Senator Homer E. Capehart, would amend
section 31 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which now provides an annual fee for registration of exchanges of one fivehundredth of 1 percent of the aggregate dollar amount of stock
exchange transactions, equal to 2 cents per $1,000. Under the bill,
this registration fee would be increased to a rate of 5 cents per $1,000
and there would be a similar registration fee of 5 cents per $1,000 on
transactions effected otherwise than on a national securities exchange."
S.l117, introduced by Senator Maurine B. Neuberger, would amend
section 36 of the Investment Company Act of 1940 to provide an investigatory power in the board of directors of a registered investment
company, or the investment adviser or principal underwriter for such
a company, with respect to among other things, securities transactions and loans by an officer, director, employee, or agent of the
registered investment company or investment adviser,"
S. 18J,~,introduced by Senator John A. Carroll (for himself and
Senator Philip A. Hart), would, among other things, amend section
4 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to provide for a term
of 10 years for members of the Commission.
H.R. 1118, introduced by Representative J. Arthur Younger,
would, among other things, amend the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 to provide for the assessment and collection of increased fees
to cover the cost of operation of this Commission.'
H.R. 1~11, introduced by Representative Abraham Multer, would
amend section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 to provide that officers and directors of any issuer of registered securities
report periodically the extent to which, and the purposes for which,
their holdings of such securities are pledged."

HR. ~799,introduced by Representative Francis E. Walter, would
amend the Investment Company Act of 1940. The bill is substantially similar to S.1117, which is discussed above.
H.R. 6591, introduced by Representative Abraham Multer, would
amend the Securities Act of 1933 and the Investment Company Act of
1940 with respect to the status of variable annuity policies and companies which offer such policies to the public.
HR. 6863, which was also introduced by Representative Multer,
would amend the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 to require disclosure by investment advisers of transactions for their own account in
any investments of the type with respect to which they render advisory services.
A substantial amount of time was devoted to matters pertaining
to other legislative proposals referred to the Commission for comment and to congressional inquiries. During the fiscal year a total of
41 legislative proposals were analyzed. In addition, numerous congressional inquiries relating to matters other than specific legislative
proposals were reviewed and answered .

comments thereon. These views and comments are carefully reviewed
by the staff and by the Commission.'
A number of changes were made during the 1961 fiscal year in the
rules, regulations, and forms under the various statutes administered
by the Commission. Other changes which the Commission announced
in preliminary form and on which it invited public comments were
pending at the end of the fiscal year. The changes made during the
fiscal year and those pending at the end of the year are described
below.
GENERAL
Revision of Rules and Forms Concerning the Reporting of Securities Holdings
and Transactions

The Commission, during the fiscal year, adopted revised forms for
reporting security holdings and transactions pursuant to section 16(a)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, section 17(a) of the Public
J The rules and regulations
of the Commission are published in the Code of Federal
R.~ulatlons.
The rules adopted under the various statutes administered by the Commission appear in the following par ts of title 17 of that code:
Securities Act of 1933, pt. 230.
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, pt 240.
!Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, pt. 250.

Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and section 30(f) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940.2
Previously, the following separate forms were prescribed for statements under each of the statutes referred to: Forms 4, 5, and 6 under
the Securities Exchange Act; forms U-17-1 and U-17-2 under the
Public Utility Holding Company Act; and forms N-30F-1 and
N-30F-2 under the Investment Company Act. All of these forms
were consolidated into two forms designated forms 3 and 4 which
are used, respectively, for the filing of initial statements of beneficial ownership of securities and statements of changes in such beneficial ownership under all three of these statutes. In connection
with the adoption of the revised forms the Commission adopted
certain changes in the related rules under the three statutes. The
amended rule 30f-1 under the Investment Company Act provides
that no statements need be filed pursuant to section 30(f) of that
act by an affiliated person of an investment adviser in his capacity
as such if such person is solely an employee, other than an officer, of
such investment adviser.
The draft of the proposed rule changes published for comment
contained a definition of the term "person" which would have included
in such term any group or syndicate the members of which are acting in concert with respect to the acquisition, disposition, holding or
voting of securities of an issuer. The draft also included a proposed
rule relating to the reporting of interests in securties held by corporations and business trusts. The Commission concluded that these
two proposals required further study and consideration and did not
include them in the revision.
Amendment of Rules Concerning Disclosure of Nonpnblic Records by Employees

The Commission amended the applicable provisions of its rules of
practice and related rules under the laws it administers to extend
the prohibition of the rules against disclosure by Commission employees of nonpublic information in the files of the Commission,"
Heretofore, these rules prohibited officersand employees of the Commission, without its specific authorization, from making available
to any person other than a member, officer,or employee of the Commission, whether in response to a subpoena or otherwise, any information or document obtained during the course of any private investigation conducted by the Commission. The amendment extends this
prohibition to information in "any other nonpublic records of the
Commission," whether obtained in an investigation or otherwise.

Amendment of Rule 151

Rule 151 under the Securities Act of 1933, which defines the term
"public offering," was amended to exclude under certain conditions
the offering of the stock of small business investment companies to
small business concerns pursuant to the requirements of the Small
Business Investment Act of 1958.4
Under the former section 304(d) of the Small Business Investment
Act, whenever a small business investment company provided capital
to a small business concern, the small business investment company
was required to offer, and the small business concern was required to
purchase, a certain amount of stock of the small business investment
company.
Under the provisions of section 304(c) of the Act, as
amended by Public Law 86-502, a small business concern has the
right but is not required to acquire such stock when capital is provided. The purpose of the amendment to rule 151 was to conform
the provisions of the rule to the amended provisions of the Act.
Proposed Rule 155

The Commission during the previous fiscal year published notice
that it had under consideration a proposed new rule which would be
designated rule 155.5 The purpose of this proposed rule was to make
clear that a public offering of an immediately convertible security
by persons who purchased such security from an issuer in a "private
placement," or a public offering of the underlying security received
by such persons upon conversion of the convertible security, may be
subject to the registration provisions of the Securities Act. Reference
to this matter was made in the Commission's annual report,"
The matter was still under consideration at the close of the 1961 fiscal year.
Adoption of Rules 234 and 235; Rescission of Regulation A-R (Rules 230-

233)

notes secured by a first lien on real estate. The new rule supersedes
regulation A-R (rules 230-233) which has been rescinded/
The new rule makes clear what has been the Conunission's longstanding interpretation, that the exemption is available only for notes
directly secured by a first lien on real estate, and hence is unavailable
for collateral trust notes or participations in an underlying note, even
though such underlying note is secured by a first lien on real estate,
or for investment contracts involved in the offering of first lien notes.
The new rule also provides that the amount of first lien indebtedness
for which an exemption is available shall not exceed 75 percent of the
appraised value of the property securing the notes. This is a liberalization of the previous requirement that all indebtedness against the
property, whether secured by senior or junior liens, shall not exceed
75 percent of the appraised value of the property.
The Commission also adopted rule 235 which provides an exemption from registration under the act for securities of certain cooperative housing corporations. Stock or other securities representing
membership in a cooperative housing corporation are exempt where
the securities are issued only in connection with the sale or lease of
dwelling units in the housing project and are transferable by the purchaser only in connection with the transfer of such dwelling units,"
Amendments to Rule 472

Rule 472, which relates to the filing of amendments to registration
statements filed under the Securities Act, was amended in certain
respects during the fiscal year to facilitate the examination of such
statements.
One amendment requires that where an amendment to a registration
statement relates to financial statements not included in the prospectus,
five additional copies of the amended financial statements shall be

furnished,"
The rule was also amended to require that every amendment to a
registration statement shall be accompanied by two additional copies
of the amendment marked to indicate clearly and precisely the changes
effected in the registration statement by the amendment. If the
amendment alters the text of the prospectus or other material previously filed as a part of the registration statement, the changes must
be indicated by underscoring or in some other appropriate manner."
The purpose of the latter amendment is to avoid the necessity for
the staff, in reviewing the amendment, to reread the entire prospectus

altered. The amendment to the ru1e conforms with present administrative practice.
Amendments to Rules 473 and 478

Section 8 (a) of the Securities Act of 1933 provides that registration
statements filed under that act shall become effective on the 20th day
after filing or such earlier date as the Commission shall determine.
The filing of an amendment to the statement establishes a new filing
date and starts the 20-day period running anew. In order to prevent
registration statements from becoming effective through the lapse of
time and before they have been amended to cure deficiencies therein, it
has been the practice of registrants to file technical or so-called
"delaying" amendments to start the waiting period running again.
The Commission has amended rule 473 to permit the filing, either
with a registration statement or at a later date, of an amendment
which will operate to delay the effective date of the statement without
the necessity of filing a delaying amendment at the expiration of each
successive 20-day waiting period." The delaying effect of such an
amendment may be terminated in either of two ways. One way is by
filing a further amendment which specifically states that the registration statement shall thereafter become effective in accordance with
section 8 (a) of the act. The other way is by the Commission's granting acceleration of the effective date of the registration statement.
The Commission has also adopted an amendment to rule 478 to
permit any amendment filed pursuant to ru1e 473 to be signed by the
registrant or its agent for servioe.'"
Amendment of Form S-8

Form 8-8 is used for registration under the Securities Act of certain equity securities offered pursuant to unincorporated stock purchase or similar plans for the benefit of employees of the issuer of such
equity securities and for registration of the interests in such plans.
Issuers using this form are required to deliver a copy of the issuer's
latest annual report with the prospectus to each eligible employee.
The issuer is also required to include in the registration statement an
undertaking to transmit to all employees participating in the plan at
the time and in the manner such material is sent to such stockholders,
copies of all reports, proxy statements and other communications distributed to its stockholders generally. Copies of such material must
also be furnished to the Commission.
The foregoing requirements have been amended to provide that such
information need not be transmitted to eligible or participating em11

ployees pursuant to the requirements of form S-8 where such employees are already stockholders of the issuer and receive copies of such
material as such stockholders." The requirement of furnishing copies
of such material to the Commission has also been amended to provide
that they need not be furnished pursuant to the instructions in form
S-8 where they are otherwise furnished pursuant to other requirements of the Commission. The amendments also place the duty of
complying with these requirements upon the issuer of the securities
offered pursuant to the plan; heretofore such duty was, in part, placed
upon the "employer," which might be a company other than the issuer.
Proposed Form S-11 for Securities of Certain Real Estate Companies

During the fiscal year the Commission published notice that it has
under consideration a proposed form for registration under the Securities Act of securities of certain real estate companies.> The proposed
:form, which would be designated :form S-11, would be used :for registration of securities issued by real estate investment trusts, as defined
in the recent amendments to the Internal Revenue Code, and by real
estate syndicates, partnerships, joint ventures, and other incorporated
and unincorporated issuers whose business is primarily that of acquiring and holding real estate or interests in real estate for the purpose
o:finvestment.
A number of comments have been received in regard to the proposed
new form and the form was being further considered in the light of
such comments at the end of the fiscal year.
Amendment of Form S-12

Form S-12 is used for registration under the Securities Act of
certain American depositary receipts against outstanding foreign
securities. This form requires the inclusion in the registration statement of an undertaking to furnish to the Commission copies of annual
and other periodic reports, proxy statements, and other communications distributed to the security holders by the issuer of the underlying securities. The form of this undertaking has been amended
to call only for the furnishing of such information in cases where
it is not otherwise transmitted to the Commission."
THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934
Amendment of Rule 14a-6

Rule 14a-6 which relates to the filing of proxy statements, forms
of proxy, and other soliciting material was amended to provide that

copies of such material (or in the case of investment companies,
three copies) shall be marked to show the differences between it and
the material as previously filed."
The purpose of the amendment is to expedite the processing of
material by making it unnecessary in reviewing proxy material to
reread in detail material which is substantially the same as material
previously filed.
The amendment represents further action on the part of the Commission to expedite in every practicable way the examination of
material filed with it in order to reduce the backlog of unprocessed
material.
Proposed Rule 15d-21

Where interests of participation in employee stock purchase, savings, or similar plans have been registered under the Securities Act
of 1933 and the securities offered plus those outstanding amount to
$2 million or more reports for such plans are required to be filed
pursuant to section 15( d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. In
the absence of any exemption, these reports are required even though
the issuer of the securities offered pursuant to the plan files reports
with the Commission pursuant to section 13 or 15 (d) of that act.
Under a proposed rule 15d-21, on which public comments have been
invited, such plans would be exempt from the operation of section
15(d) of the act if the issuer files annual reports on form lO-K and
furnishes the information, :financial statements and other documents
required by that form with respect to the plan."
Proposed Rule 19a2-1

During the 1960 fiscal year the Commission invited public comments on a proposed rule 19a2-1 under the act which would provide
that the failure or refusal of an issuer or its officers, directors,
employees, or controlling persons to cooperate with the Commission
in proceedings under section 19(a) (2) or investigations under section 21 of the act with respect to compliance with section 12 or 13
of the act shall be deemed a failure to comply with the provisions
of the act or the rules and regulations thereunder for the purpose
of section 19(a) (2).1.8 The proposed rule would provide a basis for
the issuance of an order under section 19(a) (2) denying, suspending, or withdrawing the registration of a security in such cases. This
matter was pending at the end of the fiscal year.

Amendment of Form 8-K

The Commission has invited public comments on certain proposed
amendments to form 8-K.19 These proposed amendments are designed to bring to the attention of investors promptly information
regarding material changes affecting the company or its affairs where
it appears that the changes are of such importance that they should
be reported promptly and not deferred to the end of the fiscal year.
The amendments relate to matters such as the pledging of securities
of the issuer or its affiliates, changes in the board of directors otherwise than by stockholder action, the acquisition or disposition of
significant amounts of assets, and transactions with insiders. This
matter was pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Amendments to Form 100K

Form 10-K is used for annual reports pursuant to Section 13 or
15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. An amendment to
this form, adopted during the fiscal year, requires registrants which
are not subject to the Commission's proxy rules to furnish to the Commission for its information copies of their proxy soliciting material
in the same manner as they are required to furnish copies of their
annual reports to stockholders. Another amendment requires registrants which do not furnish annual reports or proxy material to
their stockholders to include a statement to that effect in their annual
report on form 10-K.20
In connection with the proposed rule 15d-21, described above, the
Commission also invited public comments on certain proposed amendments to form 10-K which would require disclosure with respect to
employee stock purchase, savings, or similar plans." The required
information would be furnished by the sponsoring company and the
plan itself would be exempted by the proposed rule from the duty of
filing reports with the Commission.

Amendment of Rule 3c-1

The Commission during the fiscal year amended rule 3c-l under

Proposal to Adopt Exemptive Rules Applicable to Licensed Small Business
Investment Companies

After the close of the fiscal year 1961 the Commission was giving
consideration to the promulgation of certain rules applicable to small
business investment companies licensed by the Small Business Administration under the Small Business Investment Company Act of
1958. The Commission has previously adopted rules 3c-1, 3c-2, and
14a-1 (Investment Company Act Release Nos. 2828, 2909, and 3011,
respectively), excluding certain activities of small business investment companies or the ownership of their securities from various
provisions of section 3 (c) (1) of the act and permitting the use by
a small business investment company of regulation E filings under
the Securities Act of 1933 in raising its initial capital as required
by section 14(a) of the act. The rules now under consideration
would be applicable only to licensed small business investment companies and would exempt them from various provisions of sections
17(a), 17(d), and 18(c) of the Investment Company Act.24
Adoption of Form N-5R

Shortly after the beginning of the fiscal year, the Commission
adopted form N-5R for annual reports which small business investment companies are required to file with the Commission pursuant
to section 13 or 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or
pursuant to section 30(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940.25
The adoption of this form was referred to in the 26th annual report."
INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940
Amendment of Form ADV and Rule 204-1 and Adoption of Form ADV-SUP

In September 1960 the Investment Advisers Act was amended in
many important respects. Among other things, it now provides new
grounds for denying, suspending, or revoking the registration of an
investment adviser. Before the amendments were adopted the provisions of section 203(d) of the act, provided, in substance, that the
Commission could deny, suspend, or revoke the registration of an
investment adviser if it found that such action was in the public interest and that the investment adviser, or any partner, officer,director,
or controlling person: (1) within 10 years of the order, was convicted

of a felony or misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of a security or arising out of activities as an investment adviser, underwriter, broker, or dealer, or as an affiliated person or employee of an
investment company, bank, or insurance company; or (2) was subject
to an injunction based upon similar conduct or activity; or (3) had
willfully made any untrue statement or misleading omission of a
material fact in any application or report filed with the Commission.
As amended, the act now provides additional bases for denial,
suspension, or revocation of registration: (1) conviction of a felony
or misdemeanor involving mail fraud; fraud by wire, telephone, radio,
or television; or embezzlement, fraudulent conversion, or misappropriation of funds or securities; (2) willful violation of any provision of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or any rule or regulation
under any of such acts; or (3) aiding or abetting any other person's
violation of any of such acts, rules, or regulations. The amendments
also provide that any of the above disqualifications on the part of a
controlled person, as well as a partner, officer, director, or controlling
person, may be a basis for denial, suspension, or revocation.
Effective May 1, 1961, the Commission amended form ADV, the
form of application for registration and to amend such an application, to require the furnishing of information to disclose whether
any of the persons mentioned above is subject to any disqualification
under the act, as amended; to obtain certain additional information;
to clarify the instructions; to simplify its use; and to simplify its
processing by the Commission. Rule 204-1 under the act was also
amended to require every investment adviser whose registration is
effective on May 1, 1961, and every investment adviser who has an
application for registration pending on that date, to file a new form
ADV-SUP as a supplement to his application not later than June 30,
1961. Form ADV -SUP requires the same information as form ADV
as amended."
Adoption of Rule 204-2

Section 204-2 of the act, as amended, provides that every investment adviser (other than one specifically exempted from registration
pursuant to section 203(b)) shall make, keep, and preserve such accounts, correspondence, memoranda, papers, books, and other records,
and make such reports, as the Commission by rules and regulations
may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or
for protection of investors. Under this section such books and other
records are subject to inspection by Commission representatives.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

On May 25, 1961, the Commission adopted rule 204-2, effective
July 1, 1961, to require investment advisers subject to registration to
maintain specified books and records relating to their business. In
addition to the usual journals and ledgers, the rule requires the maintenance of records with respect to memoranda of orders given and
instructions received for the purchase, sale receipt or delivery of
securities, and originals or copies of certain communications received
or sent by the investment adviser. Additional requirements are applicable to investment advisers who have custody or possession of
any funds or securities of any client, and to investment advisers who
render any snpervisory or management service to any client. The
rule specifies the period during which such books and records must
be preserved and also provides that an investment adviser, before
ceasing to conduct business, must arrange for and be responsible for
the preservation of his books and records for the remainder of the
period specified in the rule, and must notify the Commission of the
place where such books and records will be maintained during such
period."
Proposed Rule 206(4)-1

Section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, as amended,
contains a Hew subsection (4) which prohibits an investment adviser
from engaging in any act, practice, or course of business which is
fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative, and gives the Commission
the power by rules and regulations to define and prescribe means
reasonably designed to prevent such acts, practices, and courses of
business.
On April 4, 1961, the Commission announced its proposal to adopt
rule 206(4)-1 to define certain advertisements by investment advisers
to be fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative within the meaning of
section 206(4) of the act. The proposed rule is intended to implement the statutory mandate by foreclosing the use of advertisements
which have a tendency to mislead or deceive clients or prospective
clients.
The proposed rule would prohibit advertisements which contain
testimonials or which call attention to specific past recommendations
made by the investment advisers which would have been profitable.
Such advertisements are generally misleading because by their very
nature they emphasize the comments and activities favorable to the
adviser and ignore those which are unfavorable. Other provisions
of the rule would specify the circumstances under which advertisements offering graphs, charts, formulas, etc. could be used, and would
2S

prohibit advertisements which represent that any report, analysis,
or other service can be obtained free or without charge unless it is
entirely free and subject to no conditions or obligations. The rule
would also include a general prohibition against the use of advertisements containing untrue or misleading statements. 29
The Commission has received many comments and suggestions on
this proposal and these are being studied to determine what changes
should be made before any further action is taken on the proposal.

PART IV
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

The Securities Act of 1933 is primarily a disclosure statute designed
to provide investors with material facts concerning securities publicly
offered for sale by use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate
commerce, and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit, or other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities. The issuer of such securities
is required to file with the Commission a registration statement which
includes a prospectus containing significant information about the
issuer and the offering. The registration statement is available for
public inspection as soon as it is filed. After the statement is filed,
the securities may be offered by means of a prospectus supplying the
information required by the act. Sales may not be made, however,
until the registration statement has become "effective." A copy of
the prospectus must be furnished to each purchaser at or before the
sale or delivery of the security. The registrant and the underwriter
are responsible for the contents of the registration statement. The
Commission has no authority to control the nature or quality of a
security to be offered for public sale or to pass upon its merits or the
terms of its distribution. Its action in permitting a registration
statement to become effective does not constitute approval of the securities, and any representation to a prospective purchaser of securities to the contrary is made unlawful by section 23 of the act.
DESCRIPTION OF THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
Registration

Statement

and Prospectus

Registration of securities under the act is effected by filing with the
Commission a registration statement on the applicable form containing the prescribed disclosure. When a registration statement relates,
generally speaking, to a security issued by a corporation or other
private issuer, it must contain the information, and be accompanied
by the documents, specified in schedule A of the act; when it relates
to a security issued by a foreign government, the material specified
in schedule B must be supplied. Both schedules specify in considerable detail the disclosure which should be made available to an investor in order that he may make an informed decision whether to
buy the security. In addition, the act provides flexibility in its ad24

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

25

ministration by empowering the Commission to classify issues, issuers,
and prospectuses, to prescribe appropriate forms, and to increase, or
in certain instances vary or diminish, the particular items of information required to be disclosed in the registration statement, as the
Commission deems appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors.
In general the registration statement of an issuer other than a
foreign government must describe such matters as the names of persons who participate in the direction, management, or control of the
issuer's business; their security holdings and remuneration and the
options or bonus and profit-sharing privileges allotted to them; the
character and size of the business enterprise, its capital structure,
past history and earnings, and its financial statements, certified by
independent accountants; underwriters' commissions; payments to
promoters made within 2 years or intended to be made; acquisitions
of property not in the ordinary course of business, and the interest
of directors, officers and principal stockholders therein; pending or
threatened legal proceedings; and the purpose to which the proceeds
of the offering are to be applied. The prospectus constitutes a part
of the registration statement and presents the more important of the
required disclosures.
Examination Procedure

The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines registration statements for compliance with the standards of accurate and
fair disclosure established by the act and usually notifies the registrant by an informal letter of comment of any material respects in
which the statement appears to fail to conform to those requirements.
The registrant is thus ordinarily afforded an opportunity to file a curative amendment. In addition, the Commission has power, after notice
and opportunity for hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement. In certain cases, such as where
a registration statement is so deficient as to indicate a willful or negligent failure to make adequate disclosure, no letter of comment is sent
and the Commission either institutes an investigation to determine
whether stop-order proceedings should be instituted or immediately institutes stop-order proceedings. Information about the use of this
"stop order" power during 1961 appears below under "Stop Order
Proceedings. "
Time Required to Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission endeavors to complete its analysis
in as short a time as possible. The act provides that a registration

26

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

statement shall become effective on the 20th day after it is filed. However, the filing of any amendment thereto establishes a new filing
date for the purpose of the 20-day period. This waiting period is designed to provide investors with an opportunity to become familiar
with the proposed offering. Information disclosed in the registration
statement is disseminated during the waiting period by means of the
preliminary form of prospectus. The Commission is empowered to
accelerate the effective date so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period
where the facts justify such action. In exercising this power, the
Commission is required to take into account the adequacy of the information respecting the issuer theretofore available to the public, the
facility with which investors can understand the nature of and the
rights conferred by the securities to be registered, and their relationship to the capital structure of the issuer, and the public interest and
the protection of investors. The note to rule 460 under the act indicates, for the information of interested persons, some of the more
common situations in which the Commission feels that the statute
generally requires it to deny acceleration of the effective date of
a registration statement.
The number of calendar days which elapsed from the date of the
original filing to the effective date of registration for the median (a verage) registration statement with respect to the 1,389 1 registration
statements that became effective during the 1961 fiscal year was 55
compared with 43 days for 1,275 registration statements in fiscal year
1960 and 28 days for 925 registration statements in fiscal year 1959.
The increase in the elapsed time has been due primarily to the cumulative effect of the unprecedented volume of registration statements filed,
particularly those filed by issuers that had never before filed under
the Act, and the lack of sufficient number of examining personnel to
process such a volume. The number of registration statements filed
during fiscal year 1961 was 1,830, as compared with 1,628 and 1,226 in
fiscal years 1960 and 1959, respectively."
The following table shows by months during the 1961 fiscal year the
number of calendar days for the median registration statement during
each of the three principal stages of the registration process, the total
elapsed time and the number of registration statements effective:
~ Excludes the 163 registration statements of mutual fund companies that became
effective during fiscal year 1961 that were filed pursuant to the provtstons of sec. 24(e)

statements was 15 calendar days for the average registration statement.

VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

During the fiscal year 1961, 1,507 statements in the amount of $19.1
billion became fully effective under the Securities Act of 1933, a record both in number and dollar amount. The number of statements
increased 8 percent over the preceding year while dollar amount increased 33 percent or $4.7 billion. Not only was there a continuation
of the large volume of small issues but also an increase in the registrations covering large issues. The chart on page 2, part I, shows the
number and dollar amount of fully effective registrations from 1935
to 1961.
These figures cover all registrations which became fully effective
including new issues sold for cash by the issuer, secondary distributions and securities registered for other than cash sale, such as
exchange transactions, issues reserved for conversion and issues reserved for options. Of the dollar amount of securities registered in
1961, 74 percent was for the account of issuers for cash sale, 18.7
percent for account of issuers for other than cash sale and 7.3 percent was for the account of others, as shown below.

COMM:ISSION

Securities to be sold for cash sale for account of issuer amounted
to $14.1 billion, an increase of $3.2 billion over the previous year.
This reflects increases of $1.9 billion in debt securities and $1.3 billion
in common stock. Debt securities made up $6.1 billion of the 1961
volume, preferred stock $250 million, and common stock $7.7 billion.
More than half of the common stock was registered by investment
companies. The number of statements, total amounts registered and
classification by type of security for issues to be sold for cash for
account of the issuing company is shown for each of the fiscal years
1935 through 1961 in appendix table 1. More detailed information
for 1961is given in appendix table 2.
Two industries, communications and manufacturing, showed
marked increases over fiscal year 1960 in the dollar amounts registered
for cash sale. Communication companies registered $2.4 billion of
securities in fiscal 1961 compared with $1 billion in fiscal 1960 while
manufacturing companies registered $2.3 billion in fiscal 1961 against
$900 million in fiscal 1960. Electric and gas companies registered
$2.4 billion of securities in fiscal 1961 and investment companies $4.5
billion, almost the same as in the previous year. Registration of
securities by other financial companies (including employee stock
pension plans) and real estate companies increased from $1.4 billion
in fiscal 1960 to $1.7 billion in fiscal 1961. A classification by major
industry is shown below for securities registered for cash sale for

REGISTRATION

STATEMENTS FILED

During the 1961 fiscal year, 1,830 registration statements were filed
for offerings of securities aggregating $20.6 billion, as compared with
1,628 registration statements filed during the 1960 fiscal year for
offerings amounting to $15.8 billion. This represents an increase of
12 percent in the number of statements filed and 31 percent in the
dollar amount involved.
Of the 1,830 registration statements filed in the 1961 fiscal year,
958, or 52 percent, were filed by companies that had not previously
filed registration statements under the Securities Act of 1933. Comparable figures for the 1960 and 1959 fiscal years were 774, or 47
percent, and 472, or 39 percent, respectively .
.A. cumulative total of 19,388 registration statements has been filed
under the act by 9,129 different issuers covering proposed offerings
of securities aggregating over $203 billion from the effective date of
the Securities Act of 1933to June 30, 1961.

STOP ORDER PROCEEDINGS

Section 8 (d) provides that, if it appears to the Commission at any
time that a registration statement contains an untrue statement of a
material fact or omits to state any material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
the Commission may institute proceedings looking to the issuance of a
stop order suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement.
Where such an order is issued, the offering cannot lawfully be made,
or continued if it has already begun, until the registration statement
has been amended to cure the deficiencies and the Commission has
lifted the stop order.
The following table indicates the number of proceedings under
section 8 (d) of the act pending at the beginning of the 1961 fiscal
year, the number initiated during the year, the number terminated
and the number pending at the end of the year.

The six proceedings in which stop orders were issued during the
fiscal year are described below.
Consolidated Development Corp.-The
registration statement
filed by this corporation involved a proposed offering of 448,000
shares of its 20 cent par value common stock, of which 100,000shares
were to be offered at $1 a share to the underwriter to which registrant
owed. $100,000 and 198,000 shares were to be offered to holders of
registrant's convertible debentures at 75 cents a share. In the course
of the proceeding the registrant stipulated to certain facts and consented to the entry of a stop order. The Commission found the regis-

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

31

tration statement to be materially deficient in numerous respects.
Some of the more important deficiencies are described below,"
The registrant is a Delaware corporation organized in 1956 under
the name of Consolidated Cuban Petroleum Corp. to engage in exploration, development, and production of oil and gas in Cuba. It
adopted its present name in 1959 after its petroleum ventures had
sustained severe financial losses. It was then decided to engage in
the 'acquisition and development of real estate in the State of Florida,
and registrant entered into an agreement to acquire certain land for
$150,000in cash, 800,000shares of its stock, and subject to a $2 million
mortgage.
The Commission found the registration statement to be materially
deficient in failing to set forth clearly that registrant had been financially unsuccessful in its petroleum operations and was in serious
financial condition; that, as a result of recent Cuban governmental
acts and its lack of success in the oil business, the registrant had
suspended its oil exploration activities in Cuba and was faced with
the possibility of having to write off all of its Cuban properties and
equipment, leaving it with practically none of the assets shown on
the balance sheet filed with the registration statement.
The information in the registration statement regarding registrant's proposed real estate operations was also materially inadequate
and misleading in many respects. Among other things, the registration statement failed to disclose the funds necessary for drainage of
the Florida land proposed to be acquired, the competitive real estate
developments in the area, that no funds were available for acquiring
or developing Florida real estate, and registrant had no specific plans
for raising such funds.
The registration statement failed to disclose that if the proceeds
from the offering did not exceed $100,000 the entire amount thereof
might go to the underwriter in payment of advances to the registrant,
so that the financing might be solely for the benefit of the underwriter
and failed to set forth material facts regarding the issuance and distribution of registrant's outstanding securities, particularly 2 million
shares of its common stock.
Hazel Bishop, Inc.-The registrant, aNew York corporation organized in 1949 and engaged in the cosmetics business, filed a registration statement in June 1960 relating to 1,157,200shares of common
stock all of which were then outstanding. It was stated that these
shares, which represented approximately 61 percent of registrant's
outstanding common stock, were held by 70 named persons referred
to as the selling stockholders. An amendment to the registration
8

32

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

statement was filed in October 1960, which, among other things, increased the number of shares to be offered to 1,274,823and the number of selling stockholders to 112. The Commission instituted
proceedings to determine whether a stop order should issue, and
registrant entered into a stipulation of facts admitting that a large
part of the stock to be offered had initially been sold in violation of
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and that the registration statement was deficient, but urged the Commission to take
into consideration amendments filed after the institution of the proceedings and to permit the statement as thus amended to become
effective, preferably without issuance of a stop order. However, the
Commission rejected this request because of "the widespread distribution of unregistered shares" and "the serious deficiencies found"
and issued a stop order.'
Among other things, the Commission found that the summary of
earnings, which showed a profit of $102,258for the fiscal year ended
October 31, 1V59, was deceptive and misleading in several respects,
particularly in that, under proper accounting practice, it should have
shown a loss of $707,996for that period.
The registration statement, while stating that television had been
registrant's principal advertising medium and that registrant had
expended about $30 million for network television advertising during
the past 10 years, failed to disclose adequately that there had been a
decided downward trend in advertising expenditures and that planned
advertising expenses were at a further reduced level.
The registration statement contained the statement that during
the period from January 1, 1959, through October 10, 1960, the price
of registrant's common stock on the American Stock Exchange
ranged from a high of $10 per share to a low of $3.50. The Commission found that the reference to the high of $10 per share was
misleading without disclosure that this price was reached on only
one day in .June 1960 following (1) the publication of a statement
by a newspaper columnist that registrant was about to introduce a
new product which would increase its sales and earnings; (2) registrant's release of unaudited results of its operations for the 6-month
period ended April 30. 1960, showing a profit of $202,776 as compared with a loss of $551,173 for the same period of the preceding
year, and (3) registrant's announcements to the cosmetics trade that
it would sponsor a number of well-known radio and television
personalities.
The registration statement stated that in registrant's opinion sales
of 562.500 shares of its stock in 1959 and 1960 constituted private
offerings exempt from registration under section 4(1) of the Securiâ€¢ Securities Act Release No. 4371 (June 7, 1961).

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

33

ties Act. The Commission found, however, that a widespread public
distribution was effected with respect to such shares, that the sales
were accordingly made in violation of section 5 of the act, and that
the representation to the contrary in the registration statement was
therefore false. The registration statement was also found deficient
in failing to disclose that sales of 293,000shares by Raymond Spector,
registrant's board chairman until March 1960, also constituted a public offering in violation of section 5, and that by virtue of the violations of that section, registrant became contingently liable to the
purchasers of the shares.
The Commission stated that the prospectus conveyed the impression that at least some of the shares would be offered through brokers
on the American Stock Exchange and that it would be prejudicial to
the protection of investors and the public interest if the massive distribution here proposed by a large group including registrant's controlling persons should be initiated through the facilities of the
exchange unless prior thereto the facts of the case were given a wider
distribution than was likely to result from mere delivery of copies
of the prospectus to the exchange, pursuant to Securities Act requirements regarding delivery of prospectuses. Accordingly, the Commission stated that prior to the final effective date of the
registration statement, the public interest required the transmittal
by registrant of the Commission's opinion together with an adequate
prospectus to all selling stockholders and the members of the exchange
community.
The Commission further pointed out that in view of the representation that the offering would be "at the market," the large number of selling stockholders, the apparent lack of procedures for coordinating their activities or guarding against unlawful practices, the
fact that the shares to be offered amounted to approximately 60 percent of the outstanding stock, almost twice the number of shares
previously available for trading in the open market, and other factors, there were grave potentialities for violations of the securities
laws by registrant and the selling stockholders. The Commission
called specific attention to rule 10b---6under the Exchange Act, prohibiting bids or purchases by any person participating in a distribution; rule 10b---7which prohibits stabilizing in connection with
an offering "at the market"; rule 10b-2, which prohibits persons participating in a distribution from paying or offering to pay any person for soliciting another to purchase any such security on the
exchange; and restrictions, under section 5 (b) (1) of the Securities
Act, on written communications which constitute an offer of securities. The Commission also pointed out that since an offering "at the
market" implied a free and open market, any activity designed to

34

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

stabilize, stimulate, or condition the market would render such
implication false and misleading.
Following issuance of the stop order, registrant filed a material
amendment to conform with the order and to furnish up-to-date
information, and the registration statement as amended was declared
effective on June 26,1961.
J. Fred Markwell and Alexander Markwell, voting trustees for
shareholders of West Star Mining Co.-A registration statement
covering voting trust certificates representing 2,500,000shares of West
Star Mining Co. common nonassessable capital stock was filed in 1957
and became effective. West Star is an Idaho corporation organized in
1939 to engage in the exploration and development of mineral deposits.
After appropriate notice a hearing was held at which the voting
trustees did not appear. However, they later submitted an answer
and petition in which they admitted that the registration statement
was deficient in certain respects and stated that no securities subject
to the registration statement had been sold and that they intended to
file an amendment. No such amendment was filed.
The prospectus failed to disclose required pertinent financial information regarding the company's operations and material information regarding the exploration of the company's properties, the nature
and dates of the work done, the results of such work, and the physical
condition of the workings. Certain excerpts taken from old engineering reports bearing various dates from 1923 to 1952 concerning
the geology and mining prospects of the company's property were
contained in the prospectus. The Commission found that the information contained in the excerpts was materially misleading without
disclosure reflecting the results of subsequent exploration and development on the properties, information which was not available to
the engineers preparing the reports. The prospectus also contained
statements indicating that the company's mine was favorably located
with reference to commercial ore bodies found on two adjoining mines.
It was found that these statements were materially misleading in view
of the failure to set forth information with respect to distances between the location of the ore mined at one of the adjoining mines and
the boundary of the company's property. Moreover, the prospectus
omitted information as to the nature of the results obtained from
exploration and development work as it continued toward the company's mine from the adjoining oil producing area,"
National Lithium Corp.-Registrant,
a Delaware corporation, was
organized in November 1956 for the principal purpose of acquiring
and developing certain mining claims containing lithium deposits in
the Yellow-knife area of the Northwest Territories of Canada. The
6

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

35

registration statement filed in February 1957 related to a public offering of 3,120,000 shares of common stock at $1.25 per share.
A geological report regarding registrant's lithium claims, which was
filed as an exhibit to the registration statement and portions of which
were quoted or summarized in the prospectus, was found misleading
in that the word "ore" was not used in accordance with its generally
accepted meaning, and the geologist who prepared the report failed to
follow accepted engineering procedures in arriving at his reserve
estimates. The Commission further found that the report and the
prospectus insofar as it quoted from the report contained a number of
other materially misleading statements.
The prospectus also contained misleading statements concerning
the market for registrant's product, the prospects for profitable operation, the use of the proceeds from the proposed offering, the possible need for additional funds, and the absence of any reasonable
prospects of obtaining such additional funds. In addition, the introductory section of the prospectus did not adequately disclose the
speculative features of the enterprise so that they would be plainly
evident to the ordinary investor.
The impression conveyed by the figures set forth in the prospectus
as acquisition and development costs of the three Canadian corporations from whom registrant obtained its mining claims was that those
costs consisted entirely of cash expended when, in fact, some of the
claims were acquired for stock and no payment had been made for
certain other claims.
The registration statement was found to be deficient for failure to
name as promoters certain persons who were instrumental in obtaining
the mining claims in question for the Canadian corporations and in
organizing two of these corporations, and the prospectus was also
deficient in failing to identify the two individuals principally responsible for determining the total consideration to be paid for the claims
acquired by the registrant.
The Commission also found that the prospectus presented an inaccurate picture regarding the beneficial ownership of registrant's stock
issued to the Canadian corporations as consideration for the mining
claims. In addition, the Commission found that registrant's claim
that the issuance and sale of a total of 6,880,000 shares to such corporations and to persons designated by the underwriter were exempt
under section 4(1) of the act as transactions by an issuer not involving any public offering was false and that disclosure should have
been made in the financial statements of the contingent liability under
section 12(1) of the act resulting from the sale of the unregistered
securities.s

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Oil, Gas & Minerals, Ine., and American Investors Syndicate,
Inc.-These were consolidated proceedings relating to registration
statements filed by Oil, Gas & Minerals, Inc. ("OGM") and American Investors Syndicate, Inc. ("American"), both Louisiana corporations. The facts were stipulated and the registrants consented to the
issuance of stop orders,"
OG~rs principal assets consisted of a one twenty-fourth working
interest in a Louisiana oil field and a plot of land located in New
Orleans, La. American was organized to build and operate an apartment hotel, and its chief asset was approximately $32,000 in cash.
OGM leased the New Orleans property to American as the site for
the planned apartment hotel. James A. and Joseph D. Lindsay were
directors, officers and shareholders of both companies and together
owned the Lindsay Securities Corp., the underwriter for both proposed
issues. American proposed to issue 600,000shares of 10 cent par value
common stock and 200,000 shares of $9 stated value convertible preferred stock for a total offering price of $2,400,000,to be offered in
units of 3 shares of common stock and 1 share of preferred stock at
a price of $12 per unit. The registration statement of OGM covered
260,000 shares of 35 cent par common stock at an offering price of
$2 per share or a total of $520,000.
The description of properties of both corporations was found to be
deficient in various respects. For example, there was a failure to
disclose that the St. Charles Avenue property which American described as an excellent site for an apartment hotel located in an exclusive and highly restricted neighborhood, was in a neighborhood
whose residential quality is deteriorating. The prospectus also failed
to disclose that American was formed by OGM's promoters, that the
$2 million estimated cost of construction and 1 year estimated construction period were not based on any detailed plans or construction
arrangements and that American's management had had no experience in the construction or operation of an apartment hotel. OGM's
prospectus failed to describe the proposed apartment hotel and to
disclose that American lacked the resources to construct it.
There was a failure to disclose the fact that the underwriter was
organized by the promoters of the two registrants for the purpose of
distributing the shares of OGM and American, and the cover page of
both prospectuses failed to state that the underwriting arrangements
were on a "best efforts" basis and that there was, therefore, no assurance that all or any of the proceeds mentioned would be received.
The financial statements contained in the registration statements
were certified by an accounting firm which participated in the keeping
of the corporate books and, therefore, was not independent. The

financial statements of OGM also did not comply with regulation
S-X under the act in that they did not present information in the
manner required nor include specified schedules with respect to, among
other things, intangible assets, capital, profit and loss, depreciation
and amortization.
American's prospectus failed to include a clear summarization of
the speculative features of its business, including the facts that
the Company was relying upon the receipts from the issue to
provide the funds for the construction of the proposed apartment
hotel; that the company would need net earnings after taxes of
$108,000 to meet the annual 6-percent cumulative requirements of the
200,000 shares of preferred stock proposed to be issued and that the
company presently had no assets or operations which could provide
such earnings; that although the offering price of the common stock
was $1 per share, the book value of the company's common stock
was 20 cents per share, stock was sold to the organizers at 10 cents
per share and shares were recently offered to the public at 50 cents
per share; and that OGM, the lessor of the site on which the apartment building was to be constructed, was depending on the receipts
from its proposed offering to retire a $125,000 mortgage on the leased
property.
The prospectus of OGM failed to include a clear summarization
of the speculative features of OGM's business and securities, and failed
to disclose, among other things, that the company had operated at a
loss since its inception, that it had an operating deficit of $24,297 and
that past dividends represented a return of capital; that the proposed
offering price for the OGM stock of $2 per share was arbitrarily determined, that the company's stock had a book value of 67 cents per
share and that shares of the company's common stock had recently
been offered to the public at $1 per share; that before the shares could
be resold by the purchasers to anyone else they had to be offered to the
company and other shareholders at their book value, which would
amount to $1.30 per share if all of the offered shares were sold at $2
per share, and that such restriction could result in substantial loss to
an investor desiring to sell his shares; and that the company had a
contingent liability of $166,800 to purchasers of 68,000 shares which
were sold without having been registered under the act and to purchasers of 101,800 shares which were sold by means of an inaccurate
and inadequate offering circular under regulation A.
Skiatron Electronics and Television Corp.-This
registration
statement covered a proposed secondary distribution of 172,242 shares
of registrant's 10 cent par value common stock, of which 75,000 shares
had been issued to Matthew M. Fox, registrant's licensee; 50,000
shares were covered by warrants owned by Fox; 30,000 shares were

38

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

owned by Arthur Levey, registrant's president, and 17,242 shares had
been issued to employees, directors or persons who had performed
services for the company. In the course of the hearing, certain facts
were stipulated and the registrant consented to the issuance of a stop
order."
The registrant, a New York corporation, was organized in 1948
by Levey, to engage in research and development in the field of
electronics. In 1950 registrant began efforts to develop a subscription or pay television system. Lacking the resources for the development and operation of such a system, registrant entered into
agreement with Fox whereby Fox or his assignee, Skiatron of
America Inc., a corporation controlled by him, became the exclusive
licensee of the registrant's system. Fox assumed responsibility for
the commercial development and exploitation of the system including
the necessary development and industrial engineering, the determination of the acceptability and feasibility of the system, and arrangements for programing.
The prospectus stated that the registrant's licensee was planning
for the immediate use of its subscription television system by means
of wire or close-circuit operations and that if existing negotiations
with owners of outstanding entertainment and with municipalities and
public utilities whose facilities might be required for such operation
progressed favorably, the licensee anticipated that it would commence
commercial operations during the early part of 1960. The Commission found that there was no basis for this representation. Contracts
for the manufacture of equipment and other arrangements remained
to be secured. The prospectus was materially misleading in failing
adequately to disclose the financial and other difficulties to be met before the registrant's system could be placed in operation. Among
other things, the registration statement failed to show the large
amounts of capital needed to establish the proposed subscription
television system and defray programing costs ami to point out
that neither the registrant nor its licensee possessed the resources required and neither had access to sources able and \filling to supply
the amounts necessary. Registrant's principal asset was the right to
receive royalties under the licensing agreement with Fox. Fox and
his company were deeply in debt; debts of at least $1 million had
been reduced to judgments and Fox had further debts of approximately $3 million, a substantial portion of which was in default.
The prospectus stated that the registrant owned a number of United
States and foreign patents and patent applications and that its patent
coverage included the Skiatron "Subscriber-Vision" television systems. This representation was materially misleading since the outâ€¢ Securities Act Release No. 4282 (Oct. 3, 1960).

TWENTY -SEVENTH ANNUAL REPORT

39

standing patents of the registrant were not essential to the operation
of either its over-the-air or wire system.
The prospectus was materially misleading in view of the failure to
disclose that Fox pledged 70,000 of the 75,000 shares purchased by him
and that many of such shares had been sold to the public before the
registration statement was filed. Fox had previously disposed of
195,000 warrants which he had received from registrant in 1954
in connection with the licensee agreements. By December 1958 all
195,000 warrants had been exercised and all of the shares sold to the
public. In addition, Fox disposed of 206,000 shares of registrant's
stock which were loaned to him by Levey for the specific purpose of
collateralizing loans negotiated by Fox. The Commission found that
at least a part of the shares referred to above were sold in violation
of section 5 of the act. Such sales created a contingent liability under
section 12(1) of the act which should have been disclosed in the
registration statement.
The registration statement was materially deficient in purporting to
cover shares which had already been sold to the public. Besides the
shares issued to Fox, which had been sold, a substantial portion of the
shares issued to officers, directors and creditors, had also been sold by
them prior to the filing of the registration statement. None of these
shares should have been included in view of the provisions of section
6 (a) of the act limiting the effectiveness of a registration statement to
securities "proposed to be offered."
Levey, the promoter and organizer of the registrant, also disposed
of large blocks of stock to the public without registering such stock
under the act. Although he claimed exemptions from registration
under section 4(1) of the act and rule ]54, the Commission found that
neither of these exemptions was available. The registration statement
should have disclosed that Levey had been distributing shares of the
company without registration as required by the act and the contingent liability under section 12(1) of the act resulting therefrom.
EXAMINATIONS

AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized by section 8 (e) of the act to make
an examination in order to determine whether a stop order proceeding
should be instituted under section 8(d). For this purpose the Commission is empowered to subpoena witnesses and require the production
of pertinent documents. The Commission is also authorized by section 20(a) of the act to make an investigation to determine whether
any provision of the act or of any rule or regulation prescribed thereunder has been or is about to be violated. Investigations are instituted
under this section as an expeditious means of determining whether a
registration statement is false or misleading or omits to state any

EXEMPTION FROM REGISTRATION OF SMALL ISSUES

Under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, the Commission is empowered to exempt, by its rules and regulations and subject to such
terms and conditions as it may prescribe therein, any class of securities
from registration under the act, if it finds that the enforcement of the
registration provisions of the act with respect to such securities is not
necessary in the public interest and for the protection of investors by
reason of the small amount involved or the limited character of the
public offering. The statute imposes a maximum limitation of $300,000
upon the size of the issues which may be exempted by the Commission
in the exercise of this power.
Acting under this authority the Commission has adopted the following exemptive rules and regulations:
Rule 234: Exemption of first lien notes.
Rule 235: Exemption of securities of cooperative housing corporations.
Regulation A: General exemption for United States and Canadian issues
up to $300,000.
Regulation B: Exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas
rights up to $100,000.
Regulation F: Exemption for assessments on assessable stock and for
assessable stock offered or sold to realize the amount of the assessment
thereon.

Under section 3 (c) of the Securities Act, which was added by section 307(a) of the Small Business Investment Act of 1958, the Commission is authorized to adopt rules and regulations exempting securities issued by a company which is operating or proposes to operate as
a small business investment company under the Small Business Investment Act. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission has
adopted a regulation E which exempts upon certain terms and conditions limited amounts of securities issued by any small business
investment company which is registered under the Investment COIDpany Act of 1940. This regulation is substantially similar to the one
provided by regulation A adopted under section 3 (b) of the act.

TWENTY -SEVENTH

Exemption from registration under section 3 (b) or 3 (c) of the act
does not carry any exemption from the civil liabilities for false and

from the criminal liabilities for fraud imposed upon any person by
section 17 of the act.
Exempt

Offerings

Under Regulation

A

The Commission's regulation A implements section 3 (b) of the
Securities Act of 1933and permits a company to obtain needed capital
not in excess of $300,000 (including underwriting commissions) in any
one year from a public offering of its securities without registration,
if the company complies with the regulation. Upon complying with
the regulation a company is exempt from the registration provisions
of the act. A regulation A filing consists of a notification supplying
basic information about the company, certain exhibits, and an offering
circular which is required to be used in offering the securities. However, in the case of a company with an earnings history which is making an offering not in excess of $50,000 an offering circular need not
be used. A notification is filed with the regional officeof the Commission in the region in which the company has its principal place of
business.
During the 1961 fiscal year, 1,057 notifications were filed under
regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $239,920,549,compared
with 1,049 notifications covering proposed offerings of $224:,913,982
in the 1960 fiscal year. Included in the 1961total were 28 notifications
covering stock offerings of $5,956,350 with respect to companies engaged in the exploratory oil and gas business and 28 notifications
covering offerings of $5,555,084by mining companies.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

Most of the offerings which were underwritten were made by commercial underwriters, who participated in 511 offerings in 1961, 398
offerings in 1960, and 251 offerings in 1959. The remaining cases
where commissions were paid were handled by officers, directors, or
other persons not regularly engaged in the securities business.
Suspension of Exemption

Regulation A provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder where, in general, the exemption is sought for securities for
which the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is
not made in accordance with the terms and conditions of the regulation or in accordance with prescribed disclosure standards. Following
the issuance of a temporary suspension order by the Commission, the
respondents may request a hearing to determine whether the temporary suspension should be vacated or made permanent. If no
hearing is requested within 30 days after the entry of the temporary
suspension order and none is ordered by the Commission on its own
motion, the temporary suspension order becomes permanent.
During the 1961 fiscal year, temporary suspension orders under regulation A were issued in 54 cases. These cases together with 29 cases
pending at the beginning of the fiscal year resulted in a total of 83
cases for disposition. Of these 83 cases, 55 became permanent: 35 by
lapse of time, 15 by withdrawal of the request for hearing, and 5 after
hearing, leaving 28 cases pending at the end of the fiscal year.
Several of the above cases are summarized below to illustrate the
type of misrepresentations and other noncompliance with the regulation which led to the issuance of suspension orders.
American Television and Radio Co.-The issuer's offering circular
was materially misleading in stating that the company believed it
was recognized as one of the world's leaders in the manufacture of
vibrators, which transform direct electrical current to alternating
current, and that its market position in this field was equal to that
of its competitors, and in failing to disclose the drastic inroads in the
vibrator market made by transistor auto radios, and that the market
for vibrators has substantially declined in recent years. The offering circular was also misleading in describing the vibrator as essentially a transistor device when in fact there is no similarity between
vibrators and transistors. A method employed by the company of
merchandising from factory directly to TV technician to consumer,
described in the offering circular as "unique," was in fact not unique
and had been unsuccessful.
A statement in the offering circular that approximately $120,000
of the net proceeds of the $300,000 offering would be used to reduce
the company's short-term indebtedness and that the balance would

T~ENTY-SEVENTH ~AL

REPORT

43

be added to working capital was found to be misleading in failing
to disclose the more specific uses which the company intended to
make of the proceeds, including increase of vibrator production facilities and inventory, hiring trained personnel, and entering the stereophonic high fidelity field. The offering circular was also found deficient in failing to disclose clearly the dilution of the equity of public
security holders resulting from offering the securities at a price considerably in excess of book value.
The Commission further found that the company had used certain
types of publicity not permitted by regulation A and not filed with
the Commission, had failed to use the offering circular in the offer
and sale of its securities, and had not set forth in the notification the
names of all of the States in which the securities were to be offered or
the name of the underwriter,"
Committee Oil Co.-According to the Commission's order in this
case, the issuer's offering circular failed to disclose the source of funds
with which the company intended to pay interest and principal on the
debentures and the alternative use of proceeds should the company
fail to acquire oil and gas properties as proposed and failed to describe adequately the risks involved in the oil and gas business and
the extent to which the properties of the company were to be explored
and developed. The order also challenged the company's forecast of
profits based on conjecture, the statement that the company would pay
all direct sales costs and certain other expenses when in fact no funds
were available therefor, and the use of oil and gas reserve figures based
upon secondary methods although such methods had not as yet proved
successful on the properties involved."
Custer Channel Wing Corp.-The Commission's order alleged that
the offering circular in this case contained misrepresentations in regard to the development, manufacture and marketing of aircraft
embodying a "new" wing design. Although the design had been proposed and under development since 1940, the company failed to disclose the history of such development in reasonable detail, to indicate
that during the 15-year period the proposed aircraft has been under
development by Custer, its predecessors and subsidiaries, sums aggregating several hundred thousand dollars were raised through the sale
of securities, or to disclose how such sums were expended and the reasons why a salable aircraft has not been fully developed. There was
a similar failure to disclose Custer's previous unsuccessful efforts to
market the aircraft and the fact that the aircraft was demonstrated
to the military and that no interest was shown or orders taken. The
patents pertaining to the wing were not described nor was it disclosed
that applications filed in 1953 and 1954 with the predecessor of the
,. Securities Act Release No. 4355 (Apr. 18. 1961).

Federal Aviation Agency were not completed and have since been
abandoned. No estimate of the amount required to secure FAA certification of the aircraft proposed to be manufactured was furnished.
Misrepresentation was also alleged with respect to statements that
the break-even point would be reached at approximately the 15th aircraft produced, that the company had "firm" orders for 20 aircraft,
and that $208,850 would be enough to commence actual manufacture
of aircraft to fill outstanding orders. There was a failure to disclose
that the market price of the class B stock was substantially lower than
the public offering price. Financial statements prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles were not included
as required."
Hermon Hanson Oil Syndicate, Inc.-The
Commission's order
stated that the offering circular did not contain accurate or adequate
disclosure with respect to the geological aspects of the issuer's properties; the fact that no oil or gas in commercial quantities had been
found within 150 miles thereof, that many dry holes have been drilled
between the syndicate's properties and the nearest commercially producing area; the speculative features of the offering, including the
fact that the $1 per share offering price was essentially an arbitrary
price having no direct relation to underlying asset values, and that
public investors would be asked to furnish the total funds required to
drill a "wildcatwell for only a 7-percent interest in the company.P
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

During the fiscal year ended J nne 30, 1961, 261 offering sheets were
filed pursuant to regulation B and were examined by the Oil and Gas
Section of the Commission's Division of Corporation Finance. During the 1960 fiscal year, 328 offering sheets were filed and during the
1959 fiscal year, 160 were filed. The following table indicates the
nature and number of Commission orders issued in connection with

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation E

Regulation E provides a conditional exemption from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933 for securities of small business
investment companies which are licensed under the Small Business
Investment Act of 1958 or which have received the preliminary
approval of the Small Business Administration and have been notified
by the Administration that they may submit an application for such
a license.
The new regulation, which is similar in many respects to the general exemption provided by regulation A, requires the filing of a
notification with the Commission and, except in the case of offerings
in excess of $50,000, the filing and use of an offering circular containing
certain specified information.
Regulation E provides for the suspension of exemption in particular cases if the Commission finds that any of the terms and conditions
of the regulation have not been met or complied with.
Two notifications were filed under regulation E during the 1961
fiscal year for offerings of securities aggregating $184:,350. Of these
two notifications, one became effective for a proposed offering of
$168,750.
The other notification was pending at the end of the
fiscal year.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation F

Regulation F provides an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act for assessments levied upon assessable stock and for
delinquent assessment sales in amounts not exceeding $300,000 in any
one year. It requires the filing of a simple notification giving brief
information with respect to the issuer, its management, principal
security holders, recent and proposed assessments and other security

46

COMMISSION

issues. The regulation requires a company to send to its stockholders, or otherwise publish, a statement of the purposes for which the
proceeds from the assessment are proposed to be used. If the issuer
should employ any other sales literature in connection with the assessment, copies of such literature must be filed with the Commission.
During the 1961 fiscal year, 41 notifications were filed under reguRegulation F notifilation F, covering assessments of $1,007,864.
cations were filed in three of the nine regional offices of the
Commission; i.e., the Denver, San Francisco, and Seattle regional
offices. Underwriters were not employed in any of the regulation F
assessments and in no case did the assessment exceed $61,000.
Regulation F provides for the suspension of an exemption thereunder, as in regulation A, where the regulation provides no exemption or where the offering is not made in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the regulation, or in accordance with prescribed
disclosure standards.
Two regulation F filings were temporarily suspended in fiscal 1961
for alleged false and misleading statements in the sales material used.
Requests for hearings were made with respect to both of these suspensions but both issuers subsequently consented to the issuance of
permanent suspension orders.
LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES Acr OF 1933

The Commission is authorized by the Securities Act to seek injunctions in cases where continued or threatened violations of the act are
indicated, including violations of the registration and antifraud provisions of the act. During the fiscal year, 28 such injunctions were obtained and 9 cases were pending at the end of the year. Certain of
these cases are described herein. Other actions in which violations of
the Securities Act are present and which also involve violations of
other statutes are described under the other statutes.
In S.E.O. v, FedeTal Shopping Way, Inc., et al.,13 the S.E.C. filed
a complaint against Federal Shopping Way, Inc., and 18 other defendants seeking an injunction against continued violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the offer and sale of
securities of defendant Federal Shopping, issued in connection with
the financing of a shopping center enterprise located at Federal Way,
Wash. It was alleged that defendants formed approximately 30
affiliated or cooperating corporations, including Federal Shopping,
and sought to create the appearance that various transactions including
property sales and rental agreements, between Federal Shopping and
others of these corporations, were arm's-length transactions when in
'" W.D. Wash., No. 2671.

TWENTY-SEVENTH

47

fact the various corporations were at all times under the domination
and control of defendant John R. Cessna and other defendants and
were formed and operated for the purpose of diverting moneys from
Federal Shopping, concealing such diversion from that company's
present and potential security holders, and deceiving such security
holders as to the original acquisition costs of property acquired by
Federal Shopping and the true income and profits being realized by
Federal Shopping from the rental and operation of such property.
The complaint further alleged that defendants were obtaining
money by means of untrue and misleading statements concerning the
asserted success of Federal Shopping and its shopping center enterprise, its net earnings, dividends, and bond interest paid and to be
paid and the source of such payments, the amount of rental income
and its source, its financial condition, and other matters.
In S.E.O. v. L- Wood Oompany, Inc.,14 the defendants had been selling investment contracts and participations in profit-sharing agreements without registration and had made material misrepresentations
concerning increases in the company's assets and the safety of an investment with the company. The defendants consented to entry of a
final judgment enjoining further violations of the act.
The Commission secured a permanent injunction by default against
all but one of the four defendants in S.E.O. v. American Equities Oorporation 15 prohibiting them from violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 in the offer and sale of
shares of that corporation. For the purpose of inducing the purchase of these securities by investors the defendants provided various
broker-dealers with false financial statements of the company and
caused various broker-dealers to enter quotations in the over-thecounter market, thus creating the appearance of an active market.
The case against Martin Benjamin, the remaining defendant, was still

In S.E.O. v, Insured Mortgage and Title Corporation; et al.,I6 the
Commission instituted an action against one of the so-called "8 percenters" which had been selling interests in Florida mortgages to investors throughout the United States. Under Insured's "Corrigan
Plan," investors were to receive 8 percent interest to be derived from
payments made by mortgagors on first mortgage deeds and notes on
Florida real estate which were purchased by Insured or its subsidiaries. The company issued its notes to investors, collateralized by the
assignment of the mortgages. Insured was to have the authority and
responsibility for processing the mortgages, selecting the particular

mortgage to be assigned to an investor, collecting payments from
mortgagors, remitting monthly payments of principal and interest to
investors, replacing the defaulted mortgages with others, or, in the
alternative, redeeming corporate notes collateralized by defaulted
mortgages, and handling all administrative details pertaining to the
mortgages.
The Commission charged that the defendants were selling various
types of securities, including evidences of indebtedness and investment
contracts, in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act. In addition, it was charged that false representations were
being made to investors and that Insured was insolvent. The parties
stipulated to the entry of a preliminary injunction which restricted
the company's operations to the State of Florida pending a trial on
the merits. Shortly thereafter, the president of Insured disappeared
and the court appointed a receiver to liquidate the corporation's
assets.
In S.E.O. v, Glass Manne Induetries, lne./7 the Commission
charged the company with violations of sections 17(a) (1), 17(a) (3),
and 24 of the Securities Act of 1933 and section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule 10b-5 thereunder. The complaint
charged that the company had made material misrepresentations
and had omitted material facts in a registration statement which became effective on July 6, 1960,covering a public offering which netted
the company approximately $458,000. The Commission alleged,
among other things, that whereas the registration statement had
stated that the proceeds of the offering would be used to promote and
expand the company's sales, in fact such proceeds had been used to
make loans to other companies. In addition, the complaint alleged
that the company had failed to disclose its plans for a possible merger,
and the fact that its production had been materially reduced by the
time the registration statement became effective. A preliminary injunction has been obtained freezing the assets of the company and
the matter is pending.
In S.E.O. v, American Sales Training Iiesearoh. Assn., lno./8 the
Commission charged the company and certain of its officers, directors
and employees with violating the registration provisions of the act.
The complaint alleged that the defendants were engaged in selling
education programs designed to educate a person while he sleeps, and
had sold "inactive distributorships" to certain investors for a stipulated sum in return for which the investor was to receive a percentage
of the profits realized by the defendants' sale of its programs. The
Commission contended that the defendants' "inactive distributor17 D. Del. No. 2276.

ships" were investment contracts. A permanent injunction was
entered by consent.
In S.E.O. v, Beverly Hills Security Investments, et ril./9 the defendants consented to the entry of permanent decrees enjoining them
from further violations of the registration and antifraud provisions
of the securities acts in the sale of securities issued in connection with
a so-called 10-percent investment program. The program was based
on the sale to the public of discounted trust deeds, mortgages, and
contracts related to real estate situated in California, Arizona, and
New Mexico.
The plan in this case was similar to that in Los Angeles TTU8t Deed
eX Mortgage Exchange, the earlier history of which is discussed in
previous annual reports. 20 Since those reports, the Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit 21 affirmed the decree of the District Court 22
which had enjoined the corporate defendants and certain of their
managing officers from violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in the
sale of securities issued under an investment plan, based on the sale
to investors of individual discounted trust deeds and mortgages. This
decision constitutes a significant judicial interpretation of the term
"investment contract." It also holds that, despite the absence of
specific statutory authority, the Commission may obtain the appointment of an equity receiver for an offender against the Federal
securities acts.
The merchandising of individual trust deeds and mortgages under
high-yield investment plans, without registration with the Commission, and often through grossly untruthful and deceitful public solicitations, had constituted a serious and growing regulatory problem.
Los Angeles Trust Deed & Mortgage Exchange alone had attracted
some $40 million from the investing public. It is now being liquidated in bankruptcy, and its promoters are under indictment. The
Commission's litigation opened up and exposed the highly speculative
nature of the investment programs offered by "10 percenters" who
lured many thousands of small investors to commit their savings and
earnings on the representation that the investment was sound, stable,
and comparatively riskless. Although California was the center for
these operations, the same basic scheme has been employed elsewhere
throughout the United States.
The collapse of the "10 percenters" created a major financial scandal
in California, and led to a sweeping investigation by a special com,e S.D. cane, No. 127-61-TC.

mittee of the State assembly, and the enactment of certain remedial
legislation. The serious nature of the problem created by the "10 percenters" and the ruinous consequences to many thousands of investors
are mirrored in the fact that six such enterprises are now in bankruptcy," one is in State court receivership," two are in the course of
reorganization under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,25and two are
subject to arrangement proceedings under chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act.26 The criminal indictments returned with respect to "10
percenters" are discussed at p. 17'0 below.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

Honigman v, Green Giant Oompany 21and Sawyer v, Pioneer Mills
00., Ltd.,28 are two cases involving the construction of the Commission's so-called "no-sale" rule.29 In the Green Giant case, the company solicited the consent of its stockholders to a plan of reorganization which would result in one class of shareholders giving up part
of their equity in return for greater voting rights, while the other
class would give up some voting rights in exchange for a larger
equity. In a stockholders' derivative action, it was alleged that
acceptance of this reorganization plan was induced by misleading
statements and omissions in the literature sent to stockholders by the
management. Management denied the misleading nature of the statements made and further asserted that no action for fraud could be
maintained under the Federal securities laws because rule 133 provides
that a reorganization is not a "sale." The Commission is participating
in this case as amicus curiae, and has filed a brief which points out that
although the transaction in question may not have been a sale within
the registration provisions of the Securities Act, rule 133 has no
application to the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.
The Commission took no position on the merits of the case.
In the Sawyer case, the Commission, as amicus curiae, took the same
view as in H onigman, with respect to allegedly false and misleading
solicitations of stockholder approval for a proposed merger. In addition, the Commission urged that a Federal court has jurisdiction to
rescind a consummated corporate transaction effected by means of

violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws.
Decisions in these cases have not yet been rendered.
In Moses and New v, Michael (consolidated}" the sellers of unregistered undivided working interests in oil and gas leases appealed
from summary judgments entered against them under section 12(1)
of the Securities Act. Among other things, the sellers argued that
they did not violate the Federal securities laws because only photostatic copies of the oil and gas assignments, rather than the assignments themselves, were sent through the mails. The Commission filed

PART V
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
OF 1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides for the registration
and regulation of securities exchanges, and the registration of securities listed on such exchanges and it establishes, for issuers of securities
so registered, financial and other reporting requirements, regulation
of proxy solicitations and requirements with respect to trading by
directors, officersand principal security holders. The act also provides
for the registration and regulation of brokers and dealers doing business in the over-the-counter market, contains provisions designed to
prevent fraudulent, deceptive and manipulative acts and practices on
the exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets and authorizes the
Federal Reserve Board to regulate the use of credit in securities transactions. The purpose of these statutory requirements is to ensure the
maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities.

Disciplinary Action

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission disciplinary actions taken against its members andmember firms for violations of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934o r of exchange rules.
During the year 7 exchanges reported 51 cases of such disciplinary
actions, including imposition of fines aggregating $30,137 in 25 cases;
the suspension of 9 individuals and the expulsion of another individual from membership; the revocation of 5 specialists' registrations
and the censure of a number of individuals and finne.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

It is unlarvful for a member of a national securities exchange or a
broker or dealer to effect any transaction in a security on such exchange
unless the security is registered on that exchange under the Securities Exchange Act or is exempt from such registration. I n general,
the act exempts from registration obligat,ions issued or guaranteed
by a State or the Federal Government or by certain subdivisions or
agencies thereof and authorizes the Commission to adopt rules and
regulations exempting such other securities as the Commission may
find necessary or appropriate to exempt in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. Under this authority the Conmission
has exempted securities of certain banks, certain securities secured by
property or leasehold interests, certain warrants and, on a tempgrary
basis, certain securities issued in substitution for or in addition to
listed securities.
Section 12 of the Exchange Act provides t h i ~an
t issuer rnay register
a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and
the exchange an application mhich discloses pertinent information
concerning the issuer and its affairs. An application requires the
furnishing of information in regard to the issuer's business, capital
structure, the terms of its securities, the persons who manage or control its affairs, t,he remuneration paid to its officers and directors, the
allotnlent of options, bonuses and profit-sharing plans, and financial
statements certified by independent accountants.
Form 10 is the form used for re.gistration by most commercial and
industrial companies. There are specialized forms for certain types
of securities, such as voting trust certificates, certificates of deposit,
and securities of foreign governments.
Section 13 requires issuers having securities registered on an exchange to file periodic reports keeping current the information furnished in the application for registration. These periodic reports
include annual reports, semiannual reports, and current reports. The
principal annual report form is form 10-K which is designed to keep
up-to-date the information furnished in form 10. Semiannual re-

AND- EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ports required to be furnished on form 9-K are devoted chiefly to
furnishing midyear financial data. Current reports on form 8-K
are required to be filed for each month in which any of certain specified events have occurred. A report on this form deals with matters
such as changes in control of the registrant, important acquisitions
or dispositions of assets, the institution or termination of important
legal proceedings and important changes in the issuer's capital securities or in the amount thereof outstanding.
Statistics Relating to Registration of Securities on Exchanges

As of June 30, 1961, a total of 2,341 issuers had 3,931 issues of
securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges, of
which 2,748 were classified as stocks and 1,183 as bonds. Of these
totals, 1,332 issuers had 1,544 stock issues and 1,124 bond issues listed
and registered on the New York Stock Exchange. Thus, 57 percent
of the issuers, 56 percent of the stock issues and 95 percent of the bond
issues were on the New York Stock Exchange.
During the 1961fiscal year, 130 issuers listed and registered securities on a national securities exchange for the first time, while the
registration of all securities of 96 issuers was terminated. The total
number of applications for registration of classes of securities on exchanges filed during the 1961fiscal year was 271.
The following table shows the number of annual, semiannual, and
current reports filed during the fiscal year by issuers having securities
listed and registered on national securities exchanges. The table also
shows the number of such reports filed under section 15(d) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 by issuers obligated to file reports
by reason of having publicly offered securities effectively registered
under the Securities Act of 1933. The securities of such issuers are
traded generally in the over-the-counter markets. As of June 30,
1961, there were 2,135 such issuers, including 350 that were also
registered as investment companies under the Investment Company
Act of 1940.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The ratio of share volume on the regional exchanges to the total
volume on the exchanges has continued to decline, as indicated below
and in the table on page 71 of our 26th annual report (1960). Dollar
volumes on the New York Stock Exchange and the regional exchanges declined proportionately during the first 6 months of 1961
in view of the unusually high showing made by the American Stock
Exchange.

Comparative Over-the-Counter Statistics

So far as can be ascertained from the standard securities manuals
and from reports to the Commission, there are about 4,000 stocks with
300 holders or more, of about 3,500 domestic companies, quoted only
in the over-the-counter market. The aggregate market value of these
stocks on December 31, 1960, was about $69 billion, or about 20 percent
of the $335.3 billion on the stock exchanges, continuing the ratio existing over recent years as mentioned in previous annual reports. Registered investment companies are excluded from this compilation, and
are referred to elsewhere in this annual report.
The $69 billion market value included $17.6 billion for bank stocks,
$12.4 billion for insurance stocks, and $39 billion for industrial, utility,
and other miscellaneous stocks.
The largest number of stockholders reported for an over-the-counter
stock was "over 200,000" for the Bank of America NT & SA. Over
25,000 stockholders each were reported for 20 stocks of companies including 7 banks, 8 utilities, 2 insurance, and 3 others. The following

ANNUAL REPORT

The most usual number of stockholders for an actively quoted overthe-counter stock appears to be in a range from 1,000 to 3,000.
In addition to the stocks mentioned above, there is a large and
rapidly growing number of actively quoted stocks of companies so
small as not to require continuous reporting to the Commission, and
whose coverage by the standard securities manuals is generally limited
to brief announcements of the circumstances of the offerings. At the
close of 1959, there were at least 500 actively quoted stocks of companies not reporting to this Commission nor presented in substantial
detail by the standard securities manuals. The number has since increased substantially.
While the aggregate dollar value of these
stocks will add comparatively little to the figures in billions of dollars
shown in our $69 billion compilation, the stocks have been of intense
interest to many thousands of stockholders. Fragmentary figures indicate that even a small new offering may come to have at least 500
stockholders, running, in numerous instances, into 1,000 or 2,000, and
sometimes more.
A comprehensive view of the number of securities quoted over the
counter and at anyone time is afforded by data supplied by the National Quotation Bureau, which is the principal purveyor of overthe-counter quotations in the United States. The following table
shows the number of stocks quoted in recent years and the corresponding number of dealer listings in the aggregate.

The dealer listings average about four per issue, but tend to cluster
in stocks of greatest current interest. About 3,500 of the stocks show
substantial concentrations of dealer listings, including both bids and
offers. Many of the remainder are quoted only on the bid side, generally indicating attempts either to create and expand markets for
closely held stocks or to reduce and extinguish residues from offers
in exchange following upon mergers, sales of assets, etc.
Much of the increase in number of stocks and dealer listings shown
in the table above is accounted for by hundreds of new offerings so
small in size that the financial affairs of the companies involved are
shown neither in the standard securities manuals nor in continuing
reports to this Commission.

Reporting Under Section 15(d)

Issuers reporting pursuant to section 15(d) of the Securities Exchange Act continue to increase in number, as shown in appendix table
19 of our 25th annual report. Commencing with 80 as of June 30,
1937,they reached 1,014 in number 16 years later, in 1953. They then
more than doubled to 2,135 in the 6 years to June 30, 1961. The 2,017
such reporting issuers as of December 31, 1960, included 1,353 having
$31.3 billion aggregate market value of outstanding stocks. The
remaining 664 issuers included partnerships, voting trusts duplicative
of listed shares, stock purchase and employees' savings plans, companies with only bonds in public hands, registered investment companies, and numerous issuers for whose shares no quotation was
available, including a considerable number registering in 1960 but
not offering their shares until 1961.

Applications may be made to the Commission by exchanges to
strike any securities or by issuers to withdraw their securities from
listing and registration on exchanges pursuant to rule 12d2-1(b)
under section 12(d) of the Securities Exchange Act.
During the fiscal year ended June 30,1961, the Commission granted
applications by exchanges and issuers to remove 51 stock issues and
13 bond issues from listing and registration pursuant to rule 12d21(b). There were 53 stock removals, since 2 stocks delisted by the New
York Stock Exchange were also delisted by the Midwest Stock Exchange. The number of issuers involved was 50. The removals were

In accordance with the practice developed in recent years, nearly
all of the delisting applications were filed by exchanges, only two
of the applications having been filed by issuers. Many of the applications were filed by the New York Stock Exchange pursuant to its
program of delisting securities which no longer meet its standards
for continued listing.
During the fiscal year, the Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Pacific Coast
stock exchanges adopted rules providing that an issuer intending to
delist may be required to obtain a vote of its stockholders before
filing an application with the Commission. This brings the number
of exchanges protected by their own delisting rules to 10, being all
except one of the principal registered exchanges.
Delisting Proceedings Under Section 19(a)

Section 19(a) (2) authorizes the Commission to suspend for a period
not exceeding 12 months, or to withdraw, the registration of a security
on a national securities exchange if, in its opinion, such action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and, after notice
and opportunity for hearing, the Commission finds that the issuer

of the security has failed to comply with any provision of the act
or the rules and regulations thereunder. The following table indicates

Section 19(a) (4) authorizes the Commission summarily to suspend
trading in any registered security on a national securities exchange for
a period not exceeding 10 days if, in its opinion, such action is necessary or appropriate for the protection of investors and the public
interest so requires. The Commission has used this power infrequently
in the past. However, during the 1961 fiscal year the Commission
found it necessary and appropriate in four instances to use its authority summarily to suspend trading in securities registered on a national
securities exchange. Three of these suspensions remained in effect
at the end of the fiscal year.
The only case in which an order was issued under section 19(a) (2)
during the fiscal year withdrawing securities from registration on a
national securities exchange is described below.
Cornucopia Gold Mines.-Registrant,
a corporation organized in
the State of 1Vashington in 1930, registered its common stock on the
American Stock Exchange in 1939. It ceased mining operations in
1941 and remained inactive until May 1957. At that time, control of
the company passed to a group of individuals, including Earl Belle.
The Commission instituted proceedings under section 19(a) (2) of
the act to determine whether it was necessary or appropriate for the
protection of investors to suspend or withdraw the common stock
from registration on the exchange for failure to comply with section
13 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the rules thereunder
governing the filing of reports with the Commission and for filing
with the Commission proxy material which was false and misleading
and failed to comply with the requirements of the Commission's
proxy rules.
The Commission found the registrant's 1957 annual report to be
false and misleading in a number of respects. The financial statements which purported to be certified by independent certified public
accountants were, in fact, prepared and certified by an individual
accountant who had made no audit of, nor had he even seen, the

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

63

registrant's books and records. The statements he certified were
copied, with some figure and wording changes, from statements prepared by another accountant. The financial statements furnished
were false and misleading in a number of respects including, among
other things, inclusion as cash at December 31, 1957, of the proceeds
of a loan of $125,000 made on January 20, 1958, the failure to reveal
certain contingent liabilities, and to set forth the basis for determining
the amounts at which buildings and equipment were listed as assets.
The annual report was 'also deficient in failing to indicate important changes in the business of the registrant and in stating that
certain individuals had been directors of the registrant when, in fact,
they had never consented to act as such and were not aware that they
had been "elected" to that office.
The Commission also found that the registrant had failed to file
current reports pursuant to section 13 of the act to report the acquisition of certain subsidiaries, to describe certain legal proceedings
with respect to one of its subsidiaries and to reflect a change in control
of the registrant from the group referred to above to Earl Belle.
The Commission further found that the preliminary proxy material
filed by the registrant with respect to a proposed meeting of stockholders in July 1958 contained false and misleading statements and
omitted necessary information. For example, it gave the misleading
impression that the registrant's program for the acquisition of subsidiaries was completed and that only stockholder ratification was
being sought whereas, in fact, stockholder approval of certain capital
changes was essential in order to enable the registrant to be in a position to meet its commitments to issue large blocks of stock necessary
to complete the acquisitions. The proxy material was also false and
misleading in failing to disclose adequately and accurately certain
transactions by the registrant and its affiliates. Information with
respect to remuneration paid by the registrant was also found to be
materially misleading.
On the basis of these and numerous other deficiencies the Commission issued an order withdrawing the registrant's common stock from
registration on the American Stock Exchange, which had suspended
trading in the stock prior to the commencement of the Commission
proceedings.'
UNLISTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES

Stocks with only unlisted trading privileges on the exchanges continued to decline in number, falling from 232 on June 30, 1960, to 212
on June 30,1961. For comparison, it may be recalled that such stocks

, ExcIudmg duplications with respect to 5 common stocks also traded unlisted on the American Stock
Exchange.

About $5 billion of the $13 billion aggregate was of 55 stocks of
companies reporting as fully as though they were listed, by reason of
registrations under the Securities Act, or the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, or the Investment Company Act, or because the companies in some cases had other securities listed on registered exchanges.
About $4 billion of the $13 billion aggregate was of 63 Canadian
and other foreign stocks and American Depositary Receipts for foreign shares, of companies not reporting to the Commission.
About $4 billion of the $13 billion aggregate was of 97 stocks of
domestic companies not reporting to the Commission. More than half
of this $4 billion was held by Standard Oil Co. (New Jersey) in shares
of Creole Petroleum Corp.
The $13 billion unlisted aggregate presents a sharp reduction from
a peak of $22.4 billion on December 31, 1956. About two-thirds of
the $9.4 billion reduction was occasioned by removal from the American Stock Exchange to listing on the New York Stock Exchange of
Great Atlantic & Pacific Tea Co., Inc., and Singer Manufacturing Co.
stocks and by absorption of Humble Oil & Refining Co., International
Petroleum Co., Ltd., and United States Foil Co. into companies whose
stocks are listed on the New York Stock Exchange. At the close of
the fiscal year, listings on the New York Stock Exchange of Duke
Power Co. and Electric Bond & Share Co. stocks, involving a further
$0.7 billion loss to the American Stock Exchange unlisted section,
were in process.
The reported volume of trading on the exchanges in stocks with
only unlisted trading privileges thereon, for the calendar year 1960,
was about 30,900,000 shares or about 2.2 percent of the total share

TWENTY-SEVENTH

65

ANNUAL REPORT

volume on all the exchanges. About 82.6 percent of this volume was
on the American Stock Exchange, 16.4 percent was on the Pacific
Coast Stock Exchange, and four other regional exchanges contributed
the remaining 1 percent. The share volume in stocks with only unlisted trading privileges was about 8.5 percent of the total share volume on the American Stock Exchange and about 11.7 percent of that
on the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange in the calendar year 1960.
Unlisted trading privileges on some exchanges in stocks listed on
other exchanges remained at 1,538, there being 55 additions and
55 removals during the year. The reported volume of unlisted trading
on the exchanges in these stocks, for the calendar year 1960, was
close to 45 million shares. About one-fifth of this volume was on
the American Stock Exchange in stocks listed on regional exchanges,
and about four-fifths was on regional exchanges in stocks listed on
the New York or American Stock Exchange. The number of unlisted trading privileges is greater than the number of stocks involved,
since leading New York listings are traded unlisted on as many
as seven regional exchanges. While the 45 million shares amounted
to only about 3.2 percent of the total share volume on all the
exchanges, it constituted substantial portions of the share volumes on
the leading regional exchanges, reaching about 77 percent on Boston,
72 percent on Philadelphia-Baltimore,
64 percent on Cincinnati,
55 percent on Pittsburgh, 47 percent on Detroit, 32 percent on
Midwest, and 21 percent on Pacific Coast Stock Exchange.
Appendix tables 7 and 8 of this annual report show the dispersion
of stocks and share volumes among the exchanges.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Applications by exchanges for unlisted trading privileges in stocks
listed on other exchanges, made pursuant to rule 12f-1 under section 12(f) of the Securities Exchange Act, were granted by the

BWCK. DISTRIBUTIONS REPORTED BY EXCHANGES

The usual method of distributing blocks of listed securities considered too large :for the auction market on the floor of an exchange
is to resort to "secondary distributions" over the counter after the
close of exchange trading.
In an effort to keep as much as possible of this business on their
floors, special offering plans were adopted by leading exchanges commencing in 1942, and the somewhat more flexible exchange distribution plans commencing in 1953. The plans, declared effective by this
Commission, include an exemption from the antimanipulative rule
10b-2, as set forth in paragraph (d) thereof, with respect to payment
of compensation in connection with the distribution of securities.
The largest number of special offerings was 87 in 1944, with $32,454,000 aggregate value. The number has declined through the years,
there being only three in 1960, aggregating $5,439,000.
Similarly, the largest number of exchange distributions was 57 in
1954, with $24,664,000 aggregate value, compared with 20 in 1960,
aggregating $11,108,000.
Secondary distributions, as reported, averaged 89 in number and
about $139,000,000in amount during the 12 years 1942-53 inclusive,
rising to 115 in number and about $433,200,000 in amount as the
average over the 7 years 1954-60 inclusive.
During the 6 months ending June 30, 1961, there were no special
offerings, 18 exchange distributions aggregating $38,743,000, and 58
secondary distributions aggregating $559,921,000. This last amount
was larger than the $424,688,000secondary distributions during the
entire year 1960, and was also larger than the $455,764,000in the first
half and the $366,572,000in the second half of 1959.

STUDY OF PUT AND CALL OPTIONS

During the fiscal year, the Division of Trading and Exchanges
completed a study of put and call options and reported the results
to the Commission. The study was undertaken at the direction of
the Commission in May 1959 to enable the Commission to carry out
its statutory responsibilities under the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, sections 9 (b) and (c) of which empower the Commission to
impose rules and regulations on dealings in puts and calls if it deems
necessary.
The study was one of several reviews of option trading made from
time to time but was more comprehensive in scope than previous
studies. It was based chiefly on replies to questionnaires, covering
options outstanding or sold during June 1959,by put and call brokers
and dealers and by New York Stock Exchange member firms which
endorse or guarantee puts and calls.
A report of the study, which has been published under the title
"Report on Put and Call Options," provides for the first time detailed
statistical information on the size and nature of the put and call
market. It includes data on the proportion of options which were
exercised and on the net return to option holders.
MANIPULATION AND STABIUZATION
Manipulation

The Exchange Act describes and prohibits certain forms of manipulative activity in any security registered on a national securities
exchange. The prohibited activities include wash sales and matched
orders effected for the purpose of creating a false or misleading appearance of trading activity in, or with respect to the market for,
any such security; a series of transactions in which the price of such
security is raised or depressed, or in which actual or apparent active
trading is created for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales of
such security by others; circulation by a broker, dealer, seller, or
buyer, or by a person who receives consideration from a broker,
dealer, seller, or buyer, of information concerning market operations
conducted for a rise or a decline in the price of such security; and
the making of any false and misleading statement of material information by a broker, dealer, seller, or buyer regarding such security
for the purpose of inducing purchases or sales. The act also empowers the Commission to adopt rules and regulations to define and
prohibit the use of these and other forms of manipulative activity in
any security registered on an exchange or traded over the counter.
The Commission's market surveillance staff in its Division of Trading and Exchanges in Washington and in its New York regional
office and other field offices observes the tickertape quotations of
securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange and on the Amer-

68

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

CO:MMISSION

ican Stock Exchange, the sales and quotation sheets of the various
regional exchanges, and the bid and asked prices published by the National Daily Quotation Service for about 6,000 unlisted securities to
observe any unusual or unexplained price variations or market activity. The financial news ticker, leading newspapers, and various
financial publications and statistical services are also closely followed.
VVhenunusual or unexplained market activity in a security is observed, all known information regarding the security is examined and
a decision made as to the necessity for an investigation. Most investigations are not made public so that no unfair reflection will be
cast on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not be
upset. These investigations, which are conducted by the Commission's
regional offices, take two forms. A preliminary investigation or
"quiz" is designed to rapidly discover evidence of unlawful activity.
If no violations are found, the preliminary investigation is closed.
If it appears that more intensive investigation is necessary, a formal
order of investigation, which carries with it the right to issue subpoenas and to take testimony under oath, is issued by the Commission.
If violations by a broker-dealer are discovered, the Commission may
institute administrative proceedings to determine whether or not to
revoke his registration or to suspend or expel him from membership
in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., or from a national securities exchange. The Commission may also seek an injunction against any person violating the act and it may refer information obtained in its investigation to the Department of Justice
recommending that persons violating the act be criminally prosecuted.
In some cases, where State action seems likely to bring quick results
in preventing fraud or where Federal jurisdiction may be doubtful,
the information obtained may be referred to State agencies for State
injunction or criminal prosecution.
The following table shows the number of quizzes and formal investigations pending at the beginning of fiscal 1961,the number initiated in fiscal 1961, the number closed or completed during the same
period, and the number pending at the end of the fiscal year:

ANNUAL REPORT

69

When securities are to be offered to the public, their markets are
watched very closely to make sure that the price is not unlawfully
raised prior to or during the distribution. Registered offerings numbering 1,507, having a value of over $19 billion, and 1,057 offerings
exempt under section 3 (b) of the Securities Act, having a value of
about $239 million, were so observed during the fiscal year. Other
offerings numbering 223, such as secondary distributions and distributions of securities under special plans filed by the exchanges, having
a total value of $485 million, were also kept under surveillance.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open-market purchases of securities to prevent or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a
distribution.
It is permitted by the Exchange Act subject to the
restrictions provided by the Commission's rules 10b--6, 7, and 8.
These rules are designed to confine stabilizing activity to that necessary for the above purpose, to require proper disclosure and to
prevent unlawful manipulation.
During 1961 stabilizing was effected in connection with stock offerings totalling 45,024,882 shares having an aggregate public offering
price of $1,271,512,178and bond offerings having a total offering price
of $255,587,250. In these offerings, stabilizing transactions resulted
in the purchase of 1,052,186 shares of stock at a cost of $25,015,006
and bonds at a cost of $2,389,262. In connection with the stabilizing
transactions, 7,743 stabilizing reports showing purchases and sales
of securities effected by persons conducting the distribution were
received and examined during the fiscal year.
INSIDERS' SECURITY HOLDINGS AND TRANSACTIONS

Section 16 of the act is designed to prevent the unfair use of information by directors, officers and principal stockholders by giving
publicity to their security holdings and transactions and by removing
the profit incentive in short-term trading by them in securities of
their company. Such persons by virtue of their position may have
knowledge of the company's condition and prospects which is unavailable to the general public and may be able to use such information
to their personal advantage in transactions in the company's securities. Provisions similar to those contained in section 16 of the act
are also contained in section 17 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 and section 30 of the Investment Company Act of
1940.
Ownership Reports

Section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act requires every person who is a direct or indirect beneficial owner of more than 10 per-

70

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

cent of any class of equity securities (other than exempted securities)
which is registered on a national securities exchange, or who is a
director or officer of the issuer of such securities, to file reports with
the Commission and the exchange disclosing his ownership of the
issuer's equity securities. This information must be kept current by
filing subsequent reports for any month in which a change in his
ownership occurs. Similar reports are required by section 17(a) of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of officers and directors of
public utility holding companies and by section 30(f) of the Investment Company Act of officers, directors, principal security
holders, members of advisory boards and investment advisers or
affiliated persons of investment advisers of registered closed-end
investment companies.
All ownership reports are available for public inspection as soon as
they are filed at the Commission's office in Washington and reports
filed pursuant to section 16(a) of the Securities Exchange Act may
also be inspected at the exchanges where copies of such reports are
filed. In addition, for the purpose of making the reported information available to interested persons who may not be able to inspect the
reports in person, the Commission summarizes and publishes such
information in a monthly "Official Summary of Security Transactions
and Holdings", which is distributed by the Government Printing
Office on a subscription basis. Such subscriptions to this publication
exceeded 16,000 as of .Iune 30, 1961.
During the fiscal year, 40,869 ownership reports were filed, as compared with 38,821 reports filed during the 1960 fiscal year. The following table shows the number of reports filed under each of the three
acts under which such reports are required.

Recovery of Short-Swing Trading Profits by Issuer

In order to prevent insiders from making unfair use of information
which may have been obtained by reason of their relationship with a
company, section 16(b) of the Securities Exchange Act, section 17(b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and section 30(f) of the
Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of
the issuer of any profit realized by insiders from certain purchases and
sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within any
period of less than 6 months. The Commission has certain exemptive
powers with respect to transactions not comprehended within the pur-

pose of these provisions, but is not charged with the enforcement of
the civil remedies created thereby.
REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under sections 14(a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12(e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20(a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, the Commission has adopted regulation 14 requiring the disclosure in a proxy statement of pertinent
information in connection with the solicitation of proxies, consents,
and authorizations in respect of securities of companies subject to
those statutes. The regulation includes provisions that when the
management is soliciting proxies, any security holder desiring to
communicate with other security holders for a proper purpose may
require the management to furnish him with a list of all security
holders or to mail his communication to security holders for him. A
security holder may also, subject to reasonable prescribed limitations,
require the management to include in its proxy material any appropriate proposal which such security holder desires to submit to a vote
of security holders. Any security holder or group of security holders
may at any time make an independent proxy solicitation upon compliance with the proxy rules, whether or not the management is making a solicitation.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminary form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosure
standards, the management or other groups responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to avoid such
defects in the preparation of the proxy material in the definitive form
inwhich it is furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the 1961 fiscal year, 2,197 proxy statements in definitive form
were filed under the Commission's regulation 14 for the solicitation of
proxies of security holders; 2,169 of these were filed by management
and 28 by nonmanagement groups or individual stockholders. These
2,197 solicitations related to 1,974 companies, some 200 of which had
more than 1 solicitation during the year, generally for a special meeting not involving the election of directors.
There were 1,966 solicitations of proxies for the election of directors,
217 for special meetings not involving the election of directors, and
14 for assents and authorizations for action not involving a meeting
of security holders or the election of directors.
In addition to the election of directors, the decisions of security
holders were sought through the solicitation in the 1961 fiscal year

Stockholders' Proposals

During the 1961 fiscal year, 48 stockholders submitted a total of 198
proposals which were included in the 127 proxy statements of 127
companies under rule 14a-8 of regulation 14.
Typical of such stockholder proposals submitted to a vote of security
holders were resolutions relating to amendments to charters or bylaws
to provide for cumulative voting for the election of directors, limitations on granting stock options and their exercise by key employees
and management groups, sending a postmeeting report to all stockholders, changing the place of the annual meeting of stockholders, and
the approval by stockholders of management's selection of independent
auditors.
The managements of 27 companies omitted from their proxy statements under the Commission's rule 14a-8 a total of 55 additional proposals submitted by 31 individual stockholders. The principal reasons for such omissions and the numbers of times each such reason
was involved (counting only one reason for omission for each proposal even though it may have been omitted under more than one
provision of rule 14a-8) were as follows:
(a) 20 proposals were not a proper subject matter under State
law;
(b) 9 proposals concerned a personal grievance against the
company;
(c) 8 proposals related to the ordinary conduct of the company's business;
(d) 6 proposals were not timely submitted;
(e) 2 proposals and reasons therefor were deemed misleading
or impugned character;
(f) 1 proposal involved the election of directors; and
(g) 9 proposals were withdrawn by the stockholders.

Ratio of Soliciting to Nonsolicitin,. C mpanies

Of the 2,341 issuers th ..t had sec .rrities listed and registered on
national securities exchanges as of June 30, 1961, 2,097 had voting
securities so listed and registered.
Of these 2,097 issuers, 30 listed and
registered voting securities for the first time after their annual stockholders' meeting in fiscal 1961; thus, of the remaining 2,067 issuers
with voting securities, 1,680, or 81 percent, solicited proxies under the
Commission's proxy rules during the 1961 fiscal year for the election
of directors.
Proxy Contests

During the 1961 fiscal year, 32 companies were involved in proxy
contests for the election of directors.
A total of 463 persons, both
management and nonmanagement, filed detailed statements as participants under the requirements of rule 14a-11. Proxy statements in 20
cases involved contests for control of the board of directors and those
in 12 cases involved contests for representation on the board.
Management retained control in 9 of the 20 contests for control of
the board of directors, 3 were settled by negotiation, nonmanagement
persons won 2, and 6 were pending as of June 30, 1961. Of the 12
cases where representation on the board of directors was involved,
management retained all places on the board in 10 cases and there were
2 cases pending as of June 30, 1961.
INVESTIGATIONS

Section 21 (a) of the act authorizes the Commission to make such
investigations as it deems necessary to determine whether any person
has violated or is about to violate any provision of the act or any
rule or regulation thereunder.
The Commission is authorized, for
this purpose, to administer oaths, subpoena witnesses, compel their attendance, take evidence and require the production of records. In addition to the investigations undertaken in enforcing the anti-fraud,
broker-dealer registration, and other regulatory provisions of the act,
which are discussed in part XI of this report under "Complaints and
Investigations", the following investigations were undertaken in enforcing the reporting provisions of sections 12, 13, 14, and 15 (d) of the
act and the rules thereunder, particularly those provisions relating to

registration of all brokers and dealers who use the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce to effect transactions in, or to induce the purchase or sale of, securities in the over-the-counter markets.
The act affords exemption from registration for those brokers and
dealers whose business is exclusively intrastate or exclusively in exempted securities, commercial paper, bankers' acceptances, or commercial bills.

Administrative Proceedings

Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act provides that the
Commission shall, after appropriate notice and opportunity for hearing, deny or revoke registration if it finds such a sanction in the public
interest and that the applicant or registrant or any partner, officer,
director, or other person directly or indirectly controlling or controlled
by such applicant or registrant is subject to one or more of the disqualifications set forth in the act. These disqualifications, in general,
are:
(1) willful false or misleading statements in an application or
document supplemental thereto;

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

75

(2) conviction within 10 years of a felony or misdemeanor involving the purchase or sale of securities or any conduct arising out of business as a broker-dealer;
(3) injunction by a court of competent jurisdiction against engaging in any practices in connection with the purchase or
sale of securities; and
(4) willful violation of the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or any of the Commission's
rules or regulations thereunder.
The Commission is empowered by section 15A of the Securities
Exchange Act to suspend or expel a broker-dealer from membership
in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., the only securities association registered with the Commission, upon a finding of
violation of the Federal securities laws or regulations thereunder.
Section 19(a) (3) of the act grants similar powers with respect to
membership in national securities exchanges.
The Commission may not deny or revoke registration without
finding a disqualification of the types set forth in the act. Therefore,
bad reputation or character, or lack of experience in the securities business, or even conviction of a felony unrelated to transactions in securities cannot in itself be a basis for ordering denial or
revocation of registration as a broker-dealer.
Under section 15A(b) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act, in the
absence of the Commission's approval or direction, no broker or
dealer may be admitted to or continued in membership in the Nationa} Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., if the broker or dealer
or any partner, officer, director, or controlling or controlled person
of such broker or dealer was a cause of any order of denial or revocation of registration or suspension or expulsion from membership
which is in effect. An individual named as such a cause often is subject to one or more statutory disqualifications under section 15(b)
and his employment by any other broker-dealer thus could also become a basis for broker-dealer revocation proceedings against the
new employer.

cases in which the Commission revoked broker-dealer registrations:

TWENTY -SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

He, He & Sagarese.-The
Commission found that Gerald A. Re and
Gerald F. Re, members of the American Stock Exchange, had willfully violated section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933 in the unlawful
distribution on that exchange of the stocks of nine companies in which
they acted as specialists on the exchange. It also found that the
Res willfully violated the antifraud and antimanipulative
provisions
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, its short-selling provisions and
its restrictions applicable to specialists as well as its bookkeeping requirements.
Accordingly, the Commission, in advance of the issuance
of formal findings and opinion, ordered the immediate expulsion of
the two Res from membership on the American Stock Exchange and
revoked the broker-dealer registration of Re, Re & Sagarese."
Barnett & Co., Inc.-This
registrant was found to have employed
well-known "boilerroom" techniques in connection with the offer and
sale of stock of Steuben Electronics Corporation, Inc., including the
use of numerous salesmen to sell a large block of such stock exclusively
by long-distance telephone calls through the means of inaccurate,
highly exaggerated, and misleading representations concerning the
issuer's financial condition, its income and capital, and the prospective
market price of its stock, without any reasonable basis therefor and
without any efforts having been made to obtain information concerning such matters." The Commission found Stanley Barnett, Maurice
Lieber, and Murray Libman to be causes of the order of revocation.
Midland Securities, Inc.-The
Commission found that registrant,
Ben Degaetano, president, a director and principal shareholder of
registrant, and registrant's salesmen, in the sale of securities of Inland
Resources Corp., made false and misleading statements that, among
other things, Inland had just brought in a "gusher" and had many
producing wells, the stock was to be listed on a national securities
exchange, only a limited amount of stock was available, registrant's
price for the stock was lower than the prevailing market price, registrant could give a special price for the stock because it had obtained
a block from an estate, the price of the stock would increase sharply
in a short time, and that Inland had or was about to receive government contracts." The Commission found Degaetano and Joseph P.
Emanuel, Samuel Golden, Herbert Geist, Marvin Berkrot, and Irving
R. vVinkler, salesmen, each a cause of the order of revocation.
Cullen-Stanford Corp.-The
Commission determined that the registrant and its president, Stanford R. Gabaeff, whom it found to be
a cause of the revocation order, had sold unregistered shares of Union
Gulf Petroleum Corp. and had made false and misleading representations in the sale of shares of Union and of Pacific Central Co.

Among other things, it was represented that the Union stock had been
approved by the Commission, that it would have a rapid growth
and rise within a short period from its current price of $4~ per share
to $7 or $8, that dividends would be paid on the stock, and that a
New York syndicate was buying up the stock and such activity would
cause the price to increase markedly; and that the Pacific stock would
double or triple in price within 60 or 90 days, that such stock would
be listed on an exchange, that dividend payments would be increased;
that Pacific would announce startling new discoveries, that Pacific
and Shell Oil Co. expected to merge and had entered into a contract
whereby Shell agreed to take Pacific's entire output of oil, and that
registrant was the fifth largest brokerage firm on Wall Street."
N. Pinsker & Co., Inc.-Registrant
sold shares of unregistered
Class B stock of Tyrex Drug & Chemical Corp. in violation of section 5
of the Securities Act, participating in a distribution being made for
the issuer and purchasing Tyrex stock with a view to distribution
from an individual who was under common control with the issuer.
In addition, registrant, employing the technique of using numerous
salesmen and wholesale and persistent telephone solicitation, violated
the anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts by making false and
misleading representations that Tyrex had developed a drug which
would cure ulcers, and concerning the future market price of Tyrex
stock and the merger or affiliation of Tyrex with another company."
Earl J. Knudson & Co.-The Commission found that registrant
Earl J. Knudson, Jr., vice president, illegally offered and sold unregistered shares of International Petroleum Holding Corp. In
August 1959, at the request of one Max Gilford, Knudson acquired
substantially all the stock of a predecessor of International, which
was a corporate shell, for $5,000 and delivered such shares to Gilford.
Following a 100-for-1 split of its shares, a total of 2,190,000 shares,
all but 100 of the shares outstanding after the split, were transferred
to Knudson. Thereafter a wide distribution of the shares was effected
in several States through various individuals and broker-dealers
without prior registration with the Commission. The Commission
found that Knudson participated in significant steps essential to the
distribution and aided and abetted in it, and that, in the light of the
extensive distribution, no private offering exemption under section
4(1) as claimed by Knudson was available.'
Lawrence Rappee, doing business as Lawrence Rappee & Co.-At
the same time that registrant was conducting an intensive campaign
to effect retail distribution of the common stock of Star Chemical
Laboratories, Inc., it purchased shares and entered quotations for

the stock in the daily sheets of the National Daily Quotation Service
at progressively increasing prices which averaged 20 percent and
were as much as 30 percent higher than the closely contemporaneous
cost prices of the shares purchased. Registrant also arranged with
a broker-dealer in another city to also submit quotations for Star
Chemical stock and periodically furnished this broker-dealer with the
prices to quote, which in general were the same as and followed registrant's quotations. No other broker-dealer quoted Star Chemical
stock during the period.
The Commission concluded that registrant created the market for
Star Chemical stock and through the quotations of the other brokerdealer created the illusion that an independent market existed to
facilitate registrant's sales of the block of stock he acquired. These
activities of registrant were not revealed to his customers. In addition, registrant used sales brochures which contained false and misleading statements regarding the assets and facilities of Star Chemical
and represented that several other companies were its wholly-owned
subsidiaries, whereas the company had only nominal assets and had no
interest in or control over any of the alleged subsidiaries,"
Security Enterprises, Inc.-Registrant,
Truman K. Pennell, president and owner of substantially all of the registrant's shares, and
Carl L. Linn, a former employee of registrant, sold shares of
American Trust Life Insurance Co. and American Trust Underwriters without disclosing to customers as required by rule 15cl-5
of the Exchange Act that Pennell was president and a large stockholder of Life and Underwriters and occupied a position of control
in those companies, or the fact that registrant and Linn were also
under the common control of Pennell. The Life and Underwriters
shares were sold to customers at excessive prices not reasonably
related to current market prices, some sales by registrant being at
prices representing markups of as much as 283 percent over its contemporaneous costs on purchases from other customers, and sales by
Linn representing markups as much as 102 percent over his contemporaneous costs on securities he purchased from Pennell and as
much as 185 percent over his contemporaneous costs on purchases
from other customers. Customers were not informed of the markups
or that shares they purchased had been acquired from Pennell.
During the period in which these transactions were being effected

case involved transactions by
registrant with customers at prices not reasonably related to prevailing market prices. The Commission held that the best evidence of
current market prices is a dealer's own contemporaneous costs, in the
absence of countervailing evidence, Certain securities purchased from
other customers were sold on the same day at markups ranging from
12.8 percent to 60 percent of such cost and from $62.50 to $5,000. In
other transactions where registrant sold to customers securities purchased from other broker-dealers on 1 or 2 days prior to the date
of sale, registrant's markups over such cost ranged from 9.7 percent
to 300 percent. Registrant also purchased securities from customers
which he resold to other broker-dealers at prices ranging from 12.5
percent to 100 percent greater than the prices registrant had paid its
customers, registrant's profit on an individual transaction ranging
as high as $2,062.10

REPORT

The use of customers' funds for the registrant's own purposes, a
form of misconduct accompanied in most cases by doing business while
insolvent and in violation of the net capital requirements, by failure
to file financial reports, sending false confirmations, and keeping false
records, was found and resulted in revocation in Wiles & 00./1 Thom/pson & Sloan, Iw.,2s First Idaho 00rp.29 and in First Securities 00.30
In the last named case, Frank L. 'Vasserman, a partner, commingled
securities carried for the accounts of customers with registrant's own
securities subject to a lien for loans made to it, and sold for his own
account stock belonging to a customer without the latter's knowledge
or authorization, signing the customer's name on the stock certificate
to effect its transfer.
An injunction against violation of the securities registration provisions, conviction for mail fraud in the sale of securities and the failure to amend registrant's broker-dealer application to disclose such
conviction were the grounds for revocation in Mortgage Clubs of
America, I W.81
Suspension Proceedings

Section 15(b) authorizes the Commission to suspend effectiveness
of a broker-dealer's registration pending :final determination as to
whether registration should be revoked. To suspend, the Commission
must make a finding, after notice and opportunity for a hearing, that
suspension is necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. During the past :fiscalyear the Commission suspended the registrations of five broker-dealers after hearings
at which the evidence adduced revealed that serious misconduct was
currently being engaged in by the respondents."
To prevent further
harm to investors the Commission determined that it was in the public
interest to suspend those registrations pending determination of the
question of revocation. The entry of an order of suspension is not
determinative of the ultimate questions of whether willful violations
have been committed and an order of revocation should be issued.
Other Sanctions

The Commission is empowered to suspend for a period not exceeding
12 months or to expel any member of a national securities exchange
for violations of the Securities Exchange Act and to take such action

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

with respect to a member of a registered securities association for
such violations or for willful violations of the Securities Act.
In G. J. Mitchell, Jr. 00.,33 the Commission suspended the registrant
from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., for 15 days for using sales literature which constituted a prospectus not conforming to the requirements of section 10 of the Securities Act and using a selling brochure which omitted to refer to operating losses by the issuer of the securities being recommended.
In Bruns, N ordemaai <:0 00.,34 the registrant was suspended from
membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
and two of its partners, Harold S. Coleman and Lawrence H. Lubin
were suspended from membership in the New York Stock Exchange
and American Stock Exchange-Coleman for a period of 90 days and
Lubin for 60 days. The Commission found that Bruns, Nordeman,
in advance of a public offering through it as underwriter of additional
shares of Gob Shops, Inc., "at the market" price at the time of the
offering, entered increasing bids for Gob stock in the daily quotation
sheets and engaged in trading activities in such stock which "were designed to stimulate buyer interest and thereby create market activity
which would induce the purchase of Gob Shops stock by others at
rising prices." Additional stimulus was provided the market by the
declaration by Gob, following the proposal by Coleman and Lubin
who were directors, that a cash dividend be paid despite an operating
loss, which was charged to capital surplus because of the unsufficiency
of earned surplus. Misleading optimistic sales literature and misrepresentations were also used as part of the manipulative scheme to
raise the price of the Gob stock. The bidding for and purchasing of
Gob stock during the distribution of the shares pursuant to the underwriting was also found to violate rule 10b-6.
The Commission found. certain mitigating circumstances, including
the previous good records of the registrant, Coleman and Lubin, that
registrant would be disqualified from acting as an underwriter for an
offering of securities under regulation A for a period of 5 years, and
that pursuant to rescission offers made to customers who had purchased Gob stock from it, registrant had repurchased many shares
and had paid losses sustained by customers of over $10,000. The
Commission concluded that, under the circumstances, the public interest did not require the revocation of registrant's registration.
Net Capital Rule

Rule 15c3-1 adopted under section 15(c) (3) of the Securities
Exchange Act, commonly known as the net capital rule, provides
sa Securities Exchange Act Release No. 6433 (Dec. 13, 1960).

'" Securities Exchange Act Releases Nos. 6540 (Apr. 26, 1961) and 6548 (May 2, 1961).

TWENTY-SEVENm

safeguards for funds and securities of customers dealing with brokerdealers. This rule imposes a 20-to-1 limit on "aggregate indebtedness" which may be incurred by a broker-dealer in relation to his "net
capital" as those terms are defined by the rules.
Prompt action is taken whenever it appears from examination of
reports filed by a registered broker-dealer, or through inspection of
his books and records, that the permitted ratio is exceeded. Unless
the broker-dealer promptly takes necessary steps to correct such
capital deficiency, injunctive action may be taken and proceedings
may be instituted to determine whether the broker-dealer registration
should be revoked. During the fiscal year, violations of the net
capital rule were charged in injunctive actions filed against 31 brokerdealers and in revocation proceedings instituted against 26 brokerdealers.
Broker-dealers participating in "firm commitment" underwritings
must have sufficient net capital to permit participation in the underwriting for the amount agreed upon without impairing the allowable
capital-debt ratio prescribed by the rule. In order to protect issuers
and customers of broker-dealers participating in such underwritings,
the staff carefully analyzes the latest information concerning the
capital position of such broker-dealers in order to determine if assumption of the new obligations involved in the underwriting is possible without violating the net capital rule. Acceleration of the
effective date of registration statements filed under the Securities Act
will be denied where it appears that underwriting commitments may
engender violations of the net capital rule by any participating
underwriter. Participants who appeared to be inadequately capitalized to take down their commitments were informed of the potential
violation and the effect it would have on the pending registration
statement. Such broker-dealers either obtained sufficient additional
capital so that full compliance with the rule could be had, reduced
their commitments in the underwriting to such an extent as to participate in the underwriting without violating the rule, withdrew as
underwriters, or participated in the underwriting on a "best efforts"
basis only.
Financial Statements

Rule 17a-5 promulgated under section 17(a) of the Securities
Exchange Act requires registered broker-dealers to file annual reports of financial condition with the Commission. Every report so
filed must be certified by a certified public accountant or a public
accountant who is in fact independent with certain specified limited
exemptions applicable to situations where certification does not appear
necessary for customer protection. The rule provides specific condi-

84

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tions under which members of national securities exchanges are exempt
from the necessity of certification. An exemption from the certification requirement is also available to a broker-dealer who, since his
previous report, has limited his securities business to soliciting subscriptions as an agent for issuers, has transmitted funds and securities
promptly, and has not otherwise held funds or securities for or owed
monies or securities to customers. An exemption is also afforded a
broker-dealer who, from the date of his last report, has confined his
business to buying and selling evidences of indebtedness secured by
liens on real estate and has carried no margin accounts, credit balances
or securities for any customers.
With respect to the times within which financial statements must
be filed, rule 17a-5 provides that upon the initial registration of a
broker-dealer the registrant's first financial report must be as of a
date during the period between the expiration of the first and fifth
months following the effective date of the registration. In all cases,
reports must be filed within 45 days after the date as of which the
report speaks.
The reports of financial condition furnish a means whereby the
Commission and the public may evaluate the financial position and
responsibility of registered brokers and dealers. The reports are
analyzed by the staff of the Commission to determine whether the
registrant is in compliance with the net capital rule. Revocation
proceedings may be instituted against registrants who fail to make
the necessary filings. However, it is the policy of the Commission first
to advise the registrant of his obligations under rule 17a-5 and give
him an opportunity to file the report.
During the fiscal year 5,060reports of financial condition were filed.
This compares to the 1960total of 4,569.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

Section 17(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 provides
for regular and periodic inspections of registered broker-dealers.
The inspection device, which the Commission has continually emphasized, is a most useful instrument in protecting investors and preventing and detecting violations of the Federal securities laws.
Among other things, the inspections involve: (1) a determination
of the broker-dealer's financial condition; (2) a complete review of
his pricing practices; (3) an evaluation of the safeguards employed
in his handling of customers' funds and securities; and (4) a determination of whether adequate and accurate disclosures relating to
transactions are made to customers.
The inspectors also determine whether brokers and dealers keep
books and records in compliance with the Federal securities laws and
conform to the margin and other requirements of regulation T as

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

85

prescribed by the Federal Reserve Board. In addition, they examine
individual trading accounts to determine whether excessive trading
or switching has occurred. Frequently inspectors find evidence of
the sale of unregistered securities or the use of fraudulent practices,
including the use of improper sales literature or sale techniques, The
inspection program has also assisted the Commission in its administration of many of its rules.
The number of inspections completed during the fiscal year totaled
1,627, an increase of 128 inspections or almost 9 percent over the previous year. With the steady increase in the number of registered
broker-dealers and benefits derived from the inspection program, the
Commission intends to continue its policy of increasing the number
of inspections in the future.
In determining whether to institute action against a broker-dealer
found to be in violation of the statutes or rules as a result of an
inspection, consideration is given to the type of violations and to the
effect such violations may have upon members of the public. It is
not the Commission's policy to take formal action against brokerdealers for every infraction uncovered. For example, inspections
frequently reveal various inadvertent violations which are discovered
before becoming serious and before customers' funds or securities are
endangered. Where no harm has come to the public in such situations, the matter is usually brought to the attention of the registrant
and suggestions are made to correct any improper practices. If a
violation appears to be willful and the public interest or the protection of investors is best served by formal action, the Commission
promptly institutes appropriate proceedings.
The following table shows the various types of violations disclosed
as a result of the inspection program during the fiscal year:

In addition to the Commission's inspection program, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and the principal stock exchanges also conduct inspections of their members and some of the
States also have inspection programs. Each inspecting agency conducts inspections in accordance with its own procedures and with
particular reference to its own regulations and jurisdiction. Con-

86

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sequently, inspections by other agencies are not an adequate substitute
for Commission inspections since the inspector will not be primarily concerned with the detection and prevention of violations of the
Federal securities laws and the Commission's regulations thereunder.
However, the inspection programs of these other agencies do afford
added protection to the public. The Commission and certain other
inspecting agencies maintain a program of coordinating inspection
activities for the purpose of avoiding unnecessary duplication of
inspections and to obtain the widest possible coverage of brokers and
dealers. The program does not prevent the Commission from
inspecting any person recently inspected by another agency, and such
an inspection by the Commission is made whenever reason therefor
exists.
Agencies now participating in this coordination program include
the American Stock Exchange, the Boston Stock Exchange, the Midwest Stock Exchange, the National Association of Securities Dealers,
Inc., the New York Stock Exchange, the Pacific Coast Stock Exchange, the Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange, and the Pittsburgh Stock Exchange.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Maloney
Act) provides for the registration with the Commission of national
securities associations and establishes standards for such associations.
The rules of such associations must be designed to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to prevent fraudulent and manipulative
acts and practices and to meet other statutory requirements. Such
associations are essentially disciplinary in purpose and serve as a
medium for the cooperative self-regulation of over-the-counter
brokers and dealers. They operate under the general supervision
of this Commission which is authorized to review disciplinary actions
and decisions which affect the membership of members, or of applicants for membership, and to consider all changes in the rules of
associations. The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(NASD), is the only association registered under the act.
In adopting legislation permitting the formation and registration
of such associations, Congress provided an incentive to membership
by permitting such associations to adopt rules which preclude a
member from dealing with a nonmember, except on the same terms
and conditions as the member affords the investing public. The
NASD has adopted such rules. Accordingly, membership is necessary to the profitable participation in underwritings and over-thecounter trading since members may properly grant price concessions,

TWENTY -SEVENTH

87

discounts, and similar allowances only to other members. Loss or
denial of membership due to expulsion or suspension or other ineligibility due to a statutory disqualification, or to failure to meet standards
of qualification established in NASD rules, thus imposes a severe
economic sanction.
Membership in the NASD reached an all time high of 4,611 at
June 30, 1961. During the year membership increased by 239, as a
result of 685 admissions to, and 446 terminations of, membership. At
the same time, there were registered with the NASD as registered
representatives 94,040 individuals, including generally all partners,
officers, traders, salesmen, and other persons employed by or affiliated
with member firms in capacities which involved their doing business
directly with the public. The number of registered representatives
increased by 3,860 during the year as a result of 20,818 initial registrations, 11,813 reregistrations, and 28,771 terminations of registrations. At February 28, 1961, there were 94,176 registered representatives, an all time high figure.
NASD Disciplinary

Actions

The Commission receives from the NASD summaries of decisions
in all disciplinary actions against members. Each such complaint
must be based on allegations that a member has violated specified provisions of the NASD rules of fair practice, although registered representatives of members, and persons controlling or controlled by members, may also be cited for having been the cause of a violation.
The sanctions available where violations are found include expulsion or suspension from membership, revocation or suspension of registration as a registered representative, fine, and censure. An individual may also be found to be the cause of a violation and of the
penalty imposed on another party for such violation. Such a cause
finding can have far-reaching effects, particularly in the case of expulsion, or suspension from membership or suspension or revocation of
registration as a registered representative. A person found to be a
cause of suspension or expulsion from membership cannot be employed
by any NASD member while such suspension is in effect, except with
the approval of the Commission. Where an individual should have
been, but was not, registered as a representative, a finding that the
unregistered person was a cause of an effective expulsion, suspension,
or revocation acts as a disqualification from membership, or from
controlling or being controlled by a member, just as if such a penalty
had been imposed directly on the person found a cause. In many
cases more than a single penalty may be imposed so that expulsion,
suspension, or revocation may be accompanied by a fine or censure,
and, in cases where a fine is imposed, censure is customarily added.

88

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

All decisions by district business conduct committees of the NASD
are reviewable by the NASD board of governors on its own motion,
or on the timely application of an aggrieved party. On review
the board may affirm, modify, or reverse such decisions or remand
them for further consideration. At times two or more complaints
against a single member are consolidated and disposed of in one
decision and at other times one complaint may involve more than one
member firm. During the year the association reported to the Commission its final disposition of 304 formal complaint actions. These
304 final decisions reflected action against 273 different firms." In
67 cases, the complaints were dismissed against the named respondents
on findings that the allegations had not been sustained. Formal findings of violations were made in the remaining 237 cases and some
sanction imposed. Of this total, 178 cases were directed solely against
members while 59 cases were against members and their representatives. A total of 149 representatives had been charged with violations
in the original complaints. Such charges were dismissed as to 20
such individuals and disciplinary action was taken against 129.
The maximum penalty of expulsion from membership was applied
in 31 decisions (including 1 firm expelled in each of 2 decisions), and
17 members were suspended from membership for periods ranging
from 10 days to 3 years (including 1 firm suspended in each of 2
decisions for consecutive periods of 12 and 6 months). Fines ranging
from $10 to $2,500 were imposed on members in 138 cases (including
3 in which members were expelled and 1 in which the member was
suspended) . In 55 other cases the only penalty was censure.
The sanctions imposed on registered representatives had a similar
wide range. The registrations of 45 registered representatives were
revoked and 10 suspended for periods ranging from 60 days to 2
years; 35 were fined amounts ranging from $50 to $1,000; and 13 were
censured. Twenty-six were found to be causes of 14 expulsions, 1
suspension, and 11 fines imposed on the employing firms.
In addition to the various penalties described above, some of the
costs of the proceedings were usually assessed against the members and
the registered representatives found to have acted improperly. During the fiscal year the association collected $83,256.35in fines and costs.
This amount does not reflect the fines and costs assessed since there
is little or no incentive for an expelled member or a revoked registered
representative to pay them.
Commission Review of NASD Disciplinary Action

Section 15A(g) of the act provides that disciplinary actions by
the NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion
.. A total of 26 firms were each involved in 2 or more of the reported cases: 22 firms
in 2 cases; 3 firms in 3 cases; and 1 firm in 4 cases.

89

or on the timely application of any aggrieved person. This section
also provides that the effectiveness of any penalty imposed by the
NASD is automatically stayed pending determination in any matter
which comes before the Commission for review. Section 15A(h) of
the act defines the scope of the Commission's review in proceedings
to review disciplinary action of the NASD. If the Commission finds
that the disciplined person engaged in such acts or practices, or has
omitted such acts as found by the NASD, and that such acts, practices,
or omissions to act are in violation of such rules of the association
as have been designated in the determination, and that such conduct
was inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade, the
Commission must dismiss such proceedings unless it finds that the
penalties imposed are excessive or oppressive, having due regard to
the public interest, in which case the Commission must, by order, cancel
or reduce the penalties. At the beginning of the fiscal year eight
such review cases were pending before the Commission. During the
year 13 additional such petitions were filed, 1 was withdrawn prior
to a determination, and decisions were issued on 5 cases, certain of
which are discussed below, leaving 15 petitions pending at the year
end.
The Commission sustained certain findings by the NASD that
Boren &: 00., and its president and sole stockholder, Irving N. Boren,
had violated certain association rules but found the penalties imposed
excessive." In 24 retail sales to customers of shares of Colorado Gas
Co. stock, the prices charged by Boren ranged from 33.3 to 66.7 percent over the firm's contemporaneous cost. In 23 retail sales of Texas
Toy Co. stock, the markup ranged from 11.9 to 19 percent over the
prices paid by the firm on the day of the sales, and in 4 sales of other
securities the markups ranged from 10.8 to 25 percent. The Commission affirmed the NASD's findings that the markups in these transactions were excessive and inconsistent with just and equitable principles
of trade. However, in other retail sales of Texas Toy Co. stock, and
in certain transactions for customers, the Commission was unable to
sustain NASD findings that the prices and commissions charged
customers had been unfair. The Commission also set aside the NASD
finding of violation in failing to register certain representatives as
a required finding of willfulness had not been made by the NASD.
The sanctions imposed by the NASD, expulsion of Boren & Co.
from membership and revocation of the registration of Irving H.
Boren as a registered representative, and the assessment of $8,318.25
in costs, were reduced by the Commission to 90-day suspensions of
the firm's membership and of Boren's registration and $1,000 in costs.
The Commission pointed out that although substantial sanctions were
... Securities Exchange Act Release No. 6367 (Sept. 19, 1960).

90

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

warranted, the sanctions imposed were excessive in view of its modifications of the findings of the association. The Commission further
held that a part of the costs of NASD actions is to be borne by the association from its regular budget including items such as employees'
salaries which are not directly attributable to particular proceedings;
that costs should not be so high as to discourage an adequate defense;
and that in determining the amount of the reduction consideration
must be given to the facts that certain findings of violations had been
set aside and that there had been no showing of deliberate obstruction and delay. Under all the circumstances, costs were reduced to
$1,000.
The Commission also dismissed an application for review by Midland Securities, Inc., and its president and sole stockholder, Ben
Degaetano, of a decision which expelled the firm from membership,
found Degaetano a cause of such expulsion and revoked his registration as a registered representative and assessed costs of $2,292.76
against him." The Commission's opinion affirmed findings by the
NASD that the firm had sold securities at unfair prices. The Commission rejected the firm's contention that since the securities involved
were low in price, the markups were justified under the NASD's socalled "5-percent markup policy," which indicates that a "somewhat
higher" markup than 5 percent may sometimes be appropriate in the
case of securities selling below $10 per share. The Commission declared that markups of 10.4 to 67 percent cannot be considered as
only "somewhat higher" than 5 percent. Midland's contention that
its markups were justified by its claimed costs of doing business,
including 10 percent sales commissions on gross sales and allegedly
"unusual" services to customers, was also rejected, the Commission
pointing out that merely to recoup the 10 percent sales commission
on the gross sales price would require a markup of more than 10
percent, and that the alleged services did not appear to be unusual.
However, the Commission reduced the assessment of costs to $750 on
grounds similar to those cited in the Boren case.
In considering an application for review filed by Maryland Securities 00., Lnc., and its president, Morton Sandler, the Commission
reduced a fine of $750 imposed on the firm to $500.3S The Commission sustained the NASD findings that in 17 sales of shares of stock
markups ranging from 13.3 to 34.2 percent over the firm's same-day
costs of such shares were excessive and violated the NASD's Rules of
Fair Practice. The Commission determined that in 28 other transactions for which there were no same-day purchases by the firm the
NASD had incorrectly calculated a markup of 27 percent based upon
'" Securities Exchange Act Release No. 6413 (Nov. 16,1960) .

the prices paid by the firm some weeks prior thereto. Under the circumstances the Commission found that the representative "asked"
prices shown in the daily sheets published by the National Daily
Quotation Bureau were a more representative basis for the computation of markups, but that even when computed on this basis the firm's
markups in 20 transactions of 11.1 percent were excessive and unfair.
The Commission reduced the costs assessed by the association from

Section 15A(b) of the act and the bylaws of the NASD provide
that, except where the Commission finds it appropriate in the public
interest to approve or direct to the contrary, no broker or dealer may
be admitted to or continued in membership if he, or any controlling
or controlled person, is under any of the several disabilities specified
in the statute or the bylaws. By these provisions Commission approval is a condition to admission to or continuance in association
membership of any broker-dealer who, among other things, controls
or is controlled by a person whose registraton as a broker-dealer has
been revoked or who has been and is suspended or expelled from association membership or from a national securities exchange, or whose
registration as a registered representative has been revoked by the
NASD or who was found to have been a cause of such an effective
order.
A Commission order approving or directing admission to or continuance in association membership, notwithstanding a disqualification under section 15A(b) (4) of the act, or under an effective
association rule adopted under that section or section 15A (b) (3), is
generally entered only after the matter has been submitted initially
to the association by the member or applicant for membership.
Where, after consideration, the association is favorably inclined, it
ordinarily files with the Commission an application on behalf of the
petitioner. A broker-dealer, however, may file an application directly
with the Commission either with or without association sponsorship.
The Commission reviews the record and documents filed in support of
the application and, where appropriate, obtains additional relevant
and pertinent evidence. At the beginning of the fiscal year, three such
petitions were pending before the Commission. During the year nine
petitions were filed; one was withdrawn; decisions were issued in
eight cases; and three petitions were pending at the year end.
The Commission found it appropriate in the public interest to
approve seven petitions for continuance in, and one petition for
admission to, NASD membership notwithstanding employment of
a disqualified person. In four such instances the petitions concerned

disqualified persons who had earlier received Commission approval to
be employed by specified NASD member firms. The circumstances
of the initial approval having changed, reapproval was necessary."
LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

For the protection of the public, the Commission is authorized to
institute actions for injunctions when violations of the Securities
Exchange Act are present or threatened. A large proportion of such
actions involves unlawful activities by broker-dealers. During the
past year such illegal activities consisted primarily of violations of the
anti-fraud sections and of the provisions concerning financial responsibility and the maintenance of net capital and bookkeeping requirements. Frequently the firms involved have violated two or more of
the protective provisions of the act. Generally, also, violations of the
anti-fraud provisions involve violations of the Securities Act of 1933.
In several of the cases, it developed that the broker-dealer was insolvent, and on motion of the Commission, receivers were appointed by
the court. Injunctions were obtained in 40 cases during the fiscal year
and at the year end 12 cases were pending.
Section 25 of the act grants to any person aggrieved by an order
issued by the Commission under the act the right to obtain review of
the order by a U.S. court of appeals.
Illustrative examples of the variety of injunctions and appellate
actions are discussed below together with actions in which the Commission participated as amicus (fIJ1)'We.
In S.E.O. v. DuPont Homsey & 00. and Anton E. H omsey,40 the
Commission obtained a permanent injunction against a registered
broker-dealer and one of its general partners, Anton E. Homsey, who
was a member of the. New York Stock Exchange, prohibiting further
violations of the antifraud and other provisions of the act and the
Commission's net capital rule. The case arose out of the misappropriation by Homsey of approximately $690,000in customers' securities
deposited with the firm. Upon motion of the Commission a receiver
was appointed for all assets of the firm. The customers of the firm
whose securities had been misappropriated were compensated from
separate funds contributed by the New York Stock Exchange.
In S.E.O. v. Fruit of the Loom, Inc., et 01.,41 the Commission alleged
that the defendants had violated section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act and rule 10b-5 thereunder in connection with a written
offer to Loom's stockholders by Bates Manufacturing Co. to purchase
3D Securities Exchange Act Releases Nos. 6382 (Oct. 7, 1960) ; 6395 (Oct. 17, 1960) ;
6450 (Jan. 12, 1961) ; 6468 (Feb. 9, 1961) ; 6481 (Feb. 24, 1961) ; 6513 (Mar. 24, 1961) ;

the preferred and common stock of Loom at $50 and $20 per share,
respectively; the offer was transmitted by Loom's management with
its endorsement. At the same time, another company, Philadelphia
& Reading Corp., was publicly offering to purchase the preferred and
common stock of Loom at higher prices-$51.50 and $23 per share,
respectively. To compete with this higher offer, Bates, with the
cooperation of two members of Loom's management, entered into a
secret agreement with Carl M. Loeb, Rhoades & Co., a broker-dealer,
to acquire stock of Loom at prices equaling the P. & R. offer and,
with special written approval, at even higher prices and to repurchase
all the shares obtained by Loeb, Rhoades.
The Commission charged that Loom, through its management and
specifically through two members thereof, violated rule 10b-5 by failing to disclose the higher P. & R. offer to its stockholders while the
Bates offer at the lower prices which it had endorsed and transmitted
was still continuing. Not only did the management of Loom not
disclose the higher prices being offered by P. & R., but it aggravated
this violation by advising its stockholders that the BahlS offer, which it
was transmitting, was better than that of another company, and by its
failure to inquire as to the nature of P. & R.'s offer although P. & R.
had previously informed Loom's management that an earlier offer
would be increased. Two members of Loom's management took advantage of the secret purchasing program of Loeb, Rhoades on behalf
of Bates and sold their stock to that firm after having advised Loom's
stockholders that members of management intended to tender their
shares pursuant to the terms and conditions of the Bates offer.
The Commission charged that Bates violated rule 10b-5 by making
a public offer to purchase stock of Loom at one price and then pursuing
a secret program through Loeb, Rhoades and under the auspices of
Loom's management to pay higher and varying prices. Bates also
misrepresented that a certain large block of shares of Loom would
not be tendered pursuant to its offer because of a "conflict of interest"
when in fact, shortly after the Bates offer was transmitted to Loom's
stockholders, this block was sold to Bates at higher prices.
Loeb, Rhoades necessarily violated rule 10b-5, the Commission
charged, in its capacity as the knowing instrument through which
many of the violations of Bates and of certain members of Loom's
management were committed. The defendants consented to a permanent injunction and offers of rescission were made by Bates and
by Loeb, Rhoades.
In S.E.O. v. Oecil Rhoades, et al.,42 permanent injunctions by
consent were entered against Cecil Rhoades and Marshall Field, enjoining them from further violations of the anti-fraud and antimanip'" S D.N.Y. No. 61 D1v. 375.

ulative provisions of the act. Cecil Rhoades had sold short about
600 shares of IBM stock and 1,400 shares of Polaroid Corp. stock,
both securities listed on the New York Stock Exchange, and, in order
to cover such short position at favorable prices, the defendants employed a device, scheme, and artifice to defraud by concealing their
own identities and arranging to have sell orders for 4,000 shares of
Polaroid stock and 500 shares of IBM stock placed with various
brokers in fictitious names. As a result, a false and misleading appearance of active trading in these stocks was created, and their
market prices declined, enabling defendants to cover Rhoades' short
position.
In S.E.O. v, Stanley I. Younger,43 the Commission brought suit
to prohibit Younger from perpetrating a fraudulent scheme by placing orders with various New York broker-dealers to sell securities
which he did not own and by instructing the broker-dealers to buy
on the over-the-counter market, on the basis of the credit established
through the sales of such securities, the common stock of National
Photocopy, Inc., a nonexistent corporation. In order to create a
market in National Photocopy, Inc., Younger deposited with a Salt
Lake City broker-dealer a large block of stock of this fictitious corporation and had the broker-dealer place asked quotations in the National Daily Quotation Service. A permanent injunction was entered
by consent.
In S.E.O. v, Arlee Associates, Inc., et al.,44the Commission obtained
a permanent injunction prohibiting the defendants from violating the
anti-fraud provisions of the securities acts by selling without the
consent of the owners securities pledged with the defendant First
Discount Corp. as collateral for loans, and prohibiting them from
effecting securities transactions for the accounts of others without
being registered with the Commission as broker-dealers. The Commission's complaint also alleged that the defendants placed purchase
orders with broker-dealers when they did not intend to deposit funds
or securities to cover such purchases, and the injunction prohibited
any further such conduct. As a result of their unlawful conduct,
the defendants had defrauded various broker-dealers of over
$1,400,000, and the whereabouts of securities collateralizing loans
in excess of $4,500,000 is unknown. A receiver has been appointed
to administer the assets of the defendants Arlee Associates, Inc., and
First Discount Corp.

and dealers by placing orders to purchase large blocks of listed securities with members of the New York Stock Exchange, and then
failing to pay for them, causing the firms to cancel the transactions
and sell the securities so purchased. If the sellout resulted in a profit,
Karal would then tender payment for the securities purchased and
demand payment for the proceeds of the sale, including the profit.
If, however, the sellout resulted in a loss, Karal ignored demands for
payment, and refused to make good the loss.
In Peoples Securities Oompany v, S.E.0.46 the Court of Appeals
for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the Commission's denial of Peoples'
motion to cancel or withdraw its application for registration as a
broker-dealer under section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act,
its denial of Peoples' application, and its finding that certain controlling persons were causes of the denial. The court rejected
Peoples' contention based on the early case of Jones v, S.E.0.,47 that
it had an absolute right to withdraw its application any time before
the effective date of registration.
It also held that section 15(b) did
not require that the Commission cancel the application simply because
Peoples had been dissolved as a corporation.
In Blaise d'Antoni & Associates v. S.E.0.48 the Court of Appeals
sustained an order of the Commission revoking the registration of a
broker-dealer for violation of the net capital rule, naming its president and sole stockholder a cause of the revocation, and denying the
latter's application for broker-dealer registration and his request to
withdraw such application. The Court noted the importance of the
net capital rule as "one of the most important weapons in the Commission's arsenal to protect investors." It rejected the controlling
person's contention that he had an absolute right to withdraw his
application for registration.
Commission orders revoking brokerdealer registrations were also affirmed in Associated Securities 001'poration and Norman B. Jenson v, S.E.0.49 and N. Sims Organ & 00.

An important decision involving applications for stays of Commission orders involved two such applications heard together by the

request to stay an order of the Commission pending a petition for
review, it had to balance the possible injury to the petitioners against
the probable harm to the public interest. The Court held that while
the exclusion of these petitioners from the securities business may
be a serious personal injury, such injury was far outweighed by the
consideration of possible harm to the investing public. To grant a
stay, the Court felt, would be to substitute its judgment of the public
interest considerations for that of the Commission, which had the
primary responsibility for making such a determination, and
whose determination as to those considerations should not be upset
except for cogent reasons.
In Samuel B. Franklin and '00. v. S.E.O.,52 the Court of Appeals
upheld an order of the Commission dismissing a proceeding to review
disciplinary action taken by the National Association of Securities
Dealers. The Court held that the evidence amply supported the
findings of the Commission that the petitioner had sold and purchased
securities at prices which were not fair under all the relevant circumstances and which were not reasonably related to the market price,
in violation of the rules of the NASD. Noting that there is no hardand-fast "5-percent rule," the Court nevertheless held that the NASD's
5-percent policy on markups and markdowns is applicable to low
price and penny stocks, and that the Commission did not affirm the
fine imposed by the NASD merely because the markups and markdowns of petitioner exceeded 5 percent, but because they were clearly
excessive. The Court also adopted the Commission's view that the
timely filing of a petition for agency reconsideration tolls the 60-day
period within which to seek review of an order of the Commission in
a court of appeals and that a petition to review such an order which is
filed within 60 days from the termination of the application for reconsideration by the agency is timely. A petition for a writ of certiorari
is pending.
Participation as Amicus Curiae

The Supreme Court has granted certiorari in Blasi v. Lelvman,53 in
which the Commission is participating as amicus curiae. This case
involves the question whether, under section 16(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act, a corporation whose securities are registered on a
national securities exchange may recover the entire "short swing"
profits realized by an investment banking partnership from trading
in such securities where a member of the partnership is also a director
of the corporation. The Court of Appeals had held 54 that a waiver

actions did not relieve him from liability under section 16(b), but
that such liability was limited to his proportionate share in the firm's
profits, and it dismissed the complaint against the other partners.
A motion by the Commission for leave to participate as amicus curiae
and file a petition for rehearing in the Court of Appeals was denied.
In addition to supporting plaintiff's petition for certiorari, the Commission filed a brief on the merits, urging that the partnership be held
liable for the entire "short swing" profits realized by the firm.
Bellanca (Iorporatioti v. Sidney L. Albert, et al.,55 involved a suit
for damages, based on the antifraud and reporting provisions of the
act, against a former controlling shareholder and director of the
plaintiff corporation and other former directors. The complaint
charged that Albert fraudulently induced the corporation to issue
and sell its stock and prevented the corporation from filing required
reports with the Commission. The other directors were charged with
aiding and abetting violations of the act by authorizing, ratifying
and acquiescing in Albert's actions. The Commission in a memorandum filed as (JImWU8 curiae urged that the complaint stated causes of
action against the defendants and was timely filed within the applicable statute of limitations.
In M atheson. v, A1'mb1'U8t,56 the Court of Appeals upheld a private
right of action by a defrauded purchaser of securities based upon
violation of section 10 (b) or the Securities Exhange Act and rule
10b-5 thereunder.
The Court concluded that Congress did not
intend to draw a distinction under section 10 (b) between defrauded
sellers and buyers of securities. Accordingly, it rejected the contention that specific remedies available to the defrauded purchaser
under the Securities Act were exclusive and barred an action based
upon violation of rule lOb-5.
The Court also held that an interstate telephone call made to induce
the negotiations which led to the fraudulent sale was sufficient to
create Federal jurisdiction over the transaction, that actions under
rule lOb-5 are additional to State and any other Federal actions and
a plaintiff may bring suit in a Federal court even though he may also
have an adequate remedy in the State courts; and that rule 10b-5
encompasses "face-to-face" securities transactions not involving any
broker-dealer firm or a national securities exchange.

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF I q35
In administering the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
the Commission regulates interstate public-utility holding company
systems engaged in the electric utility business and/or in the retail
distribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also extends to
natural gas pipeline companies and other nonutility companies which
are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. Although the
matters under the act dealt with by the Commission and its staff
embrace a variety of intricate and complex questions of law and fact
generally involving more than one area of regulation, briefly there are
three principal regulatory areas. The first covers those provisions of
the act, contained principally in section 11(b) (1), which require the
physical integration of public utility companies and functionally related properties of holding company systems and those provisions,
contained principally in section 11(b) (2), which require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of
holding company systems. The second covers the financing operations of registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, the acquisition and disposition of securities and properties, and certain
accounting practices, servicing arrangements and intercompany transactions. The third includes the exemptive provisions of the act, the
provisions covering the status under the act of persons and companies,
and those regulating the right of a person affiliated with a public
utility company to acquire securities resulting in a second such affiliation. Matters embraced within this area of regulation frequently
come before the Commission and its staff. Many such matters do not
result in formal proceedings and others are reflected in such proceedings only in an indirect manner when they are related to issues
principally under one of the other areas of regulation.
The Branch of Public Utility Regulation of the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation performs the principal functions
under the act. It observes and examines problems which arise in connection with transactions which are or may be subject to regulation
under the act and discusses such problems with interested persons and
companies and advises them as to the applicable sections of the act, the
rules thereunder and Commission policy with respect thereto. Ques98

tions are raised with and problems are presented to the staff daily.
These include questions raised by security holders and problems presented by companies contemplating transactions requiring the filing
of an application or declaration, particularly financing operations
and the acquisition and disposition of securities and properties.
This day-to-day activity includes prefiling discussions and conferences, in person and by telephone, with company representatives
and with other persons where the matter under consideration affects
their interest. Members of the staff of this Division actively participate in hearings and often aid the Commission in the preparation of
its decision on a particular matter. The staff continually reexamines
the status of exempt companies, examines the annual reports filed with
the Commission and those sent to stockholders and, of course, the staff
must keep abreast of new technical developments in the electric and
gas industry, including the use of atomic energy as a source of power.
COMPOSITION OF REGISTERED
BOWING
COMPANY SYSTEMS AND
PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO SECTION II AND OTHER SIGNIFICANT
PROBLEMS

At the beginning of the fiscal year there were 26 registered holding
company systems subject to regulation under the act. These included
five small registered holding company systems 1 which were formerly
exempt pursuant to rule 9 of the general rules and regulations under
the act," On August 11, 1960, pursuant to section 5 (d) of the act,
the Commission declared one of these five companies not to be a holding company and thereupon its registration ceased to be in effect,"
During the fiscal year a milestone was reached in the administration of the act. Proceedings relating to three of the largest holding
company systems subject to the act and which, in the past, had taken
up a substantial amount of time and effort by the Commission and
its staff, progressed to completion resulting for all practical purposes in the elimination of these three registered holding company
systems from regulation under the act. The three systems are those
of Cities Service Co., Electric Bond & Share Co., and Standard Gas
& Electric Co.
~ The 5 companies were Kinzua 011 & Gas Corp., C. E. Burlingame Corp., Colonial
Utilities Corp., British American Utilities Corp., and Keystone Pipe & Supply Co. The
consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of these companies ranged from approxtmatetz
$213,500 (British American) to $3,548,700 (Burlingame).
~ Rule 9 permitted a holdIng company to claim exemption from the act for Itself and
Its subsidiaries If the holding company system was of relatively small size, measured by
the aggregate amount of Its utlIlty assets or of the annual revenues derived from public
utlllty operations. The rule was rescinded etl'ectlve Feb. 29, 1960.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Details with respect to Cities Service Co. are set forth on pages
134 and 135 of the Commission's 26th Annual Report. On Dec. 23,
1960, the Commission issued an order pursuant to section 5(d) of
the act declaring that Cities Service no longer was a holding company, and its registration under the act ceased to be in effect.' The
order continued in effect the reservation of jurisdiction over fees and
expenses incurred in various proceedings. In 1941, when Cities Service registered as a holding company it was the top company in a holding company system which consisted of 125 companies with extensive utility and nonutility interests and consolidated assets of over $1
billion.
As indicated on pages 136-137 of the Commission's 26th Annual
Report, at the beginning of this fiscal year Electric Bond & Share Co.
did not own as much as 5 percent of the outstanding securities of any
domestic public utility company and had pending before the Commission an application, filed pursuant to section 3 (a) (5) of the act, for
an exemption as a holding company from the provisions of the act.
On December 6, 1960, the Commission granted the exemption subject
These conditions are designed to eliminate
to certain conditions,"
any possible affiliate relationship between Bond & Share and a former
public utility subsidiary and to prevent or modify practices which
might tend toward or lead to an absence of arm's-length dealings in
connection with services performed by Bond & Share, through a
wholly owned service company, for certain other domestic public
utility companies which had formerly been subsidiary companies of
Bond & Share. In its order the Commission reserved jurisdiction to
revoke Bond & Share's exemption if the conditions are not adhered to
or to impose additional conditions if necessary. The Commission also
reserved jurisdiction in respect of the fees and expenses incurred by
certain participants and after the close of the fiscal year the Commission released jurisdiction over certain of such fees and expenses of
some of the participants and reserved jurisdiction as to others," A
long and difficult job was thereupon brought to a conclusion. In 1938,
when Bond & Share registered as a holding company it was the
largest holding company system in the country. As at December 31,
1938, the consolidated assets of Bond & Share and its subsidiary
companies amounted to more than $3.6 billion. The system included
5 subsidiary holding companies and 131 domestic subsidiaries. At the
time the exemption order was issued Bond & Share had no subsidiary

company which was either a registered holding company or a public
utility company, and Bond & Share had converted itself into an investment company, registered as such on February 6, 1961.
Details with respect to Standard Gas & Electric Co. are set forth
on page 140 of the Commission's 26th Annual Report. On January
19, 1961, the Commission approved step V of Standard Gas' plan
which, briefly stated, proposed a liquidation and dissolution program
for Standard Gas and its subsidiary registered holding company,
Philadelphia Co., through distributions to Standard Gas' stockholders
of portfolio securities and cash.' On April 22, 1961, the plan was
approved and ordered enforced by the U.S. District Court for the
District of Delaware." Although there remains for Commission consideration the fees and expenses in connection with this proceeding
and the transactions governing the final distribution of Standard Gas'
remaining assets, virtual completion of the long and difficult job in
this system was achieved during the fiscal year. In 1938, when Standard Gas registered as a holding company it controlled a farflung
utility and nonutility system operating in over 20 States and in the
Republic of Mexico. As at December 31, 1939, the system consisted
of over 100 companies and its consolidated assets amounted to more
than $1 billion. At the present time, Standard Gas controls no
public utility company and it has only common stock outstanding
in the hands of the public. Philadelphia Co. has been dissolved.
The remaining 18 active registered systems 9 include 20 registered
holding companies since, as shown in the tabulation below, the
holding company systems of Allegheny Power System, Inc., and
Central & South West Corp. have 2 registered holding companies
each. Of these 20 companies, 13 function solely as holding companies and 7 function as operating as well as holding companies.
In these 18 active registered systems, there are 91 electric and/or gas
utility subsidiaries, 40 nonutility subsidiaries, and 12 inactive companies, totaling 163 system companies.
The following tabulation shows the number of holding companies,
electric and/or gas utility companies and nonutility companies in

During the fiscal year, certain changes occurred in the total number
of companies in 6 of the 18 active registered systems, resulting in a net
reduction of 9 companies to a total of 163 as compared with a total of
172companies as at the end of the previous fiscal year. American Electric Power Co., Inc., disposed of a nonutility subsidiary, reducing the
total companies in its system from 24 to 23. Central & South West
Corp. disposed of its interest in Compania Electrica de Matamoras,
S.A., a Mexican public utility subsidiary, reducing the number of
system companies from eight to seven. The Columbia Gas System,

TWENTY-SEVENTH

Inc., increased the system companies from 20 to 21 as a result of the
creation of a new subsidiary, Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., which
acquired all of the gas distribution utility assets of an associate located
in the State of Maryland. Middle South Utilities, Inc., disposed of
its interest in Louisiana Gas Service Co., a public utility, reducing
the total system companies from 11 to 10. Iroquois Gas Corp., a public utility subsidiary of National Fuel Gas Co., acquired the assets of
an associate, Penn- York Natural Gas Corp., a nonutility subsidiary
which later dissolved, resulting in a reduction of total system companies from nine to eight. Six of the electric subsidiaries of New
England Electric System were merged into a seventh electric subsidiary, resulting in a reduction of total system companies from 25
to 19.
On the basis of total assets, less valuation reserves, of the entire
privately owned electric and gas utility and natural gas pipeline
companies in the United States, a comparison of such data with similar data for the 18 holding company systems registered under the act
indicates that one-fifth of the total privately owned electric and gas
utility industry is subject to the Commission's jurisdiction under the
act. Since no other regulatory agency supervises the financial practices of as great a segment of the industry, persons interested in financial problems look to this Commission for leadership and guidance
with respect to such matters. The Commission took the initiative
in requiring competitive bidding regarding securities sold for cash,
enunciating standards regarding appropriate capitalization ratios,
specifying the protective provisions required to be included in first
mortgage bonds and preferred stock, and requiring full refundability
of senior securities at all times and at reasonable redemption prices.
The largest number of companies subject to the act as components
of registered holding company systems at anyone time was 1,620 in
1938. Altogether 2,413 companies have been subject to the act as
registered holding companies or subsidiaries thereof at one time or
another during the period from June 15, 1938, to June 30,1961. Included in this total were 224 holding companies (holding companies
and operating-holding companies), 1,037 electric and/or gas utility
companies, and 1,152 nonutility enterprises. From June 15, 1938, to
June 30, 1961, 2,226 of these companies have been released from the
regulatory jurisdiction of the act or have ceased to exist as separate
corporate entities. Of the remaining 187 companies, 163 are members of the 18 active systems listed in the table above and 24 are members of the 5 additional small systems referred to above.
Of the above-mentioned 2,226 companies, 926 with assets aggregating approximately $13 billion at their respective dates of divestment
have been divested by their respective parents and are no longer sub-

ject to the act as components of registered systems. The balance of
1,300 companies includes 791 which were released from the regulatory
jurisdiction of the act as a result of dissolutions, mergers and consolidations and 509 companies ceased to be subject to the act as components of registered systems as a result of exemptions granted under
sections 2 and 3 of the act or the grant of orders pursuant to section
5(d) of the act finding such companies had ceased to be holding
companies.
While, as the above indicates, the Commission has succeeded for
the most part in accomplishing the aims and purposes of the Congress
reflected in section 11 there still remain a number of problems to be
resolved under that section. Some of them are the subject matter of
proceedings now before the Commission and are discussed under the
developments in individual registered systems.
Unresolved issues under section l1(b) (1) concern the retainability of nonutility pipeline companies by Consolidated Natural Gas
Co.; the retain ability by Delaware Power & Light Co. of both its gas
and electric facilities; the retainability of gas and transportation
properties of one of the public utility subsidiary companies in the
Middle South Utilities, Inc., system; the retainability by the National
Fuel Gas Co. system of oil and gas transmission businesses; and the
retainability by Utah Power & Light Co. of its subsidiary, the Western Colorado Power Co. Under section l1(b) (2), unresolved issues
relate to the existence of publicly held minority interests in subsidiary
companies of Allegheny Power System, Inc., the Columbia Gas System, Inc., Eastern Utilities Associates, New England Electric System,
and Union Electric Co.
DEVELOPMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL REGISTERED SYSTEMS

There is discussed below each of the active registered holding company systems and other systems in which there occurred during the
fiscal year 1961 significant developments other than financing transactions discussed under another heading.
Allegheny Power System, Inc. (Formerly The West Penn Electric Co.)

This system had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of
approximately $587,600,000 at December 31, 1960, and for the year
ended that date, the system's consolidated operating revenues
amounted to about $158,579,000.
During the fiscal year this holding company changed its name from
the West Penn Electric Co. to Allegheny Power System, Inc. The
change in name was approved by a vote of the stockholders at a special
meeting held in November 1960. While the change of name as such
was not subject to approval by the Commission under the Holding

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

105

Company Act, a declaration was filed pursuant to section 12(e) of
the act regarding the solicitation of proxies to amend its charter
to effect the change and was permitted such declaration to become
effective."
Allegheny Power owns 12.5 percent of the voting securities of Ohio
Valley Electric Corp., which, with its wholly-owned subsidiary,
Indiana-Kentucky
Electric Corp., furnishes electric power to an installation of the Atomic Energy Commission near Portsmouth, Ohio.
There was still pending before the Commission at the close of the fiscal
year the issue of whether the acquisition of such stock by Allegheny
Power and other sponsoring companies (among which are American
Electric Power Co., Inc., and Ohio Edison Co., registered holding
companies) meets the standards of section 10 of the act. This issue
and the organization and financing of Ohio Valley Electric Corp. and
Indiana-Kentucky
Electric Corp. are discussed on pages 126-129 of
the Commission's 23d Annual Report.
American Electric Power Co., Inc.

As at December 31, 1960, the American Electric System had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of some $1,507,189,000, and
for the year ended that date, consolidated operating revenues totaled
about $338,078,000.
The Commission approved a declaration filed by American Electric
permitting it to issue sufficient shares of its common stock to pay a
21!z-percent stock dividend."
The Commission also approved a plan
filed by American Electric pursuant to section 11 (e) of the act proposing the sale to a non affiliate of certain quarrying properties owned
and operated by a non utility subsidiary.
In 1945 the Commission had
determined that, under the standards of section 11 (b) (1), the operation by the system of these properties constituted a business incidental
to the operations of the system's integrated electric utility system on
the ground that blasting and quarrying operations by a nonaffiliate
might have seriously endangered the foundations of a nearby hydroelectric dam which was part of the system's integrated system."
Since 1945 more efficient, accurate, and safer quarrying methods have
been developed so that it is now possible to obtain assurance that the
quarrying operations by a nonaffiliate owner would not jeopardize the
dam. In the light of the foregoing the Commission approved the
section 11 (e) plan on the ground that the conditions upon which the
1945 order was predicated do not now exist and it could no longer be
said the quarrying operations were incidental to the operations of the
integrated system.

On April 17, 1961, the Commission approved a proposal by 'Wheeling Electric Co. to sell to Ohio Power Co. all of Wheeling Electric's
utility facilities located in the State of Ohio. These companies are
both subsidiaries of American Electric."
In addition to the above matters there was an important development relating to capitalization ratios and accounting for deferred taxes
which arose from the filing by Kentucky Power Co., a subsidiary of
American Electric, of a proposal to issue and sell $40,000,000 face
amount of long-term notes to banks. This is discussed as a separate
matter at pages 121-123.
American Electric Power owns 37.8 percent of the stock of Ohio
Valley Electric Corp. The status of this matter is discussed under
Allegheny Power System, Inc., above.
American Natural Gas Co.

As at December 31, 1960, the American Natural system had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $872,585,000,
and, for the year then ended, its consolidated operating revenues
amounted to about $240,250,000.
On November 13, 1959, the Commission issued its findings and
opinion regarding the plan of American Natural filed pursuant to
section 11(e) of the act providing for the elimination of American
Natural's then outstanding shares of $25 par value nonredeemable
preferred stock by the payment of $32.50 per share to the holders
thereof.> The order approving the plan was not entered until, as
required by the Commission, it was modified to provide that the
amount of cash payment, exclusive of dividends, in excess of the par
value of the preferred stock would be charged by American Natural to
its earned surplus and that American Natural would pay only such
fees, expenses, and other remuneration in connection with the proceeding as the Commission might determine, award, or allow."
During the fiscal year, claims for such fees and expenses were filed,
and, after the submission of additional information and the filing
of briefs, the Commission approved the amounts requested."
Also during the fiscal year, the Commission permitted an amendment of American Natural's charter to increase its authorized shares
of common stock and to split such stock on the basis of 2% shares

In June 1961, Southwestern Electric Power Co., a subsidiary company of Central, registered as a holding company as to the Arklahoma
Corp., an electric transmission company. Central, Southwestern, and
Arklahoma had previously filed a joint application requesting that
Central and Southwestern each be declared not to be a holding company as to Arklahoma, and that Arklahoma be declared not to be a
subsidiary company to Southwestern. Southwestern owns 32 percent
of the capital stock of Arklahoma; and Arkansas Power & Light Co.
and Oklahoma Gas & Electric Co., neither of which is affiliated with
Southwestern or with each other, each owns 34 percent of Arklahoma's
capital stock. A hearing was ordered on the joint application," but
before the hearing took place, Southwestern registered as a holding
company and the Commission, upon request, permitted the joint
application to be withdrawn."
Cities Service Co.

The details of the status of Cities and its subsidiaries up to September 2, 1960, are set forth at pages 134-135 of the 26th annual report.
The section 11(d) plan there referred to was consummated December 2, 1960; and Cities, by order issued December 23, 1960, under
section 5(d) was found to have ceased to be a holding company and
its registration as a holding company ceased to be in effect.20 The
order of the Commission approving the section 11(d) plan reserved
jurisdiction in respect of the allowance and allocation of fees and
expenses in connection with the consolidated proceeding. At the end
of the fiscal year a proceeding was pending with respect to such fees
and expenses.
The Columbia Gas System, Inc.

This registered holding company and its subsidiary companies had
consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of $1,256,365,000 at December 31, 1960, and consolidated operating revenues for the year
then ended of $517,050,000.
Columbia continued its corporate realignment program, initiated
in 1955, to segregate retail and wholesale operations and carry on the
retail business by a single company in each State with one additional
company to transport gas in interstate commerce and render wholesale service to affiliated and nonaffiliated companies. Effective J anuary 1, 1961, Columbia Gas of Maryland, Inc., acquired the retail

The latter
company will sell gas at wholesale to the Maryland company and
continue retail service in West Virginia. To date the program has
been completed with respect to the retail operations in the States of
Kentucky, New York, and Maryland.
After lengthy court proceedings discussed on pages 155-156 of the
Commission's 26th annual report, a plan of reorganization of American Fuel & Power Co. and its two principal subsidiary companies,
Inland Gas Corp. and Kentucky Fuel Gas Corp., was consummated.
A new company, the Inland Gas Corp., Inc., acquired the properties
and businesses of the above corporations and the common stock of
the new company was placed in escrow for delivery to Columbia
if it should, upon application under the act, obtain approval to
acquire the stock.
At the close of the fiscal year there was pending before the Commission an integration proceeding regarding the retainability of the
properties of six subsidiary companies of Columbia having net property equal to approximately 12.5percent of the aggregate net property
of the Columbia system. Many difficulties have interfered with any
substantial progress toward resolution of the proceedings. During
the fiscal year the Commission's staff reexamined the problems involved and conferences with company representatives took place.
The basic problems were further complicated by the question of
whether the facts and circumstances had changed since the hearing
was closed. As a result of conferences between the staff of the
Division of Corporate Regulation and Columbia officials an agreement was reached as to the appropriate procedure to be followed to
bring the record up to date so as to permit the matter to go forward.
Consolidated

Natural Gas Co.

This registered holding company and its subsidiary companies had
consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately
$782,111,000 at December 31, 1960, and for the year then ended, the
system's consolidated revenues amounted to about $363,372,000.
Pursuant to an order of the Commission dated December 29, 1960,22
Consolidated Natural Gas Co. issued 23,000 shares of its capital stock,
par value $10 per share, to the Union Heat & Light Co. of Grove
City, Pa., a nonaffiliate. The stock, valued at $45 per share, or an
aggregate of $1,035,000,was issued in connection with the acquisition
by the Peoples Natural Gas Co., a subsidiary of Consolidated, of
all of the assets of Union. Peoples assumed all of Union's liabilities
and issued to Consolidated 10,350 shares of Peoples' capital stock,
par value $100 per share, or an aggregate par value of $1,035,000.

This registered holding company and its subsidiaries had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $111,972,000
at December 31, 1960, and, for the year then ended, its consolidated
operating revenues amounted to about $38,042,000.
During the fiscal year, a significant step was made with respect
to compliance by Eastern Utilities Associates with the April 4, 1950,
order directing the company to divest itself of its direct or indirect
interest in the gas utility properties of its subsidiary, Blackstone
Valley Gas & Electric CO.23 Step 1 of the section 11(e) plan discussed at pages 135-136 of the Commission's 26th Annual Report was
approved on August 10, 1960.24 Step 1 provided for the transfer of
Blackstone's gas properties and related facilities to Valley Gas Co.a new company organized for that purpose in 1956-in exchange for
the common stock, first mortgage bonds and a long-term unsecured
promissory note of Valley, and for the contemporaneous negotiated
sale of such bonds and notes. On October 21, 1960, this phase of
the plan was approved and ordered enforced by the U.S. District
Court for the District of Rhode Island; 25and, on appeal by a public
common stockholder of Blackstone, the District Court's order was

As at December 31, 1960, this system, excluding Manila Electric Co.,
a foreign public utility subsidiary, had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $930,749,000, and, for the year then
ended, its consolidated operating revenues totaled about $204,813,000.
Construction work began in February 1960 on a small (5,000 kw.)
pressurized water-type nuclear reactor at the Saxton generating station of Pennsylvania Electric Co., a system subsidiary. The facility
is expected to be completed by the end of 1961, after which it will be
operated as a research and development project over a 5-year period.
At the end of the fiscal year the Atomic Energy Commission had
scheduled a public hearing to consider issuance of a provisional

Granite City Generating Co. (Voting

Trustees)

As at March 31, 1961, the end of its fiscal year, this system had
total assets, less valuation reserves, of about $292,000 and Granite
City Generating Co., an electric utility company, had total operating
revenues of about $125,000 for the 12 months ended that date. The
Voting Trustees, by virtue of their voting control of all of the voting
securities of the electric utility company, are a holding company and
registered as such in 1937. The electric utility company owned a
power plant which was leased to Union Electric Co. and the entire
annual rentals for the leased plant, less expenses and taxes, were
devoted to the retirement of the outstanding first mortgage bonds
of the electric utility company. During the fiscal year the Voting
Trustees and the electric utility company sold all of that company's
assets to a nonaffiliated steel company and, to the extent necessary,
the proceeds from the sale were used to retire all of the electric utility
company's first mortgage bonds then outstanding."
During the coming fiscal year, it is expected that the Voting Trustees will file a plan
under section 11(e) of the act to distribute the cash balance, after
the payment of fees of the Voting Trustees and all liquidating and
other expenses, to the holders of the voting trust certificates of the
electric utility company.

Middle South Utilities, Inc.

This registered holding company had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of about $793,945,000 at December 31, 1960, and, for the
year then ended, its consolidated revenues amounted to approximately
$214,574,000.
As discussed at page 138 of the 26th annual report, Middle South
proposed to adopt a restricted stock option plan and issue thereunder
restricted common stock options to key officers and employees of the
company and its subsidiary companies. During the fiscal year, the
Commission approved the proposal subject to certain conditions. As
filed, the plan provided that during a period of 5 years from the date
of approval of the plan by the stockholders of Middle South, nontransferable options were to be granted, as determined by a special
option committee, to key executive employees of the system for the
purchase of up to 120,000 of the authorized and unissued shares of
common stock of Middle South." No options were to be issued to any
one employee which would permit him to acquire more than 10,000
shares of stock, no option could be exercised in whole or in part during
the first 12 months after its grant but each option could be exercised
as to one-fourth of the shares optioned thereunder for each 12-month
period subsequent to the date of grant, and no option could be exercised after 7 years from the date of grant. The exercise price per
share of the common stock covered by each option was to be not less
than 95 percent of the market value of such stock at the time of the
grant of the option, subject to modifications and adjustments under
certain conditions; and the exercise price could subsequently be reduced to 95 percent of the market value of the stock on the day of
reduction if the average market value thereof for the 12 consecutive
calendar months preceding the month in which the reduction occurred
was less than 80 percent of the fair market value of the stock on the
date of the grant of the original option.
In approving the proposal, the Commission required the plan be
amended so that (a) the aggregate exercise price of common stock
optioned to anyone optionee may not exceed 150 percent of the regular
annual cash compensation then being paid to him, (b) the exercise
price may not be less than 100 percent of the market price of the
stock on the date of the grant of the option, and (c) not more than
25 percent of the shares reserved under the plan may be optioned to
employees who, at the time of adoption of the plan, are officers in the
Middle South system." Middle South accepted the conditions and â€¢

in addition, eliminated the provision permitting the reduction in the
exercise price if the market price of the stock declined."
During the fiscal year Middle South filed a plan pursuant to section
11 (e) of the act providing for the exchange of shares of its common
stock for the 3.18-percent publicly held shares of common stock of
New Orleans Public Service, Inc., a public utility subsidiary company
of Middle South, on the basis of 2% shares of common stock of Middle
South for each share of common stock of New Orleans. The Commission consolidated the plan proceeding with a proceeding instituted by
the Commission to determine what action, if any, should be taken by
Middle South and New Orleans pursuant to section 11 (b) (2) of the
act to insure that the corporate structure of New Orleans does not
unfairly or inequitably distribute voting power among its security
holders. A notice of filing was issued 32 and a hearing held, and, at
the end of the fiscal year, the matter was under advisement.
Following the announcement by the Government on July 11, 1955
(p. 85 of the 21st annual report) that the power contract between the
Atomic Energy Commission and Mississippi Valley Generating Co.,
a subsidiary of Middle South;" would be canceled, the Government
advised Mississippi Valley that no payments would be made under the
contract.
Subsequently, on November 4, 1955, Mississippi Valley
sued the Government in the Court of Claims and recovered a judgment
on behalf of itself and certain use plaintiffs."
Upon appeal by the
Government, the U.S. Supreme Court reversed the judgment on the
ground that the conflict of interest on the part of one of the Government's participants in the negotiations leading up to the power arrangements vitiated the contract. 35 Mississippi Valley's assets 36
aggregate about $524,000 and its liabilities, including expenses incurred in connection with the litigation in the Court of Claims and
Supreme Court, approximate $1,824,000, leaving an excess of liabilities over assets of about $1,300,000. Middle South, in a proceeding
pending at the close of the fiscal year, proposed to make available
about $1,027,000 31 to pay the claims against Mississippi Valley, which
is to be dissolved."

National Fuel Gas Co.

As at December 31, 1960,the National Fuel system had consolidated
assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $215,011,000,and the
system had consolidated operating revenues of $113,118,000 for the
year 1960.
In July 1960, a plan was filed by National Fuel pursuant to section
11(e) of the act for the elimination of the 5.95-percent minority
interest in the common stock of one of its gas utility subsidiary companies, Pennsylvania Gas Co. The plan provides for the exchange
of shares of the common stock of National for the publicly held shares
of common stock of Penn Gas. The Commission consolidated the
plan proceeding with a proceeding instituted by the Commission to
determine what action, if any, should be taken by National and Penn
Gas, pursuant to section 11(b) (2) of the act, to ensure that the corporate structure of Penn Gas does not unfairly or inequitably distribute
voting power among its security holders. Hearings were held and
briefs were filed and, at the end of the fiscal year, the matter was
pending before the Commission for determination.
During the fiscal year, a gas utility subsidiary, Penn-York Natural
Gas Corp., sold its physical assets to an affiliated company and thereafter dissolved."
New England Electric System

As at December 31, 1960, this registered holding company and its
subsidiaries had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of $624,697,000; and, for the year ended on that date, the system's consolidated operating revenues amounted to $179,939,000.
In its findings and opinion and order issued February 20, 1958, the
Commission held that the electric properties of New England Electric
System (NEES) and its subsidiaries constituted an integrated electric utility system retainable under common control under the integration standards of section 11(b) (1) of the act.40 The order of
February 20, 1958, reserved for later determination the question of
whether any or all of the gas properties owned and operated by the
NEES system are retainable under the integration standards of the
actY The hearing has been concluded with respect to the retainability of the system's gas properties and, at the close of fiscal year,
requested findings and briefs were in preparation by the participants.
On January 9,1961, the Commission approved a proposal by NEES
""Iroquois Gas Corp. et al., Rohling Company Act Release No. 14409 (Apr. 13, 1961) .
.. 38 S.E.C. 193. At Dec. 31, 1960, the NEES system's gross electric plant account (1neluding work in progress) aggregated $638,109,000, and revenues from electric sales In
1960 amounted to $152,159,000.
â€¢, At Dec. 31, 1960, the NEES system's gross gas plant (Including work In progrosa)
amounted to $62.518,000, and revenues from gas sales In 1960 amounted to $26,769,000.

seventh electric utility subsidiary." Under the proposal, Worcester
County Electric Co. (the name of which was subsequently changed to
Massachusetts Electric Co.) acquired all the assets of Attleboro Electric Co., Northampton Electric Lighting Co., Northern Berkshire
Electric Co., Quincy Electric Co., Southern Berkshire Power & Electric Co., and Weymouth Light & Power Co. The merged company constitutes the largest retail electric utility subsidiary of the NEES system. As at December 31, 1960, its assets, after deducting valuation
reserves amounted to $116,730,000and its revenues in 1960 amounted to
$63,051,000, both figures giving pro forma effect to the merger.
During the fiscal year a hearing was held to determine whether
(a) the Commission should approve a plan filed under section l1(e)
of the act by NEES providing for the issuance by NEES of additional shares of its common stock in exchange for the 2.82-percent
publicly held shares of the common stock of its electric subsidiary,
Lynn Electric Co., and (b) whether an order should be entered under
section 11(b) (2) of the act directing the elimination of the publicly
held interest in Lynn. Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year the
Commission issued its findings and opinion and order approving the
plan and, in addition, directing the elimination of the minority
interest."
On December 30, 1959, the Commission issued an order under section 13 of the act conditionally approving a proposal by NEES and
its subsidiary service company, New England Power Service Co.,
providing for the transfer to the Service Co.'s, payroll of the salaries
of all officers and employees of NEES who are also officers and employees of the Service CO.H The order of December 30, 1959, provided that the authority granted thereunder would expire on June
30, 1961, unless the Commission continued the authorization.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, the Commission issued an order,
subject to certain conditions, authorizing the indefinite continuance
of the arrangement. 4~

the plant.
Ohio Edison Co.

This company is a registered holding company and an operating
electric utility company. Ohio Edison and its electric utility subsidiary, Pennsylvania Power Co., had consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of approximately $660,132,000 at December 31, 1960,
and system consolidated operating revenues for the year then ended
amounted to about $159,947,000.
Ohio Edison has a 16.5 percent interest in the common stock of
Ohio Valley Electric Corp. The status of such holding is discussed
under Allegheny Power System, Inc., above.
During the fiscal year, the Commission approved 41 a proposal of
Ohio Edison concerning adoption of a restricted stock option plan
which is substantially similar to the one proposed by Middle South and
discussed above.
The Southern Co.

As at December 31, 1960, this system had consolidated assets, less
valuation reserves, of approximately $1,400,312,000, and, for the year
then ended, it had consolidated operating revenues of about $319,162,000.
On August 1, 1947, the Commission entered an order, pursuant to
section 11(b) (1) of the act, requiring, among other things, the divestment from the Southern system of the bus properties and business
operated in Rome, Ga., by Georgia Power CO.48 No plan having been

Union Electric Co.

Union Electric is a registered holding company and a public-utility
company. As at December 31, 1960, the consolidated assets, less valuation reserves, of Union Electric and its subsidiaries amounted to
approximately $642,830,000, and system consolidated operating
revenues for the calendar year 1960 totaled about $159,189,000.
.As indicated at pages 141-142 of the Commission's 26th annual
report, Union Electric has filed with the Commission an application
for exemption as a holding company from the provisions of the
Holding Company Act pursuant to section 3(a) (2) thereof, and briefs
were filed by Union Electric, by J. Raymond Dyer, a stockholder of
the company, and by the staff of the Division of Corporate Regulation.
Oral argument was held and the matter was pending at the close of the
fiscal year.
The three cases arising out of the objections of Dyer to the solicitation of proxies by the company's management which were pending
before the courts at the close of the last fiscal year have been decided. 51
The Commission's order, permitting Union Electric's proxy material
to become effective and thus authorizing the solicitation with respect
to the 1957 annual stockholders meeting, was affirmed by the Court
of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit, 52 as was the Commission's order
with respect to the 1959 proxy material. 53 That court also affirmed
the Commission's order denying Dyer's request that the Commission
process Union Electric's proxy material for its 1960 annual meeting
pursuant to the provision of the Holding Company Act rather than
under the Securities Exchange Act.54 In addition, the same court

from soliciting proxies until a declaration had been filed and the
Commission had permitted it to become effective, However, the Court
vacated the injunctive decree as being too broad, since it prohibited

pursuant to authorizations granted by the Commission under sections
6 and 7 of the act, 28 issues of their stock and long-term debt securities
aggregating $555 million." Of this amount, $15 million was used
for the purpose of refunding outstanding debt securities carrying
higher rates of interest. The balance of $540 million represented
securities sold for the purpose of raising new capital. Of the 18

The table does not include securities issued and sold by subsidiaries
to their respective parent holding companies, issuance of short-term

notes to banks, portfolio sales by any of the system companies, nor
securities issued for stock or assets of nonaffiliated companies. These
issuances and sales also required authorization by the Commission
except in the case of the issuance of notes having a maturity of less
than 9 months where the aggregate amount did not exceed 5 percent

securities is exempted by the provisions of section 6 (b) of the act.
Competitive Bidding

All of the 28 issues of securities sold for cash in fiscal 1961, as
shown in the preceding table, were offered at competitive bidding
pursuant to the requirements of rule 50 promulgated under the act.
Three other issues of securities, not included in the table, were sold

requirements of rule 50 with respect to the proposed sale of both blocks
of Louisiana Gas stock, totaling 710,000 shares. All of the 670,000
shares held by Louisiana Power were sold during the fiscal year, but
no part of the 40,000 shares to be offered by Louisiana Gas was sold.

shares of Consolidated's capital stock in connection with the proposed
acquisition by Peoples Natural Gas Co., a subsidiary of Consolidated,
of all of the assets of Union.
During the period from May 7, 1941, the effective date of rule 50,
to June 30,1961, a total of 823 issues of securities with aggregate sales
value of $12,023 million were sold at competitive bidding under the

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ISSUANCE OF LONG.TERM DEBENTURES BY SUBSIDIARY PUBLIC
UTILITY COMPANIES

During the fiscal year, applications were filed under the act by two
nonaffiliated public utility subsidiary companies of registered holding
companies, seeking, in each case, authority to issue and sell unsecured
long-term debentures. The applications were filed by Pennsylvania
Electric Co. ("Penelec"), a public utility subsidiary company of General Public Utilities Corp. ("GPU"), for an issue of $12 million
principal amount of 25-year debentures, and by Indiana & Michigan
Electric Co. ("Indiana & Michigan"), a public utility subsidiary
company of American Electric Power Co., Inc., for an issue of $20
million principal amount of 25-year debentures. After thorough
consideration, the Commission approved both transactions on May
25, 1961.65
In passing upon the Penelec proposal, the Commission noted in its
findings and opinion 66 that it departed from the pattern of financing
theretofore followed by Penelec and the GPU holding-company system of having outstanding in the hands of the public, except for
short-term notes issued to commercial banks, only two layers of securities of subsidiary public utility companies, i.e., first mortgage bonds
and cumulative preferred stock. The debenture issue, by reason of its
approval by the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the State
commission of the State in which Penelec is organized and doing
business, was exempt, under the provisions of section 6 (b) of the
act, from the financing standards prescribed by section 7 of the act,
subject to the imposition of such terms and conditions as the Commission might deem appropriate in the public interest or the interest
of investors or consumers. The Commission observed that it was
required to give weight to the decision of the State regulatory agency
and that it may impose conditions only to the extent that the security
issue offends the basic standards and policies of the act and thereby
creates the likelihood of those abuses which led to passage of the act;
and that, in effect, a greater degree of latitude is permitted in applymg the standards and policies of the act to a security approved by a
State commission than to an issue subject to all provisions of section
7; but that, where there is a material variance from those standards
and policies, it is the responsibility of the Commission, despite State
approval, to impose appropriate terms and conditions. The Commission noted that the issuance of the proposed debentures would create
an additional layer of long-term securities of Penelec in the hands
esPennsylvania Electric Oo., Holding Company Act Release No. 14451, and Indiana <$
Michigan Electric Co., Holding Company Act Release No. 1441>3
.
.. Although the Commission did not Issue a findings and opinion In respect of the
Indiana & Michigan financing, the Commission's contemporaneous approval of that company's proposal was bottomed on the same general considerations as those set forth in the
Penelec findings and opinion.

of the public, thus having a tendency to create a complexity in the
corporate structure of Penelec, and of the GPU holding-company
system.
The Commission considered Penelec's contentions that (a) after
issuance of the debentures, its common stock equity "cushion" would
still be adequate to preserve its stability to issue additional senior
securities even when economic conditions are unfavorable to the issuance of additional common stock; and (b) it had considered the
advisability of issuing additional preferred stock but had rejected this
as an uneconomical method of raising capital under present tax rates."
Penelec represented to the Commission that, unless conditions not
110W contemplated change radically, it will abandon any future issuances of preferred stock; and GPU and its subsidiary companies expect to give early consideration to the feasibility of retiring the
system's outstanding preferred stock." In view of these representations, and in light of the pro forma capitalization ratios and earnings
coverage of both Penelec and the GPU system, the Commission deemed
it unnecessary to consider what terms and conditions might appropriately be imposed if it had concluded that the proposed creation
of an additional layer of permanent securities was a material variance from the policies and standards of the act. In addition, the
Commission noted that the indenture under which the proposed
debentures were to be issued and which had been the subject of extended conferences between the company and the Commission's staff,
contained various protective provisions, including annual cash sinking fund payments designed to retire 48 percent of the issue before
maturity thereof; limitations on the payment of common stock dividends; a limitation on short-term indebtedness; and certain conditions, in terms of capitalization ratios and interest coverage, in respect
of additional issuance of long-term debt.
CAPITAUZATION

RATIOS AND ACCOUNTING FOR DEFERRED TAXES

An important development during the past fiscal year related to
capitalization ratios and accounting for deferred taxes arising from
the taking of liberalized depreciation and accelerated amortization
for tax purposes (pursuant to sees. 167 and 168of the Internal Revenue
Code) while taking straight-line depreciation for financial accounting purposes. The questions involved arose in connection with an
application filed pursuant to section 6 (b) of the act by Kentucky
<l7 In this connection, however, the Commission again took the opportunity of reiterating
Its longstanding view that the deductibility for tax purposes of interest on debt capital
should not be employed as a basis for an excessive debt ratio in a company's capital
structure
.. The elimination of Penelec's outstanding preferred stock would, of course, restore Its
flnancing pattern to only two layers of publicly held long-term securities.

COMMISSION

Power Co., a public utility subsidiary company of American Electric
Power Co., Inc., a registered holding company, proposing the issuance
of $40 million long-term notes to banks.
The balance sheet of Kentucky filed as an exhibit to the application
contained an amount of $831,825 designated "Earned Surplus Restricted for Future Federal Income Taxes" and the consolidated balance sheet of American and its subsidiaries contained an amount of
$94,698,293 which was similarly designated. The Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation contended that this treatment was not
consistent with the Commission's statement of policy regarding balance
sheet treatment of credit equivalent to reduction in income taxes."
Under the statement of policy, such accumulated tax reduction, if
material in amount, may not be designated as "earned surplus" (or its
equivalent) or in any manner as a part of equity capital (even though
accompanied by words of limitation such as "restricted" or "appropriated") .
After several weeks of hearings counsel for Kentucky and American, and counsel for the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation, entered into discussions looking to the possible settlement of
the issues which had been raised. An agreement was reached which
was submitted to and approved by the Commission."
Under the settlement proposal, as approved, supplemental financial
statements were filed by both companies which the Commission found
not in contravention of its statement of policy. In the new financial
statements, the accumulated reductions are carried under a designation
reading: "Accumulated Amount Invested in the Business Equivalent
to Reduction in Federal Income Taxes Resulting From Accelerated
Amortization and Liberalized Depreciation, Which Is Recorded as
Earned Surplus Restricted for Future Federal Income Taxes in Accounts Maintained Pursuant to State Regulatory Requirements."
As part of the settlement, the Commission also approved certain
ratio tests concerning the future capital structure of the various companies in the American holding-company system. The opinion in the
matter stated that in future financings by companies in the system,
the Commission will give due weight to the existence of the accumulated tax reduction and its size in determining appropriate capitalization ratios; and, so long as the consolidated balance sheet of American and its subsidiary companies, or the corporate balance sheet of any
of its subsidiary companies, includes a substantial amount of accumulated tax reduction, the Commission will not take any adverse action
in respect of capitalization ratios where, upon completion of the
financing: (a) common stock equity is not less than 30 percent of total

and preferred stocks of public-utility companies subject to the act,
examines the applicable mortgage indentures and charter provisions
to insure that there is substantial conformity with the standards set
forth in the statements of policy adopted by the Commission in 1956.71
These statements of policy represent a codification of the principles
and policies which the Commission had theretofore been administering on a case-by-case basis, and which the Commission had found
necessary and desirable for the protection of investors in first mortgage
bonds and preferred stocks of public utility companies. Except where,
in particular circumstances, deviations from the statements of policy
are clearly warranted, the Commission has uniformly required conformity with the statements."
During the fiscal year, applications or declarations were filed by
public utility companies under the act with respect to 14 first mortgage bond issues involving an aggregate principal amount of $265,500,000,73 and four preferred stock issues with a total par value of
$29,500,000.
Among other things, the statement of policy with respect to first
mortgage bonds requires that, under certain circumstances, the distribution of earned surplus to common stockholders be restricted, In
respect of 4 of the 14 bond issues filed by public utility companies
under the act during the fiscal year, this requirement of the statement
of policy was adequately provided for in the existing indentures. In
the other 10 bond issues, additional restrictions were required, and
were provided for either on the initiative of the issuer or as a result

of informal discussions between the Commission's staff and representatives of the issuer.
In recoznition
of the fact that the mortgaged utility property
b
constitutes the bulk of the bondholders' security, the statement of
policy for bonds also requires the periodic renewal and replacement
of the depreciable mortgaged utility property. In substance, this
requirement obligates the issuer to construct property additions (or,
alternatively, to deposit cash or outstanding bonds with the trustee)
in an amount which, over the estimated useful life of the mortgaged
depreciable property, will provide for the replacement in kind or in
cash of the book cost of the mortgaged property. The statement of
policy requires that the mortgage indenture express the periodic
renewal and replacement provision as a percent of the book cost of
depreciable property, but alternatively permits existing indenture
provisions expressed on some other basis-as, for example, a percent
of operating revenues-to remain unchanged if the issuer can satisfactorily demonstrate to the Commission that the existing provision
affords substantially the same protection as that based on a percent-ofproperty basis.
The indentures of 11 of the 14bond issues sold during the fiscal year
expressed the renewal and replacement provision as a percent of
depreciable property deemed adequate by the Commission. The indentures pertaining to the other three bond issues expressed the
requirement as a percent of revenues which the Commission found
afforded protection to the bondholders at least equal to that which
would be afforded under an appropriate percent-of-property basis.
In the case of the four issues of preferred stock with an aggregate
par value of $29,500,000,in respect of which applications or declarations were filed during the fiscal year. three issues had charter provisions which substantially conformed with the statement of policy
for preferred stock. In the case of the fourth issue, certain charter
provisions (or omissions) were found to be inconsistent with the statement of policy in respect of (a) the issuance of additional preferred
stock or other capital stock ranking prior thereto, (b) amendment of
the charter in a manner adverse to the preferred stockholders, (c) redemption or reacquisition of outstanding preferred stock during
periods when dividends thereon are in arrears, (d) mergers or consolidations and (e) the issuance or assumption of unsecured indebtedness.
The Commission, therefore, in approving the proposed issue of preferred stock, conditioned its order so as to extend to the holders of the
preferred stock the protective features prescribed by the statement
of policy."

During the fiscal year, the Commission has continued to require
adherence to the provision contained in both the bond and the preferred stock statements of policy that the securities be freely refundable at the option of the issuer upon reasonable notice and payment of
a reasonable redemption premium, if any." Continuing studies made
by the Commission's staff for fiscal year 1961 with respect to electric
and gas utility bond issues sold at competitive bidding, whether or not
subject to the act, indicate that the presence or absence of a restriction on free refundability has not affected the number of bids received
by an issuer at competitive bidding or the ability of the winning
bidder to market the bonds. This finding coincides with that described in the 26th annual report, at pages 149-150, containing a
summary of the 'results of an examination of all electric and gas
utility bond issues (including debentures) sold at competitive bidding
between }\fay 14, 1957, and June 30, 1960, by companies subject to
the act as well as those not so subject. This study has been extended
to include fiscal year 1961.
During the period from May 14, 1957, to June 30, 1961, a total of
310 electric and gas utility bond issues, aggregating $6,563.1 million
principal amount, was offered at competitive bidding. The refundable issues numbered 240 and accounted for a total of $4,434.1million,
while the nonrefundable issues-all except one being nonrefundable
for a period of 5 years, and that one being nonrefundable for a period
of 7 years-numbered 70 and totaled $2,129million principal amount.
The number of refundable issues thus represented 77.4 percent of the
total number of issues, while, in terms of principal amount, the
refundable issues accounted for 67.6 percent."
The weighted average number of bids received on the refundable
issues for the period was 4.57, while on the nonrefundable issues it was
4.23. The median number of bids was five on the refundable and four
on the nonrefundable issues." 1Vith respect to the success of the
marketing of the bond issues, an issue was considered to have been
successfully marketed if at least 95 percent of the issue was sold at
the syndicate price up to the date of termination of the syndicate. On
this basis, 13.8 percent of the refundable issues were successful, "while

standards of the act and as a matter of practical finance, was discussed at some length

'70 percent of the nonrefundable ones were successful." In terms of
principal amount, '70.8 percent of the refundable issues were successful, while 66.6 percent of the nonrefundable ones were successful."
Extension of the comparison to include the aggregate principal
amounts all issues which were sold at the applicable syndicate prices
up to the termination of the respective syndicates, regardless of
whether a particular issue met the definition of a successful marketing, indicates that 87.6 percent of the combined principal amount of
all the refundable issues were so sold, as compared with 83.8 percent
for the nonrefundable issues." These statistics developed in respect
of the two groups of bond issues support the Commission's policy of
requiring free refundability of utility bond issues subject to the act.
In connection with this policy of the Commission, it may be noted
that, during the fiscal year, National Fuel Gas Co., a registered holding company, sold at competitive bidding $2'7 million principal
amount of 4%-percent sinking fund debentures due 1986 and used a
portion of the proceeds from the sale to redeem, at 106.01 percent of
principal amount, $15 million principal amount of its outstanding
5lh-percent sinking fund debentures which were issued in 1957 with
maturity in 1982. Such redemption will effectuate a savings in capital
costs over the remainder of the original life of the redeemed issue.
If these 5lh-percent debentures due 1982 had been nonrefundable for
a 5-year period the company would have been unable to effectuate the
redemption.
In the 25th annual report, at page 141, and in the 26th annual report,
at pages 150-51, reference was made to a comprehensive study of
redemption provisions of corporate bonds being conducted at the
Wharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of
Pennsylvania.
The final results of this study were not available as
of the close of the fiscal year 1961.

In connection with the numerous plans of reorganization of holding

the years pursuant to the provisions of section 11 of the act, the holders

securities, some security holders have failed to surrender their "old"
securities. The Commission has made continuing efforts to insure that
all reasonable steps are taken to locate and to give notice to the security holders entitled to effect an exchange. Establishing contact is
often difficult due to the death of registered holders, the lack of recent
addresses, and the like, and is frequently complicated by the fact that
many of the securities had been considered by their owners to be
virtually worthless. In many instances, the further exchange of
securities has been barred by the lapsing of the period fixed for exchange in the plan of reorganization or in the order of the appropriate
Federal district court enforcing the plan. However, there are many
cases in which the "bar date" on exchanges has not passed or in which
no time limit has been fixed.
The staff of the Division of Corporate Regulation checks upon
efforts made by the various companies to contact and locate holders
of unexchanged securities and, in order to explain the situation and
clear up misunderstandings, frequently communicates with such security holders by letter and, occasionally, by telephone. In most
instances, the companies are urged to employ the services of a professional tracing agency to locate missing shareholders or their heirs.
Where an extension of the period for exchanging shares appears
necessary, either the company involved or the Commission will petition the appropriate court for additional time.
During the past fiscal year renewed and more intensive efforts
were made by the Commission to locate "lost security holders." .A
further review was made of all reorganization plans under section 11
to determine instances where there was no "bar date" or the time for
exchange of securities had not yet expired, and more than 100 questionnaires were sent by the Commission's Division of Corporate Regulation to companies, banks, and exchange agents inquiring as to the
status of any unexchanged securities and what efforts had been made
or were contemplated to locate the rightful owners of the securities .
.As a result, renewed efforts were made by the exchange agents, with
the aid of professional tracing agencies in some instances. While
there can be no exact measurement of the benefits of this inquiry,
thousands of dollars worth of securities have found their way to their
beneficial owners, who, often are in financial need.

PART VII
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANK.
RUPTCY ACT
The Commission's role under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act,
which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the
United States district courts, differs from that under the various
other statutes which it administers in that the Commission does not
initiate chapter X proceedings or hold its own hearings. It has no
authority to determine any of the issues in these proceedings. However, at the request of the judge or on the Commission's own
motion, if approved by the judge, the Commission may participate
in such proceedings in order to provide independent, expert assistance to the court, the participants, and investors on matters arising
in such proceedings and, where the Commission considers such action
appropriate, it may file advisory reports on reorganization plans.
Thus, the facilities of the Commission's technical staff and its disinterested recommendations are placed at the service of the judge and
the parties, affording them the views of impartial experts in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. The Commission pays
special attention to the interests of public security holders, who may
not otherwise be effectively represented.
Where the scheduled indebtedness of a debtor corporation exceeds
$3 million, the judge under section 172 of chapter X must, before
approving any plan of reorganization, submit it to the Commission
for its examination and report. If the indebtedness does not exceed
$3 million, the judge may, if he deems advisable, submit the plan to
the Commission before deciding whether to approve it. Where the
Commission files a report, copies of it, or a summary thereof, must
be sent to all security holders and creditors when they are asked to
vote on the plan. The Commission has no authority to veto or require
the adoption of a plan of reorganization and is not obligated to file
a formal advisory report on a plan.
The Commission's advisory reports on plans of reorganization are
usually widely distributed and serve an important function. However, they represent only one aspect of the Commission's activities
in cases in which it participates. The Commission, as a party to a
128

T~ENTY-SEVENTII

~AL

REPORT

129

chapter X proceeding, is actively interested in the solution of every
major issue arising therein, and the adequate performance of its
duties requires that it undertake in most cases intensive legal and
financial studies. Even in cases where the plans are not submitted
to the Commission and no report is filed, the Commission must consider various reorganization proposals of interested parties while
plans are being formulated, and be prepared to comment fully upon
all plans that are the subject of hearings for approval or confirmation.
In the exercise of its functions under chapter X, the Commission
has endeavored to assist the courts in achieving equitable, financially
sound, expeditious, and economical readjustments of the affairs of
corporations in financial distress. To aid in attaining these objectives the Commission has lawyers, accountants, and financial analysts
in its New York, Chicago, and San Francisco regional offices who
keep in close touch with all chapter X hearings and issues. Supervision and review of the regional offices'chapter X work is the responsibility of the Division of Corporate Regulation of the Commission,
which also handles the actual trial work in cases arising in the Atlanta
and Washington, D.C., regional areas.
SUMMARY

OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission actively participated in 56 reorganization proceedings involving 85 companies (56 principal debtor corporations and
29 subsidiaries of those debtors) during the past fiscal year.' The
stated assets of these 85 companies totaled approximately $599,477,000
and their indebtedness totaled approximately $559,735,215. The
proceedings were scattered among district courts in 23 States and the
District of Columbia as follows: 10 proceedings in New York ; 5 each
in Illinois and Kentucky; 4 in Texas; 3 each in Oklahoma and
Maryland; 2 each in Iowa, Pennsylvania, California, Colorado,
Michigan, North Carolina, Nevada, and Utah; and 1 each in 1Vashington, Virginia, New Jersey, North Dakota, Kansas, Georgia, Louisiana,
Wyoming, Florida, and the District of Columbia.
During the year, the Commission entered its appearance in 11 new
proceedings under chapter X involving companies with aggregate
stated assets of approximately $32,383,000and aggregate indebtedness
of approximately $27,615,215. They involved the rehabilitation of
corporations engaged in the operation of such varied businesses as
a deluxe resort motel, an automobile parts fabricator, an aluminum
product fabricator, TV tube rehabilitation, amusement park, oil and
gas exploration, mutual investment fund, apartment and transient
hotel, an insured 10-percent second mortgage broker, meat packing,

manufacture of cosmetics, a machine shop, and real estate development.
Proceedings involving eight principal debtor corporations were
closed during the year. At the end of the year, the Commission was
actively participating in 48 reorganization proceedings involving 75
companies.
THE COMMISSION AS A PARTY TO PROCEEDINGS

The Commission has not considered it necessary or appropriate that
it participate in every chapter X case. Apart from consideration
of the excessive administrative burden of participating in everyone
of the 111 cases initiated during the fiscal year, many of the cases
involve only trade or bank creditors and few stockholders. The
Commission has sought to participate principally in those proceedings
in which a substantial public-investor interest is involved. This
is not the only criterion, however, and in some cases involving only
limited public-investor interest, the Commission has participated
because an unfair plan had been or was about to be proposed, the
public security holders were not adequately represented, the reorganization proceedings were being conducted in violation of important
provisions of the act, the facts indicated that the Commission could
perform a useful service, or the judge requested the Commission
to participate."
MATTERS RELATED TO THE PROCEEDINGS

When a party in chapter X proceedings, the Commission has urged
upon the court the procedural safeguards to which all parties are
entitled. The Commission also has attempted in its interpretations
of the statutory requirements to encourage uniformity in the construction of chapter X and the procedures thereunder.
In its efforts to protect the public security holder the Commission,
in the case of M agio M owntain, Ina.,s filed objections to the referee's
report which had recommended that the debtor's voluntary petition
for reorganization be dismissed. The debtor owned an amusement
park which was only partially completed. The Commission in its

objections pointed out to the court that there were 12,000 holders of
the common stock of the debtor and stated that "nothing is more
demonstrative of the need for reorganization" than the possibility
that these stockholders might be wiped out by the many pending
:foreclosure actions. The Commission urged that a disinterested
trustee be appointed to determine whether the corporation could be
reorganized, and to investigate the conduct of the debtor's former
management. The district court judge entered an order in accordance with the Commission's views.
In Kirohofer and Arnold, Inc.,4 and in connection therewith, in
Morehead Oity Shipbuilding,
Inc.,ll a subsidiary, although it was
clear that the debtors would have to be liquidated because hopelessly
insolvent, the Commission recommended that the debtors not be
adjudicated bankrupts since this would involve a precipitous liquidation with great loss to the security holders. Rather, the Commission recommended that the chapter X court retain its jurisdiction
and conduct an orderly liquidation pursuant to a plan in an attempt
to obtain a better price for the debtors' assets.
Similarly, in Dieie Aluminum
Oorporation,6 after the trustee's
report that no plan of reorganization could be effected without substantial additional operating capital, and that no one could be found
who was interested in making such an investment, the court adjudicated the debtor a bankrupt. However, after advice by Commission
counsel that liquidation pursuant to a plan under chapter X would be
more appropriate for the protection of the public security holders, the
district judge vacated his order and retained jurisdiction under
chapter X.
In the H. H. Mundy Oorporation case 1 the Commission objected
to the retention of the trustee's attorney on the grounds that he was
not "disinterested" as defined in section 158 of the Bankruptcy Act
since he was an attorney for a director of the debtor and assisted the
debtor's counsel in the preparation of the chapter X petition.
Following the staff's objection, the trustee's attorney resigned.
In the Food Town, Inc. case 8 the Commission objected to a proposed
order for general employment of an accounting firm to assist the
trustee in his section 167 investigation since this firm had audited
the debtor's books at the time a purported fraud was committed. The
court approved the employment of the firm, but limited its employment to matters unrelated to its adverse interest in order to meet the
objections of the Commission.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In the Muntz TV, Inc. case," following consummation of the plan,
one of the debtor's trustees was designated as the chief executive
officerof the reorganized company at a salary of $10,000 a year. It
has been the Commission's consistent policy to oppose the employment of a trustee or his counsel by the reorganized debtor. This
policy is based on the theory that the eff'ecti veness of the trustee's
position, so far as the public security holders are concerned, depends
on his disinterested attitude. The Commission recommended to the
court that the trustee, who was still occupying that position, should
not be permitted to serve also in an important salaried position with
the reorganized company. The court, however, did not follow the
Commission's recommendation. Instead it allowed the trustee a
substantial fee for his services in addition to the salary being paid him
as chief executive officer.
In the TJIT Trailer Ferry, Inc. case 10 the Commission objected to
the claims of Merrill-Stevens Drydock and Repair Co., one of the
largest TMT creditors, on various grounds. The court allowed the
Commission time to investigate and file specifications in support of
its objections. This matter is still pending.
In the Swan-Finch Oil Corporation. proceeding 11 the court of appeals upheld the Commission's viewpoint, set forth in the Commission's
26th annual report," that a petition for the reorganization of a
subsidiary under chapter X could be filed in the court in which the
chapter X reorganization of the parent was pending notwithstanding
the pendency of a chapter XI proceeding for the subsidiary in another
district.

In Piclcmam.Trust Deed Oorporation,13 the debtor operated a second

notes secured by trust deeds were purchased by Pickman to be placed
into customers' accounts on the basis of a 10 percent annual return.
Pickman, which obtained $5 million from investors, is 1 of 12
companies which have operated in this manner in California and are
currently in financial difficulties, representing total investments of
over $70 million.

were to be pooled for the benefit of all investors. The Commission,
however, advocated that each investor should be allowed to trace hie
specific note and reclaim it on an individual basis, on the ground that
otherwise contractual rights would be disregarded. The trustee, after
6 days of litigating the matter before the district court, proposed a
compromise whereby claimants to approximately $2,300,000 of notes
which were recorded in their names could elect to reclaim their notes
or remain in a pool. The Commission argued that the compromise
proposal was premature since a section 167 report had not been prepared by the trustee, in the absence of which customers would not have
the necessary information as to the status of the debtor to make an
intelligent choice whether to withdraw their notes or remain in a
pool. The court, however, approved the compromise and classified
investors as "secured creditors" rather than "owners," but with the
right to withdraw their underlying securities if their deeds were
recorded.
In DePaul Educational Aid Society,I4 the debtor was organized in
1927 as a nonprofit corporation to build and operate a building which
would house DePaul University while at the same time insulating
the university from any liability. The debtor issued 6-percent mortgage bonds to the public. "When the debtor went into a chapter X
reorganization in 1959 the Commission made an extensive investigation of its financial condition. The investigation showed that the
debtor was extremely undercapitalized.
Difficulties ensued from the
debtor's inception but the university kept the debtor alive with
financial aid during its first few years. However, when business
conditions worsened in the 1930's, the university withdrew its aid and
the debtor became insolvent. After the debtor passed through a
section 77B reorganization proceeding, the university secretly purchased about one-third of all the debtor's outstanding bonds at large
discounts while continuing to occupy the bulk of the debtor's rentable
space at a rental which barely covered minimum operating costs. It
was the Commission's contention, as well as that of the trustee, that,
DePaul University's claims should be subordinated to those of the
public bondholders. This matter is still pending.
In the case of Hudeon. and lJfanhattan Railroad Oompany 15 the
Commission took the position that the court should not approve the
action of the directors of the reorganized company in appointing the
trustee as the chief executive of the company and his counsel as
general counsel. The appointment of these persons to remunerative
positions was inconsistent with the policy of chapter X to maintain
the independence and disinterestedness of a trustee and of his counsel

until the termination of the proceeding. The Commission pointed out
that just as a chapter X trustee may retain special counsel for certain
limited purposes during a proceeding, where such counsel need not
be disinterested, it would not be inappropriate for the reorganized
company to employ either the trustee or his counsel for special
purposes. In this case, the possible sale of the company's assets to
a public authority would represent such a special purpose. The court
approved the directors' action because of the unique situation arising
out of the apparent imminence of sale negotiations.
TRUSTEE'S INVESTIGATIONS

A complete accounting for the stewardship of corporate affairs by
the old management is a requisite under the Bankruptcy Act and
chapter X. One of the primary duties of the trustee is to make a
thorough study of the debtor to assure the discovery and collection
of all assets of the estate, including claims against officers, directors,
or controlling persons who may have mismanaged the company's
affairs, diverted its funds to their own use or benefit, or been guilty
of other misconduct. The staff of the Commission participates in
the trustee's investigation so that it may be fully informed as to all
details of the financial history and business practice of the debtor.
The Commission views its duty under chapter X as requiring it to
call the attention of the trustee or the court, if necessary, to any
matters which should be acted upon.
In TMT Trailer Ferry, lno.,16 after the district court confirmed a
plan of reorganization which the Commission felt was inequitable
because, among other things, it returned control of the debtor to those
responsible for its downfall, the Commission prevailed upon the trustee to complete his section 167 report. Thereafter a hearing was held
which resulted in the district court vacating its previous order and
ordering the trustee to submit a new plan. An appeal was taken by
those who benefited under the original plan. Following the close of
the fiscal year, the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit affirmed the
district court order and denied a petition for rehearing."
In Equitable Plan Oompany 18 the trustee, holding a substantial
amount of shares of Doeskin Products, Ino., instituted a derivative
action in the Federal court on behalf of Doeskin to set aside the fraudulent issue of 1 million shares of Doeskin stock and to recover assets
misappropriated by officers and directors in the control of Lowell M.
Birrell. Doeskin moved to stay the action because of a prior stockholder's suit pending in the State court. The Commission appeared,

a substantial asset of Equitable Plan and that he should not be prevented from undertaking any action which he deemed necessary to that
end. The district court, in a decision based in part upon the Commission's position, denied the motion for a stay. The Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit affirmed."
In Automatic Washer 00., Ino.,20 the trustee obtained a judgment
for more than $500,000 for fraud in the alleged sale of rubber machinery to the debtor. While an appeal from this judgment was pending,
the defendant offered to compromise the judgment for $105,000 cash.
The Commission, along with a creditors' committee, objected to the
settlement on the ground, among others, that the trustee had not made
a real effort to determine whether the judgment could be satisfied.
The district court approved the settlement offer, and an appeal was
taken by the creditors' committee and a stockholders' committee in
which the Commission participated.
The Court of Appeals for the
Eighth Circuit reversed the district court's action and remanded the
case, stating that there had not been a sufficient investigation to enable
the district court to exercise an informed judgment,"
Shortly after
the close of the fiscal year, the same compromise, reduced to writing
and with a provision added that the judgment debtor should not be
interrogated as to his assets, was resubmitted to the district court.
After a full hearing, the trustee was directed to reject the offer.
The trustee also obtained a judgment of over $1 million against
Banker's Life and Casualty Co. as a result of an investigation in
which he was assisted by the Commission.
INTERVENTION IN CHAPTER XI PROCEEDINGS

Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure by which
debtors can effect arrangements with respect to their unsecured debts
under court supervision.
Where proceedings are brought under that
chapter which should have been brought under chapter X, section
328 of the Bankruptcy Act authorizes the Commission to make application to the court to dismiss the chapter XI proceeding unless the
petition that initiated the proceeding is amended to comply with the
protective requirements of chapter X.
In Life and Industrial Oompanies, Ino.,22 a parent and three affiliated companies which controlled manufacturing
plants producing
concrete and plating, filed chapter XI petitions on July 8, 1960. The
debtors' public investors included 225 holders of 6-percent subordi10 Fergu80n v. Tabah, 288 F. 2d 665 (C.A. 2, 1961).

COMMISSION

nated debenture bonds, 51 holders of preferred stock, and 1,324 holders of common stock, or a total of 1,600. An arrangement was
proposed on July 28, 1960, whereby the debtors would merge into a
new corporation. Stock of such corporation would be issued to the
unsecured creditors and stockholders. On October 7, 1960, the Commission, feeling that the proceedings under chapter XI were not
sufficient to protect the public security holders and that chapter XI
was being misused, filed a motion under section 328 of the Bankruptcy
Act to intervene and to dismiss the proceeding. In its motion the
Commission pointed out that what in effect was taking place was
a complete reorganization which was not authorized under chapter
XI. The Commission noted that reorganization of companies with
complex capital structures should be conducted under chapter X,
where appropriate substantive and procedural safeguards are supplied. The District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas denied
the Commission's motion but immediately adjudicated the debtors
bankrupt.
In Herold Radio and Electronics Corporation." the debtor had
been engaged in the business of manufacturing and distributing radios,
phonographs and other electronic equipment since 1950. The debtor
had outstanding $1,472,000principal amount of 6-percent convertible
subordinated debentures, 4,816 shares of $5 par value cumulative convertible preferred stock and 582,199shares of $0.25 par value common
stock. Except for 38 percent of the common stock which was held
by persons associated with management, these securities were all held
by members of the investing public. There were approximately 400
holders of debentures, 52 holders of preferred stock, and 1,600holders
of the common stock which was listed on the American Stock
Exchange.
On August 15, 1960, the debtor filed a petition in the District Court
for the Southern District of New York under section 322 of chapter
XI alleging inability to meet its debts as they matured and an intention to propose an arrangement. The Commission moved to intervene and to dismiss the debtor's petition unless it was amended to
comply with the requirements of chapter X.
The district court granted the Commission's motion and dismissed
the debtor's chapter XI petition as improperly filed on the grounds
that chapter XI is not available to a debtor when there are publicly
held securities and the corporation has need of a thoroughgoing reorganization and recasting of its capital structure. Subsequent to the
dismissal of the chapter XI proceeding, the debtor consented that it
be adjudicated a bankrupt.

In Trustors' Oorporation,24 the debtor filed a chapter XI petition
on April 3, 1961. The debtor dealt in second trust deed notes which it
sold to investors who were assured an annual return of 10 percent
on their investment. The company's operation was similar to that
in the Pickman Trust Deed case, supra. At the time the petition was
filed, there were outstanding $8,900,000face amount of notes held for
1,800 customers. Trusters' is itself an obligor on $1,500,000of these
trust deed notes. The debtor has outstanding 42,834 shares of 6 percent cumulative preferred stock held by 492 stockholders. The common stock is held by two of its officers.
'The Commission moved for dismissal of the petition on June 20,
19tH, stating that a proposal filed by the debtor in connection with
its plan of arrangement might modify its secured debts. Since only
chapter X can affect the rights of secured creditors the need for transferring the proceedings was evident. Subsequent to the close of the
fiscal year, the debtor abandoned the objectionable proposal and,
accordingly, the Commission withdrew its objections to the chapter
XI proceeding.
ACTIVITIES WITH REGARD TO ALLOWANCES

Every reorganization case ultimately presents the difficult problem
of determining the allowance of compensation to be paid out of the
debtor's estate to the various parties for services rendered and for
expenses incurred in the proceeding. The Commission, which under
section 242 of the Bankruptcy Act may not receive any allowance
from the estate for the services it renders, has sought to assist the
courts in protecting debtors' estates from excessive charges and at the
same time in equitably allocating compensation on the basis of the
claimants' contributions to the administration of estates and the
formulation of plans.
The role of the Commission with regard to fees was questioned in
the Liberty Baking Oorporation. case." Applications for allowances
from nine applicants requested a total of $341,693.53. The Commission's recommendations totaled $173,184.13. The court offered the
applicants an opportunity, if they desired, to cross-examine persons
responsible for the Commission's recommendations. The Commission
expressly declined a written request by several applicants to subject
the Commission or any of its members to cross-examination explaining
that the recommendations stated to the court by counsel were the
Commission's and that such inquiry would be analogous to examining
a judge concerning the bases of his decision. The Commission further

stated that the careful consideration accorded its views by some courts
derives from the Commission's unique position as a disinterested
party to the proceeding and its broad range of experience in cases of
this nature. The court thereafter awarded fees in the amount of
$229,090.
As reported in the Commission's 25th annual report," the Commission took the position that the attorney first appointed for the
trustees in the F. L. Jacobs Oompany case 21 was not "disinterested"
and he resigned while a decision was pending on the application for
his removal. He subsequently sought an allowance for services rendered prior to his resignation. The Commission opposed any award
to him since, as an experienced bankruptcy lawyer, he was well aware
of the significance of his acts. The court, however, granted him
compensation equal to 25 percent of the amount requested.
In the Stardust, Ino., case 28 applications for allowances totaling
$637,100were requested. The Commission recommended total overall
allowances of $326,925. At the end of the fiscal year the court had not
acted on the applications.
In El-Tronics, Inc.,29 applications for allowances were filed totaling
$462,500. The Commission recommended allowances totaling $180,000; no allowances were recommended for one of the counsel for a
trade creditors' committee and for its secretary. Counsel had traded
in the stock of the debtor during the proceeding and was disqualified
from an allowance under section 249 and withdrew his application.
The secretary of the creditors' committee, it appeared, had participated with third persons in the purchase of claims against the debtor
from creditors of the class represented by the committee. The claims,
after being voted in favor of the trustees' plan, were converted into
stock pursuant to the plan and thereafter sold at a substantial profit.
The Commission obtained an order from the court authorizing an
investigation of the activities of the secretary and others involved
in these transactions. The secretary moved to vacate the order of
investigation and for leave to withdraw his allowance application.
The Commission took the position that the order constituted an
appropriate exercise of the power of the court to look into the activities of a fiduciary during the proceeding and that permission should
not be granted to the secretary to withdraw his application pending
the outcome of the investigation. At the close of the fiscal year, the
decision on this matter and on the allowances had not been rendered .

PART VHI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT
OF 1939
The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as specifically exempted by the act, be. issued under an indenture which
meets the requirements of the act and has been duly qualified with the
Commission. These indentures must provide means by which the
rights of holders of securities issued under such indentures may be
protected and enforced by including provisions which relate to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee
to provide reasonable financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests. The act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly
used to eliminate all liability of the indenture trustee and imposes on
the trustee, after default, the duty to use the same degree of care
and skill "in the exercise of the rights and powers invested in it by
the indenture" as a prudent man would use in the conduct of his own
affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must be
contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities issued
in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities issued
under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority which,
although exempted from the registration requirements of the Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the qualification of
the indenture, including a statement of the required information
concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

ACT

The Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae during the course of
a reorganization, pursuant to section 122(a) of the Real Property law
of the State of New York, of the Hotel St. George Corp. which had
offered securities pursuant to an indenture qualified under the provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939. The Commission took the
position that in accordance with section 312(b) of the Trust Indenture
Act, the court should vacate its order directing the indenture trustee
not to send to all bondholders of the corporation proposed communications which had been submitted to the trustee by a protective committee comprised of certain of the bondholders. The Commission
suggested that if the trustee should be of the opinion that a mailing of
any such material would be contrary to the best interests of the
bondholders or would be in violation of applicable law, the trustee
should be directed to file a written statement to that effect with the
Commission, in accordance with the procedure specified in section
312(b) of the act. The matter was settled without a ruling by the
court on the Commission's motion to participate as amicus C11/1iae.

PART IX
ADMINISTRATION OF THE Th'VESTMENT COMPANY ACT
OF 1940
Companies primarily engaged in the business of investing, reinvesting, holding, and trading in securities are subject to registration and
regulation under the Investment Company Act of 1940. This act,
among other things, prohibits such companies Â£rom changing the
nature of their business or their investment policies without the
approval of their stockholders, requires disclosure of their finances
and investment policies, regulates the means of custody of the companies' assets, requires management contracts to be submitted to
security holders for their approval, prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more than a minority of
the directors of such companies, and prohibits transactions between
such companies and their officers, directors, and affiliates except with
the approval of the Commission. The act also regulates the issuance
of senior securities and requires face-amount certificate companies
to maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their
certificates.
The securities of investment companies which are offered to the
public are also required to be registered under the Securities Act of
1933 and the companies must file periodic reports. Such companies
are also subject to the Commission's proxy rules and closed-end companies are subject to "insider" trading rules. The Division of Corporation Finance and the Division of Corporate Regulation both assist
the Commission in the administration of the statute, the former being
concerned with the disclosure provisions and the latter with regulatory
provisions.
COMPANIES

UNDER

THE ACT

As of June 30, 1961,there were 663 investment companies registered
under the act, including 44 small business investment companies, and
the estimated aggregate market value of their assets on that date was
approximately $29 billion. These figures represent an overall increase
of 93 registered companies and an increase of roughly $5.5 billion

with the SBA, to determine the status of the Proposed Operator
under the Investment Company Act and the other statutes administered by the Commission. Both the proposed operator and the SBA
are notified as to the staff's conclusion in each case. A total of 356
such proposals were reviewed by the staff of the Commission during
the fiscal year.

INSPECTION

PROGRAM

The Commission initiated in 1957 a program for the periodic
inspection of investment companies pursuant to the statutory authority conferred under section 31(b) of the Investment Company Act.
Prior to the fiscal year 1961,57 companies had been inspected pursuant
to this program. An additional 56 companies were inspected in fiscal
year 1961. As in prior years, a number of inspections were undertaken by staff teams consisting of attorneys or analysts from the
Division of Corporate Regulation and securities investigators from
the appropriate field office. However, several of the regional offices
now have personnel experienced in the inspection of investment
companies and approximately 23 inspections were conducted exclusively with regional office personnel. This is consonant with the
Commission's program, which contemplates placing the principal
responsibility for making inspections in the regional offices as personnel in such officesbecome sufficiently experienced in the regulatory
provisions applicable to investment companies.
The inspections made indicated, in a number of instances, failure
to comply with various regulatory provisions of the Investment
Company Act or with the other statutes administered by the Commission. The 26th annual report discusses, at page 170, the irregu-

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

145

larities discovered in inspections made in previous years. Inspections
in the 1961 fiscal year disclosed a number of instances in which fund
prospectuses did not accurately or adequately describe the actual
practice of the funds, and as a result, the prospectuses were revised.
This involved such matters as the policy on control of portfolio
companies, interrelationships of several investment companies with
common management, and methods used in pricing shares for sale
and redemption. This year's inspection program also disclosed
several instances of failure to keep accurate and up-to-date minutes
of meetings of boards of directors, failure to obtain the requisite
shareholders' vote needed to approve an advisory contract, infrequent
attendance at meetings of certain directors, instances of portfolio
securities being held which were not in accordance with stated investment policies, expenses paid by funds which should have been paid by
the investment advisor, possible affiliations in violation of the act and
insufficiency of accounting records. Instances were noted where an
increase in the amount of fidelity bond was indicated. In one case
where sales of portfolio securities to affiliated persons were made
under circumstances which raised questions as to possible violations
of the prohibitions of the act, the transactions were reversed or the
fund was compensated for the difference between the sales price and
current market price on the date of the sale. Normally where
deficiencies are noted, unless other action is indicated, they are brought
to the attention of the investment companies involved so that corrective steps may be taken.
STUDY OF SIZE OF INVESTMENT COMPANIES

On behalf of the Commission, the Securities Research Unit of the
'Vharton School of Finance and Commerce of the University of
Pennsylvania has been conducting a factfinding survey in connection
with a study of the problems created by the growth in size of investment companies. This inquiry has been undertaken pursuant to
section 14(b) of the Investment Company Act. Information has
been obtained through questionnaires sent to registered investment
companies.
The first questionnaire was distributed in fiscal 1959 to all registered open-end investment companies and the information furnished
in response thereto is the basis for a report covering the following
subjects: Origin and Scope of the Study and Summary of Principal
Findings; The Organization and Control of Open-end Investment
Companies; Growth of Funds of the Investment Company Industry,
1952-1958; Open-end Investment Companies and Portfolio Company
Control ; Investment Policy; Investment Company Performance;
and Impact of Investment Funds on the Stock Market.

146

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

A second questionnaire, distributed in December 1960, will form
the basis of an additional report dealing with the relationships
between open-end companies and their investment advisers and principal underwriters.
It is expected that the complete report will be available to the Commission prior to the end of the calendar year 1961. With information
gained therefrom, the Commission will be in a position to determine
what further action by it is required and whether specific remedial
legislative recommendations should be made by the Commission to
the Congress.
CURRENT INFORMATION

The Commission's rules promulgated under the act require that the
basic information contained in notifications of registration and in
registration statements of investment companies be kept up to date,
through periodic and other reports, except in cases of certain inactive
unit trusts and face-amount companies. The following current reports and documents were filed during the 1961 fiscal year:

Quarter Iy reports_____________________________________________________

2,256

The foregoing statistics do not reflect the numerous filings of revised prospectuses by open-end mutual funds and unit investment
trusts making a continuous offering of their securities. These prospectuses, which must be checked for compliance with the act, are
required to show material changes which have occurred in the operations of the companies since the effective date of the prospectuses on
file. In this respect the registration of the securities of such companies is essentially different from the registration of the usual
corporate securities.
APPUCATIONS AND PROCEEDINGS

The Investment Company Act prohibits certain types of transactions in the absence of an exemptive order by the Commission issued
upon a determination that specified statutory standards have been
met. Accordingly, one of the principal activities of the Commission
in its regulation of investment companies is the consideration of
applications for such exemptive orders. Under Section 6 (c) the Commission, by rules and regulations, upon its own motion or by order
upon application, may exempt any person, security, or transaction
from any provision of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent
with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended
by the policy and provisions of the act. Other sections, such as 6 (d),

TWENTY-SEVENTH

147

ANNUAL REPORT

9(b), 10 (f), 17 (b), and 23 (c) contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which the Commission may grant exemptions from
particular sections of the act or may approve certain types of transactions. Also, under certain provisions of sections 2, 3, and 8 the
Commission may determine the status of persons and companies under
the act.
There were 216 applications under various sections of the Investment Company Act before the Commission during the fiscal year
1961. The various sections of the act with which these applications
were concerned and their disposition during the fiscal year are shown

Usually the applications for exemptions under the act are processed
without holding formal hearings; however, hearings are held when
the impact of the proposal upon investor or the public interest are
substantial or matters of fact or of law are in dispute.
In the past fiscal year, the following matters upon which hearings
had been held were determined :
As reported in more detail in the 26th annual report, page 178, The
Equity Oorp. consented to a judgment enjoining it from violation of
the anti pyramiding provisions of the act arising out of its continued
holdings of the common stock of Eq1tity General Corp, and Development Oorp. of America, both investment companies. Pursuant to the
method of compliance specified in such injunction, Equity General
was merged into Equity Corp.; the preferred stock of Development
Corp., which was publicly owned, was redeemed at its contract price;
and Development Corp. was merged into Equity Corp. The Commission exempted the Equity Corp.-Development Corp. merger from

148

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

section 17(a) of the act.' In connection with the merger, the common
stockholders of Development Corp., other than Equity, were paid
in cash $7.91 as the value of each share they held, unless they exercised their right to demand an appraisal under Delaware law.
The Commission also granted an exemption from section 17(a) of
the act to Madison Fund, Imc., and International Mining Corp. for the
sale of the assets of Canton Co. of Baltimore, 79 percent of whose
outstanding stock was owned by Madison, to Northside Warehouse
Corp., a subsidiary of International." The ownership by Madison
of an 8.3 percent interest in International created an affiliation which,
under the act, resulted in a bar to the transaction unless exempted.
I t was proposed that Northside would be merged with Canton and
the surviving corporation would acquire the Canton stock for $25
per share payable in cash and notes of International, which price
and other terms of the transactions the Commission considered to be
fair and reasonable and not to involve any overreaching. In exempting the transactions, the Commission found that the record did not
support the objections of a stockholder of International and a stockholder of both Madison and International, both of whom contended
that the transactions were unfair.
The Commission also granted an application pursuant to section
17(b) of the act filed by Oentu,ry Inoestors, Ino., and Web8ter Inmestors, Imc., investment companies, and American lIIanufrwtul'ing 00.,
Ino., an affiliate of Century and Webster, for an exemption with
respect to transactions incident to a merger of Century and Webster
into American," Under the proposal, each publicly held share of
common stock of Century and each publicly held share of common
stock of 'Webster were to be exchanged for 1.27 shares and 1.25 shares
of common stock of American, respectively. The Commission found
the exchange ratios reasonable and fair, that there was no overreaching involved, and that the terms of the proposed merger were consistent with the general purposes of the act. At American's request
the Commission deferred action on the application of American for
an order declaring that it would not be an investment company upon
consummation of the merger, conditioning such action on compliance
by American with its commitment that it would not engage in any
transactions which would be prohibited to a registered investment
company pending the Commission's determination of the company's
status.
An exemption was granted to Atlas Corp, and its controlled company, Mel'tronic8 Oorp., with respect to an offering of Summers GyroInvestment Company Act Release No. 3077, July 14, 1960.

scope Co. shares to their shareholders. 4 The purpose of the offering
was to effect a divestiture by Atlas and Mertronics of all their interests
in Summers in order to dispose of proceedings before the Civil Aeronautics Board arising out of interlocking relationships existing
between Atlas, which controls an air carrier, and Summers, which is
deemed to be engaged in a phase of aeronautics. The offering was
proposed to be made at '75cents per share through primary and secondary subscription rights. In order to assure complete divestiture of
their entire interest in Summers, Atlas and Mertronics entered into
agreements with a former officer and director of Atlas whereby he
undertook to purchase, at 75 cents per share, all shares of Summers
stock owned by them, subject to their prior right to offer such shares
to their shareholders. The Commission noted that it did not appear
necessary to decide the question of control of Atlas by the former
officer since the consideration to the former officer in return for his
obligation to purchase all unsubscribed Summers shares was reasonable and fair and no overreaching was involved. Accordingly, it was
appropriate to exempt the transactions from section I7(a) of the act
even if such affiliation existed.
Proceedings were instituted to determine whether an exemptive
order previously granted to the Securities Corporation General should
be revoked. The order exempted the sale by Securities of 51.25 percent of the outstanding stock of Anemostat Corp. of America to
Dynamics Corp. of America which held about 33 percent of such
stock. The proceedings were instituted when the Commission was
informed that the purported directors of Securities at the time the
sale was negotiated and the exemption application filed had not been
elected in accordance with the provision of the act which requires
directors of registered companies to be elected by the stockholders at
annual or special stockholder meetings. The Commission determined
not to revoke the exemptive order, rejecting a contention by a stockholder that because of noncompliance the exemptive order was automatically void and finding that the failure to comply with the requirements of the act relating to election of directors was inadvertent;
that the persons who caused the change inthe board of directors owned
a majority of the outstanding stock and could have elected, and at
the next regular stockholder meeting did elect, their representatives
as directors in compliance with the act and that there was no evidence
of fraud or overreaching in the transaction and the terms of the
transaction were reasonable and fair. 5
The Commission issued an exemption order under the act permitting Vornado,Ino., to purchase 160,000shares of its common stock

from Investors Diversified Seroioes, Lno., in exchange for $2,340,000
principal amount of Vornado's 3.10-percent junior subordinated
notes, due May 1,1976, and a warrant expiring April 27, 1967,to purchase 42,000 shares of Varnado common stock at $16 per share." The
terms of the contract of sale of the 160,000 shares of Vornado stock
were found to be fair and reasonable and not rendered unfair or unreasonable by subsequent market price increases in Vornado's stock.
The Commission granted an application of the Great American
Life Underwriters, Ino., for an exemption from the Investment Company Act of 1940, retroactive to January 1, 1941, the effective date of
the act," The company had discontinued the issuance and sale of
face-amount certificates prior to the effective date of the act but continued to receive payments on and to service outstanding securities
and accordingly was within the definition of an investment company.
In view of the discontinuance of the sale of such securities and the
Commission's conclusion that the company was primarily engaged
in the insurance business through controlled subsidiaries, the Commission concluded that the company should be granted an exemption
from the Investment Company Act on the ground that it is not the
type of company intended to be regulated thereunder. Among the
other considerations leading to this conclusion were the facts that the
company has a very substantial part of its investments in, and derives
a very substantial part of its income from, its holdings of stock in its
insurance subsidiary and that the company's officers and directors
have been active in the management and operation of the insurance
subsidiary. In determining that the exemption might be made retroactive, the Commission pointed out that the company would have been
entitled to the exemption at any time, that it failed earlier to file an
application for exemption because of good faith through mistaken
belief that it was not subject to the act, that it clearly is not now an
investment company and was at all times primarily engaged in the
insurance business, and its outstanding face-amount certificates were
at all times protected by reserves on deposit with a State agency and
have been reduced to the point where they are insignificant in comparison to applicant's assets.
An Arizona corporation called International Bank applied to the
Commission for an order declaring it not to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act, and the Commission
ordered hearings thereon." The company also seeks a temporary
exemption from the registration requirements of the act pending
final determination of its status under the act. It asserts that it is
not engaged in business as an investment company but is engaged,

Financial General Corp. and Iowa Interests Corp., in the small loan
business; international trade financing; registration of ships, servicing of corporations, and commercial banking in Liberia; life, fire,

A hearing was held in the case of Mid-America Mutual Fund, Inc.,G
on an application to allow it to sell its shares to certain insurance
policy holders at less than the public offering price. A decision is
pending.
The following significant decisions were issued by the Commission
in matters in which no formal hearing was held:
The Commission granted an application of Israel Development
Oorp. for an exemption from section 18(c) of the act with respect to
its issuance and sale of $3 million of debentures due 1976 while it has
outstanding $1,625,000of bank loans secured by the pledge of various
securities." The Commission's decision construed section 18(c) as
intended to make clear that a company might have outstanding both
publicly distributed and privately arranged debt securities only if
there were no differences in the preferences as to assets and interest of
any outstanding indebtedness. The exemption order is subject to the
condition that the bank loans be eliminated not later than August 22,
1962, and that thereafter, while the proposed debentures are outstanding, the company does not issue or sell any senior security representing
indebtedness containing a preference or priority over such debentures
in the distribution of its assets or in respect of the payment of interest.
The Commission also issued a decision granting an application of
Reinsurance Investment Oorp. for exemption from all provisions of
the act for a period of 1 year.!' As of September 30, 1960, the company had total assets valued at $5,596,722 and consisting of 1,152,000
shares of Loyal American Life Insurance Co., Inc., valued at
$3,312,000and 189,495 shares of American Income Life Insurance Co.
valued at $1,184,950 with the balance of its assets consisting mainly
of government securities and cash. According to the decision, the
company has majority voting control, although not majority ownership of American; Loyal American until recently was a majorityowned subsidiary and the company intends to acquire sufficient additional shares of Loyal American within 1 year to make it a majorityowned subsidiary; and, in such event, the company may no longer fall
within the definition of an investment company or may qualify for
exemption.

The Commission issued a decision and order exempting the merger
of Delaware Realty ill Investment Co. into Christiana Securities Co.
from the provisions of section 17(a) of the act." Delaware owned
32.7 percent of the outstanding common (voting) stock of Christiana.
The value of the total net assets of Christiana as of September 30,
1960, was approximately $2,418million of which 98.6 percent was represented by its holdings of common stock of E. I. du Pont de Nemours
& Co. On the same date, the value of the total net assets of Delaware
Realty was approximately $1,052 million, of which 74.5 percent was
represented by its holdings of Christiana common stock and 22.6
percent by its holdings of Du Pont common stock. Under the agree.
ment of merger, the common stock of Delaware was converted into
common stock of Christiana.
Variable Annuity Contracts

As described in detail in the 26th annual report," the Commission
on February 25, 1960, issued decisions granting certain exemptions
under the 1940 act to Variable Annuity Life Insurance Co. and
Equity Annuity Life Insuranoe 00., engaged in the business of
offering variable annuity contracts. Subsequent to an enabling
amendment to the District of Columbia Life Insurance Code, the
assets of each of these companies applicable to variable annuity contracts have been segregated into a separate fund which is available
only for satisfaction of the claims of variable annuity contract holders.
As a result, during the fiscal year, the Commission granted additional
exemptions from prohibitions of the 1940 act with respect to loans
and advances to agents, managers and sales employees 14 and to permit
in certain circumstances borrowings from nonaffiliates in addition to
bank borrowings."
The Prudential Lneurance 00. of America has filed an application
for exemption from the 1940 act or, in the alternative, for exemption
from certain provisions thereof, in connection with its proposed plan
for the sale of variable annuity contracts." Hearings on this application were commenced on June 12, 1961,and were still in progress at the
close of the fiscal year. The application seeks a determination that
Prudential will be the issuer of such contracts and is not required to
register as an investment company. Under New Jersey law, pursuant
to which Prudential was organized, the proceeds from the sale of
variable annuity contracts must be placed in a fund segregated from
the company's other assets. Prudential proposes to invest such proceeds primarily in equity securities and if the Commission determines

that this segregated fund, rathe,: dl::n Prudential, is the issuer of the
contracts and an investment company, Prudential requests an order
exempting the fund from certain provisions of the act. The provisions of the act from which exemption is sought for the fund deal
mainly with the voting rights of holders of investment company
securities, the manner in which directors are selected and the terms
under which a redeemable security may be issued and sold. New
Jersey law provides that holders of variable annuity contracts are
entitled only to vote for directors, charter amendments, and mergers
whereas the act provides for shareholder approval of other matters,
including changes in investment policies which would govern the
fund. Similarly the ad prohibits any person from serving as a
director of an investment company unless elected by the security
holders and Prudential seeks to continue its present arrangement
whereby 7 of its 23-member board of directors are appointed rather
than elected. Additional exemptions are sought concerning the
redemption features of the contracts and the sales load to be deducted
from payments.
LITIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT COMPANY ACT OF 1940

The Commission filed a complaint against Townsend Corporation

of America, et al.,n charging that Townsend Corp. of America
(TCA) and Townsend Management Co. (TMC) had been under the
control and domination of Morris M. Townsend, Clinton Davidson,
and Raymond E. Hartz; that these individuals had knowingly operated the two companies and their subsidiaries for their personal
benefit and in derogation of the interests of TCA and TMC shareholders; that both companies had engaged in business as investment
companies since 1957 without being registered, in violation of the
registration requirements of the Investment Company Act; that from
that time until January 1960, when they registered at the insistence
of the staff of the Commission, they had engaged in numerous transactions which were in violation of the act; that upon registration
in January 1960 the companies acknowledged that they had acquired
investments which they could not lawfully continue to hold, and
represented to the Commission that within 1 year they would either
divest themselves of such investments or would cease to be investment
companies; and that they had failed to perform either undertaking
and had made no diligent attempt to do so but, on the contrary, had
engaged in further illegal transactions.
The complaint further alleged, among other things, that the named
individuals caused TCA and TMC to acquire securities which they
would have been prohibited from acquiring had they been registered;
17

D.N.J. No. 336-61.

154

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

to obtain loans in excess of the debt limit prescribed by the act; to
enter into situations involving cross-ownership of securities prohibited
by the act; and to issue non-voting common stock prohibited by the
act; and caused TCA to make loans to TMC and the latter's subsidiary
which would have been prohibited had the companies been registered
as required by the act.
The complaint also alleged that in September 1960, TCA mailed
to its stockholders a report with was false and misleading in the
following material respects: It reflected fictitious and inflated assets;
it failed to disclose the adverse operating results of TCA and its
subsidiaries for the 6 months ended June 30, 1960, and the facts that
TCA's chief source of income had been dividends paid by its subsidiary, Resort Airlines, Inc., which had held a contract with the U.S.
Air Force, that at June 30,1960, such contract was not renewed, and
that Resort Airlines had a net loss for the :first 6 months of 1960; and
it stated that TCA's profit for 1959 was about $700,000 when in fact
the profit reported was a capital gain of a subsidiary which was insolvent, with the result that such profit was not available for distribution to TCA stockholders.
The complaint also alleged that the individual defendants caused
TCA and TMC to borrow from Resort Airlines from time to time
sums aggregating over $1,200,000, which loans were repaid in newly
issued shares of common stock of TCA and TMC to the detriment
of the stockholders of Resort Airlines. In addition, the complaint
alleged, among other things, borrowings at excessive rates of interest,
failure to call stockholders' meetings and to mail reports to stockholders, the granting of options to the individual defendants in violation of the act, and waste of assets.
Injunctions were entered by consent against the two corporations
and the three individuals.
The court took possession of TCA and
TMC for the purpose of enforcing compliance with the act and
appointed an interim board of directors to carry out the terms of
its decree.
In connection with the above it may be noted that a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act was
filed on May 10, 1961, by Townsend Growth Fund, Inc., a registered
open-end investment company, of which TMC and a subsidiary thereof
were the investment advisers and of which another subsidiary of
TMC was the principal underwriter.
Davidson was chairman and
Townsend and Hartz were members of the board of directors of the
Growth Fund. This represents the first chapter X reorganization
of a registered investment company since World War II. A trustee,
appointed by the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of
New York, is now in control of the company's assets. The company
was unable to meet its obligations as they matured, including requests

for redemptions, since a large part. of its portfolio consisted of securities not readily marketable. There were 302,900 shares of stock
outstanding on May 5, 1961, held in approximately 1,900 stockholders
accounts.
The case of Hennesey v. S.E.O.18 was an appeal from an order
of the Commission granting the application of the Great American
Life Underwriters, Inc. (Underwriters), for a retroactive exemption
under section 6(c) of the Investment Company Act from the provisions of the act from and after January 1, 1941, the effective date
of the act.
Hennesey, a stockholder of Underwriters, whose participation in
the proceedings was limited to an appearance on the first day of the
hearings, filed an application with the Commission for reargument
and rehearing. The Commission denied the application on the
grounds that it was not timely filed and raised no issues not previously presented to or considered by the Commission. Following
the denial of the application for rehearing Hennesey filed a petition
for review in the Court of Appeals.
Underwriters was granted leave to intervene and subsequently
moved to dismiss the appeal on the ground that Hennesey had no standing to appeal because she had not participated in the hearings and
had not raised any issues before the Commission. The Commission
opposed the motion to dismiss, taking the position that the petitioner
could raise on appeal any issue that had been raised before the Commission by a participant in the hearing whose interests were not
adverse to those of the petitioner. The Court of Appeals subsequently
denied the motion to dismiss."
Following the end of the fiscal year, the Court of Appeals affirmed
the Commission's order, holding (1) that the record contained substantial evidence to support the Commission's findings of fact; (2)
that in view of the exceptional circumstances of the case the Commission was justified in entering a retroactive order, and that the Commission should not be deprived of the flexibility that the retroactive
procedure permits; and (3) that in view of the Commission's determination that Underwriters was not the type of company intended to
be covered by the act, it was not necessary for the Commission to
scrutinize Underwriters' transactions. 20 A petition for rehearing was
denied.
In Oivil &: Military Investor's Mutual Fund, Inc. v. S.E.O.,21 a
mutual fund appealed from a Commission order declaring that the
name of the Fund was deceptive and misleading within the meaning

mission found an implication inherent in the name "that registrant
is particularly suited to meet the investment needs of [government]
personnel", and concluded that such implication was deceptive and
misleading. The Court of Appeals affirmed the Commission order
and stated that the determination made by the Commission was not
unreasonable and was supported by substantial evidence. In addition, the Court held that the Commission's finding of a "harmful tendency [to deceive] inherent in the name itself" was sufficient to support the Commission's action and that there was no need to find "an
actual intent to deceive."
The case of Nadler v, 8.E.0. 22 is an appeal from an order of the
Commission refusing to revoke a previous Commission order, issued
pursuant to sections 17(b) and 23(c) of the Investment Company
Act, which exempted from the provisions of section 17(a) of the act
certain transactions between affiliates, and permitted one of the parties,
an investment company, to receive as part of the consideration certain
of its own preferred shares.
A stockholder of the companies involved urged before the Commission that the directors of the investment company were not elected
in accordance with the requirements of section 16(a) of the act, and
that accordingly all of their subsequent acts, including the application
to the Commission for an exemption, as well as the Commission's order
granting the exemption, were void. As described above at p. 149,
the Commission held that the acts of the directors were voidable only
and that under all the circumstances the prior order should not be
revoked. The case was pending at the close of the fiscal year.
Participation

as Amicus

Curiae

Three important cases in which the Commission is appearing as
amicus curiae involve private rights of action under the Investment
Company Act. In Brouk v. Managed Funds, Managed Funds filed
a complaint in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of
Missouri, seeking an accounting, injunctive relief, and money damages
from its former directors, its investment advisers, its brokers and
others, for alleged violations of the Investment Company Act of 1940.
It was alleged (1) that the investment advisers received fees for which
no services were performed; (2) that the person to whom the investment advisory function was delegated channelled the Fund's brokerage
business to a brokerage partnership of which he was a member; (3)
that the Fund did not follow the investment policy announced in its
prospectuses in that it engaged in excessive portfolio transactions;
(4) that false statements were contained in the Fund's registration
statements; (5) that the investment advisers and brokers occupied
a fiduciary relationship to Managed Funds which was breached
"" C.A. 2, No. 26810.

TWENTY-SEVENm

ANNUAL REPORT

157

through mismanagement and waste of the Fund's assets; and (6) that
the director-defendants had knowledge both of the fiduciary relationship and of the mismanagement and waste, but failed to take any
action to prevent it. The District Court denied defendants' motion to
dismiss, but the Court of Appeals reversed on the ground that the
Investment Company Act provides for no civil remedies." The Court
denied plaintiff's motion for rehearing as well as the Commission's
motion requesting leave to appear as amicus on the rehearing. The
Supreme Court has granted certiorari."
In its brief supporting the petition for certiorari the Commission
contended that the decision of the Court of Appeals is in conflict with
numerous courts of appeals decisions under other Federal securities
laws and with several holdings of the district courts that the Investment Company Act gives rise to an implied private right of action,
and that a proper construction of the legislative history and the
statutory language provides for a private right of action.
The Commission participated as amicus curiae in Brown v, Bullock,
an action instituted by shareholders of Dividend Shares, Inc., a
registered investment company. The complaint alleged that the defendants, who are directors of the fund and also of the fund's investment adviser and underwriter, engaged in a course of conduct
constituting "gross misconduct" and "gross abuse of trust" under the
standards imposed by section 36 of the Investment Company Act,
and in an unlawful and willful conversion in violation of section 37
of the act. The complaint also alleged that certain proxy material
caused to be distributed by defendants on behalf of the fund was to
their knowledge false and misleading in violation of section 20(a)
of the act and the Commission's rules thereunder and that the fund's
directors failed to perform their duties under section 15 in connection
with the annual renewals of the fund's investment advisory contract.
The action was brought by plaintiffs both as a derivative action on
behalf of the fund and as a representative action on their own behalf
and that of other stockholders of the fund similarly situated.
Defendants moved to dismiss the complaint on the ground that
it failed to state a Federal claim, arguing, inter- alia, that neither
section 36 nor section 20(a) nor the rules thereunder give rise to a
private right of action. The Commission, as amicus curiae, took the
position that a private right of action under the act may flow from
violations of the duties imposed by the act, and specifically from
violations of the proxy requirements under the act and from "gross
misconduct" or "gross abuse of trust."
After extensive briefs had been filed by the parties and by the
Commission, the district court denied defendants' motion to dismiss
"'286 F. 2d 901 (C.A. 8. 1960) .
.. June 19, 1961.

158

COM:MISSION

and in a carefully considered and detailed opinion held that defendants' position was unsound and that the complaint stated claims under
the Federal statute upon which relief could be granted. 25
An appeal was taken from the district court's denial of the motion
to dismiss and the Commission filed a brief and presented oral argument as amicus curiae on the appeal. On September 5, 1961, the
court of appeals en bamo affirmed the decision of the district court
holding that a private right of action would flow from violation of
the duties contained in the act, specifically holding that violation of
section 37 (larceny and embezzlement) and the duties imposed by
section 15 (relating to renewal of the advisory contracts) would give
rise to such private rights of action. The court did not pass on the
section 20(a) or 36 issues since it held the section 15 and 37 violations
were sufficient to sustain the complaint."
The actions of Ohabot v, Empire Trust 00. and Schwartz v. National Securities Series were brought by shareholders of a mutual
fund, organized as a common law trust, against the trustee and others
for restoration to the fund of fees paid to the trustee. The trustee
moved to stay the proceedings until the plaintiffs had delivered a
bond to indemnify it against the costs and expenses of defending the
action. The District Court for the Southern District of New York 21
held applicable the provision of the trust agreement to the effect that
no shareholder of the fund should have the right to an accounting
except upon furnishing indemnity to the trustee against costs and
expenses, with such indemnity to be payable unless it should be
established that the trustee had been guilty of fraud, misfeasance, or
gross negligence. The district court therefore stayed the action
pending the posting of security.
On appeal from that decision, the court of appeals expressed doubt
whether the complaint in fact asserted a claim within the jurisdiction
of a Federal court but noted that this point was soon to be decided by
it in Brown v, Bullock (described above). It upheld, however, the
right of appeal from the order of the district court." Subsequent to
the close of the fiscal year, the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae
expressing the view that the provision of the trust agreement requiring the posting of security before .the shareholders can commence
their action is void under section 17(h) of the act which prohibits an
investment company from operating under any instrument which
contains "any provision which protects or purports to protect any
director . . ." Such a provision would also violate section 47 (a), the
Commission contended, in that the security requirement constitutes
a waiver of compliance with provisions of the act.

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration of
persons who are engaged for compensation in the business of advising
others with respect to securities. There are, however, certain limited
exemptions from the requirement of registration.
One who advises
only investment or insurance companies need not register. An exemption is also afforded the adviser who in the last 12 months had fewer
than 15 clients and does not hold himself out generally to the public
as an investment adviser. Furthermore, the registration requirement
does not apply to one whose investment advice is given only to persons
resident in the State in which he maintains his principal place of
business as long as the advice does not concern securities listed on a
national securities exchange or admitted to unlisted trading privileges
on such an exchange.
Prior to amendments to the Investment Advisers Act, effective September 13, 1960, it was unlawful for registered investment advisers
to engage in practices which constitute fraud or deceit upon clients
or prospective clients. Section 206 of the act, as amended, now prohibits any investment adviser from engaging in fraudulent, deceptive,
or manipulative acts or practices and gives the Commission authority,
by rules and regulations, to define and to prescribe means reasonably
designed to prevent such acts and practices.
Prior to said amendments the Commission was not empowered to
inspect the books and records of an investment adviser. Section 204
of the act, as amended, now requires every investment adviser, if not
exempt from registration, to make, keep and preserve such books and
records as may be prescribed by the Commission and empowers the
Commission to inspect such books and records.
The act as amended has added additional grounds under section
203 (d) of the act for denying, suspending or revoking the registration of an investment adviser. These include conviction of a felony
or misdemeanor involving mail fraud; fraud by wire, telephone, radio
or television; or embezzlement, fraudulent conversion or misappropriation of funds or securities; also willful violation of any provision
of the Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or any rule or regulation under

any of such acts, as well as aiding or abetting any other person's
violation of such acts, rules or regulations.
These and other amendments to the acts and rules promulgated or
proposed thereto are more fully discussed in part II of this report.
Investment advisers who violate any of the provisions of the act
are subject to appropriate administrative, civil or criminal remedies.
Investment advisers who also effect transactions as brokers and
dealers, must disclose any interest they may have in transactions effected for clients if acting as an investment adviser with regard to
such transactions. The act prohibits any investment adviser not exempt from registration from basing his compensation upon a share
of the capital gains or appreciation of his client's funds. The act
also makes it unlawful for any such investment adviser to enter into,
extend or renew any investment advisory contract or to perform
such contract if the contract provides for compensation to the investment adviser on the basis of a share of capital gains or capital appreciation of the funds or any portion of the funds of the client or fails
to provide that no assignment of such contract shall be made by the
investment adviser without the consent of the other party to the
contract.
At the close of the fiscal year, 1,855 investment advisors were
registered with the Commission. The following tabulation contains
statistics with respect to registrations and applications for registration during fiscal year 1960.

ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEEDINGS

During the past fiscal year, the Commission has instituted proceedings against three registered investment advisers.
Oambridge Research and Investment Oorp.; Arthur J. Bryant.Proceedings against these two registrants were consolidated. Cambridge was permanently enjoined by the U.S. District Court for the
District of Massachusetts, in an action instituted by the Commission,

from violating section 206 of the act by soliciting subscriptions to its
service and accepting subscription fees by means of misstatements
or omissions of material facts concerning its ability to publish and
furnish the service for the en,tim period of tlie subscriptions, and
without disclming that i t had not published and furnished such copies
to a number of subscribers since November 1959, and that it had
applied subscription fees to its own use at a time when it was unable
to publish and furnish such service. Bryant, who was president of
Cambridge, mas also permanently enjoined from aiding and abetting
such violations. I n addition to the injunction, the Commission found
that Cambridge, aided and abetted by Bryant, violated section 207
of the Investment Advisers Act in that it willfully failed to amend
information in its application for registration to disclose that Bryant
ceased to be sole owner of more than 25 percent of the voting
securities of Cambridge and that Cambridge had moved its principal
place of business from the address shown on its registration application. I n view of the injunction m d the violations, the Commission
found it in the public interest to revoke the registrations of registrants as investment advisers.'
FTank Payson Todd, doing business as The New England Ownse2Zor.-Registrant, publisher of an investment letter called "The
New England Counsellor", recommended that subscribers purchase
common stock of Canadian Javelin, Ltd., a Canadian corporation
engaged in operating a foundry and developing mining properti
The company retained Todd to make an evaluation of its financial
program and paid him $500 for this service. Shortly thereafter,
he purchased 17,000 shares of Javelin stock for $70,500 and gave two
unsecured demand notes in payment After such purchase registrant
mentioned Canadian Javelin in his newsletter about every other week
and sent telegrams to his subscribers advising purchase of Canadian
Javelin stock. H e was reimbursed for part of his telegraph expenses
by the secretary to the president of Canadian Javelin. The stock
was unregistered.
I n an action brought by the Commission, a permanent injunction
was issued by the U.S. District Court for the District of Massachusetts
against registrant. The injunction decree recited that it appeared
to the court that regist.rant was engaged and about to engage in acts
violating the registration and antifraud provisions of the Securities
Act of 1933 'and section 206 of the Investment Advisers Act, and
enjoined him from using the mails or interstate facilities to (1)
sell or deliver stock of Canadian Javelin or any other securities contrary to the registration provisions of the Securities Act; (2) publicize any security i n return for a consideration from any issuer,

underwriter or dealer, without disclosing such consideration and the
amount thereof; or (3) in connection with the offer or sale of Canadian
Javelin stock or any other securities, employ any fraudulent device
or course of conduct or untrue or misleading statement concerning,
among other things, recommendations to purchase such securities,
profits from such purchases, the price at which such securities should
be sold or traded, and the compensation received for recommending
such securities. The decree also permanently enjoined the registrant,
while registered with the Commission as an investment adviser, from
engaging in fraudulent activities or representations, and recommending the purchase of securities, or accepting fees from clients for such
recommendations without disclosing that he was receiving compensation from persons interested in selling such securities. Registrant
consented to the entry of the decree without admitting any of the
allegations in the complaint.
In the revocation proceeding, which followed the injunction, registrant argued that, since the injunction was entered by consent and no
factual issues were litigated, the decree could have no binding effect
on the administrative proceeding and that the injunction alone, in the
absence of proof that it had been violated, was not sufficient to warrant
a finding that revocation or suspension of registration is in the public
interest. The Commission rejected this argument holding that an
injunction against an investment adviser within the ambit of section
203(d) of the Investment Advisers Act is sufficient to support a
finding that revocation of registrant is in the public interest, that in
determining the question of public interest it was appropriate to look
to the nature of the acts enjoined and the basis on which the injunction
was entered, and that the fact that the injunction was entered by
consent did not alter the basic consideration. The Commission observed that it was not determinative that the injunction had not been
violated, since to hold otherwise would be to treat the existence of an
injunction as precluding action by the Commission with respect to
the registration although the statute expressly makes it a ground for
revocation. The Commission stated "An investment adviser is a
fiduciary and, as such, owes a duty of fair and impartial advice to
his clients. It is clear that Todd's conduct grossly violated this
standard, and we conclude that under all the circumstances it is in the
public interest to revoke his registration as an investment adviser." 2

Service, Inc. The complaint alleged that the defendants solicited
and received payments from insurance companies for recommending
securities issued by such companies in the defendant's semimonthly
bulletins which were then distributed to subscribers as containing
unbiased and independent recommendations. Permanent injunctions
were entered by consent.
In 8.E.0. v. Oapitoi Gains Research Bureau, Inc.,4 the Commission
charged the company, an investment service, and its president, Harry
P. Schwarzman, with violations of sections 206 (1) and (2) of the
Investment Advisers Act. The complaint alleged that the company
assumed a position opposed to that of its customers by purchasing
certain securities, then recommending to its customers that they purchase such securities without disclosing its position or its intention
to sell, and thereafter selling its securities in the higher market resulting from its customers' purchases. Conversely, the complaint
charged, the company sold securities short, then advised its clients that
such securities were overvalued, and within a few days, as a result
of a falling market, was able to buy the securities at a profit. The
Commission's request for a preliminary injunction was denied and
the matter has been appealed to the Court of Appeals. (\

PART XI
OTHER ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION
COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the fiscal year 1961 there were pending in the
courts 84 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted by
the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices in
the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 92 additional
proceedings were instituted and 81 cases were disposed of, leaving
95 such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of corporate reorganization
cases under chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 12 proceedings in
the district courts under section 11(e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act; and in 9 miscellaneous actions. The Commission also
participated in 55 civil appeals in the U.S. Courts of Appeals. Of
these 27 came before the courts on petition for review of an administration order, 7 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the
Commission had taken an active part, 8 were appeals in actions
brought by or against the Commission, 3 were appeals from orders
entered pursuant to section 11(e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, and 10 were appeals in cases in which the Commission
appeared as amicus curiae. The Commission also participated in
7 appeals or petitions for certiorari before the U.S. Supreme Court
resulting from these or similar actions.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are
contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during
the year are discussed in the sections of this report relating to the
statutes under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General, who may
institute
criminal proceedings. The regional officesand , at times ,the
.
mam officeof the Commission prepare detailed reports in cases where
the facts appear to warrant criminal prosecution. After careful
164

TWENTY -SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

165

review by the General Counsel's office, these reports are considered
by the Commission and, if it believes criminal prosecution is appropriate, the reference for criminal prosecution is forwarded to the
Attorney General. Commission employees familiar with the case
generally assist the U.S. Attorneys in the presentation to the grand
jury, the conduct of the trial, and the preparation of briefs on appeal.
The Commission also submits parole reports prepared by its investigators relating to convicted offenders.
During the past fiscal year 42 cases were referred to the Department of Justice for prosecution. As a result of these and prior referrals, 44 indictments were returned against 205 defendants during the
fiscal year. There also were 126 convictions in 45 cases, the largest
number of convictions obtained in any fiscal year since the earliest
days of the Commission's history. Convictions were affirmed in four
cases, reversed in two cases, and appeals were still pending in seven
other criminal cases at the close of the period. Of five criminal contempt cases handled during the year, three defendants were convicted
in two cases, another case was dismissed and two cases are still
pending.
From 1934, when the Commission was established, until June 30,
1961,2,982 defendants have been indicted in the U.S. District Courts
in 689 cases developed by the Commission, and 1,507 convictions have
been obtained. The record of convictions obtained and upheld in
completed cases is over 86 percent for the 27-year life of the
Commission.'
The fraud cases again, as in prior years, covered a wide variety of
fraudulent practices. They included high-pressure long-distance
telephone "boiler room" frauds, frauds by investment advisers, frauds
in the sale of securities by new as well as established businesses, and
fraudulent security sales relating to the promotion of insurance companies, oil, gas, and mining ventures, alleged inventions, and other
spurious investment schemes. In addition, there were prosecutions
for the filing of false proxy statements, as well as other false documents filed with the Commission, and the first criminal prosecution
for violation of the Investment Company Act of 1940. Because of
the large volume of cases it is impossible to report in detail all of
the criminal matters, but some of the more important and endless
variety of fraudulent devices and techniques are described in the
specific cases discussed below,"

summary of all criminal cases developed by the Commission
from the fiscal year 1934 through the fiscal year 1961 Is set forth In appendix table lW.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The first criminal prosecution under the Investment Company Act
resulted in a conviction in United States v, Francis Peter Orosby
(S.D.N.Y.) where the defendant pleaded guilty to violations of that
act, as well as the Securities Exchange Act. Crosby had acquired
control of Jefferson Research Foundation, Inc., and, through that
corporation, control of Jefferson Custodian Fund, Inc., an investment
company. Crosby then liquidated a portion of the portfolio of the
fund for some $241,000 to raise cash and attempted to sell the fund
worthless securities for $396,000. When the custodian of the fund
refused to execute the orders to purchase the worthless securities,
Crosby attempted to secure another custodian.
The first conviction for violation of the anti-touting provisions of
section 17(b) of the Securities Act was obtained in United States v,
Todd (D. Mass.) where F. Payson Todd, doing business as the New
England Counsellor, entered a plea of nolo contendere to charges that
he had recommended purchases at the market to his customers of the
stock of Canadian Javelin without disclosing that he had received
compensation from the issuer and underwriters and that his recommendations for purchase to his clients were for the purpose of facilitating a distribution of the stock by creating a demand for it and
to raise its market price.
The first convictions for violations of the proxy provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act were had in United States v, Fortune Pope
and Anthony Pope (S.D.N.Y.). The defendants were each sentenced
on pleas of guilty and nolo contendere to fines of $25,000 and additionally given a 1-year suspended prison sentence and placed on
probation for that period. The defendants were convicted of soliciting
proxies of stockholders of the Colonial Sand & Stone Co., Inc., by
means of false and misleading proxy statements and filing such false
and misleading proxy statements with the Commission and with the
American Stock Exchange.
Another conviction involving the use of false and misleading proxy
soliciting material was obtained in United States v. Maurice Olen
(S.D. Ala.) where the defendant was convicted on his nolo contendere
plea and fined $2,500.3 In United States v. Alexander L. Guterma
(S.D.N.Y.) involving the stock of United Dye & Chemical Corp.,
Guterma pleaded guilty to charges that he conspired to file a false
and misleading proxy statement with respect to that company, to
obstruct the making and filing of reports required to be filed by the
company with the New York Stock Exchange and the Commission,
and to defraud purchasers in the sale of unregistered securities of
that corporation. This case is still pending as to other codefendants,â€¢ For further details, see 26th annual report, 189.

Guterma also pleaded guilty to the indictment in United States v,
Samuel S. Garfield et al. (S.D.N.Y.) which charges a conspiracy to
distribute to the public shares of the common stock of United Dye &
Chemical Corp. through the mails without complying with the registration provisions of the Securities Act. This case is pending as to
other defendants. Guterma again pleaded guilty in United States v.
Samuel S. Garfield et al. (S.D.N.Y.) to an indictment charging conspiracy to violate the registration and antifraud provisions of the
Securities Act in the distribution of stock of Shawano Development
Corp. by use of false and misleading literature and by means of an
intensive local and long-distance telephone sales campaign. This
indictment also is pending as to other defendants.
Guterma and Paul Hughes pleaded guilty in United States v. Paul
Hughes et al. (S.D.N.Y.) where the defendants are charged with
fraud in the sale of stock of the Western Financial Corp., Diversified
Financial Corp. of America, and Consolidated American Industries,
Inc., and where it is alleged an extensive telephone and mail campaign
was carried on to effect the sale of the stock at arbitrary prices from
$2.25 to $2.50 per share. Other defendants are awaiting trial.
Convictions were affirmed in United States v. Guterma, 281 F. 2d
742 (GA. 2, 1960), cert. denied, 364 U.S. 871, for conspiracy to violate
and for violation of the reporting requirements of the Securities
Exchange Act. This landmark case was the first criminal prosecution
of corporate insiders for their failure to file ownership reports and
for their obstruction of the filing of the annual report required to be
filed by companies having securities listed on a national securities
exchange."
A conviction for violations of the Securities Act and the mail fraud
statute was affirmed in J. Phil Burns et al. v. United States, 286 F. 2d
152 (C.A. 10, 1961). The defendants were found guilty of selling
over $51 million of securities of the Selected Investments Trust Fund
of which $12 million were redeemed. Dividends had been paid out of
capital while the defendants represented to investors that dividends
were paid from profits; false financial statements were distributed;
defendants redeemed certificate bonds at their face amount which
substantially exceeded their actual value; and defendants converted
and used for their own personal profit money and properties of the
trust fund without reimbursing the trust fund. In addition, the
defendants, with a total investment of $13,800 in the Selected Investments Corp., dominated and controlled the multimillion dollar trust
fund which in turn controlled approximately 37 subsidiary companies.
The defendants, J. Phil Burns and Hugh A. Carroll, were sentenced
to 5 years, William A. Rigg received a suspended sentence of 5 years

and was placed on probation, and Julia Moore Carroll was placed on
probation for 5 years. The defendant corporation, Selected Investments Corp. and United Securities Agency, were each fined $1,500.
The stock of Atlas Gypsum Corp., Ltd., was sold through the
securities brokerage firm of J. C. Graye Co., in one of a series of
boiler room promotions controlled by Stanley I. Younger and his
associates in United States v, Stanley I. Younger et at. (D. Conn.) ,
The defendants acquired a large block of Atlas Gypsum stock at
approximately 20 cents per share and subsequently sold these shares
to investors in some 30 States by means of arbitrary markups at
prices as high as $3.75 per share. As the trial was to start in
October, six defendants entered pleas of guilty or nolo contendere /
after the Government called its first witness, the remaining defendants
on trial withdrew not-guilty pleas and entered pleas or nolo contendere:" Stanley Ira Younger received an 8-year sentence, James C.
Graye received a 3-year sentence and varying sentences were imposed
on the remaining defendants, including Carmine Lombardozzi who
received a suspended sentence of 3 years and 5 years' probation with
a fine of $2,500, Arthur Tortorello who received a 3-year sentence to
be suspended after service of 3 months, and Louis Michael de F'illippo
who was similarly sentenced.
In connection with the investigation of the Atlas Gypsum Corp.,
Ltd. matter, Jack Yetman pleaded guilty to committing perjury
while testifying before investigating officers of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and is awaiting sentence.
Younger was again a defendant in another boiler room promotion,
United States v, Phillip Newman Associates, Inc.; et at. (D.N.H.)
where he received a 3-year sentence, to be served concurrently with
other sentences imposed upon him, for violations of the antifraud
provisions of the Securities Act in the sale of securities of Monarch
Asbestos Co., Ltd., through the brokerage firm of Phillip Newman
Associates, Inc.
Younger also was convicted, together with Richard T. Cardall, of
violating the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act
and the Mail Fraud Statute in the case of United States v. Stanley I.
Younger, et al, (S.D.N. Y.). Here the defendants placed orders with
brokers for stock of National Photocopy, Inc., a nonexistent corporation, and then sold Photocopy stock using an alias through other
brokers. In this manner they caused the brokers to purchase the
Photocopy stock, but never accepted or paid the broker for the stock.
For his part in the manipulations of National Photocopy, Inc., stock
Younger received a sentence of 3% years. A somewhat similar

l{aral (D. Mass.).
Seven codefendants of Lowell M. Birrell, a fugitive presently
residing in Brazil/ were convicted in United States v, Samuel J.
Smiley (S.D.N.Y.) of violating the antifraud provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act in defrauding Doeskin Products, Inc., by
causing Doeskin to issue over 1 million shares of its stock by
falsely pretending that $2,140,000 had been received by Doeskin.
Some of the defendants also induced Doeskin to pay a commission
of $53,500 on this fictitious sale. They then sold 70,000 shares back
to the corporation and obtained $100,000 more. A number of other
codefendants in addition to Birrell are presently fugitives in this
ease,

A number of broker-dealers were convicted and a number of others
are awaiting trial on charges arising from conduct of a securities
business. Thus in United States v, Iiomsey (D. Mass.) a 2-year
sentence and a $5,000 fine was imposed on Anton E. Homsey on
his plea of guilty. Defendant, who was a partner in the Boston
securities firm of DuPont, Homsey & Co., hypothecated investors'
securities in violation of the provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act. Single investors were defrauded in amounts of $385,000,
$85,000, and $25,000; a Florida couple gave Homsey $102,000 of
securities, having been promised 5 percent interest plus the dividends
on the securities. They did not receive the dividend payments, the
interest, or the return of the securities. Joseph F. 'Whalen, Jr., a salesman for the same firm of DuPont, Homsey & Co., also hypothecated
securities for his own use, forged checks received from the proceeds
of the sale and then appropriated the same to his own use and benefit.
Whalen was sentenced to 1 year's imprisonment on his guilty plea.
Fraud and registration violations are included among the pending
charges in United States v. Greenberg, et al. (S.D.N.Y.). Jacob A.
Greenberg and Morris Mac Schwebel are charged with selling stock of
Soil Builders International Corp. to Associates Union Trust, a
Lichtenstein trust, with offices in Geneva, Switzerland, which stock
was then immediately resold to investors in the United States without
registration. Misrepresentations as to the profitable operation of the
business, its proposed listing on the American and New York Stock
Exchanges, and other similar matters also are alleged in the indictment. These defendants also are charged in another indictment with
conspiring to violate and violating the registration provisions of the
Securities Act in the sale of cornmon stock of Basic Atomics, Inc.

as well as in

COMMISSION

A number of convictions were obtained for fraud involving the sale
of insurance company stock. Thus in United States v, (Iharles
1/. Newell and OhaunceyA. Allen (D. Colo.) the defendants were
convicted of falsely representing in the sale of stock of the Unity
Insurance Co. of Omaha that the investor's money would be placed
in escrow until an insurance business franchise was issued by the State
of Nebraska; that the company had the money to qualify and would
get the license, and the company was so profitable that they would
refund the issuer's money at any time with 5-percent interest. The
defendants did not disclose that the officers of Unity Insurance Co.
did not invest their own money in the company but received stock
options from the company and that the greater portion of the investor's purchase price went to a company officer.
There were also several prosecutions for alleged fraud in the sale
of notes and mortgages and related securities. An indictment was
returned in United States v, David Farrell, et al. (S.D. Cal.), where
some 9,000 investors invested in excess of $40 million in an
alleged "Secured 10% Earnings Program", for violations of the
Securities Act and the Mail Fraud Statute in the sale of securities of
the Trust Deed & Mortgage Exchange, Los Angeles Trust Deed &
Mortgage Exchange, Trust Deed & Mortgage Markets, and Colorado
Trust Deed & Mortgage Markets. The indictment alleged that the
defendants engaged in a scheme and artifice to defraud investors
throughout the United States and in foreign countries by falsely
representing that the Secured 10% Earnings Program assured
investors "full, firm 10% earnings" with a degree of liquidity comparable to insured bank deposits or insured savings and loan certificates, that the "Exchange" maintained by TD & ME and LATD &
ME was similar to a stock exchange, and that LATD & ME and
TD & MM were "safe, solid, solvent and adequately financed institutions"-the "oldest and largest in America" offering "Secured 10%
Earnings." The indictment alleges that in fact LA TD & ME and TD
& MM were insolvent and that funds entrusted to them by investors
were constantly endangered and in jeopardy."
The defendant in United States v, Wendell Ralph Lutes (S.D.
Ind.) was convicted on charges of defrauding investors by the sale
of common stock of the Brown Mortgage Co., Inc. The defendant
had organized this company for the avowed purpose of making mortgage loans in Brown County, Ind., and represented to purchasers that
the company would earn 12 percent a year on mortgage loans and that
the company could pay a 10-percent stock dividend. The company
actually did not own mortgages and did not do business of this kind;
the defendant caused a 10-percent stock dividend to be paid solely for

the purpose of aiding in the sale of the stock. The defendant Lutes
drew from the company funds of over $80,000 by writing company
checks to fictitious persons, forging the endorsements, and then endorsing the checks for deposit in his bank account; by taking securities belonging to the mortgage company, registering them in his
name and then selling the mortgages; by organizing a stock brokerage firm in Saint Petersburg, Fla., with funds of the mortgage company; and by inducing a purchaser to take control of the Brown
County Mortgage Co. and redeem Lutes' shareholdings for an amount
far in excess of its value.
An alleged revolutionary uranium processing machine, the "Benson
Uranium Upgrader," was one of the schemes involved in United
States v. John Milton Addison, et al. (N.D. Tex.). The defendants
obtained money from the public in 35 States, including Hawaii, in
the sum of about $2 million. After trial the judge imposed a 15year sentence and $36,000 fine on one defendant and sentences of
from '7 to 2 years on five others." The fraudulent promotion of a
steam generating machine, as well as a protective paint, a nonslip
nut, roll-a-way furniture, and a water retaining fertilizer, were involved in United States v. OZarkL. Fry (W.D. Wis.).
Oil and mining promotions continued to provide a fertile field for
fraudulent promoters. The defendant in United States v. Tho11UL8
E.
Robertson (S.D.N.Y.) was sentenced to 3 months' imprisonment on
the first count and a sentence 1 year was suspended on all other counts
after conviction on an indictment charging violations of the antifraud
provisions and the registration requirements of the Securities Act in
the offer and sale of stock of the American-Canadian Oil & Drilling
Corp. Robertson had acquired 500,000 shares of stock of AmericanCanadian in exchange for certain oil and gas leases which was sold to
investors without registration and without disclosing that Thomas E.
Robertson, Inc., was the principal and owner of the shares. Robertson
and his company made misrepresentations as to dividend payments,
the value of the stock, approval of the Securities and Exchange Commission, listing of the stock on a national securities exchange, value
of the properties, and cost of acquisition of the properties.
In another oil promotion, United States v. Mervin J. Fischman,
et al. (D. Mass.), pleas of not guilty were changed to guilty by two
defendants who employed a scheme to defraud investors in a longdistance telephone campaign to sell shares of the Lexa Oil Corp. to
residents of Massachusetts and other States. In the telephone campaign false representations were made that Lexa Oil Corp. had struck
a well that was producing 250 barrels a day; that proceeds from the
sale of shares that were being offered by Anglo-American were to be

used by Lexa as working capital; that Anglo-American was offering
the shares of Lexa at a lower price than that being charged in the open
market; that an investment in Lexa would certainly result in a high
profit; and that the shares of Lexa were going to be listed on a stock
exchange. Fischman received a suspended sentence of 5 years and
5 years' probation and Palermo received a 2-year probationary
sentence.
A purported Canadian mining venture resulted in a 3-year sentence
for the defendant in United States v. George Alexander Kerr (D.
Wash.) upon his plea of guilty to violating the Mail Fraud Statute.
Kerr sold shares of Eagle Plains Development, Ltd., a Canadian
corporation, misrepresenting that there was a limited amount of stock
available for purchase; that a million dollars had been invested by
a syndicate in the corporation; and that the company owned producing
mining property and that the stock on the New York Stock Exchange
"Eagle P" was, in fact, the stock of Eagle Plains Development. By
this scheme the defendant and his associates obtained more than
$375,000 from some 1,000 investors in the United States by longdistance telephone calls and a mail campaign from Vancouver, British
Columbia, and "Whitehorse, Yukon Territory.
Other participants
in the scheme were apprehended by Canadian authorities.
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Each of the acts administered by the Commission specifically authorizes investigations to determine whether violations of law have
occurred.
The nine regional officesof the Commission, with the assistance of
their branch offices,are primarily responsible for the conduct of investigations. In addition, the Office of Special Investigations of the
Division of Trading and Exchanges of the Commission's Washington
Office conducts investigations dealing with matters of particular interest or urgency, either independently or assisting the regional
offices. The Division of Trading and Exchanges exercises general
supervision over and coordination of the investigative activities of
the regional offices. Its staff examines and analyzes the investigative
findings and recommendations of the regional officesand recommends
appropriate action to the Commission.
There are several sources of information which eventually lead to
investigation. One of the primary sources of information is complaints submitted by members of the general public concerning the
activities of persons involved in the offer and sale of securities. The
Division of Trading and Exchanges and the regional officesgive careful consideration to such information and, if it appears that violations
of the Federal securities laws may have occurred, an investigation is

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

173

commenced. Other sources of information which are of great assistance to the Commission in carrying out its enforcement responsibilities are the national securities exchanges, brokerage firms, State and
Canadian securities authorities, better business bureaus, the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and various law enforcement
agencies.
It is the Commission's policy to conduct its investigations on a
confidential basis. Such a policy is necessary for effective law enforcement and in the interest of fairness to persons against whom unfounded
or unconfirmed charges may be presented. Another advantage of
confidential investigations is that suspected violators may not be
warned and afforded an opportunity to frustrate or obstruct the investigation. The Commission investigates many complaints where no
violation is ultimately found to exist. To conduct such investigations
publicly would ordinarily result in hardship or embarrassment to
many innocent persons and might affect the market for the securities
in question, resulting in injury to investors with no countervailing
public benefits. Moreover, members of the public have a tendency to
be reluctant to furnish information concerning suspected violations
if they think their personal affairs would be publicized. Accordingly,
the Commission does not generally divulge the existence of or findings
of any investigation unless they are made a matter of public record
through proceedings before the Commission or in the courts.
'Vhen a preliminary investigation indicates a serious violation or
appears to require more extensive investigation, which may include
examination of books and records or interviews with numerous
persons, a case is docketed and a full investigation is conducted.
Under certain circumstances it becomes necessary for the Commission
to issue a formal order of investigation which designates members
of its staff as officersto issue subpenas and take testimony under oath.
This step is taken when the principals and others involved in the
investigation are uncooperative or it is otherwise necessary to use the
subpoena power in order to determine the exact nature of the activities
involved. During the past year, 131 formal orders were issued in
connection with investigations handled through the Division of Trading and Exchanges. In addition, there were 24 formal orders issued
at the recommendation of the Division of Corporation Finance. That
Division conducts certain investigations necessary to assist in processing filings made with that Division under the Securities Act of 1933
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Wb.en an investigation has been completed and enforcement action
appears appropriate, the Commission may proceed in one of several
ways. The evidence may be referred to the Department of Justice
with a recommendation for criminal prosecution. Should this occur,

174

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

members of the Commission's staff, who were instrumental in developing the case, usually assist the Department of Justice and the U.S.
attorney in presenting the case to the grand jury. If an indictment is
returned, members of its staff usually aid in the trial of the case.
The Commission may, when appropriate, authorize institution of
civil action for injunctive relief to restrain further violations. I n
such event, the complaint is filed in the Commission's name with the
appropriate U.S. district court and the case is presented by a member
of the Commission's staff. The Commission may also institute admin.
istrative proceedings when the investigation indicates that such action
is appropriate, for example, that a registration statement or report
filed with i t is false or misleading or omits required information, or
that a broker-dealer or investment adviser registered with this Commission is violating the Federal securities laws.
,The following table reflects in summarized form the investigative
activities handled by the Division of Trading and Exchanges of the
Commission during fiscal 1961:

ENFORCEMENT PROBLEMS WITH RESPEm TO CANADIAN
SECURITIES

While the unlawful offering and sale of securities by Canadian
issuers and broker-dealers continues to be a serious problem, considerable progress has been made within the past fiscal year, resulting
in great improvement in this field.
The success which has been achieved is due to continued and aggressive efforts and the increasing awareness of the seriousness of the
problem on the part of Canadian provincial authorities and responsible members of the Canadian securities industry, resulting in an active
interest in cooperative enforcement. We are currently receiving excellent cooperation from most Provinces and some segments of the
Canadian securities industry.
A principal factor in our enforcement program during the past
year has involved the issuance of postal fraud orders which greatly
reduced illegal offering9 from Toronto. During the past fiscal year,
upon evidence furnished.by the Commission, 58 postal fraud orders

TWENTY -SEVENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

175

have been issued. Numerous "extensions" to such orders have also been
issued to cover changes of address by persons who sought by such
changes to avoid the consequences of original orders directed to them.
On March 28, 1961, the Toronto Stock Exchange and the Ontario
Broker-Dealers Association took steps to require their members to
refrain from offering securities illegally in the United States. Conferences were held between representatives of the Commission and
representatives of the securities industry in Toronto to discuss the
situation and to work out a plan whereby broker-dealers in Ontario
could operate in compliance with the laws of the United States. As
a result of these actions several broker-dealers from Toronto have
become registered with this Commission under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and have agreed that they will not offer or sell
securities in the United States in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. The chairman of the Ontario Securities Commission has expressed his approval of these
arrangements.
Our enforcement difficulties with respect to jurisdictional problems,
including the denial of extradition by Canadian courts in a test case
under the Supplementary Extradition Convention, have been presented in detail in previous annual reports.
Details concerning actions involving Canadian securities are described elsewhere in the section relating to litigation under the Securities Act of 1933and in the section relating to criminal proceedings.
The Commission continues to maintain its Canadian restricted list.
This is a list of Canadian companies whose securities the Commission
has reason to believe currently are being, or recently have been, distributed in the United States in violation of the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. Failure to comply with the
registration requirements deprives investors of material information
and facilitates false claims as to the worth of securities. Thus investors are denied the essential protections provided by the Securities
Act.
The list and supplements thereto are issued to and published by
the press and copies are mailed to all registered broker-dealers and
are available to the public. The list serves as a warning to the public
and alerts broker-dealers to the fact that transactions in the securities
of the companies named therein may be unlawful. Most United States
broker-dealers refuse to execute transactions in such securities.
During the fiscal year 1961, 26 supplements to the list were issued
in which 47 names were added and 4 deleted upon compliance with
established procedures. The number of names on the list as of June
30, 1961,was 253.
The current list, as of September 30, 1961,follows:

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

A section of securities violations is maintained by the Commission
as a part of its enforcement program to provide a further means of
detecting and preventing fraud in securities transactions. The section maintains files providing a clearinghouse for other enforcement
agencies for information concerning persons who have been charged
with violations of various Federal and State securities statutes. Considerable information is also available concerning violators resident
in the Provinces of Canada. The specialized information in these
files is kept current through the cooperation of the U.S. Post Office
Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials, State securities authorities, Federal and State prosecuting attorneys, police officers, better business bureaus, chambers
of commerce and other agencies. At the end of the fiscal year these
records contained information concerning 76,399 persons against
whom Federal or State action had been taken in connection with
securities violations. In keeping these records current, there were
added during the fiscal year items of information concerning 13,281
persons, including 4,651 persons not previously identified in these
records.
The section issues and distributes quarterly a securities violations
bulletin containing information received during the period concerning violators and showing new charges and developments in pending
cases. The bulletin includes a "wanted" section listing the names and
references to bulletins containing descriptive information as to persons wanted on securities violations charges. The bulletin is distributed to a limited number of officials of cooperating law
enforcement and other agencies in the United States and Canada.
Extensive use is made of the information available in these records
by regulatory and law enforcing officials. Numerous requests are received each year for special reports on individuals in addition to the
information supplied by regular distribution of the quarterly bulletin. All available information is supplied in response to inquiries

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

from law enforcement agencies. During the fiscal year the Commission received and disposed of 3,216 "securities violations" letters
or reports and dispatched 812 communications to cooperating
agencies,
APPLICATION

FOR NONDISCWSURE

OF CERTAIN INFORMATION

The Commission is authorized under the various acts administered
by it to grant requests for nondisclosure of certain types of information which would otherwise be disclosed to the public in applications,
reports or other documents filed pursuant to these statutes. Thus,
under paragraph (30) of schedule A of the Securities Act of 1933,
disclosure of any portion of a material contract is not required if the
Commission determines that such disclosure would impair the value
of the contract and is not necessary for the protection of investors.
Under section 24(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, trade
secrets or processes need not be disclosed in any material filed with
the Commission. Under section 24(b) of that act written objection
to public disclosure of information contained in any material filed
with the Commission may be made to the Commission which is then
authorized to make public disclosure of such information only if in
its judgment such disclosure is in the public interest. Similar provisions are contained in section 22 of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935and in section 45 of the Investment Company Act of
1940. These statutory provisions have been implemented by rules
specifying the procedure to be followed by applicants seeking a determination that public disclosure is not necessary in a particular case.
The number of applications granted, denied or otherwise acted
upon during the year are set forth in the following table:

ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION

IN ACCOUNTING

AND AUDITING

The several acts administered by the Commission recognize the
importance of dependable informative financial statements which disclose the financial status and earnings history of a corporation or

180

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

other commercial entity, These statements, whether filed in compliance with the requirements under those statutes or included in other
material available to stockholders or prospective investors, are indispensable to investors as a basis for investment decisions. The Congress, cognizant of the fact that such statements lend themselves
readily to misleading inferences or even deception, whether or not
intended, included express provisions with respect to disclosure requirements. Thus, for example, the Securities Act requires the inclusion in the prospectus of balance sheets and profit and loss statements "in such form as the Commission shall prescribe" 10 and
authorizes the Commission to prescribe the "items or details to be
shown in the balance sheet and earnings statement, and the methods to
be followed in the preparation of accounts * * *." 11 Similar authority is contained in the Securities Exchange Act,12and even more comprehensive power is embodied in the Investment Company Act 13and
the Public Utility Holding Company Act.14
Pursuant to the broad rule-making power thus conferred with respect to the preparation and presentation of financial statements, the
Commission has prescribed uniform systems of accounts for companies subject to the Holding Company Act; 15has adopted rules
under the Securities Exchange Act goyerning accounting and auditing of securities brokers and dealers; 16and has promulgated rules
contained in a single. comprehensive regulation, identified as regulation S-X,17 which govern the form and content of financial statements
filed in compliance with the several acts. This regulation is implemented by the Commission's Accounting Series Releases, of which
89 haye so far been issued. These releases were inaugurated in 1937
and were designed as a program for making public, from time to time,
opinions on accounting principles for the purpose of contributing to
the development of uniform standards and practice in major accounting questions. The rules and regulations thus established, except for
the uniform systems of accounts which are regulatory reports, prescribe accounting principles to be followed only in certain limited
areas. In the large area of financial reporting not covered by such
rules. the Commission's principal means of protecting investors from
inadequate financial reporting. fraudulent practices and overreaching

by management under the various acts is by requiring the report of an
independent public accountant 'which is based on auditing standards
and prepared in accordance with accounting principles and practices which are recognized as sound and which have attained general
acceptance.
The Securities Act provides that the financial statements required
to be made available to the public through filing with the Commission
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant.' 18
The other three statutes permit the Commission to require that such
statements be accompanied by a certificate of an independent public
accountant," and the Commission's rules require, with minor exceptions, that they be so certified. The value of certification by qualified
accountants has been conceded for many years, but the requirement
as to independence, long recognized and adhered to by some individual accountants, was for the first time authoritatively and explicitly introduced into law in IV33. The Commission's rules are designed to accept accountants qualified to practice in their own St ate
as qualified to practice before the Commission unless they have entered into disqualifying relationships with a particular client, such
as becoming a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee, director, officer,
employee, or stockholder; 20 or, in rare cases, have demonstrated incompetence, subservience to the management, or have engaged in unethical
and improper professional conduct." The Commission has worked
along these lines to encourage and foster an independent state of mind
of the accountant with respect to his dealings with his client so that
he may better be able to perform the service to the public contemplated
by the Congress in the various acts.
The Commission is vigilant in its efforts to assure itself that. the
audits which it requires are performed by independent accountants ;
that the information contained in the financial reports represents full
and fair disclosure and that appropriate auditing and accounting
practices and standards have been followed in their preparation. In
addition it recognizes that changes and new developments in financial
and economic conditions affect the operations and financial status of
the several thousand commercial and industrial companies required
to file statements with the Commission and that accounting and auditing procedures cannot remain static and continue to serve well a dynamic economy. The Commission's accounting staff, therefore,
studies the changes and new developments for the purpose of estabSections 7 and 10(a) (schedule A, pars. 25, 26).

lishing and maintaining appropriate accounting and auditing policies, procedures and practices for the protection of investors. The
primary responsibility for this program rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission, who has general supervision with respect to
accounting and auditing policies and their application.
Progress in these activities requires continuing contact and consultat ion between the staff and accountants both individually and through
such representative groups as, among others, the American Accounting Association, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the American Petroleum Institute, the Controllers Institute
of America, the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, and the National Federation of Financial Analysts
Societies, as well as other Government agencies. Recognizing the importance of cooperation in the formulation of accounting principles
and practices, adequate disclosure and auditing procedures which will
hest serve the interests of investors, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants, the Controllers Institute of America, and the
National Federation of Financial Analysts Societies appoint committees which maintain liaison with the Commission's staff. The
Commission on its part has authorized its Chief Accountant to continue to serve as a member of an advisory committee to the accounting
principles board of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants.
The many daily decisions of the Commission require the almost constant attention of some of the Chief Accountant's staff. These include questions raised by each of the operating divisions of the Commission, the regional officesand the Commission. As a result of this
day-to-day activity of the Commission and the need to keep abreast of
r-urrent accounting- problems, the Chief Accountant's staff spends
much time in the examination and reexamination of sound and generally accepted accounting and auditing principles and practices.
From time to time members of the staff are called upon to assist in
field investigations, to participate in hearings and to review opinions
insofar as they pertain to accounting matters.
Prefiling and other conferences, in person or by telephone, with
officials of corporations, practicing accountants and others occupy a
considerable amount of the available time of the staff. This procedure,
which has proven to be one of the most important functions of the
Office of the Chief Accountant and of the Chief Accountant of the
Division of Corporation Finance and his staff, saves registrants and
their representatives both time and expense.
Many specific accounting and auditing problems arise as a result
of the examination of financial statements required to be filed with
the Commission. Where examination reveals that the rules and reg-

ulations of the Commission have not been complied with or that
applicable generally accepted accounting principles have not been
adhered to, the Examining Division usually notifies the registrant by
an informal letter of comment. These letters of comment and the
correspondence or conferences that follow continue to be a most convenient and satisfactory method of effecting corrections and improvements in financial statements, both to registrants and to the Commission's staff. Where particularly difficult or novel questions arise
which cannot be settled by the accounting staff of the divisions and
by the Chief Accountant, they are referred to the Commission for
consideration and decision. By these administrative procedures the
Commission deals with many accounting questions.
These procedures are particularly applicable to the problems which
arise in connection with initial filings made by new corporate entities
and by corporations whose securities had been closely held or traded
over the counter. Currently there are many such filings being made
oy companies whose business is closely associated with rapidly growing technological and scientific developments and with our expanding population, as in real estate and recreational activities.
Some of the problems frequently causing difficulty arise because
audits made in prior years did not measure up to generally accepted
standards, particularly in that they often omitted accepted-audit procedures with respect to inventories and receivables. These procedures
require observation of inventories and confirmation of receivables
where either of these assets represents a significant proportion of the
current assets or of the total assets of a concern. Failure to apply
them where they are practicable and reasonable generally precludes
expression of an opinion on the fairness of the financial statements
taken as a whole because the income, earned surplus, and the current
position may be materially affected. If the auditor finds himself
faced with such a situation, he must satisfy himself as to inventories
for prior years by appropriate methods. In some instances this is
very difficult and may preclude certification because the client may
not have taken an inventory at any prior yearend or because inventory records for such years are incomplete or because such records
may have been destroyed.
Other difficulties often arise in connection with the initial filings of
such companies because accountants and other advisers serving them
have not had any prior dealing with the Commission. In some cases
these persons have not familiarized themselves with the rules and
regulations of the Commission-particularly
the instructions as to
financial statements required by the forms, the rules relating to independence of the certifying accountant, and those relating to the form
and content of financial statements set forth in regulation S-X.

COMMISSION

During the fiscal year the Chief Accountant and his staff cooperated
with other divisions of the Commission in the preparation of proposals
to amend articles 7 and 12 of regulation S-X governing the form and
content of financial statements and schedules filed by insurance companies other than life and title insurance companies; to amend form
10-Ie and regulation S-X setting forth the disclosures and financial
statements required by employee stock purchase, savings or similar
plans; and for a new form for the registration of securities of certain
real estate companies. The revision of articles 7 and 12 of regulation
S-X was adopted July 26, 1961.22 This revision reflects changes in
requirements of the annual statement filed with State regulatory authorities and developments in insurance reporting since these articles
were originally adopted.
As a result of the reluctance on the part of independent public accountants to express an opinion in respect of the financial statements
included in the annual statement and the accounting principles and
practices reflected therein as required by rule 2-02 (c) of regulation
S-X without taking exception to certain insurance accounting practices, there has grown up the practice of reconciling the statutory
capital share equity and net income or loss with capital share equity
and net income or loss as determined in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles and practices. Special note 2 of rule
7-05 gives recognition to this practice where such differences are
deemed to be material, the principal differences being in the accounting for nonadmitted assets and commissions and expenses incurred
in writing insurance.
'With respect to commission and expenses written off it has been
the practice to add back such expenses only to the extent of increase
in equity in unearned premiums, less Federal income tax effect, which
can be supported by reliable loss and expense ratios. Comparable
conservative practices are followed in making the other adjustments.
The Chief Accountant's officealso cooperated with other divisions
of the Commission in the preparation of a rule under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1040 which requires investment advisers subject to
registration with the Commission to maintain specified books and
records relating to their business. This rule as adopted by the
Commission became effective July 1, 1961.23
Early in 1959 the Commission issued its findings, opinion, and
order pursuant to rule II (e) of the Commission's Rules of Practice
denying to Theodore Bollt, formerly a partner in Bollt & Shapiro, a
firm of certified public accountants, now dissolved, who was found

to have engaged in unethical and improper professional conduct, the
privilege of practicing before the Commission until he obtained the
approval of the Commission."
Late in 1960Bollt filed a petition for reinstatement of his privilege
of practicing before the Commission.
In his petition BoIlt represented, among other things, that his professional and business reputation had not been impugned prior to
the Commission's proceedings; that on the basis of the Commission's
findings against him he was suspended from membership in the
American Institute of Certified Public Accountants for a period of 6
months, which period of suspension has expired; that although he
was no longer engaged in the practice of public accounting, and had
no intention of actively practicing as an accountant before the Commission, the issuance and continuance of the Commission's suspension
order of January 28, 1959, and the widespread publicity received by
it had severely adversely affected his business and professional standing; and that the further continuance of such order was not necessary
or appropriate in the public interest.
The Commission considered the representations set forth in the
petition and, being satisfied that under all the circumstances it would
not be inconsistent with the public interest, early in 1961it terminated
its order denying Bollt the privilege of practicing before the
Commission."
During the fiscal year the Commission issued its findings, opinion,
and order in a proceeding instituted under rule 2 (e) of its rules
of practice against Myron Swartz, a certified public accountant. The
Commission found that the respondent had made it possible for false
and misleading financial statements and certificates to be circulated
on his stationery over his signature and, thereafter, without disclosing
the falsity of such statements, continued to perform accounting services, including the preparation of incorrect and misleading statements
for filing with the Commission. The Commission found also that in
a subsequent Commission investigation respondent testified falsely
with respect to certain of the matters referred to above. The Commission concluded that, in view of the gravity of the misconduct in
the case before it and in view of the high standard of honesty and
professional conduct the Commission must demand of accountants and
others practicing before it if it is to fulfill its responsibility to protect
the public interest, Swartz should be denied the privilege of practicing
before the Commission in the future."

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

INTERNATIONAL

BANK FOR RECONSTRUCTION

AND DEVELOPMENT

Section 15 of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, as amended,
exempts from registration under both the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 securities issued, or guaranteed
as to both principal and interest, by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. The Bank is required to file with the
Commission such annual and other reports with respect to such securities as the Commission shall determine to be appropriate in view of
the special character of the Bank and its operations and necessary in
the public interest or for the protection of investors. Pursuant to
the above authority, the Commission has adopted rules requiring the
Bank to file quarterly reports and also to file copies of each annual
report of the Bank to its Board of Governors. The Bank is also required to file reports with the Commission in advance of any distribution in the United States of its primary obligations. The Commission, acting in consultation with the National Advisory Council on
International Monetary and Financial Problems, is authorized to
suspend the exemption at any time as to any or all securities issued
or guaranteed by the Bank during the period of such suspension.
During the fiscal year ending June 30,1961, the Bank made 27 loans
totaling the equivalent of $610 million, compared with a total of $659
million last year. The loans were made in Argentina, British Guiana, Burma, Ceylon, Chile, Colombia (2 loans), Costa Rica, EI Salvador, India (2 loans), Israel, Japan (4 loans), Mexico (2 loans),
Norway, Pakistan (2 loans), Panama, Peru, Sudan, Thailand,
Uganda, and Yugoslavia. This brought the gross total of loan commitments at June 30 to $5,790.5 million. By June 30, as a result of
cancellations, repayments and sales of loans, the portions of loans
signed still retained by the bank had been reduced to $4,217.2million.
During the year the Bank sold or agreed to sell $202 million principal amount of loans, all without its guarantee. On June 30 the total
sales of loans amounted to $1,013 million, of which $69 million was
with the Bank's guarantee.
The outstanding funded debt of the Bank amounted to $2,228 million on June 30, 1961, reflecting a net increase of $155.5 million over
the past year. In this period there was a gross increase in borrowings
of $837.5 million consisting of three public bond issues, two in Swiss
francs equivalent to $37.3 million and one in Netherlands guilders
equivalent to $13.8 million; the private placement of bonds and notes
equivalent to $736 million, partly to raise new funds and partly as refunding operations ($508 million in U.S. dollars, $220.2 million in
deutsche marks and $7.8 million in Swiss francs); the delivery of
$14.5 million of dollar bonds and $23.8 million in deutsche mark notes
of issues sold previously subject to delayed delivery arrangements and

TWENTY-SEVENTH

187

$12.1 million equivalent which was added to the funded debt as a resuIt of the revaluation of outstanding Netherlands guilder, Canadian
dollar, and deutsche mark bonds and notes. An amount of $182.5
m.illion of the U.S. dollar and deutsche mark borrowings in the fiscal
year had not been drawn down at .Iune 30, 1961. The funded debt was
decreased by $499.5 million as a result of the maturing of $15 million
of bonds and notes; sinking fund and purchase fund transactions
amounting to $18.5 million; and the refunding of privately placed
issues equivalent to $466million.
Pursuant to the increase in the authorized capital of the Bank from
$10 billion to $21 billion on September 15, 1959, 62 members have
doubled their subscriptions and 29 members have subscribed to
$1,396.9million in addition to their 100 percent increases. During the
fiscal year, Cuba and the Dominican Republic withdrew from membership and Portugal and Nigeria became members of the Bank
with capital subscriptions of $80 million and $66.7 million, respectively, making total membership 68. The subscribed capital of the
Bank amounted to $20.093million on .June 30, 1961.
INTER-AMERICAN

DEVELOPMENT

BANK

The Inter-American Development Bank Act, which authorizes the
United States to participate in the new Inter-American Development
Bank, provides an exemption for certain securities which may be issued by the Bank similar to the exemption provided for securities of
the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Acting pursuant to this authority, the Commission, during the fiscal year,
adopted regulation IA which require." the Bank to file with the Commission substantially the same information, documents, and reports
as are required from the International Bank for Reconstruction and
Development. The Bank is also required to file a report with the
Commission prior to the sale of any of its primary obligations to the
public in the United States. Up to .June 30, 1961, 110 such sales had
been made.
The first meeting of the Board of Governors of the Bank took place
in February 1960, and the Bank officially commenced operations on
October 1, 1960. As of .June 30, 1961, the Bank had approved loans
from its ordinary capital totaling $4,700,000 to borrowers located in
Brazil. As of that date additional applications for loans from ordinary capital were pending in the amount of $36,189,974from applicants located in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, El Salvador, Guatemala,
Honduras, Nicaragua, Peru, and Venezuela. In addition, loans from
the Bank's Fund for Special Operations had been made in Bolivia in
the total amount of $10 million. Additional loans from the fund for

188

special operations were pending in the amount of $HU50,OOO with respect to borrowers in Brazil, Haiti, Honduras, and Paraguay.
STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

During the past fiscal year the Branch of Economic Research continued its reg-uIar 'York in connection with the statistical activities of
the Commission and the overall Government statistical program under
the direction of the Office of Statistical Standards, Bureau of the
Budget. In addition, the Branch of Exchange Regulation continued
its compilation of data on the stock market.
The statistical series described below are published in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin and in addition, except :for data on registered issues and on the stock market, current figures and analyses of
the data are published in quarterly press releases.
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933

Monthly and quarterly statistics are compiled on the number and
volume of registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type
of security, and use of proceeds. Summary statistics :for the years
1935-61 are given in appendix table 1 and detailed statistics for the
fiscal year 19G1 appear in appendix table 2.
New Securities Offerings

This is a monthly and quarterly series covering all new corporate
and noncorporate issues offered for cash sale in the United States.
The series includes not only issues publicly offered but also issues
privately placed, as well as other issues exempt from registration
under the Securities Act, such as intrastate offerings and railroad
securities. The offerings series includes only securities actually offered
for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of issuers. Annual
statistics on new offerings for recent years as well as monthly figures
from January 1960 through June 1961 are given in appendix tables
3,4, and 5.
Estimates of the net cash flow through securities transactions are
prepared quarterly and are derived by deducting from the amount of
estimated gross proceeds received by corporations through the sale
of securities the amount of estimated gross payments by corporations
to investors for securities retired. Data on gross issues, retirements,
and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations and for the principal industry groups.
Individuals'

Saving

The Commission compiles quarterly estimates of the volume and
composition of individuals' saving in the United States. The series
represents net increases in individuals' financial assets less net in-

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

189

creases in debt. The study shows the aggregate amount of saving
and the form in which the saving occurred, such as investment in
securities, expansion of bank deposits, increase in insurance and pension reserves, etc. A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with
the personal saving estimates of the Department of Commerce, derived
in connection with its national income series, is published annually
by the Department of Commerce as 'Yell as in the Securities and
Exchange Commission Statistical Bulletin.
Corporate Pension Funds

An annual survey is made of pension plans of all United States
corporations where funds are administered by corporations themselves, or through trustees. The survey shows the flow of money into
these funds, the types of assets in which the funds are invested, and
the principal items of income and expenditures.
Financial Position of Corporations

The series on working capital position of all U.S. corporations, excluding banks, insurance companies, and savings and loan associations,
shows the principal components of current assets and liabilities, and
also contains an abbreviated analysis of the sources and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission, compiles a quarterly financial report of all U.S. manufacturing concerns.
This report gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated
income account, data being classified by industry and size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures

The Commission, together with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual surveys of actual and anticipated plant
and equipment expenditures of all U.S. business, exclusive of agriculture. Shortly after the close of each quarter, data are released on
actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the
beginning of each year of the plans for business expansion during
that year.
Stock Market Data

The Branch of Exchange Regulation regularly compiles statistics
on the market value and volume of sales on registered and exempted
securities exchanges, round -lot stock transactions on the New York
exchanges for accounts of members and nonmembers, odd-lot stock
transactions on the New York exchanges, special offerings, and secondary distributions. It also computes indexes of stock market
prices each week based upon the closing market prices of common
stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange. This stock price in-

190

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

dex and data on round-lot and odd-lot trading on the two New York
exchanges are released weekly. The other statistical data mentioned
above, as well as these weekly series, are published regularly in the
Commission's Statistical Bulletin.
During the fiscal year, the Commission revised its stock price index
to conform with the recommendation of the Officeof Statistical Standards that all Government indexes be compiled on a uniform and recent base period where feasible. There were two major changes in the
stock price index: (1) The base period was changed to the years
1957-59 from the former base year of 1939; and (2) the coverage
was expanded to include 32 industry classifications and 300 stocks, in
place of 29 groups covering 265 issues. 1Yeekly indexes were computed on the new base back to January 1939. The Commission published a pamphlet containing the revised indexes, a description of
the method of computation, and a list of stocks included in the indexes.
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

The Commission issues opinions in contested and other cases arising
under the statutes administered by it and under the Commission's rules
of practice, where the nature of the matter to be decided, whether
substantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance to warrant a
formal expression of views. These opinions include detailed findings
of fact and conclusions of law based on evidentiary records taken before a hearing examiner who serves independently of the operating
divisions, or, in an occasional case, before a single Commissioner or
the entire Commission. In some cases, formal hearings are waived
by the parties and the findings and conclusions are based on stipulated
facts or admissions.
The Commission, as well as individual Commissioners to whom
particular cases may be assigned for the preparation of an opinion, is
assisted in the preparation of findings and opinions by its Office of
Opinion .Writing, a staff officecompletely independent of the operating divisions of the Commission and directly responsible to the Commission itself. The independence of the staff members reflects the
principle, embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act, of a separation between staff members performing investigatory or prosecutory
functions and those performing quasi-judicial functions. In some
cases, with the consent of all parties, the interested operating division assists in the drafting of opinions.
The opinions of the Commission are publicly released and distributed to representatives of the press and to persons on the Commission's mailing list. In addition, the opinions are printed and
published by the Government Printing Office in bound volumes entitled "Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."

TWENTY-SEVENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

191

During the fiscal year 1961,the Commission issued 167opinions and
other rulings of an adjudicatory nature.
DISSEMINATION

OF INFORMATION

The objective of the laws administered by the Commission of providing public disclosure of pertinent financial and other information
concerning securities offered for public sale and those traded on
exchanges so that they may be realistically evaluated by the investing public, is furthered by various activities of the Commission which
facilitate the dissemination of such information. This is accomplished
in part, of course, through the requirements of the law and Commission rules for the distribution of the prospectus or offering circular on new offerings and the filing of annual and other periodic
reports. All registration statements and reports are available for
public inspection. Much of the data also is reprinted and receives
general circulation through published securities manuals, investment
advisory services and statistical services, which are reference material
for securities analysts and investment advisers.
To facilitate public dissemination of the financial and other proposals filed with and actions taken by it, the Commission issues a
daily News Digest containing a resume of these filings and actions.
The Digest is distributed daily to the press; and it also is distributed
on a daily, subscription basis through the Government Printing
Office (1,195 copies) and on a weekly basis by the Commission to a
mailing list comprising the names of over 11,000 individuals and
firms. Included in the Digests issued during the year were summary reports on the 1,674 registration statements filed during the
year (not including amendments pursuant to section 24(e) of the
Investment Company Act) which proposed the public offering of
$16.5 billion of securities. Also included were resumes of the 1,302
notices, orders, decisions, rules, and other announcements issued by
the Commission. Much of the information is published in the daily
press and in financial and other periodicals. The texts of the Commission's pronouncements are available to the press and given more
limited distribution to registrants, practicing lawyers, and others.
Members of the Commission and its staff frequently deliver addresses before professional, business, and other groups, and participate in "briefing" and other conferences in order to explain the
Commission's functions and activities, explain important rules and
policies, and otherwise contribute to a better understanding by individuals and firms subject to its jurisdiction as well as the investing
public of the role of the Commission.

ORGANIZATION

The Commission's staff consists of attorneys, security analysts, accountants, engineers, investigators, and administrative and clerical
personnel.
The following organizational changes have been made since June
30, 1960, in accordance with the Commission's policy of continuing
review of its organization and functional alignments:
In August 1960, the Commission established an additional Branch
of Investigations and an additional Branch of Enforcement in the
New York regional office. This action was designed to permit improved utilization of available personnel for the mounting workload
of cases requiring investigative and enforcement action and for the
regulation A, corporate reorganization and interpretative functions
of the New York regional office.
In November 1960, the position of Adviser to the Commission was
abolished and the functions were transferred to other staff officials.
In June 1961, the positions of Executive Director and Associate
Executive Director were abolished and certain functions thereof were
delegated to other members of the staff.
In August 1961, the Commission established three additional
Branches of Corporate Analysis and Examination in the Division of
Corporation Finance to handle the increased volume of filings on
proposed new financing under the Securities Act of 1933.
In October 1961, the Commission established a special study of
securities markets to conduct the study and investigation of the
adequacy of the rules of the national securities exchanges and na1Must be ordered

tional securities associations provided for by Public Law 87-196, dated
September 5, 1961.
Also in October 1961, the Commission established two new branches,
the Branch of Special Investigations, Trial and Enforcement, and
the Branch of Criminal References, in the Division of Trading and
Exchanges. This action was designed to consolidate in one division
the Commission's investigation and enforcement activities in the headquarters officeand to contribute to more effective coordination of such
activities in the several regional offices.
PERSONNEL,

BUDGET,

AND FINANCE

In fiscal 1961, the Commission continued its efforts to recruit outstanding college and law school students with the specialized academic
training required for its fields of work. Recruitment brochures
covering specific positions were prepared and articles in the recruiting literature published by the Civil Service Commission updated.
Close contacts with placement officers and finance and law professors
of various colleges and law schools enabled the Commission to hire a
number of high-caliber recent finance and law graduates to fill
positions at the entrance levels.
Early in the fiscal year, an attorney honors program was adopted,
aimed directly at those law school graduates whose academic achievements, special training and career objectives indicated an unusual
suitability for the work involved in carrying out the objectives of the
Federal securities laws. On June 19, 1961, hiring procedures for
filling attorney positions were further revised to provide for giving
an examination to those candidates who, on initial review and evaluation of their applications, are considered to be well qualified for
employment on the Commission's staff.
The Federal service entrance examination conducted by the U.S.
Civil Service Commission continues to be an excellent source of supply for the filling of competitive positions at the GS-5 and GS-7
levels, particularly in the financial analyst category. Appointments
also are made from the lists of eligibles established under this examination to investigator (trainee) and other professional job categories
at the entrance levels.
Training activities in fiscal 1961 were conducted in accordance with
the Commission's basic policies of (1) training employees to do their
work more efficiently and effectively, (2) stimulating and encouraging employee self-development and self-training to the fullest extent
and (3) affording equal opportunities for development. Supervisory
officials were enrolled in a special training course for middle and top
management officials. Professional training, though largely on the
job, was supplemented by special critique and instructional sessions

196

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE CO:MMISSION

to meet identifiable needs. For example, in the Denver regional office,
new attorneys and investigators attended sessions conducted by the
regional administrator and senior officials on special aspects of
gathering evidence and developing securities fraud cases. In ",Vashington, a briefing conference on securities laws and regulations, which
was sponsored by the Federal Bar Association and in which members of the Commission and top officials participated, served an additional purpose of training junior and intermediate staff members,
who were selected to attend at no cost to the Commission those sessions particularly pertinent to their work.
The average grade level of positions in the Commission in fiscal
ID61 was GS-8.88 compared with GS-8.D3 for 1960. Approximately
200 positions were studied and grades substantiated or adjusted.
Proper grade allocations for its top-level positions continue to be
of utmost importance to the Commission for the effective execution
of its programs. In the interest of attracting and retaining highly
qualified persons for these positions, continuous efforts are being made
to obtain favorable consideration of recommendations, heretofore
submitted to the Civil Service Commission, to place these positions
in grades GS-16, GS-17 and GS-18 as spaces become available.
A total of D55 employees were eligible to enroll in the Federal employees health benefits program which went into effect on July 10,
1960. Of this number 845, or 89 percent, elected to enroll in health
plans offered under the program. Sixty percent selected the service
(Blue Cross) plan, 32 percent the indemnity (Aetna Life Insurance
Co.) plan and 8 percent local comprehensive medical plans. Ninetythree percent of the employees enrolling in plans chose the high
option.
In its sixth annual service and merit awards ceremony held in
October 1960, the Commission for the first time gave formal recognition to those members of the staff whose term of service included time
completed in other Federal agencies. The length-of-service emblem
pin used by various Federal agencies was adopted. In addition, new
15-year and 25-year SEC service pins now make it possible to reward
length of service with the Commission at 5-year intervals commencing with the completion of 10 years. Pins covering total Federal
service were awarded to 3 employees for 40 years, 7 employees for
35 years and 16 employees for 30 years. Fifty-five employees received pins for 25 years of SEC service. Cash awards totaling $6,800
and certificates of merit were presented to 54 employees and 13 employees received a total of $395 for suggestions adopted during the

TWENTY-SEVENTH

197

ANNUAL REPORT

of awards made by other organizations. On March 21, 1960,Manuel
F. Cohen, Director, Division of Corporation Finance, was 1 of 10
employees throughout the Federal service to receive a Career Service
Award presented by the National Civil Service League annually. Mr.
Cohen was selected on the basis of a "record of Federal service exemplifying outstanding qualities of technical competence and efficiency,
and personal and intellectual integrity of the highest order." On
May 20, 1961, the Federal Government Accountants Association presented its first National Award for Distinguished Leadership to Andrew Barr, Chief Accountant of the Commission, Mr. Barr received
his award "for distinguished leadership in formulating and administering financial requirements placed upon the business community
under the laws administered by the Securities and Exchange
Commission."
In February 1961, Magdalen B. Murphy, attorney-adviser, and
Helen K. Steiner, analytical statistician, both on the staff of the Division of Trading and Exchanges, were presented citations in recognition of their contributions to the public service and to the prestige
of women employees in the Federal Government.
The trustees of the .William A. Jump :.\Iemorial Foundation in :May
1961 presented Andrew N. Grass, Jr., a chief enforcement attorney
in the New York regional office,a certificate and citation in recognition of his exemplary accomplishments and special contributions to
the efficiencyand prestige of the public service.
The Commission is justifiably proud of the devoted, conscientious,
and competent service rendered by its staff. Public recognition is an
essential factor in building and maintaining the prestige of public
careers and awards of this nature serve to improve the quality of public administration and the morale and public service motivations of
Federal employees.
The following comparative table shows the personnel strength of the
Commission as of June 30, 1960and 1961:
