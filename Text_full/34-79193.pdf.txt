Summary

1.
Respondent Adrian D. Beamish repeatedly engaged in improper professional
conduct during PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP’s audits of Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III,
LP, a $283 million San Francisco-based venture capital fund. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, was
first engaged to conduct the audits of the venture capital fund’s year-end 2006 financial
statements. As detailed below, Beamish, as the engagement partner, failed to comply with the
relevant professional standards in connection with his audits of the fund’s 2009, 2010, 2011, and
2012 year-end financial statements.
2.
In the audit of the venture capital fund’s year-end 2009 financial statements,
Beamish became aware that the fund’s founder, G. Steven Burrill, had arranged for the fund to
pay millions of dollars to other companies that Burrill owned and controlled. From 2009 through
2011, Burrill characterized the payments as advances on future management fees that he would
earn through the provision of future management services as the fund’s manager. The payments
were made many months—and even years—before the fees were to be earned. In each of these
three years, Beamish failed to inquire whether Burrill had the authority to take the unusual
payments, nor did he scrutinize the rationale for the payments, which Burrill needed to pay his
own personal expenses and to fund his other businesses. Significantly, in conducting the yearend 2012 audit, Beamish learned that the advanced management fee payments that had been paid
greatly exceeded any potential future management fee obligations the fund might owe.
3.
Despite an advanced management fee balance rapidly growing over several years
and not decreasing, and Beamish’s own audit team’s suggested financial disclosure language
being rejected by management, Beamish improperly signed audit reports with unqualified
opinions for the fund’s year-end 2009, 2010, 2011, and 2012 financial statements, in violation of
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards (“GAAS”). In addition, the fund’s financial statements,
for those same years, did not comply with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (“GAAP”).
Further, Beamish relied upon unreasonable bases as the supposed means for repayment of the
advanced management fee balance.

Related Persons and Entities

5.
G. Steven Burrill, age 71, resides in San Francisco, California, and Eagle River,
Wisconsin. From 1977 to 1993, Burrill was a partner at a large audit firm and focused on the
biotechnology industry. Burrill began raising venture capital funds when he left the audit firm in
1993. In addition to venture capital funds, Burrill owned and controlled a number of affiliated
businesses, including an investment adviser, a merchant banking firm, and a media company. On
March 16, 2016, Burrill, a CPA, was suspended from appearing or practicing before the
Commission as an accountant and was barred from association with any broker, dealer, investment
adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally recognized
statistical rating organization and prohibited from serving or acting as an employee, officer, director,
member of an advisory board, investment adviser or depositor of, or principal underwriter for, a
registered investment company or affiliated person of such investment adviser, depositor, or
principal underwriter.
6.
Burrill Capital Management, LLC (“BCM”) is a Delaware limited liability
company and filed reports as an exempt reporting adviser with the Commission from April 2012
to January 2015, when it withdrew its registration. Burrill Capital Management is wholly owned
by Burrill and had its principal place of business in San Francisco, California. Now defunct,
BCM acted as the adviser to several venture capital funds operated by Burrill. Burrill also used
BCM as the operating entity through which he directed resources to his affiliated businesses. As
of its last filing in March 2014, BCM reported $358.6 million in total assets under management.
7.
Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III, LP (“Fund III” or the “Fund”) is a
Delaware limited partnership formed by Burrill in 2006. The Fund received $283 million in
venture capital funds to invest in life sciences companies. The Fund retained BCM as its
investment adviser.
8.
Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III Partners, LP (“General Partner”), a
Delaware limited partnership, was the General Partner of Fund III during the relevant time
period. The General Partner’s Investment Committee included Burrill and four others. The
General Partner was entitled to receive fees for managing the Fund, but also could designate an
affiliate to receive the fees.
9.
Burrill Capital, LLC (“Management Company”) is a Delaware limited liability
company owned and controlled entirely by Burrill. As described further below, in its 2012
financial statements, the Fund stated that the Management Company was responsible for
repaying the balance of the management fees that had been advanced to the General Partner.
10.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PricewaterhouseCoopers” or “PwC”)
provides audit, assurance, tax, transaction, and advisory services throughout the United States,
and throughout the world via their members firms. Auditors from its San Jose, California office
conducted the audits of Fund III for fiscal years 2006-2012.

D.

Formation of Fund and Retention of PricewaterhouseCoopers as Auditors

11.
Burrill formed Fund III in 2006 to invest in life sciences companies. Established
with a projected 10-year lifespan, Fund III was originally scheduled to expire in February 2016.
Fund III is structured as a limited partnership. Investors in Fund III, which include public
companies, pension funds, and institutional investors, are limited partners in the Fund. During
the relevant period, Burrill Life Sciences Capital Fund III Partners, LP served as the Fund’s
General Partner. Five individuals, including Burrill, controlled the General Partner.
12.
The rights and responsibilities of the General Partner and the limited partners of
Fund III are governed by a limited partnership agreement (“LPA”). The LPA delineates, among
other things, the manner and amount of the General Partner’s fees for managing the Fund.
According to the LPA, the General Partner or its designee is entitled to two percent of committed
capital for six years, payable on the first day of each fiscal quarter for management services to be
rendered during that quarter. After the initial six years, the General Partner or its designee is
entitled to two percent of the cost basis of the investments, plus reserves. As enumerated in the
LPA, the management fee was intended to be used by the General Partner to cover expenses in
connection with the management of the fund, including salaries, travel, and rent. The LPA did
not authorize the General Partner to take management fees more than one quarter in advance, and
prohibited non-arm’s length transactions between Fund III and the General Partner or its
members without explicit approval of an advisory committee of limited partners.
13.
The Fund’s offering materials state that a major financial accounting firm would
issue a report on the financial statements annually. In addition, the LPA similarly stipulated that
the Fund would issue financial statements in accordance with GAAP, and would be audited
annually by a public accountant of recognized national standing.
14.
Beginning in 2006, the Fund issued annual financial statements and retained
PricewaterhouseCoopers to serve as its auditor to conduct annual audits on the Fund. Beamish
served as the PwC audit partner responsible for the audit team’s compliance with the appropriate
professional standards. As the engagement partner, Beamish had final authority over the
planning, execution, and supervision of the audits and was responsible for audit reports issued by
PwC on the Fund’s financial statements.
15.
For the year-end 2009 through year-end 2012 audits, Beamish authorized
PricewaterhouseCoopers to issue audit reports with unqualified opinions stating that the Fund’s
financial statements were presented fairly, in all material respects, in accordance with GAAP and
that the audits were conducted in accordance with GAAS. In reality, however, the Fund’s
financial statements failed to comply with GAAP and the audits failed to comply with GAAS.
E.

Burrill Took “Advanced Management Fees” to Fund Other Businesses

16.
In late 2007, Burrill and his affiliated businesses began to face cash flow
shortages. Burrill Capital Management, the adviser to Fund III and the entity through which
Burrill operated and funded his affiliated businesses, maintained records showing that the
expenses of the Burrill affiliates far exceeded the revenue that the businesses were generating.

4

Even though he did not solely control the Fund’s General Partner, Burrill unilaterally directed
BCM’s controller to take $400,000 from Fund III to make up for the cash shortfall in BCM.
Burrill justified the withdrawal as an “advance on management fees” that the General Partner
expected to earn in the first quarter of 2008. The advance was recorded as a “prepaid expense”
on the books of Fund III.
17.
By mid-2008, Burrill, alone directing the General Partner, had begun to take
routine and significant advances on management fees. Whenever BCM, or Burrill’s affiliated
entities, faced a cash shortfall, Burrill arranged to cover the shortfall by taking money from
Fund III and recording it as a prepaid expense to BCM on the Fund’s books. Advanced
management fees from Fund III became a consistent cash source for the affiliates and for Burrill
personally. Burrill used the money to pay for, among other things, salaries of employees of the
related entities and his personal expenses. These advanced management fees appeared in the
Fund’s financial statements as “prepaid expenses” or “receivables,” as described below.
F.

During the Year-End 2009, 2010, and 2011 Audits, Beamish Failed
to Scrutinize the Advanced Fees Appropriately

18.
The amount of the advanced management fees taken by the General Partner was
disclosed to the PricewaterhouseCoopers audit team. Through the audits, Beamish became aware
that the balance of the advanced management fees increased by millions of dollars every year
from 2009 through 2011:


By the end of 2009, the advanced management fee balance totaled $4,927,374,
representing almost one year of advanced management fees.



By the end of 2010, the advanced management fee balance had grown to
$9,259,317, or just under two years of advanced management fees.



By the end of 2011, the advanced management fee balance had grown to
$13,374,569, or nearly three full years in advanced management fees.

19.
These balances were significant, far surpassing PwC’s internally-established
threshold for materiality and were recognized by the PwC audit team, and by Beamish
particularly, as unusual in the industry. According to the relevant GAAS standards that relate to
the consideration of possibility of fraud, if an auditor becomes aware of significant and unusual
transactions, the auditor should gain an understanding of “the business rationale of such
transactions and whether that rationale (or lack thereof) suggests that such transactions may have
been entered into to engage in fraudulent financial reporting or to conceal the misappropriation
of assets.” AU § 316.66.3 Furthermore, in assessing the risk of material misstatement, the auditor
must consider there is a risk that “involves significant non-routine transactions . . . outside the
normal course of business for the entity, or that otherwise appear to be unusual.” AU § 314.111.

“AU” and “AU-C” refer to Statements on Auditing Standards issued by the American Institute
of Certified Public Accountants.

20.
Despite the significant and unusual nature of the payment of the advanced
management fees, Beamish and the PwC audit team took no steps to try to understand the
business rationale for the payments. And even though the balance of the advanced fees grew
steadily during 2009, 2010, and 2011, Beamish did not inquire into the rationale for the
advances, nor did Beamish inquire as to why the amount grew.
21.
Had Beamish made appropriate inquiries as required by professional standards,
his audit team would have likely discovered that the fees advanced to the General Partner had
been used for the business operations of affiliated Burrill entities, such as Burrill Securities LLC,
and to pay for Burrill’s own personal expenses. Further, Beamish did not attempt to obtain
evidence about whether Burrill and the affiliated entities were authorized to receive such
payments, as well as whether they had the ability to repay the amounts.
22.
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards require auditors to exercise “due
professional care” throughout an audit. AU § 230. Due professional care requires an auditor to
exercise professional skepticism, “an attitude that includes a questioning mind and a critical
assessment of audit evidence.” AU § 230.07. “Since evidence is gathered and evaluated
throughout the audit, professional skepticism should be exercised throughout the audit process.”
AU § 230.08. The auditor “should not be satisfied with less than persuasive evidence because of
a belief that management is honest.” AU § 230.09; see also AU § 316.13. This is particularly
true with respect to related party transactions. Audit procedures for related party transactions
“should extend beyond inquiry of management” and require an auditor to obtain an
“understanding of the business purpose of the transaction.” AU § 334.09.
23.
Beamish failed to exercise the professional care required by GAAS in the audits
of the Fund’s 2009, 2010, and 2011 financial statements. Beamish took no steps to obtain audit
evidence that the payments were properly approved and authorized, even as the balance
continued to grow year to year. During the audit of the Fund’s year-end 2011 financial
statements, Beamish’s audit team calculated the total future management fees due to the General
Partner for the remaining life of Fund III. The audit team estimated there was approximately
$10.2 million left in future management fees to be earned by the General Partner over the
remainder of the contractual life of Fund III, beyond the nearly $13.4 million that had already
been advanced. The audit team concluded that the General Partner could “earn down” the
balance, through the provision of management services by the expected termination of the Fund
in 2016.
24.
The auditors’ calculation of the amount of future fees available to the General
Partner during the 2011 audit, however, was incorrect by a significant margin. If his audit team
had correctly calculated the future management fees to be earned, using a conservative
calculation, Beamish would have realized there was, at most, $3.2 million in future fees to be
earned—not the $10.2 million that the PwC team had calculated. After the approximately $3.2
million was paid, Fund III would have no contractual obligation to pay additional management
fees to the General Partner or its designee for the remaining contractual term of the Fund. Had
Beamish exercised the appropriate professional skepticism required of him as an auditor,
especially in light of the ever increasing advanced management fee balance, he should have
questioned and sought evidence for the premise that the advanced management fee balance

6

would likely be recovered simply through the provision of future management services by the
General Partner.
25.
From his audit, moreover, Beamish learned that the Fund described the advanced
management fee balance as a “receivable,” or undocumented loan, to the General Partner in the
year-end 2009, 2010, and 2011 financial statements. Generally Accepted Auditing Standards
require special scrutiny of interest-free loans between related parties and loans with “no
scheduled terms for when or how the funds will be repaid.” AU § 334.03. When confronted with
such an undocumented loan, an auditor is required to “[d]etermine whether the transaction has
been approved by those charged with governance.” AU § 334.09. Nonetheless, Beamish, and the
PwC auditors working at his direction, took no steps to determine whether such a loan to the
General Partner was permitted by the LPA. Nor did Beamish inquire whether the General
Partner’s governing documents permitted Burrill to take the advanced fees without the consent of
the General Partner.
G.

The Fund’s Year-End 2009, 2010, and 2011 Financial Statements
Failed to Disclose Fees Accurately

26.
Generally Accepted Auditing Standards concerning related party transactions
require that an “auditor should view related party transactions within the framework of existing
[accounting] pronouncements, placing primary emphasis on the adequacy of disclosure.” AU
§ 334.02 (emphasis added). Furthermore, an auditor should apply procedures to obtain
satisfaction about the related party transactions and the effect on financial statements. AU
§ 334.09. For each “material related party transaction . . . common ownership or management
control relationship . . . the auditor should consider whether he has obtained sufficient
appropriate audit evidence to understand the relationship of the parties and . . . the effects of the
transaction on the financial statements.” AU § 334.11. Disclosures of related party transactions
must include (1) the nature of the relationships involved; (2) a description of the transactions and
other such information deemed necessary to an understanding of the effects of the transactions
on the financial statements; and (3) the terms and manner of settlement. ASC 850-10-50-1.4
27.
The Fund III year-end 2009, 2010, and 2011 financial statements inconsistently
and inaccurately disclosed the nature of the advanced management fees. In none of the three
year-end financial statements did the Fund adequately disclose that management fees were being
advanced:


The balance sheet in the Fund’s year-end 2009 audited financial statements
included the amount of advanced management fees as an undefined part of a larger
“prepaid expense” paid by the Fund. The balance sheets in the 2010 and 2011
financial statements similarly included the amount of advanced management fees as
an undefined part of a larger amount of “prepaid expenses and other receivables,”
but did not separately show a related party receivable on the balance sheet as
required by GAAP (and in particular, ASC 850-10-50-2). The balance sheets did

“ASC” refers to the Accounting Standards Codification issued by the Financial Accounting
Standards Board.
4

7

not further describe the nature of the “prepaid expenses” or “receivables,” and made
no explicit reference to the payment of advanced management fees.


The Related Party footnotes to the year-end 2009, 2010, and 2011 audited financial
statements described the amount of the advanced management fees only as a
“receivable from the General Partner.” The footnotes did not further describe the
transaction nor the terms and manner of settlement of the so-called “receivable,” as
required by GAAP. ASC 850-10-50-1.



The Management Fee footnotes to the year-end 2009, 2010, and 2011 audited
financial statements merely described the amount the General Partner was legally
entitled to receive over the course of the calendar year in accordance with the LPA.
The footnotes did not disclose that the Fund had actually paid advanced
management fees, and contained no references to the amounts described as “prepaid
expenses” and “receivables” on the balance sheets or a cross-reference to the
Related Party footnotes. As a result, the footnotes further created a misleading
picture of the Fund’s financial statements for each period.

28.
The Fund’s audited financial statements materially misstated the nature of the
related party payments. Beamish failed to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to
determine whether GAAP compliant disclosure of the payments made was adequate, as required
by GAAS, when he authorized PricewaterhouseCoopers to issue audit reports with unqualified
opinions on the Fund’s year-end 2009, 2010, and 2011 financial statements.
H.

Beamish Issued a Clean Opinion on the Fund’s Year-End 2012 Financial Statements

29.
By the first quarter of 2012, the General Partner was paid more in management
fees from Fund III than the General Partner was contractually entitled to earn over the entire 10year life of the Fund. At the end of 2012, the balance of the advanced management fees totaled
$17,922,059. Beamish was aware of the balance of advanced management fees in connection
with the audit of the Fund’s 2012 financial statements. Under Beamish’s supervision, the PwC
audit team calculated that the fund overpaid in excess of approximately $7 million in
management fees.
30.
Aware that millions of dollars in excess management fees had been taken from
the Fund, the audit team proposed to BCM management that the Fund provide the following
additional disclosure in its year-end 2012 financial statements: “Prepaid expenses and other
receivables at December 31, 2012 include $17.9 million due from the General Partner. This
amount exceeds the expected future management fee expenses for the remaining contractual life
of the fund.” (Emphasis added.) When BCM management rejected the second sentence of
Beamish’s proposal regarding the excessive amount, however, Beamish agreed that the
additional disclosure need not be included in the Fund’s financial statements.
31.
Shortly thereafter, BCM management told Beamish that Burrill had executed an
unsecured promissory note for the full amount of the advanced management fee balance. The
BCM controller provided PwC with the promissory note, which was dated December 31, 2012.
After receiving the note, Beamish’s audit team suggested a revision to the proposed Related

8

Party footnote for the Fund’s year-end 2012 financial statements to describe the terms of the
note, the manner of settlement, and the interest rate. The auditors provided the suggestion to
BCM management. Three days later, the BCM controller told Beamish that Burrill “strongly
feels he does not want the footnote as currently worded to be included in the financials” and that
the note had been “withdrawn.” The reference to the promissory note was omitted from the yearend 2012 audited financial statements.
32.
In April 2013, the Fund issued its year-end 2012 financial statements with an
audit report with an unqualified audit opinion from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The audited
financial statements materially misstated the nature of the related party payments. Beamish failed
to obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence to determine whether GAAP compliant disclosure
of the payments was made, as required by GAAS, when he authorized PwC to issue its audit
report with an unqualified opinion. The balance sheet identified the advanced management fees
as part of a larger amount of “prepaid expenses and other receivables from related party” owed to
the Fund, but did not separately show a related party receivable on the balance sheet as required
by GAAP (and in particular, ASC 850-10-50-2).
33.
In the Related Party footnote to the year-end 2012 financial statements, the Fund
described the advanced management fees only as a “receivable” owed by the Management
Company, Burrill Capital, LLC—not the General Partner, as had been disclosed in the year-end
2009, 2010, and 2011 financial statements. The footnote did not further describe the transaction
nor the terms of the “receivable,” as required by GAAP (and in particular, ASC 850-10-50-1).
34.
The footnote further stated that the Management Company “intends to pay” the
receivable “from future distributions to the General Partner” and from “Management Company
funds.” Beamish and his audit team, however, failed to obtain sufficient audit evidence of the
receivable’s collectability, as required by GAAS. An auditor “should design and perform audit
procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances for the purpose of obtaining sufficient
appropriate audit evidence.” AU-C § 500.06. Furthermore, an auditor should “obtain sufficient
appropriate audit evidence about whether related party relationships and transitions have been
appropriately identified, accounted for, and disclosed in the financial statements.” AU-C
§ 550.09.
35.
With respect to the collectability of the receivable “from future distributions to the
General Partner,” Beamish looked only to the Fund’s capital account for the General Partner,
which was fair valued at $15.3 million as of December 31, 2012. As set forth in the LPA, the
General Partner’s right to use the capital account was conditioned on the performance of its
management duties (including, among other things, not breaching its fiduciary duties nor engaging
in willful or reckless misconduct or fraud). Significantly, the LPA provided that if the General
Partner failed to make its required capital contributions to the Fund, its right to the capital account
could be substantially impaired. As Beamish and the PwC audit team were aware, the General
Partner had not made its required capital contributions from 2009 through 2012 and was instead
adding the amount of the contributions to the advanced management fee balance each year. By
relying only on the value of the General Partner’s capital account, and failing to consider that the
General Partner did not make its required capital contributions, Beamish failed to obtain sufficient
appropriate audit evidence about the collectability of the receivable. Additionally, when faced with
inconsistent audit evidence, “the auditor should determine what modifications or additions to audit

9

procedures are necessary to resolve the matter…” AU-C § 500.10. In this situation, Beamish
failed to identify the contradictory audit evidence and thus did not consider additional audit
procedures to test the collectability of the receivable.
36.
Furthermore, Beamish relied on Burrill’s representations about the General
Partner’s intent to pay the receivable through its future distributions without determining whether
Burrill had authority to bind the entity. Beamish did not inquire whether the General Partner’s
governing documents permitted Burrill to commit the future distributions of the General Partner.
Nor did Beamish obtain evidence of the financial condition of the General Partner to determine
whether the General Partner was encumbered by other financial obligations. Thus, Beamish’s
failure to scrutinize the representations made by Burrill regarding the intent to pay the receivable
“from future distributions to the General Partner” demonstrated a significant lack of professional
skepticism by Beamish under the circumstances.
37.
Nor did Beamish take any steps to verify whether the Management Company had
the funds to repay the receivable. Had Beamish requested the Management Company’s balance
sheet, he would have discovered that the Management Company had less than $1,600 in cash on
hand as of December 31, 2012, and that its remaining assets were illiquid and arose out of related
party transactions with other Burrill entities. Generally Accepted Accounting Standards state that
written representations “complement other auditing procedures and do not provide sufficient
appropriate audit evidence on their own about any of the matters with which they deal.” AU-C
580.04. Additionally, “if written representations are inconsistent with other audit evidence, the
auditor should perform audit procedures to attempt to resolve the matter.” AU-C 580.23.
Instead, in violation of the professional standards required by GAAS, Beamish relied only on
Burrill’s representations about the sources and means of repayment.
38.
As in the year-end 2009-2011 audited financial statements, the Management Fee
footnote to the Fund’s year-end 2012 financial statements merely described the amount the
General Partner was legally entitled to receive over the course of the calendar year in accordance
with the LPA. The footnote did not disclose that the Fund had actually paid advanced
management fees, and contained no references to the amounts described as “prepaid expenses”
and “receivables” on the balance sheet and in the Related Party footnote.
39.
With respect to the year-end 2012 audit specifically, Beamish was responsible for
obtaining audit evidence that “significant related party transactions outside the entity’s normal
course of business . . . have been appropriately authorized and approved.” AU-C § 550.24. This
he did not do. Beamish and the audit team took no steps to determine whether the LPA permitted
the payment of management fees in excess of what the General Partner would be entitled to earn,
or loans to related parties without approval of an advisory committee of limited partners.
40.
Beamish failed to maintain professional skepticism with respect to the audit of the
Fund’s year-end 2012 financial statements, as required by GAAS (and in particular, AU-C
§ 200.08). Beamish did not inquire about the business rationale for taking advanced management
fees, even after BCM management resisted his proposed additional disclosure and “withdrew”
the promissory note, contrary to GAAS (and in particular, AU-C § 240.32 and AU-C §§ 315.2829). By failing to make inquiry into these matters, and instead relying on the representations of
BCM management, Beamish fell short of the professional standards required by GAAS.

I.

PricewaterhouseCoopers Resigned as Auditor of the Fund

41.
From the beginning of 2013 through the issuance of the Fund’s year-end 2012
audited financial statements on April 4, 2013, Burrill, alone directing the General Partner, took
an additional $3.2 million in advanced management fees. After the audit opinion was issued,
Burrill took another $1.15 million in advanced management fees through July 2013.
42.
In late August 2013, the Fund’s investment committee became aware that
virtually all the committed capital in Fund III had been spent. Emergency meetings of the
investment committee were convened. Over the following weeks, the other members of the
General Partner were informed that the Fund paid approximately $18 million in advanced
management fees. The amounts taken exceeded the amount to which the General Partner was
entitled to receive over the contractual life of the Fund by millions of dollars.
43.
In late October 2013, three members of the General Partner sent a letter to the
advisory committee of the limited partners informing them of Burrill’s misappropriation. In
response, the advisory committee of the limited partners removed the General Partner, including

Violations

47.
As a result of the conduct described above, Respondent engaged in improper
professional conduct within the meaning of Section 4C(a)(2) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice.
48.
Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) provide, in part, that the
Commission may censure or deny, temporarily or permanently, the privilege of appearing or
practicing before the Commission to any person who is found by the Commission to have
engaged in “improper professional conduct.” In relevant part, Section 4C(b)(2) and
Rule 102(e)(1)(iv)(B) define “improper professional conduct” as one of two types of negligent
conduct: (1) a single instance of highly unreasonable conduct in circumstances for which
heightened scrutiny is warranted; or (2) repeated instances of unreasonable conduct that indicate
a lack of competence.
49.
As discussed above, Respondent’s failures to conform to applicable professional
standards found in GAAS, in connection with the audits of the year-end 2009, 2010, 2011, and
2012 Fund III financial statements, constitute repeated instances of unreasonable conduct. In
addition, Respondent’s failures to conform to the applicable professional standards found in
11

GAAS, in connection with the Fund’s year-end 2012 financial statements, constitutes an instance
of highly unreasonable conduct under circumstances that warranted heightened scrutiny, which is
required under Rule 102(e)(1)(ii) in instances where significant and unusual transactions take
place, such as taking millions of dollars in advanced fees beyond the life of Fund.
III.
In view of the allegations made by the Division of Enforcement and the Office of the
Chief Accountant, the Commission deems it necessary and appropriate that public administrative
proceedings be instituted to determine:
A.
Whether the allegations set forth in Section II hereof are true and, in connection
therewith, to afford Respondent an opportunity to establish any defenses to such allegations; and
B.
Whether, pursuant to Section 4C of the Exchange Act and Rule 102(e) of the
Commission’s Rules of Practice, Respondent should be censured or denied, temporarily or
permanently, the privilege of appearing or practicing before the Commission as an accountant.
IV.
IT IS ORDERED that a public hearing for the purpose of taking evidence on the
questions set forth in Section III hereof shall be convened at a time and place to be fixed, and
before an Administrative Law Judge to be designated by further order as provided by Rule 110
of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.110.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that Respondent shall file an Answer to the allegations
contained in this Order within twenty (20) days after service of this Order, as provided by
Rule 220 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.220.
If Respondent fails to file the directed answer, or fails to appear at a hearing after being
duly notified, the Respondent may be deemed in default and the proceedings may be determined
against him upon consideration of this Order, the allegations of which may be deemed to be true
as provided by Rules 155(a), 220(f), 221(f), and 310 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice,
17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a), 201.220(f), 201.221(f), and 201.310.
This Order shall be served forthwith upon Respondent as provided for in the
Commission’s Rules of Practice.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED that, pursuant to Rule 360(a)(2)(A) of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice, the Administrative Law Judge shall issue an initial decision no later than 120
days from the occurrence of one of the following events: (A) The completion of post-hearing
briefing in a proceeding where the hearing has been completed; (B) Where the hearing officer
has determined that no hearing is necessary, upon completion of briefing on a motion pursuant to
Rule 250 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.250; or (C) The determination
by the hearing officer that a party is deemed to be in default under Rule 155 of the Commission’s
Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.155 and no hearing is necessary.

In the absence of an appropriate waiver, no officer or employee of the Commission
engaged in the performance of investigative or prosecuting functions in this or any factually
related proceeding will be permitted to participate or advise in the decision of this matter, except
as witness or counsel in proceedings held pursuant to notice. Since this proceeding is not “rule
making” within the meaning of Section 551 of the Administrative Procedure Act, it is not
deemed subject to the provisions of Section 553 delaying the effective date of any final
Commission action.
