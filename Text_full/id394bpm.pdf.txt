INITIAL DECISION
February 26, 2010

APPEARANCES:	

Robert B. Long and Robert C. Hannan for the Division of
Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE: 	

Brenda P. Murray, Chief Administrative Law Judge
BACKGROUND

On January 26, 2010, the Securities and Exchange Commission (Commission) issued an
Order Instituting Proceedings Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities
Act) and Notice of Hearing (OIP) with an attached Statement of Matters of the Division of
Enforcement to be Considered at a Public Hearing Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act
(Statement of Matters). In this material, the Division of Enforcement (Division) alleges that
Tsukuda-America Inc.’s (Tsukuda), registration statement that was declared effective on April
14, 2009, included a false audit report purportedly performed by Weinberg & Company, P.A.,
Certified Public Accountants (Weinberg).1
1

Simultaneous with issuance of the OIP, the Commission filed a complaint in the United States
District Court for the Northern District of Texas, SEC v. Tsukuda-America Inc. and John W.
Petros, No. 3:10-cv-00136-M (Jan. 26, 2010), alleging that Tsukuda’s registration statement
included a forged audit report and consent; falsely identified a stock transfer agent company as
being the transfer agent; included a bogus legal opinion and geologist’s report, and sham
consents from a geologist and an attorney who do not exist; and contained fictitious financial
information. The complaint also alleges that John W. Petros (Petros), Tsukuda’s sole officer and
director, prepared and submitted the false and misleading registration statement; that Petros
prepared and submitted bogus audit and legal opinions and consents from nonexistent lawyers
and accountants; fabricated corporate financial information; and falsely held himself out as an
attorney issuing legal opinions as company counsel in registration and offering statements for

At a public hearing held on February 9, 2010, to determine whether the Division’s
allegations set out in the OIP are true, to afford Tsukuda an opportunity to establish any
defenses, and to determine whether a stop order should issue suspending the effectiveness of
Tsukuda’s registration statement, I admitted into evidence eight exhibits offered by the
Division.2 OIP at 2; Tr. 14. Tsukuda was not represented at the hearing and has not filed an
Answer to the OIP. Tr. 4.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Tsukuda filed Articles of Incorporation in the State of Indiana that became effective on
February 4, 2009. Petros was the single incorporator, and his address and the corporation’s
principal address are the same: 5I9 Interstate 30, #248, Rockwall, Texas 75087. Exhibit 6.
Tsukuda was authorized to transact business in the State of Indiana on January 27, 2010. Exhibit
5.
Tsukuda filed a registration statement on Form S-1 with the Commission on March 27,
2009, and an amendment on Form S-1/A on April 10, 2009, for an initial offering of three
million common stock shares at $0.20 per share for net proceeds of $600,000 (registration
statement). Exhibits 1 at 2, 2 at 5. Tsukuda’s registration statement became effective on April
14, 2009. OIP at 1; Exhibit 3 at Exhibit D. The registration statement represented that Petros
was Tsukuda’s sole officer/director and it shows his office and Tsukuda’s principal office were
located at 5I9 East Interstate 30, # 248, Rockwall, Texas 75087. Exhibits 1 at 1, 4, 14; 2 at 1, 4.
Tsukuda was served with the OIP but did not appear at the hearing of which it had notice.
On January 28, 2010, Petros informed the Division via email that it could serve him with papers
at 5I9 Interstate 30, #248, Rockwall, Texas 75087, and someone would sign and forward the
materials to him, or the Division could email papers to him. Exhibit 3 at Exhibits A, B. The
Division used both means of delivering materials.3 On January 28, 2010, however, the owner of

and Lone Mountain Mining Company. Exhibit 3 at Exhibit D.

CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Section 8(d) of the Securities Act states:
If it appears to the Commission at any time that the registration statement includes
any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading,
the Commission may, after notice by personal service or the sending of confirmed
telegraphic notice, and after opportunity for hearing (at a time fixed by the
Commission) within 15 days after such notice by personal service or the sending
of such telegraphic notice, issue a stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
registration statement.
The Commission has complied with the provisions of Section 8(d) of the Securities Act.
The evidence is overwhelming that the allegations in the OIP are true. Petros filed a registration
statement for Tsukuda that contained untrue statements of material fact and omitted material
facts required to be stated so as to make the statements in the registration statement not
misleading, including the false representation that Weinberg audited and prepared an audit report
upon the financial statements of Tsukuda, and that Weinberg consented to the inclusion of the
audit report in Tsukuda’s registration statement. In addition, Tsukuda is in default because it
failed to answer, to appear through a representative at a hearing of which it had notice, and to
otherwise defend the proceeding.4 See 17 C.F.R §§ 201.155, .220(f), .310.
RECORD CERTIFICATION
Pursuant to Rule 351(b) of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.351(b), I
certify that the record includes the items described in the record index issued by the Secretary of
the Commission on February 24, 2010.
ORDER
Pursuant to Section 8(d) of the Securities Act of 1933, I ORDER that the effectiveness of
the registration statement filed by Tsukuda-America Inc. be, and it hereby is, suspended.
This Initial Decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the provisions
of Rule 360 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that Rule, a
party may file a petition for review of this Initial Decision within twenty-one days after service of
the Initial Decision. A party may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten
days of the Initial Decision, pursuant to Rule 111 of the Commission’s Rules of Practice, 17 C.F.R.
§ 201.111. If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is filed by a party, then that party shall
have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date of the undersigned’s order resolving
such motion to correct manifest error of fact. The Initial Decision will not become final until the

On February 22, 2010, my Office received several documents mailed from John Petros, 5I9
East Interstate 30, #248, Rockwall, Texas 75087, that included the Complaint; Motion for
Summary Judgment and Statement in Support of Summary Judgment; and Motion for Summary

Commission enters an order of finality. The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a
party files a petition for review or motion to correct manifest error of fact or the Commission
determines on its own initiative to review the Initial Decision as to a party. If any of these events
occur, the Initial Decision shall not become final as to that party.
