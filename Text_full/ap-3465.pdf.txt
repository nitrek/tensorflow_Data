File No. 3-16509

In the Matter of
EDWARD M. DASPIN, a/k/a “EDWARD (ED) MICHAEL,”
LUIGI AGOSTINI, and
LAWRENCE R. LUX

ORDER

A hearing in this matter was scheduled to commence in Manhattan on January 4, 2016.
Respondent Edward M. Daspin did not appear at the hearing because he was purportedly
hospitalized for unknown reasons on January 2, 2016. Counsel for the Division of Enforcement,
as well as Respondent Luigi Agostini, did appear. At the start of the hearing, I granted the
Division’s unopposed request that I temporarily adjourn the hearing and schedule a prehearing
conference for January 8, 2016, to allow the Division time to ascertain Daspin’s status and
provide me with an update.
As such, the hearing in this matter is temporarily adjourned. I also ORDER that a
telephonic prehearing conference be held on January 8, 2016, at 10:00 a.m. EST. The parties
should be prepared to resume the hearing on January 11, 2016.
