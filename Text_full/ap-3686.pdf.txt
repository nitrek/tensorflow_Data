ORDER

The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings on January 13, 2016, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 (Exchange Act) and Section 203(e) of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 (Advisers
Act). The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC v. Hansen, No. 1:13-cv-1403
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 21, 2015), appeal filed, No. 16-74 (2d Cir. Jan. 8, 2016), in which Respondent
RAHFCO Management Group, LLC, was enjoined against violations of the antifraud and
registration provisions. A prehearing conference was held today. Polly Atkinson, Esq., appeared
on behalf of the Division of Enforcement (Division), and Randal Hansen, a partner of RAHFCO,
appeared on behalf of RAHFCO.
The undersigned explained that the pendency of the appeal of SEC v. Hansen does not
preclude this proceeding from going forward. See Joseph P. Galluzzi, Exchange Act Release No.
46405, 2002 SEC LEXIS 3423, at *10 n.21 (Aug. 23, 2002) (“the pendency of an appeal does not
preclude [the Commission] from acting to protect the public interest”); Charles Phillip Elliott,
Exchange Act Release No. 31202, 1992 SEC LEXIS 2334, at *11 (Sept. 17, 1992) (declining to
delay follow-on administrative proceeding pending appeal of underlying conviction). If the
injunction is overturned, RAHFCO can request the Commission to vacate any sanctions ordered in
this proceeding (or to dismiss the proceeding, if it is still pending).1
