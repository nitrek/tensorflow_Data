ORDER TO SHOW CAUSE AND
RESCHEDULING PREHEARING
CONFERENCE

On December 30, 2015, the Securities and Exchange Commission issued an order
instituting proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
alleging that Respondents have securities registered with the Commission and are delinquent in
their periodic filings. Respondents Buncombe, Inc., Cotton Bay Holdings, Inc., and Middlesex
Inc., were served with the OIP on December 31, 2015, and their answers were due by January
13, 2016.1 Buncombe, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3486, 2016 SEC LEXIS 83 (ALJ
Jan. 11, 2016). To date, none of those Respondents has filed an answer or otherwise defended
the proceeding.
I therefore ORDER Buncombe, Inc., Cotton Bay Holdings, Inc., and Middlesex Inc., to
SHOW CAUSE by February 1, 2016, why the registrations of their securities should not be
revoked by default due to their failures to file answers or otherwise defend the proceeding. If
these respondents fail to respond to this order, I will deem them in default, determine the
proceeding against them, and revoke the registrations of their securities. See OIP at 3; 17 C.F.R.
§§ 201.155(a), .220(f).
I FURTHER ORDER that, due to the likelihood of inclement weather, the telephonic
prehearing conference scheduled for January 22, 2016, is RESCHEDULED to January 28, 2016,
at 11:00 a.m. EST.
