DEFENDANT
Steven Wise, age 54, is a resident of Woodmere, New York.
FACTS
A.

The Commission's 2005 Order
7.

From 2003 through 2005, Wise was the chief executive officer of an Ohio issuer

that purported to be in the business of selling collectible action figures and play sets over the
Internet and through telemarketing.
8.

An investigation by Commission staff showed that Wise or his nominees

controlled approximately 15 million of the issuer's 26 million common shares outstanding. The
investigation further revealed that in order to increase the demand for the shares and inflate the
share price, Wise and an associate paid kickbacks of shares to at least three registered
representatives corresponding to the number of shares the registered representatives induced
their customers to buy; the kickbacks were not disclosed to the customers.
On September 5, 2003, the Commission instituted administrative and cease-anddesist proceedings against Wise and a co-respondent relating to manipulation of a penny stock.
10.

On January 25, 2005, the Commission accepted Wise's offer ofsettlement and

issued an Order finding that Wise willfully violated Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933
[15 U.S.C. §§ 77q(a)] and Section 10(b) ofthe Exchange Act[15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule lOb5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.1Ob-5]. The 2005 Commission Order required Wise to cease and
desist from committing or causing any further violations ofthose statutes and the rule, barred
him from participating in any offering of a penny stock, prohibited him from acting as an officer

Case 1:16-cv-04104 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 4 of 8

or director of any publicly-traded company, and required him to pay civil penalties. In re Steven
Wise, Exchange Act Rel. No. 51077, 2005 SEC LEXIS 159(Jan. 25, 2005).
11.

In a parallel criminal action based on the same misconduct as in the

Commission's Order, Wise pled guilty to one count of securities fraud and two counts of
conspiracy to commit securities fraud, and was sentenced to fifty-one months incarceration
followed by f7ve years of supervised release, which ended January 6, 2016,a nd was ordered to
pay more than $2 million in restitution. United States ofAmerica vs. Steven Wise, Case No.
1:04-cr-00069 (E.D.N.Y.2004).
B.

Wise's Activities Involving Potential Penny Stock Companies in 2015
12.

In the spring of2015, Wise'approached a hedge fund in New York City that

invested in start-up companies and helped them begin trading publicly. Wise discussed plans
concerning several companies with the hedge fund principals, which,h ad the plans come to
fruition, would have caused each ofthe companies to issue shares that meet the Commission's
definition of a penny stock.
13.

Wise met regularly with principals of the hedge fund during the spring and

summer of2015 to pitch his ideas. Detailed below are three such ideas Wise brought to the
hedge fund, seeking its help in offering shares to the public.
The Ore o~ n Lighting Company
14.

In 2014, a Beaverton, Oregon lighting entrepreneur needed money for prototypes

of a new type of cinematographic light he invented. He raised $500,000 from a group of Long
Island, New York investors that included Wise's sister and Wise's employer. By 2015, Wise
was advising the investor group, and the lighting company needed more money for production.

n

Case 1:16-cv-04104 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 5 of 8

Wise suggested that if the company offered shares to the public it would have sufficient money
to pay its bills and grow.
15.

In the spring of2015, Wise brought the lighting entrepreneur to meet the hedge

fund principals at the fund's New York City office. The hedge fund principals suggested the
lighting company reverse merge into a shell company with which they already were working. A
letter of intent and term sheet were drafted and emails were exchanged among the parties setting
forth the plan. Wise handled certain corporate changes for the lighting company, assisted with
resolving billing disputes with its vendors, and assisted the company in presenting its financials
in a manner suitable for a public company.
16.

As Wise became more involved with the lighting company's finances, the

entrepreneur sought information about him. At no time did Wise reveal to the entrepreneur or
any of his representatives that Wise had been barred by the Commission from participating in
any penny stock offering, or that he had been convicted ofsecurities fraud.
17.

When the lighting entrepreneur discovered Wise's regulatory background in late

summer 2015, he severed all communications with Wise and dropped the plans to reverse merge
into a publicly trading company. He shared his discovery with one ofthe hedge fund principals,
who also ceased all communication with Wise after the summer of2015.
The New York Wristwatch Company
18.

Concurrent with his efforts on behalfofthe Oregon lighting company in the

spring of2015, Wise also sougKt to assist in the public offering ofshares of a Staten Island, New
York wristwatch company.

Case 1:16-cv-04104 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 6 of 8

19.

Wise and the hedge fund principals met with the wristwatch company president

and toured the watch company's plant. The parties discussed registering `the wristwatch
company's shares with the Commission and offering them to the public.
20.

Wise sent the wristwatch company president a term sheet prepared by the hedge

fund, which the company president signed in June 2015. However, the offering never came to
fruition.
The New Jersey Scanning Company
21.

Also in the spring and summer of2015, Wise pitched a third company to the

hedge fund for a public offering and investment. The third company, based in Springfield, New
Jersey, was afamily-run operation that scanned 'business documents.
22.

Wise introduced the president ofthe scanning company to the hedge fund

principals. The hedge fund planned to invest in the scanning company shares after they were
registered with the Commission and offered to the public. A term sheet for the investment was
prepared.
23.

Wise acted as intermediary between the scanning company and the hedge fund,

forwarding questions from the company president to the hedge fund principals, then forwarding
the principals' responses back to the company president. The negotiation, however, ended
without results.

Case 1:16-cv-04104 Document 1 Filed 06/02/16 Page 7 of 8

CLAIM FOR RELIEF
Violations of Section 15(b)(6)(B) of the Exchange Act
24.

The Commission re-alleges and incorporates by reference each and every

allegation contained in paragraphs 1 through 23.
25.

During the spring and summer of2015, Wise was subject to the 2005

Commission Order barring him from "participating in any offering of a penny stock, including:
acting as a promoter, finder, consultant, agent or other person who engages in activities with a
broker, dealer or issuer for purposes ofthe issuance or trading in any penny stock, or inducing or
attempting to induce the purchase or sale of any penny stock."
26.

Without the consent ofthe Commission, and in contravention ofthe 2005

Commission Order, Wise willfully participated in an offering of a penny stock by acting as a
"person who engages in activities with a[n) ... issuer for purposes of ... attempting to induce the
purchase or sale of any penny stock."
27.

The stocks Wise intended to offer would have qualified as penny stocks because

they were equity securities that did not meet any of the exceptions from the definition of penny
stock contained in Section 3(a)(51) ofthe Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78c(a)(51)] and Rule 3a511 thereunder [17 C.F.R. § 240.3a51-1].
28.

By reason ofthe foregoing, Wise, directly or indirectly, violated, and, unless

enjoined,will again violate, Section 15(b)(6)(B)(i) ofthe Exchange Act[15 U.S.C. §
78o(b)(65)(B)(i)].
