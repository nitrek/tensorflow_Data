In the Matter of
STRIPER ENERGY, INC.

ORDER REQUESTING ADDITIONAL
WRITTEN SUBMISSIONS

On May 6, 2016, the Commission issued an order pursuant to Section 12(k) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 suspending trading in the securities of Striper Energy, Inc.
(CPCCD) through May 19, 2016 (the "Trading Suspension Order").1 The Trading Suspension
Order stated: “It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of
current and accurate information concerning the securities of Striper Energy, Inc. due to
questions regarding the accuracy and adequacy of publicly disseminated information in the
company’s December 31, 2015 annual report and accompanying financials provided to OTC
Markets Group, Inc. concerning, among other things, Striper’s operations and financial
obligations.”2 It further stated that the “Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and
the protection of investors require a suspension of trading” in Striper’s securities.3
On May 11, 2016, Striper Energy, Inc. (“Petitioner”) filed a petition for termination of
the trading suspension pursuant to Rule of Practice 550.4 In accordance with Rule of Practice
550(b), the Commission has, in its discretion, determined to request additional written
submissions.5
