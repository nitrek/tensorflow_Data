COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
Plaintiff, Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”), files its
complaint and alleges that:
OVERVIEW
1.

From at least March 2012 through the fall of 2014, Frank E. Lleras

(“Lleras”) and two Charlotte, North Carolina-based companies that he controls,
Optimum Income Property, LLC and Optimum Property Investments, LLC
(collectively, “Optimum”), conducted an offering fraud that targeted investors in
the Dominican Republic and raised more than $2.9 million from at least twentyfive victims.

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 1 of 19

2.

Lleras solicited money from investors by representing, both orally and in a

written agreement with investors, that he would use the funds to purchase
residential homes and condominiums located in Charlotte.
3.

Lleras further represented to investors that he would renovate and resell, or

rent, the properties he purchased for substantial profit and take as his fee a
percentage of the investors’ net profit.
4.

Lleras’s investment contracts were securities and his representations to

investors were false.
5.

Within days of receiving investor funds, Lleras misappropriated large

portions of those funds for his own benefit. Lleras diverted investor funds to
support his personal lifestyle, including paying more than $1.1 million in credit
card charges; making numerous purchases at luxury retailers; and conducting
hundreds of smaller, personal transactions.
6.

Lleras concealed his scheme, and induced additional investments, by giving

investors fake documents, including forged deeds and fictitious property tax
receipts, concerning properties that he falsely told them they owned.
7.

With respect to at least three properties, Lleras provided fake deeds to

investors falsely showing that they owned properties that Optimum itself wholly
owned.
2

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 2 of 19

8.

Lleras also provided investors with fake quarterly account statements that

listed the properties supposedly owned by an investor, as well as income from the
sale or rental of the property, Optimum’s management fees, and unrealized profits.
9.

These fake documents lulled investors into a false sense of security, and

enticed several investors to make additional investments with Lleras.
10.

Beginning in late 2014, after being confronted by a few investors who

questioned their returns, Lleras confessed that he had defrauded investors and
admitted to several investors that he had used funds for impermissible purposes.
VIOLATIONS
11.

Defendants have engaged and, unless restrained and enjoined by this Court,

will continue to engage in acts and practices that constitute and will constitute
violations of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15

(“Exchange Act”) [15 U.S.C. § 78j(b)] and Rule 10b-5 thereunder [17 C.F.R. §
240.10b-5].

THE DEFENDANTS
17.

Optimum Income Property, LLC (“Optimum Income”) is a Florida limited

liability company formed by Lleras in 2013. It currently is listed on the Florida
Department of State Division of Corporations’ website as “Inactive.” Lleras
portrayed Optimum Income as a private real estate investment company that
handled all aspects of real estate investing for investors.
18.

Optimum Property Investments, LLC (“Optimum Property”) is a North

Carolina limited liability company formed by Lleras in 2009. The nature of the
Optimum Property business is described as “real estate investments” in filings with
the North Carolina Secretary of State.
19.

Frank Lleras is the control person of Optimum and signed agreements with

investors on its behalf.

5

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 5 of 19

THE FRAUDULENT SCHEME
20.

From at least March 2012 through the fall of 2014, Lleras raised more than

$2.9 million from at least twenty-five investors in the Dominican Republic.
21.

Lleras solicited investors to give him money by representing to them that he

would use their funds to purchase residential homes and condominiums in
Charlotte, many of which had fallen into foreclosure or otherwise were distressed,
from Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and Bank of America.
22.

Lleras told investors that the opportunity to purchase the properties stemmed

from his contacts with Bank of America.
23.

Lleras further told investors that, after purchasing the properties, he would

either renovate and sell the properties for profit or rent the properties to generate
income for investors.
24.

Lleras outlined to investors a process whereby he would form a limited

liability company (“LLC”) in each investor’s name, and then open an account in
the LLC’s name at Bank of America.
25.

Lleras told investors that after they wired funds into the LLC bank accounts,

he would use the funds to purchase and title properties in the names of the LLCs.
He explained to the investors that the LLC structure was necessary because the

6

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 6 of 19

investors were not U.S. citizens, and that using the LLCs would minimize their tax
burden. The LLCs were formed by Lleras in North Carolina.
26.

At least twenty-five investors ultimately invested more than $2.9 million in

Lleras’s fraudulent scheme.
27.

The investors primarily consisted of physicians residing and practicing in the

Dominican Republic, many of whom were friends or professional acquaintances
with Lleras’s father-in-law.
28.

Each investor entered an Agency Agreement with Optimum. These

agreements provided that they were governed by North Carolina state law and that
any litigation arising out of the agreements was to take place in North Carolina.
29.

Although the agreement was drafted to suggest that the client was selecting a

specific property to purchase from a few presented by Lleras and allowed the client
to discontinue Optimum services, in reality these powers were illusory and the
investors were reliant on Lleras to perform all essential management functions with
regard to the investment.
30.

The information that Lleras gave investors to choose a property was

minimal, typically including a photograph, the purchase price, and Lleras’s
projected return on investment.

7

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 7 of 19

31.

Moreover, the investors were foreign nationals residing outside the United

States, most with limited English language skills and no experience in purchasing,
renting, or reselling real estate in the United States.
32.

The investors relied wholly on Lleras and Optimum’s efforts to identify

appropriate properties, renovate those properties, and then make a profit by
reselling or renting the properties.
33.

Optimum was responsible for all essential functions of the investment,

including the acquisition and maintenance of the properties.
34.

Additionally, investors relied on Lleras to decide whether and when to rent

or sell the properties.
35.

The agreement also detailed Optimum’s compensation and provided that

Optimum was entitled to ten percent of net profit from rent, and, upon sale of the
property, between five and fifteen percent of the resulting net profit along with a
three-percent sales commission.
36.

Defendants’ profits were dependent upon the return on the investments made

by the individual investors.
37.

After the investors wired funds to their LLC accounts, Lleras provided them

with purported property deeds and property tax payment receipts for the properties
that they believed they owned.
8

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 8 of 19

38.

Lleras also provided investors with quarterly account statements, which

listed the properties purportedly owned by the investors, as well as income from
the sale or rental of the properties, Optimum’s management fees, and unrealized
profits.
39.

Contrary to Lleras’s representations, investor funds were not used to buy

investment properties for investors, but instead were used for Lleras’s personal or
unrelated business expenses.
40.

Lleras’s personal use of investor funds was contrary to the written and oral

representations he made that investor funds would be used solely for purchasing,
renovating, and maintaining real estate properties for investors.
41.

Lleras received more than $2.9 million of investor funds. Instead of

purchasing properties, as he represented he would do, he (i) used more than $1.1
million to pay bills from American Express; (ii) made purchases at luxury retailers,
such as Cartier, Louis Vuitton, and Christian Louboutin; and (iii) conducted
hundreds of smaller transactions that clearly were personal in nature (e.g.,
purchases at Bye Bye Baby, PetSmart, Starbucks, and Victoria’s Secret).
42.

Lleras also provided fake documents to investors to cover up the scheme,

assure them that their investments were secure, and induce them to make additional
investments.
9

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 9 of 19

43.

First, Lleras provided investors with deeds for properties that he claimed to

have purchased in their LLCs’ names. Lleras, however, ultimately admitted to
several investors that he had forged the deeds.
44.

At least twelve deeds provided to investors were fabricated. With respect to

at least three properties, Lleras provided fake deeds to investors falsely showing
that they owned properties that Optimum itself wholly owned.
45.

Second, Lleras provided to investors fake receipts purporting to show the

payment of property taxes on the properties. Because the LLCs did not own the
properties, however, no tax payments were owed or made in their names.
46.

Finally, Lleras provided false quarterly account statements to investors. The

statements listed specific properties that composed the investors’ portfolios, as well
as income from the sale or rental of the properties, Optimum’s management fees,
and unrealized profits along with updated and projected returns.
47.

These account statements listed information concerning properties and

resulting income and profits for properties that the investors did not own.
48.

The experiences of two investors in Lleras’s scheme are illustrative. First,

Investor A, a doctor in the Dominican Republic, invested approximately $290,000
with Lleras and Optimum in order to purchase properties in Charlotte.

10

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 10 of 19

49.

Investor A first met Lleras in March 2012 when Lleras traveled to the

Dominican Republic to solicit investors and explain the Optimum investment
opportunity.
50.

Lleras told Investor A that first he would create an LLC in the name of the

investor and open a Bank of America account in the name of the LLC. Lleras then
said he would purchase bank-owned properties in the investor’s LLC name, and
either manage the rental of the property or make repairs to the property and sell it
at a profit.
51.

Lleras guaranteed a thirty-percent profit to the investor for the resale of

property. In return, Lleras would keep as his profits five percent of rental income
and between five and fifteen percent of net profit of any resale.
52.

Based on Lleras’s representations, Investor A entered into an Agency

Agreement with Optimum and, on July 4, 2012, wired approximately $86,000 from
his bank in the Dominican Republic to his newly opened Bank of America account
in the name of a LLC Lleras created on Investor A’s behalf.
53.

Investor A wired the funds to purchase two specific properties identified to

him by Lleras. Subsequently, Lleras provided Investor A with a deed for one of
the properties that listed Investor A’s LLC as the owner of record. This deed was
fabricated.
11

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 11 of 19

54.

Investor A, unaware that the deed was fabricated and comforted by this

purported evidence of his ownership of the property, agreed to invest more money
with Lleras to purchase additional proprieties. In 2013 and 2014, Investor A wired
funds on at least three occasions totaling more than $200,000, so that Lleras could
purchase four additional properties on his behalf.
55.

Despite Lleras’s representations, Investor A never had title to at least two of

these properties.
56.

Investor B, also a doctor in the Dominican Republic, invested approximately

$177,000 with Lleras and Optimum for the purchase of properties in Charlotte.
57.

In approximately 2013, Investor B attended a presentation by Lleras in the

Dominican Republic during which Lleras described the opportunity to invest in
real estate properties in Charlotte through Optimum.
58.

Lleras told Investor B that first he would create an LLC in the name of the

investor and open a Bank of America account in the name of the LLC. Lleras then
said he would purchase bank-owned properties in the investor’s LLC name, and
either manage the rental of the property or make repairs to the property and sell it
at a profit.
59.

Based on Lleras’s representations, Investor B invested approximately

$177,000 with Optimum in three separate transactions. Lleras subsequently
12

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 12 of 19

provided two deeds to Investor B that listed Investor’s B’s LLC as the lawful
owner of the properties. Again, the deeds were fabricated.
60.

In late 2014, several investors became concerned about their investments

with Lleras because expected rental payments and profits from sales of properties
did not appear in their accounts and online portfolios.
61.

Beginning in late 2014, Lleras admitted on several occasions that he

defrauded investors.
62.

For example, Lleras confessed to family members that he had not purchased

properties for investors as he said he would do, had liquidated properties purchased
for investors without their knowledge, and had diverted investor funds for other
business purposes.
63.

Also, on December 2, 2014, Lleras executed an agreement between

Optimum and three of the investors acknowledging his debt to all of the investors.
He confirmed that Optimum owed the investors more than $2.9 million, and
promised to provide them with a promissory note in that amount with a maturity
date of February 27, 2015, as well as a personal guarantee from him and his wife
with respect to the note. Lleras also agreed to assign deeds and other interests to
the investors to secure the note.

13

Case 3:16-cv-00073-GCM Document 1 Filed 02/10/16 Page 13 of 19

64.

Additionally, when confronted by investors, Lleras confessed that he took

their funds to pay for other business liabilities.
