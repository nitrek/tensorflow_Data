FOREWORD
This is the seventeenth annual report to the Congress of the Securities and Exchange Commission, summarizing the work of the Commission during the fiscal year July 1, 1950, to June 30, 1951.
The year has been an extremely active one for the Commission. The
raising of new capital by industry, particularly for use in connection
with the defense effort, has continued at a high rate. In all, approximately $6,400,000,000 of securities were registered during the year.
The processing of registration statements and other documents filed
by various companies in connection with their financing programs
constitutes a major work load of the Commission. This large amount
of work, the volume and timing of which is entirely beyond the control
of the Commission, requires thorough and prompt attention for the
protection of investors and the accommodation of the issuing companies in their efforts toward successful financing.
In addition, the Commission, under the statutes which it administers, is charged with many other important duties, such as the surveillance of the securities markets, the regulation of the activities of
brokers and dealers, and the direction and supervision of the integration and simplification of public utility holding company systems.
The report dISCUSSes
these and the other activities of the Commission. In connection with the discussion of the Commission's activities
under the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the report
contains a cumulative tabulation of all companies and properties divested by registered public utility holding company systems since
December 1, 1935,the effective date of that Act.
The Commission has endeavored to maintain a high standard of
accomplishment in connection with its major work notwithstanding
successive drastic reductions in its staff in recent years made necessary
by budget limitations. T~number of employees of the Co~ission.
today is about one-half of the number employed III 1941. Since the
end QftIle fiscal year the over-all staff was reduced by 12' percep.t, from
1027 to 904, up to December 31, 1951, and because of the unavailability
of funds a further decrease to about 875 is likely by July 1, 1952. Despite the streamlining of procedures and the deferment and elTmination of various routine activities, the reduction in staff has reached a
point of being a serious threat to the Commission's ability to carry
out its essential duties under the statutes which it has the responsibility of administering and to cooperate promptly and fully in the
financing of the defense effort.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of 1933 is designed to provide investors with
the protection of full and fair disclosure, by means of registration
statements and prospectuses, of pertinent information regarding securities publicly offered for sale through the mails or other instrumentalities of interstate commerce, and to prevent misrepresentation,
deceit, and other fraudulent practices in the sale of securities. The
Act requires in general that every security which is to be offered for
sale by the use of the mails or other instrumentalities of interstate
commerce must first be registered with this Commission unless it is
entitled to one of the exemptions from registration provided in the
statute. Securities so exempted consist, in general, of United States
government and municipal securities and issues of banks, railroads,
cooperatives and other organizations and associations specified in
section 3 (a) of the Act or covered by exemptions in rules and regulations adopted by the Commission, as discussed elsewhere in this
report, pursuant to section 3 (b) thereof. The registration provisions also do not apply to certain transactions specifically exempted by
section 4 of the Act. However the anti-fraud provisions of both Acts
apply to exempted securities and transactions. The fact that a registration statement has been filed under the Act, or that it has been
examined by the Commission's staff, or that it is in effect, does not
imply any approval or disapproval by the Commission of the merits
of the security as an investment, and the statute makes any representation to the contrary a criminal offense. While registration, therefore,
does not insulate Investors against risk, the requirement that registrants must furnish investors at or before a sale with a full disclosure
of material facts essential to the formation of an intelligent investment
judgment makes available to them information with which to gage
the risk.
THE REGISTRATION PROCESS
The Registration Statement and Prospectus

Any security may be registered with the Commission by filing a
registration statement under the terms and conditions specified in the
Act, and it is one of the Commission's most important functions to
examine these statements for their compliance with the statutory requirements. An integral part of each statement is the prospectus,
consisting of pertinent information from the registration statement
proper. Unless a registration statement is in effect as to a security, the
Act makes it unlawful to sell or offer to buy the security through the
mails or in interstate commerce, and it is also made unlawful to sell
or deliver any security unless accompanied or preceded by a prospectus
meeting the requirements of the Act.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

While as a practical matter it is the prospectus that brings all the
pertinent information contained in the registration statement directly
to the attention of the investor, it should be pointed out that the event
of filing any registration statement, which IS immediately made public by the Commission pursuant to the statute, gives rise to widespread
publicity released by financial news services, financial writers, and
newspapers generally, covering various items of information selected
by them from the registration statement.
Effective Date of Registration Statement

In order to permit the information contained in a registration statement to become known to the investing public, the Act provides a
20-day waiting period after the filing of the registration statement
before the registration statement becomes effective and the security
may be offered for sale. If the registration statement is amended
after it is filed but before it has become effective, the 20-day waiting
period starts anew from the time of the amendment, unless the amendment is filed with the consent of or by order of the Commission. The
Commission is empowered at its discretion to accelerate the effective
date of a registration statement, in cases where the facts justify such
acceleration, so that a full 20-day period need not expire before the
securities may be offered for sale. The Act directs that, in the exercise of this power, the Commission must give due regard to the adequacy of the information about the security already available to the
public, to the complexity of the particular financing, and to the public
interest and the protection of investors.
Examination

Procedure

The Commission's work of examining registration statements and
prospectuses filed in connection with public offerings of securities
under the Securities Act of 1933 is conducted by the examining sections of the Division of Corporation Finance.
If a registration statement presents problems of an oil and gas, mining, or engineering
nature, appropriate technical experts on the staff cooperate with the
examiner, accountant and attorney of the examining section in processing that document. Not infrequently the staff may have occasion
to consult with other departments or agencies of the Government in
completing the examination of a particular filing.
In order to simplify the preparation of registration statements
calculated to meet the requirements of the statute and the rules, the
Commission has continued to make available to the registrant the
assistance of alrefiling
conference with its staff of expert analysts,
accountants an lawyers. The prefiling conference is employed most
usually to advise the prospective registrant concerning appropriate
methods of simplifying any material required to be filed in a registration statement or other document, or to help solve any other problemwhether legal, statistical, or accounting-anticipated
in connection
therewith.
A large number of these prefiling conferences deal mainly
with methods of simplifying the presentation of required financial
data. Failure to take advantage of the latitude permitted by the
Commission's rules to omit duplicate material or to substitute comparable material in more compact form may result in a confusing mass
of financial statements particularly when dealing with complicated
cases such as those involving mergers, reorganizations and the acquisi-

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

3

tion of other companies and businesses. In such situations the prefiling conference may result in avoiding the delay, inconvenience and
expense that would otherwise be caused by the need of furnishing
substantial revisions or amendments of material after the original
filing. Thus in one recent case the number of pages of financial statements proposed to be included in a prospectus of a company operating
a chain of hotels was reduced by half mainly by adopting a suggestion
of eliminating unnecessary financial statements and repetitious financial footnotes. In another case, involving a new company formed to
take over the businesses of several other companies, the number of
pages of financial statements included in the prospectus was reduced
to less than half the number originally proposed by adopting a suggestion to arrange several similar financial statements on the same
page in columnar form and eliminate certain duplicate financial
footnotes.
Where examination discloses any omission or incomplete statement
of material fact or inaccuracy in the registration statement, the staff
relies for enforcement mainly upon another informal procedure, that
of sending the registrant a "letter of comment," which points out the
inadequacies found upon examination. Such letter is sent as soon
as possible after the statement is filed and affords an opportunity for
the filing of a correcting amendment before the indicated effective
date of registration. This device avoids the necessity for the Commission to exercise its little-used authority under section 8 of the Act
to institute formal proceedings against the registration statement.
While the statute does not specifically authorize such a procedure,
perhaps no other device adopted in connection with the registration
process has equal capacity to accomplish a common-sense administration of the Act in a manner calculated to afford fair treatment to
registrants and cause a minimum of interference with financing plans.
Time Required for Registration

While the Commission makes every effort to complete the registration process within the statutory 20-day waiting period, accomplishment of this objective is often impeded by a number of variable factors
largely beyond its control. For example, experience has shown that
the time required by the staff to complete examination of the registration statement and send out the letter of comment regarding indicated
deficiencies to the registrant cannot generally be reduced in the average
case below a recently achieved low of 10 calendar days. In the 1949
fiscal year the actual time required for this step averaged such 10 days
in each month of the year. However, in the 1950 fiscal year, while for
two of the early months of the period this average was bettered with
a showing of 9 days each, in two of the later months the average rose
to 11 days and in the closing month reached 12 days. During the 1951
fiscal year, as may be seen from the table below, this average rose to
11 days in four separate months of the year. Another important
variable factor in the time required to complete the registration
process is the time elapsing between the date of the letter of comment
and the date the registrant's correcting amendment is filed, which of
course is wholly beyond the control of the Commission. Then follows
the necessarily variable factor of time required by the staff to examine
such amendment in the same manner as the original filing. The

average time required in each month of the 1951 fiscal year for each
of these principal stages as well as for all steps combined in the registration process is shown in the accompanying table. The total elapsed
time, which was as high for the average case as 30112 days for the whole
of the year 1947, and which had dropped to an all-time low of 21YJ.2
days for 1950, showed the same low figure of 21YJ.2days for 1951.

REGISTERED

The amount of securities effectively registered during the 1951
fiscal year was $6,459,333,000, making the sixth consecutive period
of registrations in excess of $5,000,000,000 each and averaging over
$6,200,000,000 per fiscal year. This average is more than three times
the approximate annual average of $2,000,000,000 for the previous
six fiscal years. More than three-quarters of the effective registrations
are for cash sale for account of issuers, and the comparatively high
current registration rate is equally apparent in this principal item and
its components.

ANNUAL REPORT

Number of Statements

The amount registered in the 1951 fiscal year was distributed over
487 statements covering 702 issues, compared with the same number
(487) of statements covering 647 issues during the previous fiscal
year. The number differs slightly from that shown under "Registration Statements Filed" on a subsequent page, as explained in footnote
2 of appendix table 1.
Type of Registration

About 80 percent of the amount registered in the 1951 fiscal year
was for cash sale for account of issuers, 2.3 percent was for cash sale
for account of others than issuers, and 17.7 percent was for other than
cash sale as itemized in part 3 of appendix table 1. Comparative
figures are as follows:

From similar tables in recent annual reports, it can be ascertained
that of approximately $29.1 billion effective registrations for cash
sale for account of issuers during the past six fiscal years, $10.0
billion were electric, gas, and water, $5.85 billion were transportation and communication, $5.75 billion were manufacturing, $5.47
billion were financial and investment, $1.13 billion were foreign
government, and all others were less than $1.0 billion. "Transportation" does not include issues subject to Interstate Commerce Commission filings and therefore exempt from registration.
Recent trends have been for electric, gas and water issues to head
the list, for financial and investment issues to rise into second place,
and for manufacturing issues to drop from first place in 1946 and
1947 to third place in 1951 fiscal year. Foreign government registrations for 1951 are unusually large by reason of inclusion of the $500,000,000 State of Israel bonds.

percent (including $0.84 billion open-end investment company issues)
were to be sold on a "best-efforts" basis. The term "best-efforts" as
used here means all offerings through investment bankers other than
those pursuant to agreements to purchase for resale. The remaining
17 percent were to be sold direct by issuers to investors. Comparative

ANNUAL REPORT

Early in 1951, the Commission published a report entitled "Cost
of Flotation, 1945-49" covering all secuirties effectively registered
under the Securities Act of 1933during those five calendar years. The
total was nearly $30 billion and represented nearly 3,500 issues. The
primary purpose was to present basic factual data on a matter of public
interest which had been regarded as a trade secret prior to 1933, and
to provide more complete coverage and detail on cost of flotation than
can as yet be found elsewhere. The cost of flotation of the approximately $30 billion securities aggregated a figure equal to $2.64 for
every $100 of' gross proceeds, including $2.12 commissions and disconnts to investment bankers and $0.52 other expenses. New issues of
securities for cash sale through investment bankers to the general
public, not including issues of investment companies, came to about
half of the $30 billion, and produced the following aggregate costs
in percent of gross proceeds:

Securities of investment companies amounted to about 11 percent
of the total dollar amount of securities effectively registered for cash
sale during the five-year period 1945-49. About 70 percent of this
amount was of open-end companies, 4 percent of closed-end companies, and 26 percent of fixed trusts, face-amount certificates and
investment plans. The cost of marketing securities of open-end companies is called the "sales load" and averaged 7.88 percent of the
gross proceeds of 246 flotations over the five years.

commencing with the first quarter of 1950, presents data on the cash
cost of marketing individual issues of securities registered during
each period, including details of offering, underwriting compensation, other expenses of flotation divided into (1) cost of professional
services, (2) taxes and fees, and (3) printing and other expenses, and
supplementary data reported by registrants on the outcome of issues

Use of Net Proceeds of Corporate Securities

Proceeds from corporate securities flotations for cash sale for account of issuers, both registered and unregistered, were mainly to
be used for expansion of fixed and working capital, approximately
$5,263,000,000 being raised for these purposes. This amount was considerably higher than the $3,843,000,000 for new money purposes during the 1950 fiscal year, but was approximately $500,000,000 less than
in the 1949 and 1948 fiscal years. Electric and gas companies accounted for 34 percent of the new money financing, manufacturing
for 32 percent, communication for 10 percent, real estate and financial
for 9 percent, railroad and other transportation
for 8 percent, and
commercial and miscellaneous companies for 7 percent. Corporate
securities offered for cash sale for retirement of outstanding securities and bank debt totaled only $1,204,000,000 as compared with
$1,651,000,000 in the 1950 fiscal year.
Appendix tables 3, 4, and 5 give a detailed statistical breakdown
of all securities offered for cash sale in the United States for account
of issuers.

EXEMPTION

FROM REGISTRATION

UNDER THE ACT

The Commission is authorized by section 3 (b) of the Act to adopt
rules and regulations granting exemptions from the registration
requirements for security offerings not exceeding $300,000 in aggregate offering price to the public. The most important of the regulations adopted under this section are Regulation A, which provides a
general exemption for small issues up to the statutory maximum permissible amount of $300,000, and Regulation B, which affords an
exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights and
is limited to a maximum aggregate offering price of $100,000.1
These regulations granting exemption from registration pursuant
to section 3 (b) carry no exemption from the civil liabilities for misstatements or omissions imposed by section 12 or from the criminal
liabilities for fraud imposed by section 17. They simply permit the
making of a small offering on the basis of less complete disclosure
than in the case of a registered security and require the filing of certain
minimum information with the nearest regional officeof the Commission a certain number of days before the offering may be made," If
any sales literature is to be used, it must be filed in advance of its use.
Exempt Offerings Under Regulation A

After three successive years had shown a slight decrease in the
amount of small financing undertaken pursuant to Regulation A, the
1951 fiscal year shows a slight increase therein and reflects at least
a halt to any such previous trend.

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL

11

REPORT

Included in the 1951 fiscal year totals are 141 letters of notification
covering stock offerings filed by companies engaged in some phase of
the oil and gas business.
In addition to the total of 1,358 letters of notification, there were
received and examined during the past fiscal year 1,212 amendments
to these letters of notification and also 1,741 filings of sales literature
to be used in connection with such offerings.
Information available as to 1,351 of these offerings in the 1951
fiscal year shows that 751 covered proposed offerings of $100,000 or
less; 251 more than $100,000 and less thjm $200,000; and 349 more
than $200,000 but not more than $300,000. Issuing companies made
1,122of these offerings; stockholders 215 ; and issuers and stockholders
jointly, the remaining 14. Less than half, or 588 of them, were underwritten, 452 by commercial underwriters and 136 by officers and
directors and other persons not regularly engaged in the underwriting
business.
Regulation A provides a means whereby small businessmen may
seek from public investors the relatively small amounts of venture
capital which they ordinarily require; and it may be of interest to
note, from the filings made ill the 1951 fiscal year as distributed by
regional offices,how this regulation is used by issuers located in every
part of the nation.

Exempt Offerings Under Regulation B

The exemption from registration provided by Regulation B for
fractional undivided interests in oil or gas rights is limited, as previously indicated, to a maximum offering price of $100,000. A person
intending to sell securities under this regulation must file with the
nearest regional officeof the Commission an offering sheet which calls
for a brief summary of pertinent information regarding the security
being offered.
During the 1951fiscal year, the Commission received and examined
96 offering sheets together with 76 amendments to such offering sheets.
These filings are in addition to the 141 offerings under Regulation A

Of the 76 amendments received during the year, approximately 44
were filed as a result of informal letters of comment sent by the staff
rather than of formal suspension orders. The Commission maintains
a specialized oil and gas unit in the Division of Corporation Finance
at its headquarters to administer Regulation B and to advise and
assist with technical phases of all offerings of oil and gas securities
arising under various provisions of the Securities Act and other
statutes administered by the Commission. For example, during the
year this unit participated in the examination of 78 registration statements, and 57 amendments thereto, filed under the Securities Act,
and reviewed 47 broker-dealer inspection reports made pursuant to
the Securities Exchange Act, which involved securities of oil producing, natural gas, or refining companies. Petroleum geologists conduct field investigations of tracts and wells and furnish advisory
reports thereon in connection with investigations made by the Commission and its regional offices. Development activity in the Rocky
Mountains which was noted in the 1950fiscal year has been extremely
marked during the 1951 fiscal year.
onfidentUil written reports of sales under RegUlation B.-The
Commission received and examined under rules 320 (a) and 320 (c)
and (d) during the 1951 fiscal year 1,922 confidential written reports
on Forms 1-G and 2-G relating to actual sales made pursuant to
Regulation B in the aggregate amount of $1,127,226. This total may
be compared with $829,875during the preceding year. These reports
are of assistance to the Commission in determining whether violations
of law occur in sales of oil and gas securities exempted from
registration.
â€¢
Oil and gas investigati0118.-The
Commission conducts a considerable number of oil and gas investigations, arising largely out of complaints received from the public, to determine whether there has been
any violation of any other provision of law in the sale of securities
exempted under Regulation B, with particular attention to the registration requirements of section 5 and the fraud prohibitions contained in section 17 of the Securities Act. Not infrequently in such
an investigation it may be necessary to conduct extensive field trips
in the ascertainment of certain material facts. Depending upon the
circumstances of the particular case, 'a field trip may Involve an
inspection of well locations, a study of the productive history or oil
possibilities of the areas under consideration, interviewing and taking

a

8EVENTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

13

depositions of persons who worked on the wells, getting affidavits
from the purchasers of oil where there has been actual production,
obtaining authenticated statements by State officials of well logs, plugging records, tax records and production records that have been filed
pursuant to the statutes of the States in which the operations took
place, the preparation of maps and similar activities.
Often investigation is directed to highly objectionable sales literature which greatly overemphasizes the possibilities of success from
the proposed security purchase. So it was in the case of Oil Prospectors, Inc. and Ralph Malone, which offerors had made a number of
filings under Regulation A, and in virtually all instances used such
literature.
In this situation the Commission made a field examination
of a lease and well in Texas and filed a complaint in the United States
District Court, Northern District of Texas, against the offerors, charging violation of the anti-fraud provisions of section 17 (a) in the
sale of capital stock of Oil Prospectors, Inc. A temporary restraining order was issued immediately after the close of the fiscal year, on
July 2,1951, and a hearing was expected on the Commission's motion
for a permanent injunction shortly thereafter.
As suggested above, a substantial number of these oil and gas investigations grow out of violations of the registration requirements of
section 5. In one such case, J. Stacey Henderson, and others, sold
fractional working interests in test wells located in Caddo Parish,
Louisiana, without making any attempt to comply with the registration provisions of section 5. A Commission engineer visited the immediate location of the test wells and Shreveport where he gathered
necessary geological and production data. At the separate trial of
Henderson which ensued, where the Commission engineer gave expert
testimony as to the geological conditions and productive possibilities
of the area, Henderson was found guilty on one count of an indictment charging violation of the Mail Fraud Statute in connection with
the sale of fractional undivided interests in oil and gas rights and was
sentenced to serve five years in prison and to pay a fine of $1,000
and costs.
An additional case illustrates the fact that often an oil and gas
investigation is of important assistance to other regulatory work of
the Commission. As discussed elsewhere in this annual report, the
Commission issued during the 1951 fiscal year a stop' order under section 8 (d) against the grossly inaccurate, misleadi~ and incomplete
registration statement of Ralph A. Blanchard and George P. Simons
doing business as Northwest Petroleum.
Eight days after the filing
of that registration statement the Commission obtained an injunction
from the United States District Court for the District of Oregon
against these registrants from selling the shares or interests they proposed offering the public until such time as a registration statement
with respect thereto became effective. Contributing largely to the
facts upon which this injunction was granted was a technical report
resulting from an investigation made by the oil and gas staff, especially
regarding the productive capacity and other technical characteristics
of the oil wells involved in the offering.
FORMAL ACTION UNDER SECTION 8

In almost all instances the Commission's informal examination
procedures, such as the prefiling conference and the letter of comment,

14

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

are sufficient to insure that the registration statement meets the standards of fair disclosure prescribed by the statute. However, there are
infrequent instances when it becomes necessary to exercise its powers
under section 8 in order to prevent a registration statement from
becoming effective in deficient, misleading or inaccurate form or to
suspend the effectiveness of one which has already become effective.
Under section 8 (b) the Commission may institute proceedings to
determine whether it should issue an order to prevent a registration
statement from becoming effective. Such proceedings are authorized
if the registration statement as filed is on its face inaccurate or incomplete in any material respect. Under section 8 (d) proceedings may
be instituted at any time to determine whether the Commission should
issue a stop order to suspend the effectiveness of a registration statement if it appears to the Commission that the registration statement
includes any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state any
material fact required to be stated or otherwise necessary to make the
statements included not misleading. Under section 8 (e) the Commission may make an examination to determine whether to issue a stop
order under section 8 (d).
Stop-order Proceedings Under Section 8 (d)

One stop order was issued during the year and another stop-order
proceeding was instituted just before the close of the year (where the
hearing was scheduled after such close) pursuant to section 8 (d).
The former case is described below.
Ralph A. Blanchard. and George P. Simons-doing
business as
Northwest Petroleum-File No. 2-8243.-This case was completed
during the 1951 fiscal year although instituted previously.
Prior to the filing of the registration statement about $300,000 had
been raised by sales of shares to public investors, of which about
$30,000 was retained by the promoters and about $270,000 was turned
over to Mon-O-Co Oil Corporation for drilling operations. With the
exception of one well, which had a rated capacity of 20 barrels per day,
the wells which were drilled were completely unproductive.
In the registration statement as origmally filed it was represented
that 350 shares were being offered; as amended during the course of
the proceedings, the registration statement recited that 447 shares, of
which 330 were "company shares" and 117 shares were "personal
shares," were being offered at $500 a share, or an aggregate of $223,500.
However, the amendment did not specify the order in which company
shares or personal shares would be sold. The Commission, in its disposition of this case, found that the failure of the registrants to include a definite undertaking with respect to the order in which the
company and personal shares were to be sold, in order adequately to
inform prospective purchasers of the order in which proceeds of a
sale of less than all of the shares were to be applied, rendered the
registration statement as amended materially misleading.
The Commission also found that, in view of the extensive experience
of Mon-O-Co and the promoters in attempting to exploit the tracts in
question, the registrants knew that in all probability further drilling
operations would not result in a return sufficient to warrant the investment of funds by the public on the basis contemplated by registrants,
and that the failure of the registrants to make the disclosures neces-

SEVENTEENTH ~~UAL

REPORT

15

sary to a full understanding by prosJ?ective shareholders of the actual
prospects of return rendered the registration statement misleading.
The Commission concluded that the registration statement was
grossly inaccurate, misleading and incomplete, and issued a stop order
suspending its effectiveness. At the close of the 1951 fiscal year the
registrants had not attempted to correct the deficiencies found in the
registration statement and the stop order was still in effect.
DISCLOSURES RESULTING FROM EXAMINATION OF REGISTRATION
STATEMENTS

The result of the Commission's work in the examination of registration statements may be illustrated by the cases described below.
Misleading security description revised-Dividend
rights and earnings prospects clarified-Position of promoters and new investors contrasted.-A company operating a life, health and accident insurance
business filed its first registration statement under the Securities Act
of 1933 purporting to cover an issue of "Special Stock Debentures" to
be offered in units of $500 each. It appeared to the staff upon examination of the statement that these securities were not debentures at
all, as the term is commonly understood, but were essentially contracts
for the purchase of capital stock. Thus, the purchaser of the "debenture" agreed to pay $500 (all at one time or in installments) and the
company agreed in consideration thereof to deliver at the end of five
years 25 shares of common capital stock. In each of these five years
the purchaser was entitled to receive the equivalent of such dividends
as would be paid on 25 shares of .,took were such shares already
issued; and he was entitled to an additional distribution based upon
a percentage of the amount of life insurance renewal premiums paid
to the company by its policy holders in each such year. The company referred to this latter distribution as a "bonus." Apart from
making use of such misleading nomenclature as "debentures" and
"bonus," the prospectus as originally filed was so prepared as to make
it virtually impossible for even a skilled analyst to form a reasonable
judgment of the investment merits of the securities.
In the ensuing examination process the prospectus and the security
instrument itself were amended to substitute the term "Special Investment Contract" for "Special Stock Debenture"; and the term "bonus,"
which ordinarily means something given beyond what is strictly due,
and which did not appear to be applicable to any feature of these
securities, was dropped.
To provide investors with some indication of what the purchaser's
right to dividend equivalents might be worth, the amended prospectus also pointed out that earnings per share during the past four years
had amounted to 30 cents, 62 cents, 12 cents, and 13 cents, respectively,
and, to provide them with an indication of what the right to distributions based on the life insurance renewal premium business done by
the company might be worth, it was furthermore pointed out in the
amended prospectus that, if the amount of such business done in 1950
were applied, total distributions over the five-year period would
amount to some $28.14. It thus becomes apparent that, notwithstanding the specification in the investment contract that $25 of the $500
purchase price was to be attributed to the 25 shares of stock which the

16

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

contract called for, and the remaining $475 was to be attributed to
the rights to dividend equivalents and distributions based on life insurance renewal business, the cost of the stock should properly be regarded as very much greater than $25 ($1 per share). In this connection the amended prospectus states: "It should be noted, therefore,
that very substantial increases in earnings will be necessary if purchasers of the investment contracts are to enjoy a satisfactory return
on the stock they will receive at the price they are paying."
The amended prospectus also introduces an explanation that, assuming eventual issuance of all of the stock called for by the investment contracts in accordance with the terms of the contracts, the original incorporators will hold some 72 percent of the outstanding stock
for which they paid approximately $37,500, in contrast to the position
of incoming investors who will receive only an 18 percent interest in
the company in exchange for a total contribution of $1,200,000.
In addition, the amended prospectus discloses that one of the company's two largest stockholders has repeatedly borrowed substantial
sums from the company and that a presently outstanding loan (originally $600,000 but at the date of the prospectus reduced to $378,000)
admittedly was under-collateralized by about 50 percent. This stockholder, the amended prospectus further discloses, profited to the extent of some $59,000, on a $500 investment, in the sale of property to
the company, and to the extent of some $15,000 in connection with
the purchase by the company of the business of another insurance
company.
Besides, this registrant was called upon to file very substantial
amendments to the financial statements included in the registration
statement proper which were deemed by the staff to be necessary in
order to meet the standards of disclosure imposed by the Act. The
more significant of the deficiencies in these financial statements as
originally filed involved the inclusion in income of (1) proceeds from
the sale of the securities, (2) amounts received as contributed surplus,
(3) borrowed money received and repaid, and (4) payments and adjustments for retirement of outstanding bonds. Following discussions with the staff, the company filed financial statements which
were appropriately amended to reflect generally accepted accounting
principles, resulting in a reduction of 1950 reported net income from
$124,000 to $33,000 (approximately), and a reduction of earned surplus as of December 31, 1950, from $231,000 to $102,000 (approximately).
Events after date of j1Jna:nci{ll
statements reaognized.-When a
utility c0!Upanyfiled its registration statement for an offer of common
stock in March 1951, the 1949 and 1950 income statements included
approximately $125,000 and $415,000 ($75,000 and $228,000 after
taxes), respectively, and the balance sheet included a deferred credit
for contingent revenues of approximately $412,000 (equivalent to
$227,000 after taxes) for revenues billed by the registrant pursuant
to a rate increase granted by the local regulatory commission. At the
time of filing the statement the United States Court of Appeals had
affirmed the action of the United States District Court in vacating
the regulatory commission's order and had ordered amounts collected
after a certain date impounded. The court had ordered that the registrant refund to its customers all monies collected under the increased

SEVENTEENTH ~AL

REPORT

17

rates but had granted a stay of its judgment pending appeal to the
Supreme Court.
The above situation was fully disclosed in the financial statements
and matters requiring amendment had been corrected to put the statement in final form. However, at about the time the registration statement was to become effective the Supreme Court of the United States
refused to review the appellate court's findings that the order of the
local regulatory commission be vacated. The registrant and its accountants then proposed to expand the footnote describing the litigation to explain the effect of the Supreme Court's action but without
eliminating from the income statements the revenues then to be refunded or correcting the balance sheet to show the liability for the
ordered refund. However, the registrant was requested by the staff
to adjust the income statements and balance sheet in respect of the
refundable amounts, since, under the circumstances, no accounting
justification then existed for including in the income statements
amounts which clearly were not proper revenue items and for failing
to show the proper current liabilities.
The statements were amended to remove the amounts in question
from the income statements and to show them in the balance sheet,
together with the $412,000 originally shown as a deferred credit, as a
current liability ($614,000) after deducting impounded funds of
$336,000. The effect of the change on earnings and earned surplus
was as follows:

Earnings restated to refleot taxes and loss carry-over.-A
registrant's prospectus as originally filed included a summary of earnings
showing a net loss of $142,000 for the first fiscal year of its operations
(certified by independent public accountants) and net profits of $110,000 and $216,000 for the succeeding two months (unaudited).
No
franchise, income and excess profits taxes had been deducted and the
registrant was therefore asked to make appropriate provision for such
taxes. The summary, as then amended, showed the net loss of $142,000
for the company's first full year, and set forth net profit for the succeeding three months combined of $168,000, after deducting a provision of $218,000 for franchise, income and excess profits taxes. However, the staff discovered that, in computing the income and excess
profits taxes for the three-month period, the company had deducted
the full amount, rather than one-quarter of the amount, of allowable
net operating loss carry-over from the first fiscal year. Pursuant to
the request of the staff, the summary was again revised, on the presumption of continuing profitable operations which the registrant
did not disclaim, to show the taxes for the first quarter of the second
. year computed on the basis of deducting only one-quarter of the first
year's allowable net operating loss carry-over. As finally revised, the
summary showed net profit (after taxes) of $116,000for the quartercompared with the profit figure of $168,OQOfor the same period as
shown in the first revision and that of $326,000 for two months only
of such period as set forth in the original filing.
Restatement of balance sheet to eliminate unearned rents and roy-

18

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

allies as a8setB.-In the course of an examination of an amendment
to an effective registration statement of a machine manufacturer
it was noted that the proportion of rental income to sales of products had increased materially and that the items of "Trade Receivables with Extended Maturities" and "Deferred Rental Income" had
become major elements in the balance sheet. In response to a request
that the method of accounting be explained, a representative of the
company disclosed to the Commission that the former account represented payments not due within the ensuing year on notes and contracts receivable covering rentals of leased machines and that the
leases normally called for payment of rentals over a period of fortyeight months. Further explanation revealed that it was the practice
of the company to record the full amount of rent receivable upon execution of the leases and to credit an equal amount to deferred income
from which transfers were made to profit and loss on a straight-line
basis over the useful life of the machines, then estimated at five years.
Since this method of accounting appeared to be unique among companies doing business on a similar basis, the staff requested that the
financial statements be amended to eliminate from the accounts the
rents and royalties not earned at the balance sheet date except to the
extent that collections had been made in advance of the due dates.
Further discussions with representatives of the registrant and its
independent accountants brought concurrence with the staff's views
and resulted in an amendment the significance of which may be seen
from the following figures. "Rentals and Royalties Receivable under
Machinery Lease Agreements" listed under current assets were reduced from $3,500,000 to $800,000 and "Trade Receivables with
Extended Maturities" were reduced from $4,730,000 to $24,000,
accounting for a total of $7,400,000 applied as a contra reduction of
"Deferred Rental Income" from $9,100,000to $1,700,000. The above
adjustments reduced total current assets from $17,300,000to $14,600,000, with a resulting reduction in the current ratio from 1.61-to-1 to
1.34-to-1, and reduced the balance sheet totals from $40,900,000 to
$33,500,000. Since the statements on the former basis had been published, the change in presentation was referred to in the "Accountants'
Report" and explained in the following "Supplemental Note" added
to the financial statements by way of amendment to the registration
statement:
Since the closing of the accounts for the fiscal year ended November 30, 1950,
and the issuance of the annual report to stockholders, the company has revised
its procedure with respect to accounting for rentals on leased machines. Here.
tofore, the full amount of such rentals was recorded as receivable at the time
of execution of the leases, with a corresponding credit to deferred income which
was transferred to profit and loss over a period of five years, the estimated life
of the machines.
Under the revised procedure, rentals are recorded only as
they become due for payment and are credited initially to deferred income, thereafter being transferred to profit and loss as earned over the life of the machines.
This change in policy has been given effect in the accompanying balance sheet
with the result that $7,385,000 has been eliminated from asset classifications and
from deferred income; the balance of deferred income as stated under the
revised procedure represents that portion of rentals received or now due, not
yet transferred to profit and loss. Of the aggregate amount of unrecorded
rentals yet to be received under the terms of existing machine lease agreements
$7,385,000, approximately $2,600,000 is scheduled for payment within the ensuingyear.

REPORT

Failure to disolose history of the enterprise, its principal promoter,
and the denial of a patent applioation under iohich. an allegedl'!{ valuable license was granted registrant.-An
Ohio company organized in
the latter part of 1949 filed a registration statement in .Tune 1950 covering a proposed public offering of 30,000 shares of its Class A stock
at $100 per share. The registrant indicated that it was formed for
the purpose of manufacturing, selling, leasing, and operating apparatus to be used particularly in connection with steel refining and in
production of steel ingots for mills in the district in which Its plant
might be established. An exhibit in the registration statement set
forth that for each Class A share sold to the public, a share of Class B
stock would be given to another Ohio corporation in consideration of
the latter's grant to the former of an exclusive license to manufacture,
sell, lease and operate equipment developed by it, but such information was omitted from the prospectus. Both classes of stock had equal
voting rights. Investigation by the staff developed that the Ohio
corporation which granted the license to the registrant had only one
patent and that it related to an emulsion process or no apparent commercial value which would expire in about three years. It was also
ascertained that the principal promoter had filed a patent application covering a combustion chamber or "unit" employing a special
fuel which was to be used in various furnace applications such as the
steel open hearth. Apparently this patent was to be transferred to the
corporate holder of the Class B stock which was to grant registrant a
license thereon. The registration statement failed to disclose either
the facts regarding its emulsion 1?rocess or that the claims in the
patent application relating to the' combustion chamber" it proposed
to manufacture had been disallowed in full by the United States
Patent Office. In addition the prospectus failed to disclose that the
Ohio corporation which purported to grant licenses was under the
control of the registrant's principal promoter.
Furthermore the
prospectus omitted to state that it appeared from an exaniination of
the latter's books by the Ohio authorities that $60,000 of its funds
had been transferred to the principal promoter of the registrant and
was unaccounted for. The registration statement also failed to state
that the principal promoter had been indicted in 1948 for violating
the Ohio Securities Act in the sale of promissory notes, that he had
been a fugitive from justice during 1949 and that he was awaiting
trial after having been released on bail. After the registrant had
become aware that the investigation had been instituted it withdrew
its registration statement in July 1950.
Failure to make material disclosures including the possible effect
on enterprise of the Defense Production Act 011950 and the mobilization of the national economy.-A
company in the electronics field
recently discharged in bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to Chapter
XI of the National Bankruptcy Act filed a registration statement
covering 400,000 shares of convertible Class A stock to be offered to
the public at $2.50 per share. The prospectus failed to disclose adequately that one of the principal purposes of the offering was to repay
a substantial loan made to the registrant by a principal and possibly
controlling stockholder. In addition, the prospectus failed to set forth
adequately the use which would be made of the proceeds in the event
that a smaller amount than 400,000 shares was sold and to indicate

the position in which purchasers of the shares might find themselves
in such event. The prospectus also failed to disclose clearly that the
cost of financing would represent at least thirty-one percent of the
gross proceeds if all the shares were sold. Moreover, the registrant
failed to indicate its relatively poor competitive position and failed
to point out the effect of the mobilization of the national economy and
the impact of the Defense Production Act of 1950 upon its ability to
obtain materials and components needed for the manufacture of its
proposed product. Finally, the registrant omitted to set forth a substantial contingent liability to the United States Government and to
make adequate provision therefor in the balance sheet. After these
failures in disclosure were directed to the registrant's attention, it
withdrew its registration statement.
CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS AND FORMS

Rules 171, X-6, and U-105-Disclosure detrimental to the national
security.-The
Commission adopted during the past year rules providing for the omission or confidential treatment of informationf, if
publication of the information would, in the opinion of the Commission, acting in consultation with other executive departments or agencies of the United States, be detrimental to the national security,"
Such rules are applicable to all filings under the Securities Act of
1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935.
Procedure has been established whereby the Commission, upon
request, will render advance, informal opinions in cases where issuers,
underwriters, or other persons are in doubt as to the extent to which,
or the manner in which, particular information may be disclosed in
a registration statement, prospectus, application for registration, report, proxy statement, notification, or other document filed with the
Commission or an exchange pursuant to any of those Acts.
The general types of information which will be treated confidentially
under the new rules are as follows:
(1) The number, size, character, and location of ships in construction, or advance information as to the date of launchings or commissionings; or the physical set-up or technical details of shipyards.
(2) Specific information about war contracts, such as the exact
type of production, production schedules, dates of delivery, or J?rogress of production; estimated supplies of strategic and critical
material available; or nationwide "round-ups" of locally published
procurement data except when such composite information is officially
approved for publication.
(3) Specific information about the location of, or other information
about, sites and factories already in existence, which would aid
saboteurs in gaining access to them; information other than that
readily gained through observation by the general public disclosing
the location of sites and factories yet to be established, or the nature
of their production.
(4) Any information about new or secret military designs, or new
factory designs for war production.
(5) Any information of a classified nature dealing with any atomic
project, construction or product.

ANNUAL

REPORT

21

AmendmeaÂ» of Rules ~~oand ~22 of Regulation A.-Qn September 8, 1950, the Commission invited comments on proposed amendments to rules 220 and 222, which are a part of Regulation A under
the Securities Act of 1933. After considering the comments received
the Commission amended those rules, effective January 8, 195.1, to
provide a new method for determining public offering price in connection with certain offerings through rights and warrants under
Regulation A.4
In the past there has been some difficulty in determining in advance
how the price limitations of Regulation A apply to certain rights
offerings by issuers, which may be accompanied by sales of the rights
and of the offered securities made at varied prices by underwriters
and controlling persons. In order to minimize these difficulties, the
Commission added a new paragraph (i) to rule 220. This paragraph
provides generally that, for the purposes of Regulation A, the offering price of securities offered through rights or warrants shall be
either (1) their market value as determined prior to the filing of the
letter of notification or (2) the price to be received by the offeror,
whichever is higher, and that no separate consideration shall be given
to any sale of the rights or warrants by any person. In addition, rule
222 is amended to provide that the letter of notification filed in such
cases shall state the market value, as well as the take-down price, of
the securities.
Where additional shares of an outstanding class are to be offered
through rights, it will normally be appropriate for the person preparing the letter of notification simply to set forth the current market
value of the oustanding shares of the class to be offered. However,
if it can be demonstrated that the offering will result in a dilution of
the value of the outstanding shares, it will be permissible for the person filing the letter of notification to compute the dilution and to base
the computation of market value of the offered securities on the diluted
value.
Where the market value of securities to be offered through rights
or warrants cannot be determined prior to the offering, the new provisions that have been added to the rule will not be applicable. In
such cases, the application of the price limitations of paragraphs (a),
(b), and (d) will turn on the take-down price, the amount received
by controlling persons who sell their rights, and, if there are any
underwriters, any amounts received from the public by such
underwriters.
Amendment to Rule ~Â¥J of Regulation A-M.-During
the year the
Commission also adopted certain amendments to rule 240 under Regulation A-M.5 That regulation exempts certain offerings of assessable
mining securities from registration under the Act. The amendments,
by deletion of paragraph (c) of the rule, removed the restriction which
prevented issuers from commencing more than one offering under the
regulation each year; and, by revision of paragraph (f), require the
reporting to the Commission of assessments received by an issuer.
However, the regulation as amended continues to limit the aggregate
of unregistered offerings and assessments received to not more than
$100,000in each yearly period.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Proposed revision of Form S-1 designed to shorten and improve
Commission had under consideration at the end of
prospeatus.-The
the year a proposed revision of Form S-1, which is one of the forms
for registration of securities under the Securities Act of 1933. The
purpose of this revision is mainly to shorten and improve the prospectus and thereby facilitate its distribution and make it more useful
to investors. Notice of the proposal was published in detail and the
Commission also invited comments and suggestions from all interested persons," Some of the items of information currently required
to be shown in the prospectus would be omitted from the prospectus
under this proposal but would be otherwise filed with the registration
statement. For example, the prospectus would include very limited
information as to the nature of the underwriting commitment. Details of the underwriting arrangements would be omitted from the prospectus but would be otherwise filed as a part of the registration
statement. Certain other items of information would be similarly
treated. The Commission's experience has been that, to a considerable
extent, detailed items and instructions result in unnecessarily detailed
answers in the prospectus. Accordingly, the revised items and instructions of the proposed form have been somewhat streamlined for the
purpose of producing more concise statements in the prospectus without sacrificing essential information.
A revised form was adopted
after the end of the fiscal year.
LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT

It is sometimes necessary to obtain compliance with the Securities
Act by resort to the courts. Where continued violation of the Act and
consequent damage to the public is threatened, the Commission acts
promptly to safeguard the public interest by instituting injunctions.
Several of the actions in which the Commission has obtained injunctions during the last fiscal year involved the sale of mining securities. In SEC v, Francis D. Graves (JfJ1,(J Earl E. Brown,7 the defendants were enjoined from further violations of the registration
and fraud provisions of the Act in the sale of undivided participating
interests in two mining leases, one of which they did not own. The
Commission's complaint alleged that they had told investors, among
other things, that samples taken from the properties contained monazite, thorium, gold and other minerals in commercial quantities when
no sampling had been conducted, that monazite would be produced
in the near future when they had made no arrangements to exploit the
properties, and that they had invested $30,000 in the enterprise when
their total investment was approximately $1,500. SEC v. Carl I.
Addison and Joe W. Black s is another action in which the Commission
obtained an injunction against further violations of the registration
and fraud provisions of the Act in the sale of mining securities. This
case involved the sale of stock in a Canadian company organized for
the purpose of producing uranium ore. SEC v. Marvin C. M eddoak,9
SEC v. Yankee Mines Inc. et al.10 and SEC v. Alhambra Gold Mines
Corporation. 11 are other cases in which sales of securities of mining

companies in violation of the Act were enjoined. The M eddock case
involved violation of the fraud provisions; the last two cases charged
violation of the registration provisions.
A number of the cases in which the Commission successfully sought
injunctions against violations of the Act involved the sale of securities
in oil and gas companies. In SEO v, Penner Oil and Gas, Ino., et al.,12
a permanent injunction was entered against all defendants. Criminal
proceedings were also brought in connection with this promotion,
which involved a widespread solicitation by mail campaign. A description of the fraud involved is contained elsewhere in this report."
In SEO v, Gold Oreek Mining Oompany,H the company and two individual defendants consented to the entry of an 'injunction against
further violations by them of the fraud and registration provisions
of the Act in the sale of various types of securities in oil properties
located in Oklahoma. Among the misrepresentations alleged to have
been made in the sale of the securities were statements that the proceeds of the sales of stock would accrue to the company when in fact
the shares being offered were personally-owned shares of one of the
individual defendants and the proceeds from the sales were largely
used by him, and that the company's leases were surrounded by producing oil wells when in fact most of the surrounding wells had been
abandoned.
Injunctions were also obtained during the last fiscal year in the
following cases which involved the sale of securities in oil and gas
companies or interests in oil and gas leases: SEO v. Western Osage
Oil Oompany.15 SEO v. Avonwold Oil Cor-poration." SEO v. William
R . Justice and Adrian J. B elislef and SEO v. Western Oil Fields, Inc.,
et al.18 The first three cases charged violation of the registration
provisions; the last violation of the fraud provisions. Violations of
the registration provisions were also charged in SEO v. Sierra Nevada
Oil Oompany.19 In that case, after the court had orally announced
that it was prepared to issue a preliminary injunction, a voluntary
petition under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act was filed by the
defendant corporation in another jurisdiction and defendants argued
that the stay of proceedings in the order approving the petition prohibited entry of an injunction order. After the close of the fiscal
year, the Chapter X court, on motion of the Commission, clarified its
order, and a preliminary injunction was thereafter entered. A complaint filed against Spearoui Oompany Inc., et al.20 charging noncompliance with the Act's registration provisions is still pending.
During the year, the Commission obtained injunctions against further violations of the Act in many cases involving sales of securities
of other types of businesses. One such case was SEO v. Oo-op Insuranoe Oompany et al.,21where the Commission charged, inter alia, that
the defendants had obtained an option to purchase certain of the stock
of the insurance company at $1.00 per share and had then proceeded
to make a public offering of these securities at successively higher

prices of $2.50, $3.50, and $5.00 per share without disclosing to purchasers the fact of the option agreement or that the price at which
the stock was being sold had been arbitrarily established by the
defendants.
In SEO v. Patrick F. O'i.l8Wk,First Guardian Securities Corporation and Leonard S. Baum,22 it was alleged that First Guardian, a
registered broker-dealer, acting through Vice President Baum, bought
for resale a substantial amount of Mr. Cusick's personally owned
shares of Standard Brewing stock and thereafter offered the stock to
the public. No registration statement with respect to the Standard
Brewing shares was in effect with the Commission. After obtaining
a temporary restraining order, the Commission discovered evidence
which indicated additional violations of its Acts by First Guardian
and instituted action to revoke its registration as a broker-dealer.
Inasmuch as First Guardian consented to the revocation of its license
and proceeded to liquidate, the Commission subsequently agreed to
a dismissal of the injunction action.
The defendant in SEO v. Robert J. Oottle 23 consented to the entry
of a permanent injunction against further violations of the fraud
provisions of the Act. The Commission alleged that Cottle sold securities by falsely representing, among other things, that he was a
member of the New York and Boston Stock Exchanges, that he was
operating a successful trading account with a large brokerage firm in
Boston, that he was earning and paying large profits to investors, and
that a prominent Boston banker was associated with him in connection with such account. Actually Cottle was using the money received
from investors to bet on horse and dog races and for other personal
purposes. Later he was convicted and sentenced to a term of three
years for violations of the Act and the Mail Fraud Statute.
In SEO v. Mercer Hicks Oorporationr: the defendants consented
to the entry of a permanent injunction against further violations by
them of the fraud provisions of the Act on the basis of a complaint
filed against them during the previous fiscal year. While this action
was pending, proceedings were instituted which concluded in the
revocation of the broker-dealer registration of the corporation."
An injunction against violation of the registration and fraud provisions of the Act was obtained in SEO v, Northnoest Aooeptance Oorporaiion. and Robert M. Hawley.26 The alleged representations included a statement that the company had substantial earnings when,
in fact, severe losses had been suffered and the company showed a
net loss for the year ending September 30, 1950. It was also alleged
that defendants stressed the company's past dividend record without
disclosing that a dividend paid during the promotion was, in fact, a
return of capital and that they assured investors that the company
would repurchase the stock at any time without loss to them when, in
fact, such repurchase would impair the corporation's capital in violation of the law of the State of Washington where it was incorporated.
In SEO v. Atlas Tack Oorporationr' an injunction was entered directing the defendant, its officers and directors to file reports as reCivil Action No. 59-354, S. D. N. Y.

quired by the statute and to correct the deficiencies contained in the
reports which had been filed.
In SEO v. Evergreen Memorial Park Association, et al./i the Commission's original complaint charged defendants with selling unregistered securities in the nature of "investment contracts" in violation
of Section 5 of the Securities Act of 1933. After the close of the fiscal
year, the Commission sought leave to amend the complaint in order to
charge, in addition, violations of the antifraud provisions of Section
17 (a). The "investment contracts" allegedly involved sales of cemetery lots in wholesale quantities coupled with representations and
agreements that investors would obtain large profits within stated
periods from the resale of these lots at retail, that the defendant vendors would improve the cemetery as a whole and also lots of particular investors to facilitate their resalability, and that said defendants
would resell the lots for investors within stated periods at specified
profits.
The Commission participated as amicus curiae during the past fiscal
year in only one case involving the proper interpretation of the Securities Act of 1933. In (Irummer v. 01"l1Jl'fl1ey 29 the plaintiff instituted
an action under sections 12 (1), 12 (2) and 17 (a), charging that
defendants sold him unregistered stock in violation of the Act, and
that he had been induced to buy this stock by fraudulent misrepresentations and statements of half-truths.
In January 1951, the court
denied a motion of defendants to dismiss the complaint with respect
to the section 12 (1) cause of action and reserved judgment on the
motion with respect to the remaining causes of action. Subsequently,
the Commission filed a brief as amicus curiae expressing the following
views: (1) that jurisdiction of the section 12 (2) cause of action was
not dependent upon a showing, as defendants contended, that the
alleged misrepresentations and half-truths were communicated by use
of the mails or instruments of interstate commerce, but that it would
suffice if either the mails or interstate facilities were used in the sale
of the stock; and (2) that the federal jurisdictional requirements of
sections 12 (2) and 17 (a) would be satisfied if it were shown, as
plaintiffs alleged, that the mails were used to effect collection of plaintiff's check in partial payment for the stock, to demand completion
of the purchase agreement, and to deliver the stock. The Commission
expressed the opinion that it was unnecessary for the court to decide
whether plaintiff could also base his private action on the alleged violation of section 17 (a), since it believed that any wrong which plaintiff suffered could be redressed under section 12. The case was pending
at the close of the fiscal year.
PART II
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT

OF 1934
The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to insure the
maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities transactions both
on the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets, which
together constitute the Nation's facilities for trading in securities .

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Accordingly the Act provides in general for the regulation and control
of transactions in such markets and of practices and matters related
thereto, including solicitations of proxies of stockholders and transactions by officers, directors, and principal stockholders. It requires
specifically that information as to the condition of corporations whose
securities are listed on any national securities exchange shall be made
available to the public; and provides for the registration of such
securities, such exchanges, brokers and dealers in securities, and associations of brokers and dealers. It also regulates the use of the
Nation's credit in securities trading. While the authority to issue
rules on such credit use is lodged in the Board of Governors of the
Federal Reserve System, the administration of these rules and of
the other provisions of the Act is vested in the Commission.
REGULATION

OF EXCHANGES

AND EXCHANGE

TRADING

Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

Section 5 of the Act requires each securities exchange within the
United States or subject to its jurisdiction to register with the Commission as a national securities exchange or to apply for exemption
from such registration. Exemption from registration may be granted
to an exchange which has such a limited volume of transactions effected thereon that, in the opinion of the Commission, it is not practicable and not necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors to require its registration. During the
fiscal year no change occurred in the number of exchanges registered
as national securities exchanges or in the number granted exemption
from such registration.
At the close of the 1951 fiscal year the following 16 exchanges were
registered as national securities exchanges:
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Los Angeles Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
New Orleans Stock Exchange
New York Curb Exchange

New York Stock Exchange
Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock Exchange
Pittsburgh Stock Exchange
Salt Lake Stock Exchange
San Francisco Mining Exchange
San Francisco Stock Exchange
Spokane Stock Exchange
Washington Stock Exchange

Four exchanges were exempted from registration at the close of the
1951fiscal year. These were:
Colorado Springs Stock Exchange
Honolulu Stock Exchange

Richmond Stock Exchange
Wheeling Stock Exchange

Information pertinent to the organization, rules of procedure, trading practices, membership requirements and related matters of each
exchange is contained in its registration or exemption statement, and
any changes which are effected in such information are required to
be reported promptly by the exchanges. During the year numerous
changes in their rules and trading practices were reported by the
various exchanges, each of which was reviewed to ascertain whether
the change effected was in the public interest and complied with the
provisions of the Act. The nature of these changes varied considerably; some of the more significant which occurred are briefly outlined below :
~

Boston Stock Exchange amended its rules relating to commissions
for the purpose of making it clear that the rates of commission pre-

SEVENTEENTH ~AL

REPORT

27

scribed by the Constitution of the exchange are minimum rates and
that, so far as the Constitution and rules of the exchange are concerned, members are free to charge greater commissions if the conditions and circumstances warrant, provided that if the commission
being charged exceeds the minimum rate, that fact must be disclosed
in writing to the customer.
Cincinnati Stock Exchange amended its rules to prohibit the selling
of a lot of stock (all or none) at a lower price than the best bid on
the Exchange, which may be for a smaller lot. Likewise the amendment also prohibits the purchase of a larger lot of stock at a higher
price without taking small lots offered at lower prices. The revised
rule does not, however, prevent a buyer or seller from going around
smaller lots at the same price but having precedence as to the time
the order was received.
San Francisco Mining Exchange increased its schedule of commission rates on stocks selling up to 29 cents per share.
San Francisco Stock Exchange adopted a rule which provides that
when a member firm holds securities for customers which have been
fully paid for, or holds securities for customers the market value of
which is in excess of the amount required under the Exchange's margin
maintenance rules, such securities are to be segregated and marked
in such a manner as to clearly identify the owners of such securities.
Disciplinary Actions by Exchanges against Members

Each national securities .exchange, pursuant to a request of the
Commission, reports to the Commission any action of a disciplinary
nature taken by it against any of its members, or against any partner
or employee of a member, for violation of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, of any rule or regulation thereunder, or of any exchange
rule. During the year four exchanges reported taking disciplinary
action against 16 members, member firms, and partners and employees
of member firms.
The nature of the actions reported included fines ranging from $100
to $5,000 in 8 cases with total fines aggregating $8,850; suspension of
an individual member from exchange membership for a period of
three months; censure of individuals or firms for infractions of the
rules, and warnings against further violations. The disciplinary actions resulted from violations of exchange rules, principally those
pertaining to handling of customers' accounts, capital requirements,
floor tradrng, commission rates, and conduct inconsistent with just
and equitable principles of trade.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES
Nature and Purpose of Registration

An issuer may register a security on a national securities exchange
by filing with the Commission and the exchange an application for
registration which sets forth on a prescribed form reliable and comprehensive information about the affairs of the issuer and its securities
which is available for public inspection. The law also requires the
registrant to file annual, quarterly, and other periodic reports in order
to keep this information up to date. The statute makes it unlawful
to trade in a security on the exchange unless it is so registered (except

Examination of Applications and Reports

The work of examining applications and reports filed under the
Securities Exchange Act is integrated with the examination work
arising under the Securities Act and certain other statutes administered by the Commission. All applications and reports are examined to determine whether accurate and adequate disclosure has been
made of the specific types of information required by the Act and
the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. Where such disclosure has not been made, necessary correcting amendments are
obtained from the registrant. The result of this examination work
may be illustrated by a description of a few actual cases arising during
the 1951 fiscal year.
Loss from eurre1UJYdevaluation charqed. to profit and loss instead
01 surplus.-The
annual report required of a company with wide foreign operations must include financial statements not only with respect
to the registrant separately and the registrant and its domestic subsidiaries combined but also with respect to the foreign subsidiaries
of such company. During the 1951 fiscal year the staff noted from
the annual report filed by one such registrant-a
large manufacturer
of specialized machinery-that
a charge had been made to surplus of
$4,911,325.31in the combined statements of its foreign subsidiaries as
a result of devaluation of foreign currencies and of the translation of
working capital and reserves of foreign subsidiaries into United
States dollars at current exchange rates.
The Division of Corporation Finance took the position that this
amount represented the loss from the devaluation of foreign currencies during the year and should be reflected in the profit and loss statement. The Division also called the attention of this company to the
reports to stockholders which had been published by other large corporations with substantial foreign activities and which had applied
the method of accounting for such loss suggested by the staff in this
instance. The combined profit and loss statement of foreign subsidiaries was thereupon amended, changing the final credit figure of
$3,126,335.98net income to a final debit figure of $1,784,989.33which
was, pursuant to the Commission's recently amended Regulation S-X,
captioned "Net income less Special charge (net charge)."
Losses of subsidiaries and adjustments of depreciation transferred
from surplus to income statement.-At
the beginning of its 1949 fiscal
year a registrant, engaged in the manufacture of aircraft parts, owned
71 percent of the voting stock of one subsidiary, and 100 percent of
the common stock along with approximately 61.5 percent of the preferred stock (which had voting rights) of another subsidiary.
Through the year 1948 its consolidated financial statements had included these companies. A merger agreement between the two subsidiaries subsequently became effective in the latter part of 1949 and
under its terms the registrant early in 1950 received 75,000 shares of
new second preferred stock of the surviving company for its investment in the two companies. The surviving company ceased to be a
subsidiary as a result of the exchange of stock.
The investment in the new preferred stock was thereafter in the
registrant's annual report shown in the balance sheet at the cost of the

SEVENTEENTH ~AL

REPORT

investments surrendered in exchange therefor, and the sum of $1,400,000 was provided from earned surplus as a reserve for the revaluation
of the new stock to approximately its par value. The financial statements also reflected adjustments of accumulated depreciation for prior
years (less applicable additional income taxes) as a credit to earned
surplus in the amount of $62,346.78. For 1949 the merged subsidiaries
sustained losses of $741,164.61 and of $230,394.88, respectively, or a
combined loss of the two companies (consolidated with the parent in
the previous year) of $971,559.49, no portion of which was reflected in
the statement of income of the parent. However, the above-mentioned
reserve against the combined investment created by a charge to earned
surplus appeared to reflect the management's opinion as to the loss
in the investment.
It was the opinion of the staff that in this situation the losses sustained by the subsidiary companies, to the extent of the registrant's
equity therein, were an incident of the year 1949, and that the losses
as well as the adjustment relating to depreciation should be reflected
in the statement of income. The statement of income as it was subsequently amended to reflect these views showed a loss of $589,560.76
for 1949 as compared to the statement as originally filed which
showed a net income of $428,199.91.
Ohange made in method 01 computing depletion.-For
many years,
including the year 1949, a large copper mining company had followed
the practice of computing unit depletion of metal mines at separate
rates per pound of copper from individual properties, charging such
depletion direct to su~lus.
The following note was appended to the
statement of surplus: ' ... The unit rates used are based on the mine
values included In the balance sheets . . . and the ore reserves of the
respective mines as estimated as of March 1, 1913, or at the date of
acquisition, or in the case of a subsidiary company at a subsequent
date ... Part of the depletion charge is based on United States
Treasury Department valuations as of March 1, 1913, determined for
depletion purposes in connection with Federal income taxes." The
reason given in a note and in the certificate of the independent certified
public accountants for using this method of treatment of depletion
read: "While it is recognized that charges made for the amortization
of cost of fixed assets are generally shown as deductions in profit and
loss statements, the difficulty of determining the extent of ore reserves
and of allocating the depletion charges between cost and appreciation.
the variance in the amount of the charge during the different periods
depending upon the particular properties operated, and other uncertainties and variables, have caused the registrant to follow consistently
the practice above mentioned ....
"
Inasmuch as some years had passed and distinct progress had been
made in the method of preparing financial statements since this matter
was first discussed with the registrant, a suggestion was made by the
staff during the 1951 fiscal year that the problem be reexamined.
Accordingly in February 1951 representatives of the registrant and
its independent certified public accountants met with members of the
staff and reviewed the question of accounting for depletion and other
matters in order to secure an over-all improvement in the presentation
of the company's financial statements for the benefit of investors. As
a result of these co-operative prefiling discussions, in its annual report
for the year 1950, filed on April 27, 1951, the registrant changed its

30

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

practice with respect to depletion so that the deduction was computed
on the basis of an over-all unit rate applied to the pounds of copper
sold from the registrant's own production except that depletion of a
consolidated subsidiary was computed separately as heretofore. The
over-all rate is deemed by the company to be sufficient in amount to
provide for the amortization of the net book value of mines on or
before the exhaustion of the mines. The charge for depletion of
mines as thus calculated was shown as a deduction in the profit and
loss statement for the year 1950. The company added this note to its
1950 financial statements: "The registrant makes no representation
that the deduction represents the depletion actually sustained or the
decline, if any, in mine values attributable to the year's operations
(which amounts are not susceptible of determination), or that it
represents anything other than a general provision for the amortization of the remaining book value of mines. Depletion used in estimating United States taxes on income has been computed on a
statutory basis and differs from the amount shown in these accounts."
The accountants made appropriate reference in their certificate to
the change in procedure and hereafter will be able to omit a cumbersome explanation from the company's financial accounts.
Statistics of Securities Registered on Exchanges

At the close of the 1951 fiscal year, 2,188 issuers had 3,523 security
issues listed and registered on national securities exchanges. These
securities consisted of 2,581 stock issues aggregating 3,477,564,645
shares, and 942 bond issues aggregating $20,896,324,569in principal
amount. This represents an increase of 329,880,327shares and a decrease of $2,394,222 principal amount of bonds, respectively, over the
aggregate amounts listed and registered at the close of the 1950 fiscal
year.

The annual and current reports listed above are in addition to the
corresponding reports filed under section 15 (d) of the Securities
Exchange Act pursuant to undertakings contained in registration

REPORT

Temporary Exemption of Substituted or Additional Securities

Rille X-12A-5 provides a temporary exemption from the registration requirements of section 12 (a) of the Act for securities issued in
substitution for, or in addition to, securities previously listed or
admitted to unlisted trading privileges on a national securities exchange. The purpose of this exemption is to enable transactions to
be lawfully effected on an exchange in such substituted or additional
securities pending their registration or admission to unlisted trading
privileges on an exchange.
The exchanges filed notifications of admission to trading under
this rule with respect to 165 issues during the year. In some instances, the same issue was admitted to trading on more than one
exchange, so that the total admissions to such trading, including
duplications, numbered 317.
Formal Action Under Section 19 (a) (2)

In case any issuer of a security listed and registered on an exchange
fails to comply with any provision of the Act or the rules and regulations, the Commission is empowered under section Hl (a) (2) to
institute formal proceedings looking to the termination of such registration. Specifically, the Commission may, after giving appropriate
notice and opportunity for hearing, deny, suspend the effective date
of, suspend for a period of not exceeding 12 months, or withdraw,
the registration of such security.
Pursuant to this authority during the 1951 fiscal year the Commission after a public hearing ordered withdrawn from registration on
the San Francisco Mining Exchange the common stock of New
Sutherland Divide Mining Company. This company had failed to
file its annual report for 1949, the exchange had consequently suspended. trading in the stock of the company, and officers of the company had stated to representatives of the Commission that the company had no assets or funds with which to file such report or with
which to file a petition in bankruptcy or effect dissolution of the
company.
MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES TRADED ON EXCHANGES

included in the amounts shown above for such other exchanges only.
The market value of bonds on New York Stock Exchange includes
$96,899,382,000 of United States Government and subdivision issues.
SPECIAL OFFERINGS ON EXCHANGES

Rule X-10B-2 under the Securities Exchange Act permits special
offerings of large blocks of securities to be made on a national securities exchange provided such offerings are effected pursuant to a plan
which has been filed with and approved by the Commission. A security may be the subject of a special offering when it has been determined that the auction market on the floor of the exchange cannot
absorb a particular block within a reasonable period of time without
unduly disturbing the current price of the security. A special offering of a security is made at a fixed price consistent with the existing auction market price of the security, and members acting as
brokers for public buyers are paid a special commission by the seller
which ordinarily exceeds the regular brokerage commission. Buyers of the security are not charged any commission on their purchases and obtain the security at the net price of the offering.
Since February 6, 1942, the date on which rule X-10B-2 was
amended to permit special offerings, the Commission has declared effective special offering plans of the following nine exchanges on the
date shown opposite each:
New York Stock Exchange
San Francisco Stock Exchange
New York Curb Exchange
Philadelphia-Baltimore

On June 30, 1951, the Commission declared effective for an indefinite period of time the amended special offering plans of the Midwest Stock Exchange, New York Curb Exchange, New York Stock
Exchange, and San Francisco Stock Exchange. These are the same
special offering plans which the Commission previously declared effective for an experimental period expiring on June 30,1951. These
amended special offering plans were discussed in last year's annual
report.'
Each exchange with a special offering plan in effect has been requested to report certain information to the Commission on each offering effected on the exchange under the plan. Such reports showed
a total of 19 offerings effected on the Midwest Stock Exchange, New
York Stock Exchange and San Francisco Stock Exchange during the
1 See 16th SEC Annual Report 21).-30. The amended special oft'erlng plans of the New
York Stock Exchange, New York Curb Exchange and San Francisco Stock Exchange were
Initially declared effective for an experimental period on August 24, August 25 and November 7, 1949, respectively; similar action was taken on November 1, 1950, with respect to
the amended plan filed by the Midwest Stock Exchange. The experimental period for all
four exchanges was subsequently extended. See Securities Exchange Act releases nos.

fiscal year ended June 30, 1951. These offerings involved the sale of
160,384 shares of stock with an aggregate market value of $5,073,000
and ranging in market value from $41,200 to $1,601,200. Special
commissions paid to brokers participating in these 19 offerings totaled
$99,000. By comparison, in the precedmg fiscal year a total of 29
offerings involving 430,955 shares of stock having a market value of
$11,129,000 were effected on two exchanges with special commissions
paid to brokers totaling $266,000. Further details of special offerings
during the year are given in appendix table 9.
During the period February 19, 1942, through June 30,1951, a total
of 454 offerings have been effected. These offerings totaled 5,507,239
shares with a market value of $160,537,000and brokers have been paid
special commissions totaling $3,180,800.
SECONDARY

DISTRIiBUTIONS

APPROVED

BY EXCHANGES

A "secondary distribution," as the term is used in this section, is a
distribution over the counter by a dealer or group of dealers of a
comparatively large block of a previously issued and outstanding security listed or admitted to trading on an exchange. Such distributions take place when it has been determined that it would not be in
the best interest of the various parties involved to sell the shares on
the exchange in the regular way or by special offering. The distributions generally take place after the close of exchange trading. As in
the case of special offerings, buyers obtain the security from the dealer
at the net price of the offering, which usually is at or below the most
recent price registered on the exchange. It is generally the practice
of exchanges to require members to obtain the approval of the exchange before participating in such secondary distributions.
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1951, 5 exchanges reported
having approved a total of 80 secondary distributions under which
4,664,187shares of stock with a market value of $128,017,000were sold.
Further details of secondary distributions of exchange stocks are given
in appendix table 10.

TRADING

PRIVILEGES

ON EXCHANGES

The number of stocks available for trading on an unlisted basis on
each of the stock exchanges can be visualized and compared with the
number available for trading on a listed basis by reference to the
table on the following page.
Clause 1 of section 12 (f) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 provides for continuance of unlisted trading privileges to which
a security had been admitted on an exchange prior to March 1, 1934.
Historically, admission of securities to trading on stock exchanges
upon application of members-the so-called 'unlisted trading" on
exchanges-eame first. Any member could have any security added
to the roster. As the stock exchanges grew in importance and public
interest in them increased, it became necessary to require reports and
disclosures from the issuers along with various other actions for
protection of the security holders, and it also became possible to
charge issuers a fee for listing, Consequently, listing by agreement
between the issuers and the exchanges, stipulating what data and
actions were required of the issuers, gradually succeeded the process
of adding issues to the trading roster upon members' requests. Thus,

New York Stock Exchange abolished unlisted trading in 1910. Other
leading exchanges such as Boston and Philadelphia continued to
allow unlisted trading on their floors in issues listed on some other
principal exchange, on the ground that listing on such other exchange
afforded the necessary background of reports and actions by issuers.
A few exchanges continued to extend unlisted trading privileges to
issues not covered by listing agreements between issuers and any
domestic stock exchange. New York Curb Exchange is the principal
surviving representative of this group and continues to have most
of the "clause I" issues which have no domestic listed status. As
anticipated by Congress, when it amended section 12 (f) on May
27, 1936, to provide for limited continuance of unlisted trading on
exchanges, there has been a considerable shrinkage in number of
"clause I" issues over the years, as they became listed or were retired,
refunded, exchanged for other issues, or otherwise disappeared from
exchange trading.
Clause 2 of section 12 (f) provides for the extension of unlisted
trading privileges to securities already listed on some other national
securities exchange. Most of the trading privileges pursuant to this
clause have been applied for and obtained with respect to stock
issues by 8 leading regional stock exchanges. Most of the stocks involved are listed on New York Stock Exchange. The total reported
volume in "clause 2" stocks during 1950was about 13,000,000shares" an
important figure to the regional exchanges but equivalent to less than

SEVENTEENTH

REPORT

2% of the share volume on New York Stock Exchange during that
vear. Admissions of bond issues pursuant to clause 2 have been 8,
of which only 2 are extant.
Clause 3 of section 12 (f) provides for the further extension of
unlisted trading privileges to unlisted securities. In these cases,
information substantially equivalent to that filed in respect of an
issue listed on a national securities exchange must be available. Applications covering stocks have been approved by the Commission III
11 instances and with respect to 9 issues, 2 of which were admitted
to trading on several exchanges. Only 4 stock issues continue their
status under clause 3, and 2 of these have become listed on another
exchange leaving only 2 with dependence for status on clause 3.
Bond admissions have been 45, but all the issues except 13 have been
retired or listed.
The status of stock and bond issues admitted to unlisted trading
pursuant to clauses 2 and 3, and the reported volumes of trading
therein for the calendar year 1950, are shown in appendix table 17.
The unduplicated number of stock issues admitted to unlisted trading on the exchanges, and which are not listed on some national securities exchange as well, was 354 as of June 30, 1951, aggregating
342,084,643shares or less than 9 percent of all shares on the 20 exchanges. Reported exchange volumes therein for the calendar year
195'0came to 34,310,513 shares or less than 4 percent of the total reported exchange volumes for that year. New York Curb Exchange
alone accounted for 32,054,348 or 93.4 percent of the 34,310,513share
volume. In considering these figures, it should be recalled that reported ticker volume of New York Curb Exchange is less than 90 percent of the true total, and that volume of trading in stocks removed
during the year is not included.
Bond issues admitted to unlisted trading on the exchanges have
become reduced over the years to a very small number. As of June 30,
1951, there were 59 pursuant to clause 1, 2 'pursuant to clause 2, and
13 pursuant to clause 3. All but 3 of the Issues were on New York
Curb Exchange. Of the total 74 issues, 6 were listed on another
national securities exchange and 68 were not so listed.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The actual number of issues involved is less than 61 since applications by different exchanges are often with respect to the same issue,
resulting in duplication.
No applications were made or approved during the fiscal year for
unlisted trading privileges in bond issues pursuant to clause 2, nor
for unlisted trading privileges in either stock or bond issues pursuant
to clause 3 of section 12 (f).
Changes in Securities Admitted to Unlisted Trading Privileges

The usual considerable number of notifications of minor changes
in securities admitted to unlisted trading was received during the
year from the stock exchanges pursuant to paragraph (a) of rule
X-12F-2.

Applications for continuance of trading in unlisted issues after
more important changes than those contemplated under paragraph
(a) of rule X-12F-2 are made under paragraph (b) of that rule, and
were limited during the last fiscal year to one by New York Curb
Exchange in the case of Nippon Electric Power Company, Ltd., 61/2
percent bonds due 1953 which was withdrawn when the Curb obtained
a listing of the bonds, and one by Boston Stock Exchange in the
case of Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul & Pacific Railroad Company
common stock which was withdrawn upon approval of unlisted trading in that issue pursuant to clause 2 of section 12 (f). Accordingly,
no denials and no grants of applications pursuant to paragraph (b)
of rule X-12F -2 were made during the last fiscal year. The Commission prefers that application for trading be made pursuant to clause
2 of section 12 (f) rather than paragraph (b) of rule X-12F -2 whenever this course is possible.
DELISTING OF SECURITIES FROM EXCHANGES
Securities Delis ted by Application

The granting of applications filed by New York Stock Exchange
pursuant to rule X-12D2-1 (b) resulted in the delisting of 3 bond and
2 stock issues from that exchange during the fiscal year. The applications covering the bonds and 1 of the stocks declared the amounts in
public hands were no longer sufficient to warrant exchange trading,2
and the application covering the remaining stock was based on bankruptcy and termination of transfer facilities,"
The granting of applications filed by issuers pursuant to rule
X-12D2-1 (b) resulted in the delisting of 9 stock issues of 6 issuers
during the fiscal year. Inactivity on the exchange was given as a
reason for delisting 4 stock issues of 3 issuers on the Chicago Board

respect to an issue on Midwest Stock Exchange," and acceptance of
an offer to exchange into stock of another company except for a small
residue was the basis with respect to an issue on San Francisco Stock
Exchange.'
Securities Delisted b". Certification

Securities which have been paid at maturity, redeemed, or retired in
full, or which have become exchangeable for other securities in substitution therefor, may be removed from listing and registration on
a national securities exchange if the exchange files a certification with
the Commission to the effect that such retirement has occurred. The
removal of the security becomes effective automatically after the interval of time prescribed by rule X-12D2-2 (a). The exchanges filed
certifications under this rule effecting the removal of 183 separate
issues. In some instances the same issue was removed from more than
one exchange, so that the total number of removals, including duplications, was 226. Successor issues to those removed became listed and
registered on exchanges in many cases.
In accordance with the provisions of rule X-12D2-1 (d), New York
Curb Exchange removed 3 issues from listing and registration when
they became listed and registered on New York Stock Exchange. This
rule permits a national securities exchange to remove a security from
listing and registration in the event trading therein has been terminated pursuant to a rule of the exchange which requires such termination if the security becomes listed and registered and admitted to
trading on another exchange. Removal under this rule is automatic,
the exchange being required merely to notify the Commission of the
removal.
Securities Removed from Listing on Exempted Exchanges

A security may be removed from listing on an exempted exchange
merely upon notification by such an exchange to the Commission setting forth the reasons for such removal. Honolulu Stock Exchange
removed five issues from listing thereon during the year due in one
case to the call of the security for redemption and in two cases due
to the liquidation of the issuers. In the remaining two cases the securities became exchangeable for other securities which subsequently
became listed on the same exchange.
MANIPULATION AND STABIUZATION

One of the evils which the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was
primarily designed to prevent is the manipulation of security markets
by practices which are deceptive or otherwise improper. Sections 9,

..
Pursuant to its statutory authority, the Commission has adopted
rules and regulations to aid it in carrying out the expressed will of
Congress. Sections 9, 10, and 15 as augmented by the Commission's
rules and regulations are aimed at freeing our securities markets from
artificial influence and maintaining fair and honest markets, where
prices are established by supply and demand and are uninfluenced
by manipulative activity.
Manipulation

The manipulation of security prices in years prior to the enactment
of the Securities Exchange Act took millions of dollars annually
from the public and was one of the principal reasons for the adoption
of the Act. In the early days of the Commission's existence, some
market operators attempted to continue their manipulative activities.
The Commission uncovered these activities and caused the imposition
of various penalties upon certain operators, including expulsions from
exchanges, revocation of broker-dealer registrations, fines and jail
sentences.
As a result of the administration of the Act, manipulation has been
reduced to a point where it is no longer an appreciable factor in our
markets. However, sporadic attempts artificially to raise or depress
the prices of securities are still encountered, and it is evident that
any relaxation of market surveillance on the part of the Commission
would create a danger of reestablishment of many of the manipulative
practices the Act was designed to prevent.
The staff regularly scrutinizes price movements in approximately
8,200 securities, including about 3,600 issues traded on exchanges and
about 4,600 of the most active over-the-counter issues. The volume
of transactions of listed securities and the number of dealers making
a market in over-the-counter issues are also closely observed. An
observation is made on a daily basis of all listed securities as they
appear in such publications as the Wall Street Journal and of overthe-counter issues as they appear in The National Daily Quotation
Service. Complete records are kept on a weekly basis (with the exception of about 600 inactive issues which are kept on a monthly
basis) of all of the above-mentioned securities. In addition unusual
activity in stock transactions on the New York Stock Exchange and
the New York Curb Exchange is observed from the ticker as soon as
it occurs.
Information maintained concerning all these securities includes
not only data reflecting the market action but also includes the latest
news items, earnings figures, dividends, options and other facts which
might explain price and volume changes. Trained analysts daily
scan the Wall Street Journal, Standard and Poor's, Moody's and
other financial publications and record any items that might be reflected in the market price of these securities. Reports required by

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

39

the Securities Acts from corporations or their officers, directors and
10 percent stockholders and from registered broker-dealers are
studied. Important information contained in these reports is recorded on the securities' weekly price and volume record. All possible known information regarding a security is maintained on a
current basis. Dates of public releases of any news regarding a compll,nyare carefully recorded. At the inception of any unusual volume
of trading or price fluctuations in a security, all this information is
reexamined. The market action of the security is compared with the
action of other securities in the same industry group and with the
action of the general market and a conclusion drawn as to the necessity
for an investigation.
The markets for securities about to be sold to the public are watched
very closely. In this connection the markets for 1,370 issues in the
amount of $173,209,739 offered under Regulation A, were carefully
checked for improper pricing or market grooming. Over 500 other
securities were kept under special daily observation during the 1951
fiscal year for periods from 10 to 90 days, largely because a public
offering under a registration statement was proposed with the right
to stabilize reserved by the underwriter or issuer. Issues actually
offered during the fiscal year had a public offering price in excess of
$3,380,000,000.
In administering the anti-manipulative provisions of the Act there
is a premium on prompt action to prevent harm before it occurs, and
at the same time to avoid interference with the legitimate functioning of the markets. To accomplish this the Commission has continuously modified and sought to improve its procedures for the systematic surveillance of trading in securities. Methods used to detect
manipulation have necessarily been flexible, since techniques employed
by manipulators change constantly, increasing in subtlety and
complexity.
The Commission operates on the premise that manipulation should
be, and in most cases can be, suppressed at its inception. Losses suffered by the public are seldom recoverable, even though the perpetrator of a fraud is brought to justice. Therefore, it is believed
that it is more important to prevent a possible manipulation than to
allow unlawful market operations to continue until it appears that
sufficient evidence for a successful prosecution is available.
It has been found that many would-be violators of the regulations
prohibiting manipulation have been halted by prompt inquiries by
the Commission. The fact that trading in a given security is under
investigation is kept confidential by the Commission, as public knowledge of the existence of such investigations may unduly affect the
market or reflect unfairly upon individuals whose activities are being
investigated. As a result, the Commission occasionally receives
criticism for failure to investigate certain cases when in fact it is
actually engaged in an investigation. However, while the general
public is unaware that an inquiry is being made, any person or group
of persons conducting unusual market activity in a security will
be made aware by questions asked either their brokers or themselves
after the brokers have supplied the names of their principals. In
this connection the Commission receives excellent cooperation from
the stock exchanges and from brokers and dealers.
The Commission's surveillance of unusual market activity may

40

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

take the form of a simple inquiry, addressed to an exchange or broker
by our nearest Regional Office, asking for an explanation or the names
of the buyers and sellers. This type of inquiry is used when the
market activity is limited to a brief period during a day's trading or
at most a single day's transactions.
1Â£ the explanation is logical and
devoid of manipulative features, no further investigation is made.
If the explanation is considered unsatisfactory, an investigation is
initiated and conducted by our Regional Office located nearest the
exchange or market on which the transactions were made.
Investigations take two forms. The "quiz" or preliminary investigation is designed to detect and discourage incipient manipulation by a prompt determination of the reasons for unusual market
behavior. Often the quiz discloses no violations of the anti-manipulative provisions of the Securities Acts. The quiz is then closed. If
possible violations of other sections of the Securities Acts or violations of other statutes are revealed, the information obtained in the
"quiz" is made available to the proper division of the Commission
or to the appropriate agency for any action that they might consider
necessary. When facts are uncovered which require more intensive
investigation, formal orders are issued by the Commission. In a
formal investigation, members of the Commission staff are empowered
to subpena pertinent material and to take testimony under oath. In
the course of such investigations, data on purchases and sales over
substantial periods of time are compiled and trading operations involving considerable quantities of securities are often scrutinized.

Stabilization

In administering those provisions of the Securities Exchange Act
prohibiting manipulation of securities prices certain stabilizing transactions are permitted.
Stabilizing is a word which is frequently misunderstood.
The law prohibits injection of artificial activity into the
market. One exception is stabilization.
But stabilizing is permissible only when it is used to prevent or retard a price change, usually
a decline. No moving around of the market under the label of stabilizing is permitted.
Stabilization means maintenance of a price independently reached in the market.
Prudent regulation by this Commission has permitted the investment industry to change its methods with changmg conditions and to
achieve its primary function-which
is to supply industry with the

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

41

capital it needs. For this purpose formal Commission rules dealing
with stabilization relate only to offerings "at the market" or at prices
related to a changing market price. The practice applicable to fixed
price offerings is embodied in a wealth of interpretative material. It
is the Commission's experience that issuers and underwriters place
great value on the immediate service which the Commission is able to
render them by being at all times available to give them responsible
advice as to the proper stabilizing techniques in the offerings of securities. Also the same policy of the Commission extends to both manipulation and stabilization in that it seeks to prevent violations of the
law rather than to allow them to develop to the point where monetary
losses occur. The investor naturally wants to see a violator of the
law brought to justice, but this does not insure the return of any financial loss that he may have suffered.
The law requires that all issuers or underwriters must file with
the Commission a notice of intent to stabilize if an issue is to be
stabilized. Thus the staff is able to observe and assist the registrant
before and during an offering.
Of 554 registration statements filed during the fiscal year, 231 contained a statement of intention to stabilize to facilitate the offerings
covered by such registration statements. Each of these latter filings
was examined critically as to the propriety of the proposed method
of distribution, market support and the full disclosure thereof.
Stabilizing operations were conducted in offerings of stock issues
aggregating 19,461,164shares with an aggregate public offering price
of $402,878,038. Bonds stabilized had a total face amount of
$64,500,000. In connection with these stabilizing operations over 350
conferences were held with representatives of issuers and underwriters. Many more written and telephone requests were answered to
assist them to avoid violations of the rules. 9,210 reports from these
representatives were received, listed, examined and filed.
SECURITY TRANSACfIONS OF CORPORATION INSIDERS
Purpose of Regulation

In the Congressional hearings which led to the passage of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, a common practice among some officers,
directors, and large stockholders of engaging in short-term speculation in the listed stocks of their companies was revealed. For example, four of the officers and directors of a company were participants
in a pool which made a profit of some $200,000 in less than 3 months
in 1933through trading III the company's common stock. In another
instance the president of a company together with his brothers controlled the company through ownership of a little more than 10 percent of its stock. They sold their holdings for upward of $16,000,000
shortly before the company passed a dividend and later repurchased
the stock for about $7,000,000, making a profit of approximately
$9,000,000on the transaction. In these instances not only were the
insiders profiting by transactions based on information available to
them solely because of their privileged position and not available to
the public, but the stockholders and the investing public were
unaware and had no way of knowing that they were trading in their
companies' stocks. Such abuses as these and others led to the in-

42

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

elusion of the provisions of section 16 in the Securities Exchange
Act. The basic Congressional objectives sought in the provisions of
section 16 are twofold: (1) to provide public stockholders with information as to the prospects of their company which may be implicit in the security transactions of the insiders; and (2) to prevent
corporation insiders from using inside information to unfair advantage in security trading.
Reports of Transaclions and Holdings

For the purpose of affording to the public information as to the
transactions and holdings of insiders, section 16 (a) provides that
every person who is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner of
more than 10 percent of any class of any equity security which is
listed and registered on a national securities exchange, or who is an
officer or director 'of the issuer of such a security, shall file with the
exchange and the Commission, at the time of the registration of such
security or within 10 days after the time he becomes such beneficial
owner, officer or director, a statement of the amount of all equity securities of such issuer of which he is directly or indirectly the beneficial owner, and within 10 days after the close of each month thereafter in which there has been any change in his beneficial ownership a statement indicating such changes and his holdings at the close
of the month. Similar provisions are contained in section 17 (a) of
the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 covering officers
and directors of registered public utility holding companies and in
section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 covering officers, directors, principal security holders, members of advisory boards,
investment advisers, and affiliated persons of investment advisers of
registered closed-end investment companies.
Publieation of Data Reported

The originals of these reports are available for public inspection
from the moment they are filed. Recognizing, however, that a relatively limited number of investors have the opportunity to inspect the
reports at the Commission's central office or at exchanges where additional copies of section 16 (a) reports must also be filed, the Commission condenses and publishes the information contained in the
reports in a monthly Official Summary of Security Transactions and
Holdings for distribution to investors, newspaper correspondents,
press services and other interested members of the public. The elimination, of certain items of nonessential data and slight changes in the
format of the Summary have made it possible during the 1951 fiscal
year to reduce the size of the Summary more than a third, with a corresponding reduction in printing and related costs.
Volume of Reporls Filed and Examined

The number of reports filed during the 1951 fiscal year, as shown
in the following table, represents an increase of more than 11 percent
over the number filed during the preceding year. In fact, it is the
largest number of such reports filed in any fiscal year since 1938.

Preventing Unfair Use of Inside Information

For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which
may have been obtained by an insider by reason of his relationship
to his company, section 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 provides for the recoverability by or in behalf of the issuer of
any profit he may realize from any purchase and sale, or any sale and
purchase, of any equity security of the company within any period
of less than six months. Corresponding provisions are contained in
section 17 (b) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
and section 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act of 1940. While the
Commission is not charged with the enforcement of the civil remedies
created by these provisions, which are matters for determination by
the courts in actions brought by the proper parties, it is interested in
seeing that information with respect to possible profits by insiders
is made available to issuers and public stockholders.
SOLICITATION OF PROXIES, CONSENTS, AND AUTHORIZATIONS

Pursuant to sections 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, 12 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935
and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 the Commission
has adopted Regulation X-14 which is designed to regulate the solicitation of proxies, consents and authorizations in connection with
securities of companies subject to those statutes in order to protect
investors by requiring the disclosure of certain information to them
at the time their proxies are solicited. The information prescribed
for such disclosure is calculated to enable the investor to act intelligently upon each separate matter with respect to which his vote
or consent is sought. The regulation also contains provisions enabling security holders who are not allied with the company's management to communicate with other security holders when management
is soliciting proxies, either by arranging for the distribution of
their own proxy statements or through the inclusion of their proposals in the proxy statements of management.

44

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

A slight increase occurred in the number of proxy solicitations
made pursuant to Regulation X-14 during the 1950 calendar year
when the staff of the Division of Corporation Finance received and
examined material relating to 1,737 proxy solicitations including
"follow-up" material in 185 instances, compared with 1,653 solicitations made in the preceding calendar year,"
The number of solicitations made by management during the 1950
calendar year accounted for 1,713 or nearly 99 percent of all proxy
statements filed that year; nevertheless, there were 24 solicitations
made during the same period by non-management groups. Besides,
57 of the 1,713 proxy statements filed by management contained 97
proposals of 24 different stockholders. Certain of these stockholders
arranged for the inclusion of their proposals in the proxy statements
of more than one company. The number of management proxy statements including such stockholder proposals has increased from 19 in
1946 to 57 in 1950, while such stockholder proposals have grown from
34 to 97 and the number of different stockholders making these
proposals has correspondingly risen from 9 to 24.
The election of directors overshadows in its frequency all other
items of business combined for which proxies are sought. Thus in
1950 there were proxy statements covering 1,523 stockholders' meetings at which the election of directors was one of the items of business, and 191 meetings not involving the election of directors, along
with 23 remaining solicitations seeking assents and authorizations
which did not involve any meeting or any voting upon directors.
The items of business other than that of election of directors for
which stockholders' action was sought in the 1950 calendar year
covered many specific proposals, the wide range and frequency of
which may be noted in the following tabulation.

A remarkable increase is reflected above in the number of proxies
submitting employees pension plans to the vote of stockholders. Thus,
the 152 such proxies filed in the 1950 calendar year may be compared
with 49 in 1949; 59 in 1948; 66 in 1947; and 75 in 1946. This increase
IS due largely to the negotiation of a number of plans recently on an
industry-wide basis.
Examination of Proxy Malerial

Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed in preliminary
form with the Commission, for its information and processing only,
8 On a fiscal year basis 1,788 sollcitatlons
were made in 1951 as compared with 1,668 in
1950.
"Follow-up material was used in 192 instances during the 1951 liscal year.

SEVENTEE~

~AL

REPORT

45

at least 10 days prior to the date the definitive copies are first sent or
given to security holders; and copies of the statement in definitive form
must be filed at the time proxy material is furnished to security
holders. The Commission's proxy examination work must be completed during this comparatively brief interval between the filing of
the material in its preliminary and definitive forms. Where a preliminary proxy statement fails to set forth information meeting the
disclosure standards of the statute and the regulation, the parties concerned are notified immediately to that effect and given an opportunity
to correct any such discrepancy before the definitive proxy statement
is prepared. Illustrations of changes made in proxy material as a
result of the Commission's examination procedure arising in actual
cases during the 1951 fiscal year are given below.
Oonsolidated financial statements required.-Under
the regulation
a proxy statement may incorporate by reference any financial statements contained in an annual report sent to security holders in connection with the same meeting as that to which the proxy statement
relates, provided such financial statements substantially meet the requirements of the Commission's regulations governing the form and
content of financial statements. A large grocery chain-store corporation, as a part of the preliminary proxy material relating to a proposal
to increase its authorized preferred stock, included the financial statements that had been used in its annual report to stockholders for the
preceding year. However, the accounts of three major subsidiaries,
one financing fixture and equipment purchases, the second purchasing
merchandise for the registrant, and the third operating a chain in
Canada, were not included in the consolidated financial statements in
that annual report, the accounts of the parent and certain other subsidiaries having been consolidated in those statements. The effect was
that neither a substantial amount of property and other assets used
in the registrant's business nor senior securities of the unconsolidated
subsidiaries were shown in the consolidated balance sheet proposed to
be submitted to stockholders with the proxy solicitation.
The staff took the position that in view of the importance of the
three unconsolidated subsidiaries to the integrated operations of the
registrant the financial statements to be made part of the proxy material to be furnished stockholders should be on a complete consolidated
basis. As a result the definitive proxy material as sent to stockholders
contained financial statements on that basis.
Oertain problems eoloed in accounting for acquisition of business
and a88et8.-Proxy statements prepared in connection with plans for
acquisition, merger or recapitalization of corporations frequently
raise special problems as to what financial statements will adequately
reveal the proposed action. For example, a steel manufacturing company in its offer to acquire the business and assets of another company
in a related business proposed to pay for the net assets to be acquired
with additional issues of its senior and junior capital shares in an
aggregate amount which the acquiring company considered represented fair value for the acquisition. These securities were to be
distributed to the holders of the senior and junior securities of the
company beinz acquired according to a fixed pro rata basis, thereby
effecting the dissolution of the company. The purchase price of the
assets being acquired, paid by the issuance of capital stock, was substantially in excess of the book value of the assets. This excess was

46

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

allocated to fixed assets since the amount was approximately equivalent to the difference between independent currently appraised values
and book values.
In the preliminary proxy material proposed to be submitted to the
stockholders of the respective companies, statements of earnings and
of assets, liabilities and capital of the respective companies were furnished in conventional form. However, the proposed data did not
readily demonstrate the impact of the acquisition upon the acquiring
company as affected (1) by the new capital structure and (2) by the
new valuation placed upon the fixed assets to be acquired. Specifically,
the stockholders would be unable to determine readily (1) the coverages of liquidating values and of dividend requirements of the preferred shares as increased, and (2) the earnings per share of the
common stock as increased and as affected by the increased amount
of the preferred stock. Accordingly, the respective companies were
requested by the staff to furnish in the proxy statements a pro forma
consolidating balance sheet giving effect to the recapitalization and
acquisition, together with a pro forma statement of profit and loss
for the year 1950 of both companies combined, calculating the income
and excess profits taxes under the Revenue Act of 1950 for the entire
year, and calculating depreciation charges upon the basis of the increase in valuation of the fixed assets. Also upon such request the
pro forma net income, applicable to common stock in the aggregate
and in per share amounts after provision for preferred stock dividends, was stated and accompanied by an explanation that this information was not necessarily indicative of the results of future
operations or the availability of net income for dividend purposes.
Oomplete financial statements required in order to show results of
significant corporate proposals.-A registrant engaged in real estate
operations submitted preliminary draft copies of proxy solicitation
material, without complete financial statements, seeking among other
matters authorization of stockholders to amend the company's certificate of incorporation so as to reduce the par value of capital stock
by a split-up from $10 per share to $1 per share; to reduce correspondingly the capital of the company from $4,255,690to $425,569;
to execute eighteen separate mortgages, together covering all of the
company's real properties and aggregating $5,000,000 in principal
amount to mature in 10 years, with interest at the rate of 4 percent
per annum; to distribute forthwith to stockholders the $5,000,000 of
mortgage proceeds and other funds of the company aggregating
$5,250,252. The company stated that financial statements had not
been included for the reason that they were not deemed material for
the exercise of prudent judgment in regard to the matters to be acted
upon at the meeting. The company had included a summary of the
balance sheet at the close of its last fiscal year and a table showing for
ten years the "net income after operating expenses, adjusted to exclude
interest on indebtedness, depreciation, and income taxes."
The first letter of comment issued by the Division of Corporation
Finance indicated the need to furnish to stockholders in this connection certified financial statements for three fiscal years, unaudited
statements of a more recent date, and a pro forma balance sheet as of
such recent date showing the effect of the proposed transactions covered by the proxy statement. The company was also requested to

SEVENTEENTH ~AL

REPORT

47

furnish to stockholders a complete summary of earnings for the last
ten fiscal years.
The most recent balance sheet indicated a stockholders' equity of
$6,236,210.30; and the pro forma balance sheet, as of the same date"
after giving effect to mortgaging of properties, reduction of capital
and distribution to stockholders, indicated a stockholders' equity of
$835,951.10. The table of "adjusted income" originally submitted
averaged $729,000 per year (with a minimum of $688,000 and maximum of $787,000) compared with interest and amortization on the
proposed mortgages of $385,000, which latter figure was changed to
$350,000 in the revised material. The revised summary of earnings
for ten years and six months afforded adequate material for analysis
of the effect of the change in capital structure of the company by
showing in separate columns "Rental and Other Income"; "Operative,
Admimstrative, and General Expense"; "Depreciation" (revealed as
being in excess of $200,000 per year); "Interest on Indebtedness"
(none in the last six months shown); "Income Taxes"; and "Net
Income."
Failure to disclose certain essential information including the names
of persons acquiring a controlling block of common stock from the
iS8Uer.-The registrant filed preliminary proxy soliciting material to
be used in connection with a forthcoming annual meeting at which it
was proposed (1) to vote upon a proposal to lease the registrant's
plants and equipment for a term of years to a corporation controlled
by an outside group and (2) to elect nine directors for the coming
year. Five directors were to be elected by holders of the registrant's
preferred stock because of defaults in the payment of dividends, and
four by holders of registrant's common stock. The management and
control of the registrant had been changed some months previously.
The financial position of the registrant was very weak due to continued
losses in its peacetime operations and large indebtedness which was
past due. The material indicated it was anticipated that within six
months there would be submitted to stockholders for their approval
a plan of recapitalization, including the issuance of a large block of
common stock, in exchange for the outstanding stock of the lessee
corporation. Such stock would -have represented control of the
registrant.
No disclosure was made of the names of the persons financially interested in the lessee corporation who might succeed to control of the
registrant. This and other deficiencies were brought to the attention
of the registrant, after which revisions of the preliminary soliciting
material were filed. The proposal to lease the plants was ultimately
abandoned, among other reasons because the registrant was unable
to obtain the required consents of its mortgage creditors. The revised material proposed a plan of recapitalization which involved the
issue of common stock for cash to the same outside group. The
obligation to purchase such additional stock was subject to various
material conditions which had to be met by the company. These proposals would have substantially reduced the interests of the old common and preferred stockholders, and would have given control of the
company to the outside group, who for the first time were named.
A few years earlier, the Commission had obtained an order enjoining
the central figure in this group from the purchase of certain securities
in violation of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Certain other

48

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

questionable activities of this individual had been brought to the
Commission's attention in the course of its earlier investigation of investment companies. Because of continued material deficiencies in
the revised proxy soliciting material, the Commission ordered a private
investigation under section 21 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. During the course of the investigation the registrant made
numerous revisions to reflect facts disclosed by the investigation.
The registrant apparently was reluctant, however, to disclose the
existence of the injunction against the principal promoter as well
as other adverse facts regarding him developed during the course
of the investigation.
Subsequently, the registrant abandoned the proposed plan of recapitalization, including the sale of common stock, and confined its
deferred annual meeting to the election of directors, for which a committee acting on behalf of holders of preferred stock had solicited
sufficient proxies to elect a majority of the board.
Problem arising in 'U8eof inventory reserves to equalize reported
inoome-r- The Commission's 14th Annual Report 9 referred to the adoption by the American Institute of Accountants of research bulletins
recommending that inventory reserves created in anticipation of
losses not yet incurred should not enter into the determination of
income. These bulletins assisted in correcting a troublesome practice
that had arisen during and immediately after World War II. While
this problem was largely corrected in recent years, it arose in the
1951fiscal year in connection with the examination of a proposed proxy
statement soliciting authority to dispose of all of the assets of that
part of the company's business to which the inventories in question
applied. The independent public accountants of this particular company, a leading processor of certain raw materials, had noted in their
certificate accompanying the registrant's first annual report following
the publication of the Institute's bulletins that the net income for the
fiscal year had benefited through return to income of previously created
reserves and that under recently accepted accounting principles the
amount should have been restored directly to surplus. That annual
report and the subsequent year's annual report submitted on the
same basis were amended at the request of the staff to eliminate the
Qualification in the certificate of the accountants and to return the
reserve directly to surplus.
Despite the fact that the Commission had required such amendment
of those annual reports, the company included in a preliminary
proxy filed in the 1951 fiscal year a summary of earnings for ten years
prepared on the original baSIS. In this summary the first seven years
reflected deductions for additions to the inventory reserve and the
years 1948 and 1949 reflected partial return of the reserves to income.
Results for 1950 were not furnished in this preliminary proxy material. When complete financial statements including a new summary
were then furnished at the instance of the Commission, it was discovered that while data for two of the years summarized, 1948 and
1949, were restated to conform to the amended annual reports, a
footnote was appended to the net profit item for the year 1947 which
read: ". . . after appropriation of $1,500,085-800 Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss." In the opinion of the Commission's staff,
â€¢ 14th Annual Report. page 110.

SEVENTEENTH

REPORT

which corresponds with the Institute's recommendation noted above,
the amount of $1,500,085 was an appropriation of surplus and not a
proper charge in the profit and loss statement.
Accordingly, the
issuer was advised that the net profit for the year in question should
be reported before making the $1,500,085 deduction, and that the footnote should be deleted. The issuer was further advised that, to the
extent that other deductions in prior years represented appropriations
of income similar to that made in 1947, the earnings summary should
be recast to show results for all years on a uniform basis.
As a result of the amendments secured in this case, the net profit
for each of the seven years 1941 through 1947 was reflected in the
summary as revised at a substantially higher figure, the effect of
which was to increase the net profit shown for the seven-year l?eriod
from approximately $7,000,000 to $12,000,000. That no losses III the
amount of this difference had been sustained over the period seems
clear by a statement in the definitive proxy material that the market
value of inventory early in 1951 was approximately $5,000,000 in
excess of (or about double) the book value, which value represented
cost under the last-in-first-out method of pricing.

misconduct on the part of the firm, its partners, officers, directors or
employees. To carry out these provisions of the Act, applications for
registration must be examined in the light of the information contained therein and information obtained from numerous other sources
available to the Commission in order to determine whether the firm
is entitled to registration for which it has applied. When it appears
that an applicant may be disqualified under such standards, proceedings are ordered by the Commission to determine whether on the
evidence adduced it IS consistent with public interest to permit registration. The applicant is, of course, given notice of the issues to be considered and afforded full opportunity to be heard thereon. Similar
procedures are followed in proceedings brought against registered
brokers and dealers to determine whether registration should be revoked or the firm suspended or expelled from membership in a national
securities exchange or association. The following tabulation reflects

As shown in the above table, there were pending at the beginning of
the fiscal year two proceedings to determine whether applications
for registration should be denied or granted, and five such proceedings were instituted during the year. Of these seven, four registrations were granted and the proceedings dismissed; two applicants
withdrew their applications; one proceeding remained pending at the
end of the year.
At the beginning of the fiscal year, there were 23 pending proceedings to revoke registration, 12 of which also involved consideration
of suspension or expulsion from the NASD. During the year, 92
revocation proceedings were instituted, three of which involved also
the question of suspension or expulsion from the NASD, and one
suspension or expulsion from an exchange. A total of 84 of the
proceedings instituted concerned the failure to file financial reports
as required by rule X-17A-5, and eight concerned alleged fraudulent conduct. A total of 93 revocation proceedings were decided during the year, leaving 22 pending at the end of the year.
In seven proceedings the Comnxission revoked registration on findings of fraudulent conduct prohibited by the Securities Act and the
Securities Exchange Act, including such frauds as misappropriation of customers' funds and securities, misrepresentations in the
sale of securities, manipulation of the market price of securities on
national securities exchanges, the sale of unregistered securities in
violation of section 5 of the Securities Act, false and fictitious entries
on books and records and filing of false financial reports with the
Commission.
Proceedings against W. F. Coley & Company, Inc., and Wade F.
Coley, its president and controlling stockholder, resulted in an order
revoking the registration of the firm, expelling the firm from the
NASD, and the finding that Wade F. Coley, personally, was the
cause of such order. ,. The Commission found that the firm, aided
and abetted by Coley, had misappropriated customers' securities and
funds~ had concealed such misappropriations by false or deficient
records, and had filed false financial reports with the Commission.
In proceedings against Mercer Hicks Corporation and Mercer Hicks,
its president and controlling stockholder, the Commission revoked
the registration of the firm, expelled it from the NASD, and found
Mercer Hicks, personally, a cause of such revocation and expulsion,

the respondents consenting thereto." On the respondents' admission
of the facts alleged, the Commission found that Mercer Hicks Corporation and Mercer Hicks, individually, had made false and misleading representations in the sale of the corporation's stock, that
purchasers were told that the corporation was being operated at profit
but were furnished with no financial data, and that purchasers were
not informed of the corporation's operating deficits or the fact that
dividends were paid out of capital surplus obtained from the sale of
the stock. The Commission also found that the corporation and Hicks
appropriated funds and securities held for customers and substituted
therefor the stock of the corporation, without the knowledge of these
customers.
It is customary, when adequate evidence of violations can be obtained in time, to institute court action promptly to enjoin further
violations, deferring until later consideration of other remedial or
punitive action. Thus in the instance of Mercer Hicks Corporation,
the Commission's action to revoke its broker-dealer registration was
instituted after the district court, Southern District of New York,
had enjoined the fraudulent acts and practices later alleged in the

revocation proceedings."
year, registration was revoked on findings of fraudulent conduct by
the registrants after a court had enjoined them from further
violations."
In proceedings resulting in the revocation of the broker-dealer
registration of Lawrence R. Leeby," the Commission rejected the contention that a broker-dealer, conducting a securities business as a sole
proprietor, may engage in "personal transactions" as distinguished
from "company transactions" without recording them on his business
books. This proceeding is also significant because it is the only
instance in which the Commission has twice revoked the registration
of a broker-dealer. Leeby first became registered in 1936. In 1943,
the Commission revoked his registration on findings of fraudulent
practices in the sale of oil royalties. In 1946, he again applied for
registration, and after hearings the Commission granted him the limited registration he requested. He was permitted to do business as a
broker, but his dealer activities were limited to the sale of investment
companies' shares.
On October 21, 1948, he petitioned the Commission to remove the
restriction with respect to his dealer activities so that he might do a
general securities business. At a hearing on his petition he testified

that he had fully complied with the conditions of 1946 registration
and had not effected any transactions as a dealer except in investment
companies' shares. Since an examination of his books and records
made by the Commission's staff reflected nothing to the contrary, the
Commission removed the restriction. When it was later discovered
that Leeby had purchased and sold Ribbonwriter shares during the
period when his registration as a dealer was limited to investment
companies' shares and that these transactions were not recorded on
his books, proceedings to revoke his registration were instituted.
During the hearings, he sought to defend the exclusion of the transactions in Ribbonwriter stock from his broker-dealer books on the
ground that these Were "personal transactions" unrelated to his
securities "business."
In its findings, however, the Commission held as artificial any
attempted distinction between "personal transactions" and "company
transactions" where the "company" is a sole-proprietorship, and held
that all securities transactions of the proprietor are required to be
recorded on his broker-dealer books whether they are for so-called
personal investment for what is termed "firm trading account" for
which business capital is employed. The Commission made the finding that Leeby's failure to enter his "personal" transactions in an
account on his broker-dealer books was in wilfull violation of the
bookkeeping rules prescribed for brokers and dealers under section
17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, and the further finding that
the representation in his application and testimony, in connection with
his 1948 petition for unconditional registration as a dealer, that he
had fully complied with the conditions of his limited registration was
false and misleading.
Broker-Dealer

Inspections

Section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act empowers the Commission to make periodic, special, and other examinations of the books
and records of brokers and dealers. Such inspections have become
the principal means by which the Commission detects and prevents
violations of law by brokers and dealers. Inspections are frequently
limited to a particular phase of the firm's business, but generally they
encompass examination of all characteristic activities.
During the fiscal year the Commission's regional offices, the staff
of which conducts these inspections, reported on 922 such examinations, 696 of which were inspections of NASD members. A.s in previous years, a substantial number of violations of the rules and
regulations were discovered, including non-compliance ~ith the
capital rule, the hypothecation rule, and Regulation T prescribed by
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. There were
a few instances of secret profits, a good many transactions in which
the reasonableness of the price to the customer in relation to current
market was questionable, and a fairly large number of infractions too
scattered to classify separately.
Consistent with accepted standards of administrative procedure,
those violations which appear to be inadvertent or the result of misinformation or innocent misinterpretation, and not "wilful," are
called to the attention of the firm involved to afford it an opportunity
to "put its house in order." Other remedies which may be invoked

54

COMMISSION

against violations are discussed in detail under the preceding caption
"Administrative Proceedings."
Investigations

Investigations of brokers and dealers stem from various sources.
When an inspection discloses conduct or practices the full facts with
reference to which must be obtained and analyzed to determine
whether any remedial or punitive action is necessary investigation is
promptly undertaken. Investigations are also made when complaints
from customers are received. Other investigations may be commenced as a result of information supplied by cooperating agencies
such as state securities commissions, securities exchanges and associations, or "better business bureaus." When investigations are completed and the evidence has been analyzed, the staff makes recommendations to the Commission for such further action as appears
appropriate. In some instances the recommendation may be for injunctive relief, in some for administrative action such as discussed
above and in some for notice, as contemplated by the Administrative Procedure Act to achieve compliance with the Act.

during the fiscal year.

Financial Reports

One of the Commission's rules, X-17A-5, requires brokers and
dealers to file financial reports each calendar year. During the 1951
fiscal year, 3,705 such reports were filed. Examination of the financial report filed by a broker-dealer affords the staff an opportunity
to determine whether, as of the date of the report, the firm is in compliance with the capital resuirements prescribed by rule X-15C3-1,
and if it is not, the firm is given an opportunity to bring its financial
condition up to the required standards. Failure to do so may, of
course, require more drastic measures to enforce the rule.
SUPERVISION OF NASD ACFIVITIES
Membership

At June 30, 1951, there were 2,846 members of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (NASD), the only national securities association registered as such with the Commission. This represented an increase of 62 members in the year as a result of 212 admissions to, and 150 terminations of, membership. At the same
date there were registered with NASD as registered representatives
30,922 individuals, including generally all partners, officers, traders,
salesmen and other persons employed by member firms in capacities

SEVENTEENTH ~AL

55

which involved their doing business directly with the public. This
represented an increase of 2,128 registrations during the year as a
result of 5,128 initial registrations or re-registrations and 3,000 terminations of registrations.
Disciplinary Actions

During the 1951 fiscal year the Commission received from the
NASD reports of final action in 22 disciplinary cases in which formal
complaints had been filed against members. One of these complaints
was dismissed on the finding by the NASD District Business Conduct Committee of initial jurisdiction that there had been no violation of the Rules of Fair Practice as alleged in the complaint. In the
remaining 21 cases the appropriate Business Conduct Committee
found that the members or registered representatives of the members
cited in the complaints, had acted in violation of the Rules of Fair
Practice and imposed various penalties as a consequence of those
infractions.
Of the 21 disciplinary decisions which included findings of violations against those named in the complaints, eight cases were directed
solely against member firms who were subjected to the following
penalties: Two member firms were expelled; two member firms were
each fined $500 and censured; one member firm was fined $300; one
member firm was fined $100 and censured; and two member firms were
censured.
In nine other cases findings of violations of the Rules of Fair Practice, and the consequent penalties, were directed not only against member firms but also against registered representatives of such members
who had been named, together with their employers, in the complaints.
One such case resulted III expulsion of the member firm involved and
revocation of the registration with the NASD as registered representative of one individual and suspension of such registration of two
other individuals. This decision, which had been affirmed by the
Board of Governors on appeal, was appealed to the Commission by
R. H. Johnson and Co., the member firm, and at the year-end was in
process before the Commission." In two unrelated cases the member
involved was expelled from the Association and the registration with
the NASD of two registered representatives of each of the two firms
were revoked." In another case both a member and a representative
of that member were each fined $500; in another, fines of $200 were
imposed both on the member and on the member's representatives.
The only other such case involving a fine resulted in a fine of $5,000
on the member firm, six months' suspension of registration of one representative, three months' suspension and a fine of $1,000 with respect
to another and three months' suspension and a fine of $100 with respect to a third representative. In three other cases against both

This appeal, pursuant to the provisions of section 15A (g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, operates as a stay of
the eft'ectlveness of the NASD's action pending the Commission's declslon. There was also
pending at the year-end, Its status not SUbstantially changed during the year, another
such appeal to the Commission from an NASD decision which imposed on Otis & Co., the
appellant, a two-year suspension from membership In NASD. This action arose from a
shtoCkoft'ering of kaiser-Fraser Corporation In 1948 as described In considerable detail In
t e Commission's 15th Annual Report, pages 73-77, and 16th Annual Report, pages 58-59.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

member firms and representatives of the firms, the firms were censured
and in addition the representatives were respectively suspended for 30
days, fined $100 and fined $25.
A third category of cases consisted of those in which a finding of
violations, and the imposition of penalties, was directed solely against
a representative of a member with a concurrent finding that the member had not acted in violation of the Rules of Fair Practice and dismissal of that portion of the complaint directed againt the member.
In this type of action revocation of the representative's registration
resulted in three cases and, in a fourth, the penalty was a five-year
suspension of registration.
The Commission continued its practice of referring to the NASD
for appropriate action facts disclosed in the course of its brokerdealer inspection program which tend to indicate possible violations
of the Association's Rules of Fair Practice, At the end of the last
fiscal year there were four such references in process before the Association and, in this year, ten additional references were made. At the
end of the year nine of these references were in process, reports of disposition having been received by the Commission from the Association on five of the cases. Four of these five cases were disposed of by
informal means without invoking formal complaint procedure; the
formal complaint case resulted in a fine of $100 and censure of the
member involved, as mentioned above.
Commission Review of Action on Membership

Under section 15A (b) (4) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
and NASD by-laws, except in cases where the Commission ap'proves or
directs admission to or continuance in membership as appropriate in the
public interest, no broker or dealer may hold NASD membership if he
controls a person who has been, among other things, expelled from a
registered securities association for violation of an association rule
prohibiting conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of
trade, or is subject to an order of the Commission revoking his registration or expelling him from NASD membership.
Pursuant to this authority, and with consideration to the affirmative recommendation of the Board of Governors of the NASD, the
Commission approved the admission to membership of O. H. Hecht,
who was under a disqualification arising from expulsion by and from
the NASD of Mutual Investments, Ltd., a broker-dealer firm of which
Hecht had been a partner, on findings that the firm had been guilty of
conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade." The
Commission also approved a similar petition by the NASD for the
continuance in NASD membership of Oscar F. Kraft & Co. while
controlling Carter Harrison Corbrey, who was under disqualification
as a consequence of expulsion from NASD membership and revocation of broker-dealer registration by the Commission."
During the year two other petitions were filed with the Commission
under this same section of the statute by or on behalf of firms seeking
to retain NASD membership while controlling a disqualified person.
Each of these petitions was withdrawn prior to a decision on the
merits by the Commission.

CHANCES IN RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS

.As stated elsewhere in this report, section 16 (b) of the Act
provides in general that where any director or officer of the issuer of
a listed and registered equity security or the beneficial owner of more
than 10 percent of any class of such security has realized any profit
from any purchase or sale, or sale and purchase, of any equity security
of the issuer, such profit inures to and may be recovered by the issuer,
or by any security holder acting in its behalf. The section authorizes
the Commission to adopt rules exempting therefrom any transactions
not comprehended within its purpose. Various rules adopted during
the 1951 fiscal year under this authority, after consideration of all
comments and suggestions invited and received in the premises, are
briefly described below.
Rule X-1BB-f. Exemption from sectioti 16 (b) of certain transactions by reaistered investment companies.- This new rule, in the
form of a revision of rule X-16B-1 which in its previous form had
become obsolete, exempts transactions which the Commission has, by
order entered pursuant to section 17 (b) of the Investment Company
Act, exempted from 17 (a) ofthat Act.
Rule X-16B-3. Exemption from section. 16 (b) of certain acquisitions of seouritiee under stock bonus 01' similar plans.-Rule
X-16B-3 was amended so as to exempt from section 16 (b) acquisitions
by directors or officers of securities received under certain types of
bonus, profit-sharing, retirement or similar plans not previously exempted by this rule. It should be noted that the rule exempts only
certain acquisitions of securities under plans of the types specified.
Sales of securities so acquired are not exempted by the rule and are,
therefore, within the purview of section 16 (b) of the Act if within six
months before or after such sales the director or officer effects other
acquisitions which can be matched against them.
Rule X -16B-5. Exemption from section 16 (b) of certain transactions in which securities are received by redeeming other eeouritiee>Â«
This new rule was adopted to exempt from the operation of section
16 (b) those transactions in which one security is surrendered for
another, where both the old and the new securities are substantially
and in practical effect equivalents and where the transaction does not
require the payment of any consideration.
Rule X-16B-6. Exemption of long-term profits incidenÂ» to sales
new rule grants
within six months of the eeercise of an option.-This
partial exemption with respect to profit which might otherwise be
deemed to have been realized and recoverable, where there is a purchase by an "insider" of an equity security pursuant to the exercise of
an option or a similar right and a sale of that equity security within
six months thereof. A statement of the considerations which led to
the adoption of this rule accompanied its promulgation in Securities
Exchange Act release No. 4509.
As set forth more fully in that statement, the Commission had been
aware for some time of a controversy concerning the proper method of
computing profits under section 16 (b) where there is a sale of an
equity security acquired pursuant to an option. The Act makes such
profits recoverable in private litigation, thus placing upon the courts
the ultimate responsibility for the interpretation of section 16 (b),
but gives the Commission, as pointed out above, responsibility for

58

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

exempting by rule transactions which it may determine to be "not
comprehended within the purposes of section 16 (b)."
Uncertainty as to just what profits would, as a matter of legal interpretation, be recoverable in the absence of a rule, as well as uncertainty whether the Commission should attempt by rule making to
affect pending litigation, had previously induced the Commission to
refrain from adopting such a rule. The Commission determined to
express its understanding of the relationship between such transactions and the underlying purpose of section 16 (b), as set forth in the
published statement; and to exercise its rule-making power in the
light of that understanding, as reflected in this new rule.
Rule X-160-3.
Exemption of sales of securities to be acquireds-Â«
The Commission adopted a new rule, designated rule X-16~,
exempting certain sales from the provisions of section 16 (c) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Section 16 (c) provides that it shall be unlawful for any beneficial
owner of more than 10 percent of any class of equity security registered on a national securities exchange, or a director or officer of the
issuer of such a security, to sell any equity security of the issuer (other
than an exempted security), (1) if he does not own the security sold,
or (2) if, owning the security, he does not either deliver it within 20
days or deposit it in the mails or other usual channels of transportation within five days, unless he was unable to do so nothwithstanding
the exercise of good faith or it would cause undue inconvenience or
expense.
The purpose of the rule is to permit persons who are entitled to
receive a security "when issued" or "when distributed" as an incident
of ownership of another security to sell the new securit;v subject to the
same restrictions as would apply if the "when issued' or "when distributed" security were already in their possession. This rule assumes,
of course, that the "when issued" or "when distributed" sale is otherwise lawful under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
Revised Form U5S.-During the fiscal year the Commission adopted
substantial revisions in the annual reporting requirements applicable
to public utility holding companies registered under the Public Utility
Holding Company Act of 1935.21
The object of these changes was to reduce the over-all reporting
requirements for registered holding companies under both the 1935
Act and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. A new Form U5S
was promulgated as the annual report form for registered holding
companies. The Commission has abolished Form U-14-3, heretofore required to be filed annually under the 1935 Act by registered
holding companies, and Forms U5-K and U5-MD which registered
holding companies formerly had the option of filing in lieu of Form
10-K under section 13 or 15 (d) of the 1934 Act. Whereas each
registered holding company in a system has heretofore been required
to file separate annual reports on Form U5S, the revised requirements provide that only one annual report shall be filed by the top
registered holding company for all registered holding companies in
the system. Registered holding companies required to file annual

reports under Section 13 or 15 (d) of the 1934Act (formerly on Form

LITIGATION UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT
Brokers and Dealers

Although the Commission's sanctions against brokers and dealers
violating the Securities Acts include administrative proceedings and
references to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution, it is
often necessary to seek court injunctions to afford immediate protection to investors.
In S. E. O. v. Lloyd Beuersdorf." the Commission obtained a final
judgment by consent enjoining the defendant from further violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions. The Commission
charged that he was engaging in a broker-dealer business without
having registered with the Commission in accordance with section
15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act.
In S. E. O. v. Aamms &} Oompany 23 during the fiscal year the individual defendants consented to the entry of a judgment restraining
them from further violations of the fraud provisions of the Securities
Act and of the Securities Exchange Act. A similar judgment was
entered against Adams & Company by default. In that case a temporary receiver had been appointed for the protection of customers
during the previous fiscal year when the Commission had filed its
complaint. The complaint had charged that the defendant Adams
& Company, a registered broker-dealer, and three of its officers violated the fraud provisions of both the Securities Act and the Securities Exchange Act in soliciting and accepting customers' orders for
the purchase and sale of securities while its liabilities exceeded its
assets; in inducing customers to purchase securities by representing that such securities would be held in safekeeping when~ in fact,
the securities were being hypothecated to secure loans made to the
firm; and in soliciting customers to purchase securities and accepting
payment therefor upon the representation that the securities would
be delivered when, in fact, the defendants used the customers' money
for their own benefit.
In 8. E. O. v. Frank 8. Kelly,24 the Commission's complaint sought
to enjoin the defandant, a registered broker-dealer, from further violations of certain of the fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. The complaint charged that the defendant effected
transactions in securities for the accounts of customers and, as a part
of such business, solicited and accepted orders from customers for the
purchase of when-issued securities, using money received from customers to purchase securities for hIS own account and for other purposes without disclosing that fact to his customers. The court granted
a temporary restraining order and appointed a receiver for the defendant. Subsequently, the defendant consented to a final injunction.
In 8. E. O. v. Howard V. Hansell,25 the defendant consented to the

entry of a final judgment enjoining him from further violations of
the anti-manipulative
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act.
The Commission's complaint charged that the defendant, in trading
in securities on the New York Stock Exchange and the New York
Curb Exchange, induced other persons to purchase said stock by raising the market price of such stocks by means of purchasing the stock
through other persons, recommending the stock to brokerage firms
and friends on the representation that the stocks would increase in
price, asking brokerage firms and friends to purchase the stock as
a favor to him and, in connection with one of the stocks, engaged a
public relations man to induce brokerage firms and others to purchase
such securities. Subsequently, Hansell's broker-dealer registration
was revoked.
Injunctive action was also brought against Mercer Hicks and Mercer
Hicks Oorporation, a broker-dealer, for alleged violations of the Securities Act of 1933. This case is discussed above at pages 51 and 52.
Amicus Curiae Cases

In addition to the cases in which it is a party, the Commission frequently participates as amicus curiae upon Important questions of law,
but not on factual issues, arising in suits between private parties involving construction of the Acts administered.
An important issue involved in all of the private actions in which
the Commission participated as amicus curiae under section 10 (b)
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and rule X-10B-5 thereunder
during the past year is whether that section and rule are applicable
to transactions in securities not traded by professionals on the ex-changes or in the over-the-counter markets of brokers and dealers.
The Commission has repeatedly expressed the view that the section
and rule are applicable to such transactions.
The Commission's view
was upheld in J'uly 1950 by the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania in Robinson v. Difford.26 The question, among others, is also involved in Speed v. Transamerica Oorp.,21
Pratt v. Robinson,2S and Northern Trust 00. v. ES8ane88 Theatres
Oorp.,29all of which were pending at the close of the fiscal year.
In the Fratt and Northern Trust 00. cases, the Commission also
expressed the view that the applicable statute of limitations in an
action for damages for the violation of rule X-10B-5 is that of the
state of the forum. Moreover, in the Northern Trust 00. case the
Commission presented argument to the following effect: (1) that
section 10 (b) and rule X-10B-5 apply to intrastate transactions in
securities involving the use of the mails, irrespective of whether the
securities are registered for trading on an exchange or whether the
issuer conducts an interstate business, (2) that under rule X-10B-5
it is sufficient that the mails or facilities of interstate commerce are
used in connection with a particular sale or purchase of securities,
and that it is not necessary that misrepresentations
or misleading
statements be communicated through the mails or facilities of interstate commerce, and (3) that rule X-10B-5 was not rendered inapplicable to the securities purchases in that case by virtue of the fact, if
established, that the purchases were made pursuant to conditions reâ€¢â€¢ 92 F. Supp. 145.

specting directors' and shareholders' consent contained in an agreement and corporate by-law predating the rule.
The Commission also participated during the past fiscal year as
amicus curiae in a number of cases which involved a construction of
section 16 (b) of the Act, wherein there is accorded to a corporation
the right to recover profits realized by officers,directors or large stock.
holders from purchases and sales or sales and purchases of the corporation's equity securities within a six months' period. In all of
these cases, the courts were concerned with the problem of computing
the profits which might be recovered by or for the particular corporation involved.
In Steinberg v, Sharpe, et al.,1l()a stockholder of Bendix Home Appliances, Inc., sued an officer of the company, to recover profits that
the officer allegedly made in the sale of certain shares of stock which
he had purchased less than six months before. The securities had
been purchased by the defendant pursuant to earlier employment
agreements which allowed him to buy a specific number of Bendix
shares at a specified price which was lower than the market price.
The plaintiff claimed $11,571.20,the difference between the sales price
and the cash actually paid under the terms of the option contracts.
Recognizing, however, that the option itself had certain values, Judge
Medina concluded that the cost basis of the stock was the cash actually
paid pursuant to the option plus the value of the option on the date
that it accrued and therefore allowed a judgment for the plaintiff in
the amount of the difference between the sale price and the market
price of the stock on the date the option accrued. The Commission had urged the conclusion reached by the court. On appeal,
the Commission filed a memorandum in support of the findings of the
district court and the court of appeals rendered per curiam a memorandum opinion affirming the decision of the lower court."
In Blau v, Hodgkinson, 32 et al., a security holder of Federated
Department Stores brought an action to recover profits realized by
directors of the company as a result of certain transactions in the
company's securities. One of the defendants, acting pursuant to a
stock warrant granted to him on October 2, 1944, had purchased a
number of Federated's common shares at substantially less than the
market price and then sold them within 6 months at the current market price. On May 24 1951, the Commission filed a memorandum
wherein it argued that the new rule X-16B-6,33 effective since November 30, 1950, should be applied in computing the cost basis of the
securities, rather than the formula used in the Steinberg case. Under
that rule, the recovery would be much less than that claimed by the
plaintiff. The application of the rule was attacked on the ground
that its retroactive feature was unconstitutional.
The Commission
also urged that an earlier payment by the defendant of less than that
owed to the corporation was immaterial, the corporation being unable
to satisfy a claim so as to prevent stockholders' actions arising under
section 16 (b) ; and that the acquisition, by other defendants, of shares
of Federated's common stock by the exchange of their holdings in
Federated's subsidiaries for shares in Federated, would constitute a
"purchase" of stock within the meaning of section 16 (b). After the

close of the fiscal year, the court rendered a decision upholding the
Commission's contentions.
The case of Gratz, et al. v, Olaughton84 reaffirmed the principle of
computation established in Smolouie v, Delendo Oorporatioa 35 to the
effect that, in the case of trading subject to section 16 (b), maximum
profits are required to be returned to the corporation. The court also
upheld the Commission's contention that a proper venue was New
York where the securities were traded on the New York Stock Exchange, as well as in a district where the defendant is found or is
an inhabitant or transacts business. Certiorari was denied by the
Supreme Court.
In Rattner v, Lehman, et al.,36the question arose as to what portion
of the profits of a partnership earned by trading in the securities of
a corporation in which one of the partners was a director, was recoverable. It was decided that the partnership's profits, except for
the director's proportionate share, could not be recovered by the corporation. An appeal was taken subsequent to the close of the fiscal
year. Similar problems were involved in Euersharp, Inc., et al. v.
Robbins,s1 but negotiations between the parties resulted in a settlement
of the case.
PART m
ADMINISTRATION OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY HOLDING
COMPANY ACT OF 1935
The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 was passed by
the Seventy-fourth Congress following an extensive investigation by
the Federal Trade Commission. That investigation disclosed a variety of abuses in public-utility holding company finance and operations, the more significant of which are enumerated in section 1 (b)
of the act: (1) Inadequate disclosure to investors of the information
necessary to appraise the financial position and earning power of the
companies whose securities they purchase; (2) the issuance of securities against fictitious and unsound values; (3) the overloading
of operating companies with debt and fixed charges thus tending
to prevent voluntary rate reductions; (4) the imposition of excessive
charges upon operating companies for various services such as mansgement, supervision of construction and the purchase of supplies
and equipment; (5) the control by holding companies of the accounting practices and rate, dividend and other policies of their operating
subsidiaries so as to complicate or obstruct State regulation; (6) the
control of subsidiary holding companies and operating companies
through disproportionately small investment; (7) the extension of

holding company systems without relation to economy of operations
or to the integration and coordination of related properties.
In this section the Congress expressly stated that it was the policy
of the act, in accordance with which all other sections are to be construed, to meet the problems and eliminate the evils enumerated above.
The regulatory provisions of the Holding Company Act fall principally into three basic categories: (1) Those designed to bring about
geographical integration and the financial and corporate simplification of public-utility holding company systems; (2) the day-to-day
surveillance of the financing, servicing arrangements, intercompany
transactions and other operations of those registered holding company groups which will continue under the active regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission as integrated regional utility systems; and
(3) miscellaneous provisions of the act, not concerned with regulation of the continuing systems, but designed principally to control
the growth of additional holding company situations. The act does
not confer any rate-making authority upon the Commission; in the
over-all its purpose is not to conflict with but to supplement and
strengthen State regulation.
INTEGRATION AND SIMPLIFICATION-QVER-AIL

SUMMARY

By the time the statute was enacted in 1935, the holding company
device had attained a position of dominance over the major portion of
the electric and gas utility industry of the country. Fifteen holding
companies controlled 80 percent of all electric energy generation; 20
controlled 98.5 percent of all transmission of electric energy across
State lines; and 11 controlled 80 percent of all natural gas pipeline
mileage. The properties acquired by these vast combinations, not only
in the utility field, but also in many other types of business, were frequently widely scattered and bore little or no functional relationship
to one another. The over-all impact of the act upon this structure has
been reflected in the return to independent ownership of large numbers of electric and gas utility and other utility companies, the elimination of large numbers of multi-tiered holding companies, the consolidation of many corporations, and the dissolution of many others.
At one time or another from June 15,1938, to June 30,1951, a total
of 2,175 companies have been subject to the active regulatory jurisdiction of the Commission as components of registered holding company systems. Of this number 211 were holding companies, 925 were
electric or gas utility companies, and 1,039 were utilities other than
electric or gas and a wide variety of other enterprises. The latter
included brick works, ice plants, movie theatres, laundries, and even
a baseball club. By the close of the past fiscal year there were but
444 companies subject to regulation, including only 64 holding companies, 195 electric and gas utilities, and 185 non-utility companies.
The following tables summarize these developments.

An even more revealing aspect of this achievement is the elimination from the national scene of holding company scatteration, stretching in some instances from coast to coast and from the Canadian border to the Gulf. This drastic realignment is reflected in the following
table setting forth the number of states in which registered holding
company systems conducted utility. operations as of July 1, 1940, when
the section 11 program was getting under way, and as of June 30,
1951. Upon completion of section 11 cases now in progress, the latter
figures will be reduced still further.

I

While the scaling down of holding company systems during the
past 15 years has been spectacular, the properties subject to the act
on June 30, 1951, continued to represent an Important segment of the
electric and gas utility industries of the nation. As of that date, there
were registered with the Commission 40 holding company systems
with aggregate system assets of approximately $12,913,000,000, before
deduction of valuation reserves. These figures may be compared with
4'6 registered systems and assets of $12,822,000,000 on June 30, 1950.
The net increase of $91,000,000 during the year despite divestments
of $104,782,000 is accounted for by the continuing growth of the industry. This high rate of expansion of plant facilities was occasioned
initially by the almost uninterrupted increase in business activity since
the close of World War II and more recently by the defense expenditures touched off by the Korean conflict. It is not expected to diminish
to any great extent in the immediate years ahead.
The release from active regulatory jurisdiction of 1,731 corporate
entities, however, falls far short of accounting for all of the progress
achieved in the integration and simplification of holding company
systems under section 11 of the act. From December 1, 1935, to June
30, 1951, 240 companies with aggregate assets of $6,099,111,000, before
deduction of valuation reserves, have been divested by holding com-

The great bulk of these companies and properties represents yarts of
holding company systems, such as American Gas and Electric Company, which either have achieved or are expected to achieve full compliance with the geographical integration and corporate simplification
requirements of the act. It is not yet possible to calculate the final
results of all section 11 problems which remain to be solved, but it is
estimated that approximately 20 holding companies will emerge as
streamlined, regional systems with some 250 companies and aggregate assets of $7,000,000,000, before deduction of valuation reserves.
In addition there will be a number of other systems, such as Texas
Utilities Company, which not only have complied with the standards
of section 11, but also qualify for exemption under section 3 from
nearly all of the provisions of the act.
In addition to the drastic simplification of complicated corporate
superstructures and the nation-wide realignment of utilities on an
efficient, integrated, regional basis, the financial integrity of the industry has been greatl! strengthened and utility investors have received
"down-to-the-rails' income-paying securities of sound utility enterprises.
Operating utilities, which have been subject to the active regulatory
jurisdiction of the Commission, have removed $1,500,000,000of inflationary items from their property accounts as a result of the combined
efforts of this Commission, the Federal Power Commission, and the
various State commissions. Assuming an average allowed rate of

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

return for rate-making purposes of 6 percent, this represents an aggregate annual saving to consumers of $90,000,000and, in addition, has
removed fictitious values which were misleading to investors.
Depreciation accruals and depreciation reserves have also been increased to more adequate levels thus strengthening the over-all asset
protection of security holders. Summary data for all Class A and B
electric utilities show an increase in depreciation and amortization
reserves from 11.6 percent of total utility plant in 1938 to 20.5 percent
at the close of 1950.1 Significant as this increase is, these figures do
not reflect the full improvement-the
earlier figure being weighted
by the large metropolitan companies most of whom had adequate
reserves even at that time, while the latter figure relates to properties
a substantial proportion of which has been added during the past
decade and therefore possessing a much longer anticipated life than
the relatively old plant which the industry possessed in 1938, comparatively little capacity having been added during the depression
years.
Despite the drastic elimination of inflationary items from plant
accounts and increases in depreciation reserves, both of which tended
to reduce common stock equity to an actual investment basis, the capital
structures of many companies have undergone substantial improvement.
An adequate equity cushion to absorb the vagaries of business conditions is an important attribute of a good security. A computation
has been made of the capital ratios of 18 electric utility companies released from Commission jurisdiction showing the marked improvement from 1940 to the date of release in the period 1946-48.2 As of
1940,and after adjustment for plant write-up eliminations, these companies had an average debt ratio of 61 percent, preferred stock 22
percent, and common stock and surplus of 17 percent. At the close
of the year of their respective divestments, the average proportion of
debt was reduced to 55 percent, preferred stock 16 percent, and common stock and surplus had increased to 29 percent.
The generally excellent financial condition of the electric and gas
utility mdustries at the present time is indicated by the average capitalization percentages of the Class A and Class B electric utilities and
straight natural gas operating utilities as of December 31, 1950, set
forth in the following table:

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

One of the most unhealthy abuses uncovered by the Federal Trade
Commission in its exhaustive investigation of holding company practices was the pyramiding device which enabled a few individuals to
acquire control of large sections of the gas and electric utility industry.
The real investors in the system who supplied the capital for the
growth of the industry were effectively disfranchised by the pyramiding of holdings, and by such devices as voting trusts, the control of
proxy machinery, interlocking directors and officers,management contracts, etc. This inequitable distribution of voting power was one of
the evils which section 11 (b) (2) of the act was designed to eliminate.
It led to excessive leverage and made it practically impossible for a
security holder near the top of the pyramided structure to evaluate
his holdings or to estimate the impact upon him of a slight change in
the earnings of the underlying operating companies. Investors in
the holding companies were in effect trading on the equity or buying
on margin. Sometimes they made substantial profits during the
1920-1929 period of rising markets; but after the stock market crash
of 1929 they had to pay dearly. Prior to the passage of the act in
1935,holding companies such as Foshay Company, Middle West Utilities Company, Tri-Utilities Corporation, Atlantic Gas and Electric
Corporation, American Commonwealth Power Corporation, Utilities
Power and Light Corporation, North American Gas and Electric Company, Midland United Company, Midland Utilities Company, Standard Gas and Electric Company, Associated Gas and Electric Company,
etc., were either in acute distress or in bankruptcy or receivership.
The failure of the pyramiding device is illustrated graphically in
the fate of investors who placed their funds in "preferred" stocks of
holding companies. As of December 31, 1940,3preferred stocks of
holding companies had a total face value (on the basis of involuntary
liquidation preference) of $2,501,723,000; of this total, more than
half, or $1,442,168,000were in default. The total outstanding arrears
on holding company preferred stocks, as of this date, aggregated
approximately $476,000,000.
Mismanagement and exploitation of operating companies by holding companies, through excessive service charges, excessive common
stock dividends, upstream loans, other extortionate inter-company
transactions, and an excessive proportion of senior securities, led to
serious defaults even on operating company preferred stocks. Of
preferred stocks of operating companies in holding company systems
totaling $1,658,677,000 (involuntary liquidation preference) at December 31, 1940, approximately $453,434,000were in default. Total
outstanding arrears on such operating company preferred stocks
aggregated $165,176,000.
By June 30,1951, this condition had been largely cured and, at the
operating company level, there are virtually no preferred dividend
arrearages or defaults on indebtedness in the electric and gas utility
industries today. Furthermore, both industries have been able to
finance successfully a post-war expansion program of unpredecented
proportions now running at over $2,500,000,000per year.
There have been some securities, of course, which never had any
real basis of value even at the time of their original issuance, and quite
â€¢ Because of the delay In registration, the Commission was not In a position to tabulate
figures for registered companies for several years after the act was passed. It Is fair to
say that enforcement of section 11 of the act did not really commence untU about 1940.

naturally these received no participation in the final stages of reorganization of the holding company systems. On the whole, however,
most holders of the junior and senior securities of holding companies
not only have not lost in the reorganization and realignment process,
but they have reaped substantial gains in the bargain.
Perhaps the best means of illustrating this is to examine the situations with respect to some of the larger holding company systems
which have undergone drastic reorganization, including, in some instances, dissolution of the holding company. The following table
shows the market values of their common stocks as of the date when
each such holding company registered under the act, and of a recent
date, September 24,1951. In the table the figure for the earlier of the
two dates represents the market price per share of common stock multiplied by the number of common shares then outstanding.
The
figures relating to the current date represent the market price per
common share as of such date multiplied by the number of common
shares then outstanding (excluding additional shares, if any, issued
between the two dates), plus (1) the amounts of cash distributions of
capital to the holders of such shares; (2) the market values, as of the
current date, of portfolio securities distributed to the common stockholders as capital distributions
(excluding dividends in kind distributed in lieu of ordinary cash dividends);
(3) the excess of the
current market value of portfolio securities offered to security holders
on rights over the price at which such rights could have been exercised by the security holders; and minus (4) amounts paid to the holding company by the common stockholders, in several instances, directly
in cash or indirectly as withheld dividends, in order to procure a
capital distribution.
The table also sets forth comparative increases
in the Dow Jones Utilities Averages and the Dow Jones Composite
Averages (based on industrials, rails and utilities).
As noted, the percentages of increase in market values. of the common
stocks listed in the table are derived from a comparison of market
values obtaining at different dates of registration with those obtaining
at a single current date. In some cases, general market conditions
varied materially at the different registration dates, as indicated by
the varying Dow Jones index figures. Accordingly, the comparative
performances of these common stocks should not be measured against
one another. Rather, they should be compared with the performance')
of the Dow Jones index figures for the same periods of time, thereby
eliminating the effects of general market improvement during such
periods.
.
It is quite apparent from the foregoing table that common stockholders of holding companies have generally benefited from the reorganizations accomplished pursuant to section 11 of the Holding
Company Act. The lower percentage increases in some cases may be
explained, at least in part, by the relatively better flnancial-condition
of those systems at the time of registration.
The benefits of reorganization, however, have not been limited only
to common stockholders.
Senior security holders have likewise been
materially aided by these same reorganizations.
To demonstrate this,
there is tabulated below the market values of the debt securities and
preferred stocks of these same holding companies as at the dates the
companies registered under the act, and the capital distributions of
cash and securities, taken at market values as at September 24, 1951,

During the past fiscal year the program of enforcement of the integration and simplification requirements of section 11 has continued
unabated.
A major portion of this streamlining and realignment
process which has contributed so much to the revitalization of the
utility industry is now complete and many of the accomplishments of
the past year represent the final culmination of several previous years
of work. For example, National Power & Light Company completed
the divestment of its subsidiary companies and is no longer a registered
holding company. Reorganization of Washington Gas and Electric
Company was effected in the fall of 1950 with the divestment of its
holdings in Southern Utah Power Company through distribution of
the common shares to its bond holders and general creditors. After
five years of intermittent proceedings under section 11 (b) (2), Eastern Gas & Fuel Associates consummated its financial reorganization
plan, and its parent holding company, Koppers Company, Inc., has
reduced its stockholdings in Eastern to less than 5 percent. Long
Island Lighting Company also completed its reorganization into a
single operating company and, since the close of the fiscal year, has
been granted an order under section 5 (d) thereby ceasing to be a
registered holding company. Another accomplishment of the year
was the successful reorganization of Pittsburgh Railways Company
with the newly reorgamzed company replacing more than 50 predecessor companies.'

REPORT

The number and asset volume of divestments for the past fiscal year
was substantially smaller than for the previous period which had
witnessed the consummation of reorganization and dissolution plans
in several of the largest systems. A decline in the volume of divestments can be expected as the work of integration and simplification
nears completion. During fiscal year 1951, 16 companies with assets
of $103,740,000were divested and are no longer subject to the Holding
Company Act. In comparison, 78 companies with assets of $2,231,000,000 were divested in the preceding year.
Despite the overall progress witnessed during the past 15 years,
however, a substantial volume of work remains to be accomplished.
Final disposition is yet to be worked out with respect to nearly
200 companies with aggregate assets of almost $6,000,000,000.5
Among the systems which still presented major section II problems
on June 30, 1951,were the followmg :
American Natural Gas Company (retainability of Milwaukee
Solvay Coke Company).
American Power & Light Company (disposition of Washington
Water Power Company and Portland Gas & Coke Company).
Central Public Utility Corporation (merger of Consolidated
Electric & Gas Company into Central Public Utility Corporation and other problems).
Cities Service Company (simplification of the corporate structure
of Arkansas Natural Gas Company and redistribution of voting
power among its security holders; retainability of other gas
utility properties in the Cities Service system).
Eastern Utilities Associates (reorganization of the system).

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

compliance with section 11 during the past fiscal year is set forth in
the following summary descriptions.
American Power & Light Company

On August 22, 1942, American Power & Light Company ("American") then a subholdin& company subsidiary of Electric Bond and
Share Company ("Bond and Share"), was ordered to dissolve, because its existence constituted an undue and unnecessary complexity
in the Bond and Share system. At the time of the issuance of this
dissolution order American controlled directly or indirectly 35 subsidiaries, 16 of which were public utility companies. American's
capital structure then consisted of long term debt, two classes of cumulative preferred stock with heavy dividend arrearages, and common
stock. By the beginning of the fiscal year American had completed
the major phases of its program of compliance with section 11. The
steps taken are reported in the 15th and 16th Annual Reports. At
present American controls only two utility subsidiaries, The Washington Water Power Company ("Washington") and Portland Gas &
Coke Company ("Portland").
On February 15, 1951, American notified the Commission of its intention to negotiate for the sale of either the common stocks or the
utility assets of Washington to Public Utility Districts located in the
State of Washington. American was prevented from consummating
the proposed sale, however, by the issuance of a decree by the Superior
Court of the State of Washington on March 28,1951, prohibiting the
Public Utility Districts from acquiring the common stock of Washington under the proposed transaction.
Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year American filed a section
11 (e) plan proposing a cash distribution of $2 per share to each of its
common stockholders. In setting a hearing date on this new proposal the Commission specified that certain additional issues were to
be considered. These issues include (a) what further steps should be
taken by American in order to comply with the Commission's order

Portland, the other utility subsidiary of American, has had on file
with the Commission an extensive plan of reorganization which would
materially reduce the interest of American in this enterprise. After

American & Foreign Power Company, Inc.

American & Foreign Power Company, Inc., ("Foreign Power"),
is a sub-holding company in the Electric Bond and Share Company
("Bond and Share") system. It controls a mutual service company
and more than 60 holding and operating utility companies located
throughout Central and South America, Cuba, Mexico, and India.
Since the operations of all of Foreign Power's subsidiaries are outside
of the United States, the Commission's principal concern is with respect to simplification of the company's corporate structure and its
relationship to its parent, Bond and Share. Foreign Power's capital
structure at December 31, 1950, consisted of debentures, notes payable
to Bond and Share, notes payable to banks, three classes of preferred
stock with dividend arrearages aggregating more than 433 million
dollars, common stock and option warrants.
Foreign Power and Bond and Share jointly filed a plan for the
reorganization of the former in October 1944, which after extensive
hearings and amendments was approved by the Commission on November 19, 1947." The plan was subsequently approved by the United
States District Court for the District of Maine but the company was
unable to effectuate the financing necessary to consummate the plan.
For this reason both the district court and the Commission subsequently vacated their orders approving it. On May 2, 1949,the Commission issued an order pursuant to section 11 (b) (2) reguiring Bond
and Share and Foreign Power to take steps to reorganize the latter
company in such a manner that its resulting capital structure would
consist only of common stock plus such an amount of debt as would
meet the applicable standards of the act.'â€¢

On January 16, 1951, Foreign Power, joined by Bond and Share,
filed a new plan of reorganization under section 11 (e) of the act,"
Extensive hearings were held during the fiscal year. Shortly after
the close of the year, and after extensive negotiations between the
companies and the organized security holders' committees who have
appeared in the proceedings, a compromise was agreed to and an
amendment to the plan was filed reflecting that compromise. The
plan, as amended, provides for the following allocations for security
holders other than Bond and Share; for each share of $7 Preferred
stock-$90 principal amount of new 4.8 percent Junior Debentures
and 3.75 shares of new common stock; for each share of $6 Preferred
stock-$80 principal amount of new 4.8 percent Junior Debentures
and three shares of new common stock; for each share of Second Preferred stock, Series (A) $7-0.85 of a share of new common stock; for
each share of outstanding common stock-1/50th of a share of new
common stock.
The option warrants are to be cancelled. Bond and Share would
receive 3,856,723shares (55.7 percent) of the new common stock for its
present holdings of Foreign Power securities, including $49,500,000

Cities Service Company

Cities Service Company ("Cities") at the time of its registration
in 1941 was the top holding company in a system containing 125
companies of which 4~ were electric and gas utility companies. Consolidated assets totaled approximately one billion dollars. This system owned or operated properties in each of the 48 States and in
several foreign countries. Utility properties were held by three subholding companies, Cities Service Power & Light Company, Federal
Light & Traction Co. and Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., each controlling one or more utility systems.
In proceedings under section 11 (b) of the act the Commission
found that Cities should be limited in Its operations to those of a single
integrated gas utility system and required the disposition of its other
interests," However, Cities expressed a desire to retain instead its
non-utility businesses and, accordingly, the Commission modified its
section 11 (b) (]) order so as to permit Cities to effectuate compliance
by disposing of all of its utility interests,"
Cities Service Power & Light Company was liquidated and dissolved in August 1946, and its portfolio holdings were at that time
transferred to Cities. Federal Light & Traction Company had also
substantially completed liquidation proceedings.
On February 9, 1949, the Commission instituted proceedings with
respect to Arkansas Natural Gas Corp., the third subholding company, and Cities under section 11 (b) (2) and other sections of the
act raising issues among others, with respect to the corporate structure of Arkansas Natural, distribution of voting power among its
security holders, and with respect to the organization and history of
Arkansas Natural and the relation of Cities Service thereto." Arkansas Natural filed a plan under section 11 (e) on January 26, 1950,
desi~ned to effectuate compliance with the requirements of section
11 (0) .15 It provided, among other things, for simplification of the
company's corporate structure and for the disposition by Arkansas
Natural Gas, as a partial liquidating dividend, of its stockholdings in
Arkansas-Louisiana Gas Company. Its other subsidiary, Arkansas
Fuel Oil Company, will be merged into Arkansas Natural Gas. The
plan treats the holdings of Cities on the same basis as the holdings of
the public security holders in Arkansas Natural Gas. One of the
issues presently being considered in connection with the fairness of
the proposal is whether there is any basis for requiring the subordination of the interest of Cities or of any other stockholder to the interests
of other security holders -
of Arkansas Natural Gas. .A number of
hearings have been held, but at the close of the fiscal year the record
had not been completed.
Cities consummated the simplification of its capital structure in
1947, and eliminated three series of preferred and preference stocks

with accumulated dividend arrears of approximately $50,000,000.
Since that time it has disposed of its direct interest in the common
stock of several utilities including Public Service Company of New
Mexico, Ohio Public Service Company and The Toledo Edison Company, applying the proceeds derived from the sales of these holdings
to the reduction of its debenture indebtedness.
At the close of the
fiscal ~ear the Cities system included 59 corporate entities. However,
of this number only seven companies were engaged in utility
operations.
Eastern Utilities Associates

Eastern Vtilities Associates ("EVA:') is a Massachusetts voluntary
association having three direct subsidiary companies, Blackstone Valley Gas & Electric Company ("Blackstone"), Brockton Edison Company ("Brockton") and Fall River Electric Light Company ("Fall
River") and one indirect generating subsidiary company, Montaup
Electric Company ("Montaup").
During the past fiscal year the
corporate changes and expansion program of this system were closely
associated with the major reorganization plan now on file with the
Commission.
After extensive proceedings, the Commission issued an order under
section 11 (b) on April 4, 1950, which provided, in part, that EVA
shall, within one year, terminate its existence and distribute its assets
to its shareholders pursuant to a fair and equitable plan or, within one
year, acquire a minimum of 90 percent of the outstanding common
stock of all of its subsidiary companies and reclassify its common and
convertible shares into a single class of stock. The order further
provided, in effect, that in the event of the adoption of the latter
alternative, EVA, within the one year period, would sever its ownership or control of the gas utility properties owned by Blackstone."
On May 17, 1950, EVA filed its reorganization plan under section
11 (e) for the purpose of complying with this order. After public
hearings, step 1 of the plan was approved by the Commission on
August 17,1950.17 EVA borrowed $9,094,000 on short term promissory notes and, with the proceeds, acquired from the New England
Electric system its interest in Fall River consisting of 118,161 shares
of capital stock. In addition, it acquired 11,721 shares held by the
public. As a result EVA now holds 98.5 percent of the total voting
power of Fall River. EVA has also caused to be organized a new
holding-operating company, named Eastern Edison Company, for the
purpose of acquiring the properties and assets of EVA, Brockton, Fall
River and Montaup and holding the securities of Blackstone.
The subsequent permanent financing of Eastern Edison Company
will require the issuance of approximately $44 million of securities.
The plan contemplates that $28 million will be raised through the
public sale of bonds, $12,500,000 through the sale of preferred stock,
and $3,500,000 through bank borrowing.
Eastern Edison Company also proposes to acquire the capital stock held by minority stockholders of its subsidiary companies. Thereafter EVA proposes to
distribute to its common and convertible shareholders the new common
stock of Eastern Edison. EVA will then transfer its remaining assets
to Eastern Edison and dissolve.

Hearings on the amended reorganization plan were reconvened in
May, 1951.
Electric Bond and Share Company

The Electric Bond and Share Company ("Bond and Share") system
was the largest to register under the act. At the time of its registration in 1938, it controlled 121 domestic subsidiaries including five
major subholding companies with combined assets of nearly $3,500,000,000. These subholding companies were American & Foreign
Power Company, Inc. ("Foreign Power"), American Gas and Electric
Company ("American Gas"), American Power & Light Company
("American Power"), Electric Power & Light Corporation ("Electric
Power") and National Power & Light Corporation ("National
Power"). Bond and Share has disposed of its holdings in American
Gas and National Power. Electric Power has been dissolved and has
been succeeded by Middle South Utilities, Inc., which like American
Gas is expected to remain as a registered holding company;" American Power has been partially liquidated and Bond and Share now
holds 7.R percent of its new common stock. Proceedings with respect
to Foreign Power, in which Bond and Share continues to hold a substantial interest, are pendin~ before the Commission and are described
above under a separate heading.
As indicated in the 16th Annual Report, the Commission issued an
order on June 19, 1950, directing the Bond and Share pay to holders
of certificates issued in respect to the $6 preferred stock an amount of
$10 per share plus interest of 5.45 percent as compensation for delay
in payment and that no further payment should be made to holders of
certificates issued in respect to the $5 preferred stock. Payments totaling $100 per share had previously been made to holders of both classes
of preferred stock. Following unsuccessful appeals from the Commission's order by the company, Bond and Share paid an aggregate of
$12.34 per share to certificate holders in respect to the $6 preferred
stock, thus completing the final step in the reorganization of the company's capital structure to a one-stock basis.>
In the past Bond and Share had filed plans with the Commission
contemplating the divestment of all of its public utility holdings in
the United States in order that its status might be changed to that of
an investment company. It has applied for relief, however, from its
commitment to dispose of the stock of United Gas Corporation
("United"), a large gas utility system, received by it in connection
with the dissolution of Electric Power. Hearings with respect to this
request have been concluded and the matter has been submitted to the
Commission for decision.
In February 1950,Bond and Share acquired upon the reorganization
of American Power common stocks of that company's subsidiaries,
Florida Power & Light Company ("Florida"), Montana Power Company ("Montana"), Minnesota Power & Light Company ("Minnesota"), Texas Utilities Company ("Texas") and new common stock of
American Power with a commitment to dispose of all of these holdings
within one year. During the past fiscal year all shares of Texas Util,. These companies are discussed In the following section entitled "Progress of ContinUing

ities and Minnesota Power and a portion of its holdings in Florida and
Montana have been sold or distributed. At June 30, 1951, Bond and
Share still held 18,709shares of Florida and 138,708shares of Montana
which it expects to dispose of before the close of 1951. An extension
of time has been requested in respect to the disposition of its holdings
of 183,050 shares of American Power.
United and its subsidiaries are presently engaged in a construction
program which will require the expenditure of approximately $170
million during the years 1951 and 1952. The major item of this program relates to the construction of more than one thousand miles of
large diameter pipe line to be built as a grid over the present system
in order to provide a more balanced withdrawal and distribution of
gas supply from presently connected and newly developed fields, to
increase the flexibility of the present system, and to enable United
to meet increased gas requirements of present customers and new customers which it proposes to serve.
On March 23, 1951, the Commission approved a joint application
of United and its subsidiary, United Gas Pipe Line Company ("Pipe
Line"), permitting United to undertake temporary short term bank
borrowing up to $25 million, the proceeds to be used to purchase $25
million of Pipe Line's first mortgage bonds." In May 1951, approval
was given to certain proposals of United and its two subsidiaries, Pipe
Line and Union Producing Co. ("Union"), providing for the issuance by Pipe Line to United of $48,127,000 of mortgage bonds due
in 1971, in exchange for United's holdings of similar amount due 1962.
United also extended to 1971 the due date on $34 million of outstanding debentures issued by Union and owned by United."
On June 21,1951, a number of major financing transactions designed
to finance a portion of the proposed construction program were
approved by the Commission,"
It authorized (1) the issuance and
sale by United, pursuant to a rights offering to its stockholders, of
1,065,330 shares of new common stock; (2) the issuance and sale by
United of $50 million principal amount of first mortgage bonds; (3)
the issuance and sale by Pipe Line to United of $25 million principal
amount of Pine Line's first mortgage bonds and $45 million of its sinking fund debentures; (4) the repayment by Pipe Line to United from
the proceeds of the sales of securities of $7 million of unsecured indebtedness.
The rights offering to United stockholders was made on June 29,
and Bond and Share was permitted to acquire its proportionate share
of the new offering, 287,065 shares, and to exercise Its oversubscription privilege if available. The offering was heavily oversubscribed.
The public offering of $50 million of United first mortgage bonds was
consummated on July 26,1951.
On June 28,1950, Bond and Share and United entered into a contract with National Research Corporation ("National Research"), a
non-affiliated company engaged in industrial research. The contract
was not to become effective, however, until either approved by the
Commission or declared not subject to its jurisdiction. Under the
terms of the contract, which will expire on December 31, 1955,National
Research will engage in certain research work in an effort to develop

new processes or products based on natural gas and its constituents.
Such services are to be performed by National Research at cost plus
certain amounts for overhead, such costs to be shared equally by Bond
and Share and United. The contract provides that Bond and Share
and United, between them, are committed to expend in each year on
work to be done by National Research minimum amounts ranging from
$150,000 in 1950 to $250,000 in 1955.
Bond and Share, while urging approval of the contract on its merits,
questioned the jurisdiction of the Commission in this matter. The
Commission found, however, that the venture provided for by the contract and the interests of Bond and Share and United therein clearly
fall within the purview of sections 9 (a) (1) and 12 (f) of the statute.
As previously indicated, the retention of United common stock by
Bond and Share is before the Commission for determination. In advance of such determination, the Commission approved the proposed
research program on condition that if Bond and Share is subsequently
denied relief from its commitment to dispose of the common stock of
United it will forthwith withdraw from and terminate all interest
in the research contract,"
On July 11, 1950, Bond and Share entered into an agreement with
a non-affiliated holding company, The Southern Company ("Southern"), which provided for the acquisition by Southern and the sale by
Bond and Share of the latter's holdings of 254,045 shares of the common stock of Birmingham Electric Company ("Birmingham") in
exchange for 331,067-1/2 shares of the common stock of Southern.
Southern proposed to merge the electric properties of Birmingham
with those of its subsidiary, Alabama Power Company and cause
Birmingham to divest itself of its transportation properties to nonaffiliated interests. The proposal-would not constitute a complete
divestment by Bond and Share of Birmingham since it would permit
Bond and Share to continue with an indirect interest in that company
through ownership of Southern's common stock.
On August 24, 1950, the Commission issued an order approving the
proposed transaction but requiring, among other things, that Bond
and Share divest itself of any direct or indirect interest in the common stock of Southern within one year from the date of acquisition.
The order also required the disposition of Birmingham's transportation properties within one year from the date of the acquisition by
Southern of the Birmingham stock."
In January 1951, Bond and Share's subholding company subsidiary,
National Power & Light Company ("National Power") effected the
divestment of its subsidiary, Lehigh Valley Transit Company, together with its four subsidiary transportation companies. The properties were sold for $810,500 to the Cincinnati, Newport and Covington
Railway Company, a non-affiliated enterprise. During subsequent
months National Power also disposed of its remaining stockholdings
in Pennsylvania Power & Light Company and, reduced its assets to
a limited amount of cash and cash items. On June 26,1951, the Commission issued an order approving a plan by which Bond and Share
sold its common stock holdings of National Power to Phoenix Industries Corporation ("Phoenix").25 This corporation is a closely.. Holding Company Act release No. 10287.

held corporation formed primarily to engage in, or to invest in, other
companies which engage in commercial activities considered to have
good prospects for growth, development and expansion. Its desire
to acquire a controlling interest in National Power was related to the
large number of the latter company's stockholders, its listing on the
New York Stock Exchange and the fact that its assets consisted entirely of cash available for investment. It was indicated that Phoenix
upon acquisition of National Power would cause National Power to
invest in companies of the same general character as those in which
Phoenix plans to invest and that neither company will, directly or indirectly, invest in public utility companies.
In its order approving the sale of stock by Bond and Share the
Commission modified the dissolution order directed to National Power
so as to permit the continued existence of that company and indicated
that, upon consummation of the sale, National Power will have ceased
to be a holding company pursuant to section 5 (d) of the act.
General Public Utilities Corporation

This company is the top holding company emerging from reorganization of the former Associated Gas and Electric Company system.
Reference is made to the 15th and 16th Annual Reports which outline
briefly the steps taken in earlier years to bring about integration and
simplification of this highly complex structure. In 1938 this system
consisted of 164 companies including 11 subholding companies operating in 26 States and in the Philippine Islands. While the present
holding compa!!)' system controlled by General Public Utilities Corporation ("GPU") represents but a segment of the former Associated
system, certain problems remain to be resolved before it can be brought
into complete conformity with the standards of section 11.
In May 1951, hearings on the company's section 11 (b) (1) proceedings were concluded. The Division of Public Utilities of the Commission at that time indicated its view: (1) that the electric, coal mining,
water, and steam heating properties of Jersey Central Power & Light
Company, Metropolitan Edison Coml?any, New Jersey Power & Light
Company, and Pennsylvania Electric Company (other than minor
steam heating properties of the latter company located at Clearfield,
Pa.) constitute a single integrated electric utility system and reasonably incidental businesses, and are retainable by GPU; (2) that the
properties of Northern Pennsylvania Power Company and of its subsidiary, The Waverly Electric Light & Power Company, the gas
properties of Jersey Central Power & Light Company, and the steam
heating properties of Pennsylvania Electric Company referred to
above are not retainable under the standards of section 11 (b) (1) of
the act; and (3) that the Commission's order of August 13, 1942, directing, among other things, the divestment by GPU of its interest in
the Philippine subsidiaries should be reinstated forthwith. At the
same time, GPU indicated that it was not opposed to the prompt
entry by the Commission of an order embodying the views of the
division. After the close of the fiscal year the Commission entered
such an order.
Construction requirements during the past year have made it necessary for the GPU system to undertake the issue and sale of 504,657
shares of its common stock through a rights offering to its common
stockholders. This offering was made on June 16, 1951. Gross pro-

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

ceeds amounted to approximately $8,365,000.26 These funds, less fees
and expenses, are bemg employed by GPU for investment in the common stocks of its domestic utility subsidiaries to meet their expansion
requirements.
GPU has also made capital contributions to certain
subsidiaries from treasury cash. In addition, its domestic subsidiaries
sold to the public $5,750,000 of mortgage bonds and $2 million of preferred stock. Virtually all of the proceeds derived from these sales
have also been applied to meet construction requirements.
International

Hydro-Electric System

At the time of registration International
Hydro-Electric
System
("IHES"),
a Massachusetts voluntary association, owned directly
Gatineau Power Company ("Gatineau"),
a Canadian public utility
company, and two wholesale electric utilities operating in the United
States. It also owned the equity in New England Power Association
which, since its reorganization, is known as New England Electric
System. IHES is now in process of liquidation and dissolution under
section 11 (d) of the act. It functions under the authority of Bartholemew A. Brickley as trustee, who was appointed by the United
States District Court for the District of Massachusetts in November1944.
Earlier steps taken toward the eventual liquidation and dissolution
of IHES are described briefly in the 15th and 16th Annual Reports.
On April 19, 1949, the Trustee submitted a "Second Plan" of four
parts to effect the eventual liquidation and dissolution of IRES and
on July 1, 1949, after approval of the Commission, Part I of the plan
was consummated."
This consisted of a partial payment on outstanding 6 percent debenture indebtedness in default since 1944, reducing
the outstanding principal amount of each $1,000 debenture from $700
to $600. At the close of the last fiscal year the trustee was also authorized to consummate Part II of the plan and retired the company's
6 percent debentures by repaying the balance of $15,940,800 ($600 per
debenture) which was then outstanding.
The requisite amounts of
cash were obtained through the exchange or sale of 340,000 common
shares of Gatineau and through consummation of a bank loan of
$9,500,000.28
Hearings were resumed in November 1950, on Part III of the Trustee's Second Plan in which it is proposed to retire the preferred and
class A stocks of IHES by issuing in exchange therefor eight trustee
certificates for each preferred share and one trustee certificate for each
class A share. Under Part IV of the Trustee's plan, a 60 day takedown privilege would be afforded to the certificate holders, under which
each certificate holder would be permitted to pay his aliquot share of
the Trustee's net obligations including the bank debt and receive his
aliquot share of the portfolio assets. Thereafter, the balance, if any,
due on the bank debt would be satisfied by a sale of assets, the expenses
of administration would be paid, the remaining assets would be ratably
distributed and the holding company would be dissolved.
Hearings on Part III of the Trustee's plan and various counterproposals were closed on February 20, 1951. At the end of the fiscal
year the staff filed its recommendations indicating that Part III would

be fair and equitable if amended to provide seven trustee certificates
in exchange for each preferred share and one trustee certificate for
each class A share. It was recommended that other counter-proposals
be disapproved.
All parties have been given an opportunity to file
objections to the staff recommendations and at the close of the fiscal
year the matter had not yet been argued orally before the Commission.
In a collateral proceeding, the Trustee applied for authorization to
make quarterly payments of 87% cents per share to the preferred stockholders pending final liquidation.
No dividends have been paid on
the preferred stock since July 15, 1934. This request is pending before
the Commission.
Koppers Company, Inc.
Eastern Gas & Fuel Associates

Koppers Company, Inc., is a large industrial organization engaged
in the production, manufacture, and sale of coal tar products, forest
products, coke and gas, machine shop and foundry products, and in
the design and construction of various types of coke ovens, chemical
plants and other structures.
It has been a public utility holding
company by virtue of its stock ownership of Eastern Gas & Fuel
Associates ("Eastern").
The latter company, which is engaged in a
large measure in the J?roduction, transportation, sale and conversion
of coal, is a public utility holding company because of its ownership
of the outstanding voting securities of two gas utility companies
operating in the Boston area.
Both Koppers and Eastern filed applications pursuant to section 3
of the act for orders exempting them and their subsidiaries from all
provisions of the act because of the intrastate character of their utility
operations and on the ground that they were only incidentally public
utility holding companies. Subsequently, however, Eastern filed a
notification of registration as a holding company which filing purported in substance to limit the effect thereof to the corporate simplification provisions of the act and Koppers filed a notification of registration purporting to limit its effect to the geographic integration
provisions of the act.
In proceedings subsequently instituted under section 11 (b) (1) of
the act, the Commission, in June 1945, ordered Koppers with its consent to sever its relationship with Eastern and its subsidiaries by
disposing of its security holdings of those companies."
In May 1945 the Commission also instituted proceedings under
section 11 (b) (2) against Eastern and these proceedings were consolidated with those involving a plan filed by that company in the
same year.so The plan as originally filed provided for the retirement
of Eastern's outstanding 6 percent cumulative preferred stock and
common stock through the issuance of a new common stock, 85 percent
of which was to be allocated to the preferred holders and 15 percent
to the common stockholders.
At the close of the hearings in January
1947, the allocation was amended to provide 79.01 percent for the
preferred holders and 20.99 percent to the common stockholders.
The
record was closed in March 1947, but because of changed circumstances- the hearings were reconvened in 1948 for the purpose of
adducing additional evidence." On December 31,1948, arrearages on

the preferred stock amounted to $35.50 per share, aggregating
$13,281,899.
In January 1949, Eastern again amended its plan by further reducing to 73.08 percent the proposed allocation of new common stock
to the 6 percent preferred stockholders. The proceedings were the
subject of vigorous disputes by various contending: stockholder representatives. In February 1950, the Commission directed Eastern to
reclassify the 6 percent preferred stock and common stock into one
new class of stock and indicated that an 87 percent-13 percent allocation plan could be approved." Because of the wide fluctuations in
Eastern's earnings due to changing conditions in the coal business,
the Commission was confronted with a most difficult task in its evaluation of past and future prospects of the company necessary to determine the fairness of the allocation. The plan was subsequently
amended to meet suggestions of the Commission and was approved in
March 1950.33 In June the United States District Court for the
District of Massachusetts entered its order approving the plan which
was consummated in October 1950.
As a result of the plan Koppers' holdings of about 78 percent of
Eastern's common stock and 13 percent of its preferred stock were
converted into 22 l?ercent of the new common stock. Through subsequent sales to varIOUSpurchasers Koppers has reduced its holdings

interest. The matter of Eastern's application for exemption from all
provisions of the act is still pending before the Commission.
Mission Oil Company
Southwestern Development Compan:,..

The stock of Southwestern Development Company ("Southwestern") is owned 47.28 percent by Mission Oil Company ("Mission"),
representing virtually the only assets of that company; 51 percent
by Sinclair Oil Corporation ("Sinclair") and 1.72 percent by minority
interests. Sinclair also holds about four percent of the stock of Mission. Mission and Southwestern are registered holding companies;
Sinclair, primarily engaged in the production and refining of petroleum products, has been granted an exemption from the provisions of
the act.34
At the time of its registration in 1936, the Southwestern system
proper comprised seven wholly rownad subsidiaries (four gas utilities, two small gas transmission companies and one natural gas production company) which supplied the natural gas requirements of
about 50 communities in the Panhandle area of Texas. In addition
to these operations, Southwestern had substantial interests in other
important natural gas production and transmission companies. It
held all of the capital stock of Canadian River Gas Company ("Canadian River") and a substantial interest in Colorado Interstate Gas
Company ("Colorado"). These two companies are known as the "Denver line," constituting in effect a single operating and business unit.
Southwestern also had at that time I1ninterest in Texoma Natural
Gas Company and Natural Gas Pipeline Company of America. These
two companies, sometimes described as the "Chicago line," constitute

a natural gas transmission system furnishing gas to Chicago and certain intermediate cities enroute.
The Southwestern holdings remained without substantial change
until 194:7when its interest in the two companies comprising "Chicago line" was sold to a non-affiliated company.
In June 1951, after numerous conferences with the staff, Mission
and Southwestern filed with the Commission a section 11 (e) plan
designed to conform its system to the integration and simplification
requirements of the statute. In substance the plan provides that (a)
Mission will be liquidated and Sinclair will divest itself of its stockholdings in Southwestern, (b) the rights to the natural gasoline in
the natural gas reserves of Canadian River, "in place", will be transferred to a new company, the stock of which will be issued to Southwestern and distributed by it to its stockholders, (c) the two companies, Colorado and Canadian River, constituting the "Denver line,"
will be merged, (d) Southwestern will also distribute its holdings of
stock in the merged Colorado-Canadian River Company to its stockholders and (e) for purposes of facilitating these proposed distributions, Southwestern and Colorado will reclassify their outstanding
common stocks. The Commission has instituted cross-proceedings
under sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) and hearings upon the consolidated matters were initiated early in August 1951.35
If this plan is successfully consummated Southwestern will remain
with its wholly owned subsidiaries including four gas utilities with
a field of operations confined generally to the north Texas area. The
stock of Southwestern will be publicly held.
New England Public Service Company

New England Public Service Company ("NEPSCO"),
at the
time of its registration, had five major operating subsidiaries of
which two operated in Maine, one in New Hampshire and two in
New Hampshire and Vermont. It also owned through an industrial
subsidiary, five textile mills, a paper company and a forest products
manufacturing company. As a result of simplification proceedings
instituted by the Commission under section 11 (b) (2), the company
was directed in 1941 to reorganize on a one stock basis or in the alternative to liquidate and dissolve. The management of NEPSCO elected
to liquidate and subsequent steps have been taken toward this end.
On June 19, 1950, the Commission reached its decision as to the
amounts to be paid on the certificates of contingent interest issued in
connection with the retirement of NEPSCO's Prior Lien Preferred
Stock and it ordered that the $7 Series receive an additional payment
of $12.25 J?er share and the $6 Series $2.25 per share, together with
compensation for delay in payment at the rate of 5.5 percent per
annum from October 10, 1947.36 The findings of the Commission with
respect to these amounts were subsequently approved and enforced by
the United States District Court for the District of Maine in Novembel' 1'950. These sums represented the final payments in connection
with retirement of the Prior Lien Preferred Stock.
Subsequently, the Commission and the court approved an amendment to the section 11 (e) plan of NEPSCO which provided for the
reduction of its outstanding bank loan by the USeof proceeds derived

from the sale of 260,000 shares of common stock of Central Maine
Power Company, renewal of the unpaid balance, and a program for
full payment by October 11, 1952. The changes also included removal of restrictions on the payment of dividends on NEPSCO preferred stock and an accounting quasi-reorganization."
Proceeds derived by NEPSCO from the sale of Central Maine Power Company
common stock permitted a reduction in its bank loan of approximately $4 million. The company also applied $2,132,000 returned to
it from funds deposited in escrow for payment of amounts found due
on the preferred stock certificates of contingent interest. These payments, together with funds generated from current earnings, have
brought the outstanding amount of the loan down to $1,310,000 at
June 30, 1951.
In June 1951, NEPSCO filed a new plan providing for the distribution of its remaining assets to the holders of its junior preferred
and common stocks and for its liquidation and dissolution. This
plan is intended to effectuate complete compliance with the Commission's order of May 2, 1941. Superimposed on NEPSCO is Northern New England, a voluntary association, which owns approximately one-third of NEPSCO's common stock. Northern New England is under Commission order to liquidate and dissolve, but it is
awaiting consummation of a final plan by NEPSCO in which the participation to be accorded to the common stock of the latter company
will be determined, before it can take the required steps to complete
liquidation.
Pennsylvania Gas & Electric Corporation

Pennsylvania Gas & Electric Corporation ("Penn Corp"), which
filed its registration statement with the Commission in November
1936, had at that time 19 subsidiary companies. Its utility operations were conducted in sections of New York, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Rhode Island and Virginia. The system included 15 gas
utility companies, three wholesale gas companies and one service company. Three of the utility subsidiaries, North Penn Gas Company
("North Penn"), Pennsylvania Gas & Electric Company, name later
changed to York County Gas Company ("York County"), and Saugerties .Gas Light Company ("Saugerties") were also subholding
companies,
In January 1942, the Commission instituted a proceeding under
section 11 (b) (2) with respect to York County and Penn Corp."
Thereafter, two subsidiaries were merged into York County and a recapitalization plan of that company was approved by the Commission in December 1944 providing for corporate simplification and a
program of debt reduction."
The plan was consummated during
1945after approval by the United States District Court for the Middle
District of Pennsylvania. Two of Penn Corp's Virginia subsidiaries
were combined in 1944 and, in July 1946, this company was divested
by Penn Corp."

In September 1948, the Commission issued an order pursuant to

Penn Corp disposed of its interest in North Shore shortly thereafter
and, in 1949 and 1950, sold its holdings of York County and Newport.
Its investment in another subsidiary, New Penn Development Corporation, was also sold during 1950. Subsidiaries in New York were
merged into Crystal City Gas Company. An order of the Commission, dated December 22, 1949, approved this merger and also directed that Penn Corp liquidate and dissolver" As a result of successive divestments and the merger, Penn Corp's holding company
system was reduced to four gas companies operating in Pennsylvania,
one company, Crystal City, operating in New York, and a mutual
service company. The Pennsylvania companies were merged, as of
December 31, 1950, into a single company, North Penn, with Crystal
City as its sole subsidiary.
In the latter part of 1950, Penn Corp. sought the approval of this
Commission with respect to a proposed sale of the capital stock of
Crystal City to certain non-affiliated interests. After hearings thereon
the Commission found that there had not been a maintenance of competitive conditions in the negotiations for such sale and disapproved
the proposed transaction."
The final portion of Penn Corp's section 11 plan contemplates the
liquidation and dissolution of that company and distribution of capital stock of North Penn pursuant to a proposed allocation to holders
of Penn Corp preferred and Class A common stock. A cash payment of $0.10 per share is proposed for holders of the Class B common. Hearings on this proposal were concluded in July 1951.
Standard Power & Light Corporation
Standard Gas & Electric Company

The Standard holding company system p'resented, at the time of its
registration, an extreme example of the evils of corporate pyramiding
and scatteration of properties. In 1936,it consisted of 105 active companies operating in 20 states and in Mexico, including the two top
holdin* compames, Standard Power & Light Corporation ("Standard
Power') and its subsidiary, Standard Gas & Electric Company
("Standard Gas"). By June 30, 1951, the system had been reduced
to 15 companies and further contraction is in prospect.
As reported in the 16th Annual Report, Standard Gas, in 1949,
filed an amended plan for the simplification of the corp'orate structure
of the system of its holding company subsidiary, Philadelphia Company ("Philadelphia").
Several provisions of the plan have already
been carried out including the reorganization of the gas properties
in the Philadelphia system under the ownership of Equitable Gas
Company ("Equitable"), the sale of Equitable common stock and $11
million of debentures of Equitable held by Philadelphia, the retirement of Philadelphia's outstanding funded debt, amountin~ to approximately $36 million and the redemption of Philadelphia's $6

$19,500,000 of bonds and preferred stock to the public the proceeds of

which were used to finance its construction program and to repay outstanding bank loans. The Duquesne five percent preferred stock,
aggregating $27,500,000,was refunded by the issuance to Philadelphia
of a new series of four percent preferred stock in consideration of
$27,200,000in cash and the transfer to Duquesne of all of the stock of
Philadelphia's direct subsidiary, Cheswick and Harmer Railroad
Company."
The amended plan as it now stands proposes that the Duquesne four
percent preferred stock be used by Philadelphia in an exchange program to retire its own six percent preferred stock and the six percent
preferred of Consolidated Gas Company of the City of Pittsburgh,
an inactive subsidiary of Philadelphia, on which Philadelphia has
guaranteed certain dividends. The proposed bases of exchange are:
one share of Duquesne's four percent preferred stock together with
$3.50 in cash, for each share of Philadelphia's six percent preferred
and 0.85 of one share of Duquesne's four percent preferred for each
share of Consolidated Gas preferred. The plan also provides that
Philadelphia five percent preferred stock shall be retired by the payment of $11 in cash for each share and that its $5 preference stock
be retired in a manner not yet specified. Aggregate par values of
these various preferred stock issues is approximately $31,700,000.
Hearings belore the Commission relating to the retirement of the
six percent and five percent preferred stocks of Philadelphia and the
preferred stock of Consolidated Gas were completed in April 1951 and
the matter is now awaiting the decision of the Commission.
During the fiscal year, both Standard Gas and its parent Standard
Power, were permitted by the Commission to withdraw their 1943
and 1944 section 11 (e) plans, which had been previously approved
but never consummated. The Standard Gas plan which had provided for its recapitalization was allowed to be withdrawn because of
changes in conditions occurring during the course of litigation. The
Standard Power plan was allowed to be withdrawn because its provisions were linked to the consummation of the Standard Gas
recapitalization."
In February 1951, Standard Gas filed a new section 11 (e) plan with
the Commission. The plan includes four steps. Step I would effect
the retirement of Standard's $7 and $6 Prior Preferred stock; Step
II is intended to effectuate the liquidation and dissolution of Standard
Gas and the delivery to the holders of its $4 cumulative preferred stock
and common stock, shares of Philadelphia Company common stock;
Step III will eliminate the minor subsidiaries of Philadelphia and,
if feasible, Pittsburgh Railways Company; and Step IV proposes
either the dissolution of Philadelphia and the distribution to its
common stockholders of its holdings of Duquesne or, if Pittsburgh
Railways is not disposed of as part of Step III, the disposition by
Philadelphia of most of its holdings in Duquesne and its continuance
primarily as a holding company for Pittsburgh Railways until disposition of that company is accomplished. Hearings are currentJy
being held on Step I of the plan.

approved a joint application by Philadelphia and Equitable Real
Estate, a non-utility subsidiary, which provided for the transfer of
all of Equitable's assets to Philadelphia and dissolution of the subsidiary." In a prior decision the Commission also approved the dissolution of Equitable Sales Company, another subsidiary of Philadelphia. That step was effected in December 1950.48
In December 1950, Standard Gas finally liquidated its investments
in Market Street Railway Company ("Market Street") after step one
of a modified plan of liquidation and dissolution of Market Street
had been approved by the Commission and the United States District
Court for the Northern District of California."
Pursuant to that
plan Market Street paid Standard Gas $512,500 in cash in settlement
of its open account indebtedness amounting to $707,189 plus a substantial amount of accrued interest, and it executed a full and complete
release of all claims which it held against Standard Gas and Standard
Power and any of their subsidiaries. The Standard Gas holdings of
junior preferred and common stocks of Market Street were declared
worthless since there were not sufficient assets to satisfy the claims
of the senior preferred stock.
Standard Gas completed its divestment of Louisville Gas and Electric Company in October 1950 by disposing of its remaining holdings
of 137,857shares of common stock for $4,331,329.50
The United Corporation

The United Corporation ("United") registered as a holding company in March 1938, at which time its portfolio was comprised principally of the common stocks of four holding company subsidiaries.
These subsidiaries, together with the percentage of voting control held
by United, were as follows: The United Gas Improvement Company,
26.2 percent; Public Service Corporation of New Jersey, 13.9 percent;
Niagara Hudson Power Corporation ("Niagara Hudson"), 23.4 percent; and Columbia Gas & Electric Corporation (now the Columbia
Gas System, Inc.), 19.6 percent. United also had other substantial
interests, principally in utility holding and operating companies.
In 1941, United filed a plan pursuant to section 11 (e) for divest.
ment of control of its statutory subsidiaries whereby United would
not vote the securities of any of its statutory subsidiaries or have any
interlocking officersor directors and would proceed when advantageous
to it, to reduce its holdings in each of its statutory subsidiaries to less
than 10 percent of the outstanding voting securities of such subsidiaries. Proceedings on that plan were consolidated with proceedings
instituted by the Commission under sections 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) .
.After the development of an extensive record, the Commission found
that the plan was not appropriate nor fair and equitable and could not
be approved."
While it found that dissolution of United would be

tribution of voting power by recapitalizing with a single class of stock
and cease to be a holding company.
Shortly before the entry of the Commission's order in 1943 and
subsequent thereto, various subsidiary as well as non subsidiary holding companies of United underwent extensive reorganizations under
section 11. A large number of indirect subsidiaries of United have
been divested and United has effectuated the retirement of all of its
outstanding preference stock largely through the exchange of securities of reorganized subsidiaries. Substantial blocks of portfolio
securities have also been disposed of through market sales.
In October 1949, the Commission approved a plan filed by United
by which it substantially reduced its investment in Niagara Hudson
through the distribution of a special dividend of Niagara Hudson
stock to its own shareholders.P
Approval of that plan was conditioned by the Commission upon a prompt filing by United of a comprehensive and detailed program under section 11 (e). Pursuant to
this requirement United submitted a new proposal in November 1949
and after successsive modifications, the Commission on June 26,1951,
issued its final order approving- the plan as amended." It provided
that holders of less than 100 shares of United common stock may
surrender their shares for cash in the amount equal to the average net
asset value of such stock based on the average of the closing market
prices of United's portfolio during the term of the offer. Holders
of 100 or more shares of United common stock were offered the opportunity during the same period to exchange their stock for an amount
of Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation ("Niagara Mohawk") common stock having an average market value equal to 97 percent of the
average net asset value of the United stock surrendered. Such average
net asset value was also based on the closing market prices of United's
portfolio securities during the period of the exchange offer. Up to
700,000 shares of common stock of Niagara Mohawk were offered for
exchange by United under this plan. United also proposes to sell its
entire interest in its common stock in South Jersey Gas Company and
to reduce its remaining holdings of voting securities of public utility
companies to an amount not to exceed 4.9 percent of the outstanding
voting stock of such companies.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year United undertook the
exchange offer approved by the Commission and 362,616 shares of
United common stock were exchanged for 69,566.6 shares of Niagara
Mohawk common stock. In addition, 95,051 shares of United common
were surrendered for cash at a purchase price of $4.43 per share.
Approximately 557,130 shares of United were held by holders of less
than 100 shares and hence were eligible for the cash purchase offer.
Proceedings to review certain aspects of the plan are pending in the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia.

1943 and enforced in the United States District Court for the District
of Delaware." Washington had filed a petition in bankruptcy in
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New
York on September 29, 1941, and, pursuant to order of the District
Court for the District of Delaware, the common stock of Washington
was turned over to its trustee to be held by him subject to order of
the District Court for the Southern District since the common stock
had been found to be valueless by the Commission and the District
Court of Delaware.
At the time of the filing of its petition in bankruptcy, Washington
had three subsidiaries, Oregon Gas and Electric Company, Southern
Utah Power Company and Dominion Electric Power, Limited.
Washington was also engaged directly in the electric and gas utility
business in the State of Washington. The principal electric properties of Washington had been taken by Public Utility Districts III
condemnation proceedings in November 1940 and, in the course of
reorganization, the remainder of its electric properties were taken
in similar proceedings in 1942. Subsequently, the trustee of Washington sold the assets of Oregon Gas and Electric and additional
assets of Washington, including its interest in Dominion Electric.
During the proceedings, Washington paid its First Mortgage Bonds
in full and caused Southern Utah to refund its debt and to recapitalize
on the basis of one class of common stock. As a result Washington
received new common stock of Southern Utah in exchange for its
former holdings of three classes of that company's stock. On J anuary 24, 1949, the Commission approved a plan submitted under
section 11 (f) by the trustee of Washington. 55 The plan was accepted
by the bondholders and general creditors of Washington and confirmed by order of the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York on October 5, 1949. It was subsequently directed
to be consummated by orders of the court dated April 14, 1950, and
July 27,1950. Pursuant to the plan, Washington has divested itself
of its interest in Southern Utah, and retains only its gas utility operations. The common stock of Washington is being distributed to the
holders of WaShington's First Lien and General Mortgage Bonds
and to its general creditors. No participation was accorded to its
preferred or common stockholders.
On May 29, 1951,the Commission issued an order pursuant to section
5 (d) declaring that Washington had ceased to be a holding company
and cancelling the effectiveness of its registration subject to a condition reserving jurisdiction over the terms, provisions and amount of
all debt securities which may be issued in connection with the plan
of reorganization."
The order also provided that such jurisdiction
would be deemed to have been released upon the filing with the Commission of due proof that Washington had obtained approximately
$150,000 through the issuance and sale of additional common stock.
A statement filed on June 28, 1951,by counsel for Washington indicates
that this stock offering has since been successfully consummated.

Wisconsin and Michigan and natural gas in Wisconsin. Steam heating service is provided in Milwaukee and Waukesha, Wisconsin. The
company also has a transportation subsidiary operating transit facilities in Milwaukee and adjoining suburbs.
On August 15, 1950, the Commission issued an order pursuant to
section 11 (b) (1) instituting proceedings to determine what properties
may be retained in Wisconsin's electric holding company system.
Hearings are presently in progress on these matters. The company
recently offered its transportation properties for sale to the City of
Milwaukee. In the event these properties are sold the major remaining problem will concern the retainability by Wisconsin of its natural
gas utility business. Representatives of the City of Milwaukee and
of the WIsconsin Public Service Commission are participating in the
proceedings before the Commission.
PROGRESS OF CONTINUING HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMS

The utility holding company groups expected to continue under the
jurisdiction of the Commission as completely integrated, regional
systems consist in general of three major types. The first is the electric
holding company system, which usually consists of one holding company above a number of interconnected electric operating companies.
In this category are included such systems as American Gas and
Electric Company, Central and South West Corporation, The Southern
Company, and Middle South Utilities, Inc. A significant characteristic of this type of system is the efficient use of large-scale, centralized
generation coupled with economical long-distance transmission of
energy.
The second type is the natural gas holding company system, which
frequently controls gas-transmission as well as gas-distribution properties. Systems of this class include the Columbia Gas System, Inc.,
American Natural Gas Company, and Consolidated Natural Gas
Company. The third type is the operating-holding company system.
In these instances the holding company derives a substantial proportion of its income from its own utility operations but also retains one
or more subsidiary operating companies. Examples of this type
include the Delaware Power & Light Company, Ohio Edison Company,
and Interstate Power Company.
In order to achieve the degree of integration contemplated in section
11 and to justify their continuing existence, these holding companies
must do more than simply establish physical interconnections among
their subsidiary companies. There must be a realization of important
economic and engineering benefits obtainable only by the knitting
together of a compact group of operating properties having basic
functional relationships with one another. In addition, the parent
holding companies must be in a position to furnish sound and constructive assistance to their operating subsidiaries in the financing
of expansion programs. The strength of each system rests heavily
upon the underlying financial stability of its subsidiaries.
The following summaries provide a review of the more important
actions taken by the Commission during the past fiscal year in respect
to operations of a number of the contmuing systems. It should be
noted that several of these systems are still faced with residual problems under section 11 (b) (1) and 11 (b) (2) of the act, and during

the past year they have made several property dispositions intended
to eliminate some of their nonretainable holdings. In a limited number
of cases, registered holding companies may eventually be able to
qualify for exemption from the act pursuant to the provisions of
section 3 (a).
Certain of the holding companies described in the preceding section
may also remain as parts of continuing systems upon resolution of
their existing section 11 problems.
American Gas and Electric Company

American Gas and Electric Company ("American Gas") is the
largest of the continuing regional holding company systems with conIts operations, almost
solidated assets in excess of $678,000,000.
wholly electric, extend over a seven state area from Kentucky to
Michigan.
In December 1950, the Commission permitted American Gas to
undertake an exchange offer designed to acquire all of the outstanding
common stock (162,030 shares) of Central Ohio Light & Power Company ("Central Ohio") in exchange for American Gas common stock
on the basis of 0.72 of a share of American Gas common stock for each
share of Central Ohio common stock." Central Ohio, an independent
electric operating utility, had service areas in two sections of Ohio
about 100 miles apart and not interconnected.
Under the plan outlined by American Gas, expenditures of almost $1,500,000 were proposed in order to interconnect the facilities and coordinate the operations of Central Ohio with The Ohio Power Company, an operating
subsidiary of American Gas. The exchange proposal proved highly
successful and American Gas reported that as of March 12, 1P51, it had
acquired 98 percent of the outstanding common stock of Central Ohio.
American Gas, with Commission approval, has also eliminated one
subsidiary from its system, Union City Electric Company ("Union
City"). Since the power requirements of Union City were furnished
entirely by The Ohio Power Company, Union City no longer served a
useful purpose in the system as a separate corporate entity. Its property therefore was transferred to Ohio Power and the company was
dissolved.
The American Gas system serves a territory which, within the last
two years, has experienced a tremendous expansion in the tempo and
scope of defense production. The system has therefore been carrying
on an extensive construction program to meet the additional demands
for service and to replace existing properties with more efficient facilities. Its construction program will require expenditures during the
years 1951 through 1953 of approximately $288 million. During the
past fiscal year the Commission has approved system financings aggregating in excess of $68 million. This was accomplished by advances
to subsidiaries, bank loans and mortgage debt and common stock offerings. Among these was a successful rights offering made by American
Gas to its stockholders of 339,674 shares of common stock without the
aid of underwriting or dealer solicitation. A substantial portion of
the net proceeds of $17,619,000 derived from this offering has been
reinvested in the equities of the subsidiary operating companies,"

American Natural Gas Company

American Natural Gas Company ("American") and its subsidiaries
now constitute an integrated gas transmission and distribution system bringing natural gas from the Hugoton field in Texas to areas in
the States of Michigan and Wisconsin.59 The development of the
American system was effected by the parent company's divestment of
certain non-retainable holdings and the application of cash proceeds
derived from these sales to investment in a newly organized gas transmission pipe line, the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Company. The
latter enterprise serves to link the gas utility subsidiaries of American
with a source of fuel some eight hundred miles to the south.
The past four years have witnessed the rapid growth of the Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe Line Company as a major long distance transmission system. The first and second phases of the project have been
substantially completed and now permit an annual gas delivery capacity of 110 billion cubic feet, the maximum presently authorized by the
Federal Power Commission. Capitalization of the pipe line company
includes $66 million of bonds, $25 million of common stock owned by
American and $20 million of bank loans due July 1,1952.
On April 5, 1951, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, one of the
principal gas utility subsidiaries of American, acquired the assets of
its wholly owned subsidiary, Austin Field Pipe Line Company, in
exchange for the cancellation of $7,295,039 of advances, the surrender
of all of the outstanding stock and the assumption of all liabilities of
the Austin company."
In order to meet a continually increasing demand for fuel the American system has undertaken a substantial amount of new financing
during the past year. At June 1951 total system construction requirements were estimated at approximately $45 million. In November
1950, Milwaukee Gas LIght Company, another subsidiary, issued ana
sold at competitive biddin~ $27 million of mortgage bonds and $6
million of sinking fund debentures to the public and $3 million of
common stock 61 to its parent, American. In early July 1951, Michigan Consolidated Gas Company sold publicly $15 million of bonds
at competitive bidding and to its parent, American, $5 million of common stock, which, it was estimated, would meet its requirements
through 1951.
In order to preserve a balanced capital structure within the system
it has been necessary for the parent holding company, American, to
make several offerings of its own common stock from time to time.
In August 1950, it Issued and sold, pursuant to a rights offering,
304,406 additional common shares. In June 1951, another rights offering to its common stockholders resulted in the sale of 334,935
shares of common stock." Aggregate proceeds of the two offerings
were $15,900,000.

and transmission facilities. To meet a continuously increasing demand for natural gas as a house-heating fuel and for new defense requirements, construction expenditures totaling over $37 million were
made by the system in 1950, and projected expenditures for 1951 involve an additional amount of $68 million. The completion of this
program is dependent, however, upon the availability of certain critical materials. Cash requirements for these undertakings have been
met, in part, through the sale at competitive bidding by Columbia Gas
of $90 million principal amount of debentures in July 1950. Although
a portion of this offering was used to retire $58 million of debentures
outstanding, the balance was made available for construction needs.
The indenture under which these debentures were issued permits the
company to issue debt to the extent of 60 percent of its total capitalization. Columbia Gas indicated that, while it is presently of the opinion that a debt ratio of not more than 50 percent is desirable, it felt
that a substantial amount of additional borrowing capacity might be
necessary in periods of heavy construction which would temporarily
bring the debt ratio above this level. The Commission recognized the
desirabilitl of such flexibility and permitted the declaration covering
issuance 0 the debentures to become effective. It indicated, however,
that it considered 50 percent to be the desirable proportion of debt for
the system and noted that its approval was not to be construed as an
indication that the issuance of debt to the full limit permitted by the
indenture would be approved under all circumstances."
Cash derived by Columbia Gas from its sale of securities has been
reinvested in several of its subsidiary operating companies through
the purchase of instalment promissory notes. The aggregate of such
investments during the fiscal year 1951 was $25,600,000. Columbia
Gas has also purchased 122,000 additional shares of the common stock
of its subsidiary holding company, Atlantic Seaboard Corporation.
The proceeds of this financing have been applied to meet construction
requirements."
Interstate Power Company

Interstate Power Company is an operating-holding company which,
together with its two subsidiaries, is engaged principally in the electric
utility business in Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, and South
Dakota.
Following a complete financial reorganization of the company in
1948 pursuant to a section 11 (e) plan Interstate's rapidly expanding
business necessitated the raising of substantial amounts of additional
capital. The company's financial structure at that time was still far
from ideal and, in the process of meeting its new capital requirements,
the company and the Commission were faced with the problem of effecting steady improvement in the system's equity ratio so that future
financmg could be facilitated on a sound and economical basis. This
objective has been achieved with marked success. Interstate's common equity has increased from 17 percent of total capitalization and
surplus at the time of its 1948 reorganization to about 27 percent by
the middle of 1950.
To finance its 1951 construction program Interstate arranged for
short term bank borrowings in the aggregate amount of $4,500,000.

By order dated February 16, 1951, the Commission approved borrowings to the extent of $2,500,000, reserving jurisdiction over the remaining portion pending consideration by the company of plans to
effect additional common stock or other equity financing in the near
future."
During the past fiscal year the Commission also approved an Adjusted Compromise Plan with respect to the distribution of 944,961
shares of Interstate's new common stock which had previously been
placed in escrow pending determination as to whether the holdings
of Ogden Corporation (former parent company of Interstate) should
be subordinated to those held by the public." The plan was directed
to be enforced by the United States District Court for the District of
Delaware in its order dated March 16, 1951. Distribution of the escrowed assets to the holders of Interstate's formerly outstanding
securities was initiated a month later.
Middle South Utilities, Inc.

Middle South Utilities, Inc. ("Middle South") controls a utility
system serving the three state area embracing Arkansas, Louisiana and
western Mississippi. The company was organized in May 1949 to acquire from Electric Power & Light Corporation the latter's holdings
in Arkansas Power & Light Company, Louisiana Power & Light Company, Mississippi Power & Light Company and New Orleans Public
Service, Inc., and a small land company. Middle South is now an
integrated regional holding company system deriving the major portion of its revenues from sales of electricity. Certain of its nonretain-.
able natural gas and transportation operations, and its interest in the
land company, have been disposed of during the past fiscal year.
On September 6, 1950, the Commission approved the sale by Arkansas Power & LIght Company of its entire gas utility assets, can
sisting of distribution systems in 23 small towns and cities in Arkansas," These properties were sold to the newly formed Midsouth
Gas Company ("Midsouth") which was organized by a group of investment banking firms. Midsouth agreed to pay Arkansas Power
in cash an amount equal to the net book cost as of December 31, 1949,
of the gas properties and also for other assets transferred and conveyed under the purchase contract.
On December 20, 1950, the Commission also approved the sale by
Arkansas Power & Light Company of its holdings of common stock of
Capital Transportation Company. The sale was made to a non-affiliated transit company for a total consideration of $575,000.68
The Middle South system has estimated that its construction expenditures for the year 1951 will total approximately $48,450,000, of
which $25,000,000 is to be raised by new financing. In November 1950,
the Commission approved the sale at competitive bidding of $10
million of mortgage bonds by Louisiana Power & Light Company,
and in March 1951 approval was granted for the issuance and sale
by the parent holding company of 450,000 shares of its own common
stock at competitive bidding." Middle South has employed the proceeds of this offering, together with other available cash, to purchase

New England Electric System

New England Electric System ("NEES") and its subsidiary companies constitute the largest utility organization in New England.
The system's total revenues from operations for the year 1950
amounted to approximately $107 million, 82 percent of which was
derived from the sale of electricity, 10 percent from gas and 8 percent from transit operations. The system has 35 subsidiary companies of which 21 furnish electricity, at retail, in Massachusetts and
Rhode Island. Two generating companies and a transmission company operating in New Hampshire and Vermont supply electricity
on a wholesale basis.
During the past fiscal year, Narragansett Electric Company, a subsidiary operating company, acquired the property of its own subsidiary, Rhode Island Power Transmission Company, which was subsequently dissolved. In October 1950, NEES sold its interest in Fall
River Electric Light Company to Eastern Utilities Associates, a nonaffiliated holding company, for $7,608,000. In March 1951, NEES
also disposed of its investment in the United Electric Railways Company which operates in the Providence, Rhode Island, area.
NEES has made considerable progress during the year with respect
to its plan for the consolidation of certain electric properties into
larger operating companies. This plan is closely associated with the
separation and disposal of the system's gas properties. The merger
of the electric properties of eight subsidiary companies located in the
central part of Massachusetts into one electric company was consummated in February 1951 and, at the same time, the gas properties of
certain combination gas and electric companies in this area were
separated and regrouped into four gas companies. On July 14, 1951,
NEES invited proposals for the purchase of all or part of the system's
gas properties.
After many modifications, the reorganization plan of Green Mountain Power Corporation ("Green Mountain"), a subsidiary of NEES,
was approved by the Commission and ordered enforced by the United
States District Court for the District of Vermont at the close of the
fiscal year.70 The plan, among other things, provided for the exchange of new common stock for the company's then outstanding
preferred stock, the issuance and sale, for cash, of additional shares
of new common stock and the settlement of possible intra-system
claims. Since NEES was allowed no participation in the reorganized
company, Green Mountain is now an independent operating utility.
It is estimated that construction expenditures for the NEES system
for the years 1949 to 1952 inclusive will total $122 million. In addition cash demands to meet sinking fund requirements and short term
debt maturities require an additional $29 million. Of direct concern
to the Commission has been the system's temporary and permanent
financing program for this construction.
To provide temporary financing for the construction program,
system companies from time to time have borrowed from commercial
banks with indications that they expect to do permanent bond and
capital stock financing and use the proceeds to retire the bank debt

and to pay for construction.
During the fiscal year, New England
Power Company ("NEPCO") and Worcester County Electric Company ("Worcester County"), subsidiaries of NEES, each sold $12
million principal amount of bonds," Although during the period
certain subsidiary companies issued capital stock to NEES and used
the proceeds thereof to retire bank debt, short term promissory notes
to banks authorized or outstanding as at the end of the period aggregated $22 million. During July 1951, other subsidiaries had pending
applications for Commission approval of an additional $6,175,000 of
bank loans. Proceeds to be derived from the contemplated sale by
NEES of its investments in gas and transportation
properties are
to be reinvested in the equity of its subsidiary companies in order to
effect an improvement in the system's capitalization ratios.
New England Gas and Electric Association

New England Gas and Electric Association ("NEGEA") is a Massachusetts trust holding the common stocks of 11 utility companies all
of which, except New Hampshire Electric Company ("New Hampshire") and Kittery Electric Light Company ("KIttery"), are engaged
in the electric or gas utility business in Massachusetts.
In February
1951, NEGEA and New Hampshire filed an application with the
Commission proposing the issuance by New Hampshire of 15,000 shares
of preferred stock and 140,000 shares of common stock and the exchange of such stocks for all of its presently outstanding common stock
which is held by NEGEA.
The application further proposed the
sale by NEGEA of New Hampshire's preferred stock to the public
and the new common shares of New Hampshire to NEGEA's stockholders, both at competitive bidding. NEGEA also proposed to donate
to New Hampshire its holdings of all of the common stock of Kittery
prior to the issuance and exchange of the new securities. The Commission approved the proposed transactions in March 1951, but no
bids were received for the purchase of the new preferred and common
stocks of New Hampshire."
NEGEA is continuing the extensive construction program commenced prior to the past fiscal year. Gas plant additions have included
facilities to utilize natural gas when it becomes available in the New
England area. Estimated expenditures for the calendar years 1951
and 1952 aggregate $12,200,000, of which $2,200,000 represents expenditures necessitated by the introduction of natural gas. To finance
this construction program the operating subsidiaries will use general
corporate funds in the aggregate amount of $8,500,000, borrow $1 million from banks, and sell additional common stock to NEG EA in the
amount of $2,700,000. The cost of adjusting customer-owned appliances for natural gas is to be financed through the issuance by subsidiary companies of 10-year unsecured sinking fund notes.
In June 1951, the Commission approved the issue and sale by
NEGEA of 197,394 additional common shares in the form of a rights
offering to holders of its common stock." The proceeds, amounting
to $2,566,000, were used to repay bank loans in the amount of $1 million and to purchase additional common stocks of subsidiaries

NEGEA is planning to raise approximately $3 million through the
issue and sale of additional common shares during 1952.
The cash requirements of NEGEA during the past fiscal year have
included the purchase of additional shares of common stock of Algonquin Gas Transmission Company, a natural gas pipeline company to
be engaged in transporting natural gas to the New England area.74
NEGEA's interest in this subsidiary will be limited to $3 million or
37.5 percent of the total initial equity of the company. Participating
with NEGEA are Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates, Texas Eastern
Transmission Corporation, and Providence Gas Company. To finance
the Algonquin purchase NEGEA has negotiated short-term bank loans
which will be refinanced on a permanent basis as soon as the line is
in operation.
Northern Natural Gas Co.

Northern Natural Gas Company ("Northern") is engaged in the
purchase, transmission and distribution of natural gas, which is
carried from fields in Texas, Oklahoma, and Kansas to utility companies located principally in Minnesota, Iowa, and Nebraska. The
company has one wholly owned gas utility subsidiary, Peoples Natural
Gas Company, and is therefore a registered holding company. On
September 25, 1950, however, Northern filed an application with this
Commission pursuant to section 3 (a) (3) seeking exemption for itself
as a holding company and for each subsidiary thereof as such from
the provisions of the act. Hearings have been held on this application and the Division of Public Utilities has recommended denial of
the application. The Commission has heard oral argument of the
question and has taken the matter under advisement.
Since the end of World War II, increased demands on this system
have necessitated large increases in its pipe line capacity, which at
the end of 1950 stood at approximately 600,000 mcf a day. Additional construction planned and undertaken for the year 1951 contemplates a further addition of 225,000 mcf of daily capacity. The
Commission has constantly urged that the financing of this construction be designed with a view to preserving as far as possible the substantial equity ratio which has been a characteristic of the system for
many years. During the past two years the company has sold an
aggregate of 810,000 shares of common stock by means of rights offerings with gross proceeds of $21,578,750,75 and has also sold $40 million of 2% percent serial debentures." The company estimates that
its 1951 construction program will cost approximately $60 million
and contemplates-financing these expenditures on a long-term basis
through the sale of $51 million of securities to the public, Temporary financing through $30 million of bank loans was permitted by
the Commission on April 26, 1951.77

sota, Wisconsin, North Dakota and South Dakota. Although the
system is expected to achieve ultimate compliance with the standards
of section 11 (b), it is faced with some residual problems.
In this connection, the Commission in June 1950 authorized the
sale of all of the physical properties of Interstate Light & Power
Company (Ill.) a wholly-owned subsidiary of Northern States, to
Northwestern Illinois Gas & Electric Company, a non-affiliated company, for the base price of $549,900.18 Inthe same order the Commission also authorized the sale by Interstate Light & Power Company
(Wisc.) , another wholly-owned subsidiary, of that part of its electric properties comprising its Platteville division to Wisconsin Power
& Light Company, another non-affiliate, for the base price of $560,500. These property sales effected the disposition of outlying electric
properties in northwest Illinois and southern Wisconsin which did
not constitute a part of the Northern States' principal electric system.
By order entered October 13, 1950, the Commission authorized the
sale by Northern States of 175,000 shares of new preferred stock to
provide a part of the capital required for completion of the system's
post-war construction program, estimated to aggregate $163,500,000
to the end of 1951.19
The company stated that further financing of approximately $25
million would be required for the completion of the current construction program in connection with which a material amount of common
stock would be sold contingent upon market conditions. It is expected that Northern States will inaugurate another large scale construction schedule, to provide for rapidly growing demand.
Ohio Edison Company

Ohio Edison Company ("Ohio Edison"), formerly a subsidiary of
The Commonwealth & Southern Corporation, IS now an independent
operating-holding company having one utility subsidiary, Pennsylvania Power Company ("Pennsylvania Power"). During the past
year, the company and its subsidiary have undertaken several financing
operations to provide funds for construction expenditures for the
years 1951 and 1952 estimated to aggregate $57,800,000 in the case of
Ohio Edison and $14,900,000for Pennsylvania Power.
Ohio Edison has made two offerings of common stock. The first
took place in October 1950 when it offered 396,571 shares through a
rights offering to stockholders. This was followed in May 1951 by
an additional rights offering of 436,224 common shares," The proceeds derived from these two sales totaled over $23 million which
materially increased the company's common stock equity. As a result,
Ohio Edison made a further investment of $1,200,000in Pennsylvania
Power by the purchase of 40,000 shares of the latter's common stock,
all of which is owned by the 'parent company. In addition, Pennsylvania Power sold at competitive bidding in March 1951, $4 million
par value of preferred stock." Shortly thereafter, Ohio Edison proposed the sale of its own preferred stock in the amount of $15 million,
but because of unfavorable market conditions the offering was postponed.

The Southern Company

The Southern Company ("Southern Company") is the parent holding company of a system which survives the former Commonwealth &
Southern group. The integrated system, which it controls, furnishes
service through four electric utility subsidiaries in Georgia, Alabama,
Florida and Mississippi.
It is second largest of the continuing
systems.
On August 24, 1950, the Commission approved the acquisition of
Birmingham Electric Company ("Birmingham")
through an exchange of common shares of the Southern Company and preferred
shares of Alabama Power Company {"Alabama"}, a subsidiary of
the Southern Company, for common and preferred shares of Birmingham. The Commission's order required that the Southern Company
and Alabama, which became the immediate parent of Birmingham,
bring about the disposal of all interest in the transportation properties
of the latter company not later than August 31, 1951.82 The sale of
these properties was accomplished in June 1951.83
During the calendar year 1950, capital expenditures of the Southern Company system totalled $70 million and present plans call for
further additions to plant during the period 1951-1953 sufficient to
effect a 38 percent increase in generating capacity over that installed
by the end of 1950. In October 1950 the Southern Company sold
one million shares of its common stock at competitive bidding 84 and
another sale of the same amount was consummated in April 1951.85
Total proceeds derived from these offerings aggregated approximately $21,900,000. These funds, together with additional amounts
of treasury cash, were invested by the parent company in the common stock of its subsidiaries. In addition to this common stock financing, operating subsidiaries sold bonds and preferred stocks to the
public yielding cash proceeds of over $34 million.
Southern Natural Gas Company

Southern Natural Gas Company {"Southern Natural"} operates a
natural gas pipeline system extending from gas fields in Texas, Louisiana and MIssissippi to markets in Mississippi Alabama and Georgia.
Two of the company's subsidiaries are engaged in the distribution of
gas in Mississippi and Alabama. Another subsidiary operates a 35
mile gas pipeline in Louisiana.
During 1950 Southern Natural commenced the largest program in
its history for the expansion and extension of its pipelme system.
Funds for the major portion of the cost of this construction were
obtained initially from short-term bank loans in the amount of $20
million."
Early in 1951 the Southern Natural sold $17,500,000 of its
first mortgage bonds due in 1970, and 155,546 shares of additional common stock to yield aggregate proceeds of $22,666,250,87 which were
used to repay the bank loans. Upon consummation of this financing,
the ratio of common equity to total capitalization and surplus of the
system was approximately 44 percent.
Over the past five years, Southern Natural's gross plant account
has doubled from about $50 million over $100 million .

Union Electric Company of Missouri

Union Electric Company of Missouri ("Union Electric") is an operating-holding company serving a sizeable area in the State of Missouri,
including the City of St. Louis, and through its utility subsidiary,
Union Electric Power Company, the southwest portion of illinois.
Union Electric is at present a subsidiary of The North American
Company, a registered holding company, which, at one time, controlled
36 utility and 46 non-utility companies and through them operated in
10 States and the District of Columbia. Union Electric is the sole
remaining direct utility subsidiary of The North American Company.
On December 29,1950, North American Light & Power Company,
a wholly-owned subsidiary of The North American Company, transferred pursuant to Commission approval its holdings of all of the
common stock of its subsidiary, Missouri Power & Light Company,
to The North American Company, in partial liquidation. Immediately thereafter, The North American Company transferred these
holdings to Union Electric Company of Missouri, its direct subsidiary, in return for 600,000 shares of the latter's common stock."
Union Electric, as a part of the transaction, agreed to dispose of several utility properties not capable of integration with its own properties and certain non-utility properties all of which were owned by
Missouri Power & Light Company. Sales of an electric distribution
system and of some ice manufacturing equipment were consummated
prior to the close of the fiscal year.
Union Electric and its subsidiaries are engaged in an extensive
construction program which will require expenditures for the years
1951 through 1955 of approximately $161 million. The funds required for the fiscal year were derived principally from the sale by
Union Electric, in April and June 1950, of 700,000 shares of its common stock to The North American Company for $10 million and the
sale, in December 1950, of $25 million of mortgage bonds to the
public."
During the past year, Union Electric, together with four other
utility companies, participated in the formation of a new corporation
known as Electric Energy, Inc. This represented a significant development in the utility industry and in the history of administration of the act. The new company was organized to build and own
a 500,000 K w generating station at Joppa, Illinois, for the purpose
of supplying one half of the power requirements of the Paducah,
Kentucky, plant of the Atomic Energy Commission. The main question presented to the Commission for determination was whether,
under the standards of the act, the common stock of Electric Ener~,
Inc., amounting to $3,500,000,might be acquired by the organizers III
the following proportions: Union Electric, 40 percent; Middle South
Utilities, Inc., 10 percent; Kentucky Utilities Company, 10 percent;
and Illinois Power Company, 20 percent. The first two of these companies were registered holding companies and the latter two were
exempt holding companies. The remaining stock was to be acquired
by Central Illinois Public Service Company, which was not a holding
company subject to the act. The type of showing required of the
applicants to support their proposed acquisitions would ordinarily
necessitate extensive proof, consuming considerable time. Due to the

importance of this project to the national defense and the expedition
required in its building, the Commission decided that, since the project
was not "business as usual", it merited postponement of "regulation
as usual"; accordingly, it postponed to more normal times the taking
of evidence which would be required to justify the acquisition of the
stock and permitted the acquisition on an interim basis,'?
The proposed financing of this project by means of the sale of not
more than $100 million of first mortgage bonds to two insurance companies and the sale of the $3,500,000 of common stock to the organizers
also raised a serious question as to the propriety of such a capital
structure. The Commission expressed the view that the problem
raised by this unbalance in the capital structure could be resolved
favorably, in view of the financial commitments of the Atomic Energy
Commission which have the effect of guaranteeing repayment of a substantial portion of the indebtedness.sThe United Gas Improvement Co.

The United Gas Improvement Company ("UGI") is a registered
holding company, incorporated under the laws of Pennsylvania, having nine subsidiaries. Six are gas utility companies, one is a gas and
electric utility company, and two are non-utilities. The operations
of all subsidiaries are conducted within the State of Pennsylvania.
In April 1951, UGI disposed of its only subsidiary having out-ofstate operations when it accepted a $1 million note from Delaware
Coach Company in exchange for 10,000 shares of that company's common stock and sold the balance of 26,000 outstanding shares to an
unaffiliated person for $400,000.92 Delaware Coach Company conducts a transportation business in Wilmington, New Castle, and
Newark, Delaware. It also has two wholly-owned subsidiaries, Delaware Bus Company and Southern Pennsylvania Bus Company.
On June 15, 1951, the Commission approved a voluntary exchange
plan, submitted by UGI, intended to reduce the substantial amount
of minority interest investments in the portfolio of UGI.93 A substantial portion of these holdings had been received by UGI in exchange for the latter's investments in holdi!1$ companies which were
reorganized under section 11 of the act. under the plan, UGI offered to exchange for each unit of five shares of its own stock (to the
extent of 363,285 shares), three shares of common stock of Philadelphia Electric Company and two shares of common stock of Consumers
Power Company. Stockholders tendering from one to four shares
of UGI stock received a cash payment in lieu of stock on an equivalent
basis. Shareholders of VGI stock tendered 329,940 shares eligible for
the exchange offer and 5,691 additional shares were retired by cash
payment. As a result of these transactions, the outstanding capital
stock of UGI has been reduced from 1,566,371 shares to 1,230,740
shares. UGI is under order to dispose of all of its remaining nonsubsidiary security holdings.

its preemptive rights provisions, and a change in the date of stockholders' annual meeting." On April 30, 1951, the Commission approved an application by Utah to purchase from the Village of Area,
Idaho, the electrical distribution lines and facilities, together with a
transmission line owned by Arco, for a cash consideration of $100,000.98
The West Penn Electric Company

The West Penn Electric Company ("West Penn") is the parent
holding company in a utilitv system deriving about 90 percent of its
revenues from sales of electric power and servicing a territory located
principally in Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Maryland. Small
adjacent sections of Ohio and Virginia are also served. West Penn
was formerly a subsidiary of American Water Works & Electric Company, Inc., which was liquidated in January 1948.
The West Penn system presently has in progress a construction
program, which for the calendar years 1951 and 1952 contemplates the
expenditure of more than $75 million. On February 21, 1951, the
Commission approved the sale by West Penn of 320,000 shares of its
common stock, at competitive bidding, with proceeds in excess of
*8,500,000.99 In April 1951, bond financings undertaken by two of
the subsidiary operating companies furnished additional funds of
over $20 million.'
The Commission now has before it a residual problem deriving
from the liquidation of West Penn's former parent company, American 'Vater Works & Elertic Company, Inc. In October 1947, American Water Works & Electric Company, Inc., undertook to retire its
outstanding publicly-held preferred stock. This was accomplished
by cash payment of the liquidation preference of $100 per share and
accrued dividends to October 15, 1947. Furthermore, at the direction
of the Commission and with the approval of the United States District Court for the District of Delaware, escrow certificates were issued

to the holders of the preferred stock as evidence of claims for such
additional payments as the Commission might subsequently determine
in fairness and equity should be made. In December 1950, after
public hearings and the submission of briefs, the Division of Public
Utilities submitted a recommended decision to the Commission proposing an additional payment of $10 per share plus compensation for
delay in payment at the rate of 5.45 percent from October 15, 1947.
On March 15, 1951, oral argument was heard and the Commission now
has the matter under advisement.
ACQillSITIONS OF SECURITIES, UTILITY ASSETS AND OTHER
INTERESTS

Under the provisions of sections 9 and 10 of the Holding Company
Act the Commission passes upon numerous applications covering
acquisitions of securities, utility assets or other interests. The major
portion of these applications reflect the acquisitions by parent holding
companies of securities issued by their subsidiaries. In this area, the
Commission exercises jurisdiction over the manner in which parent
holding companies finance the expansion of their subsidiary companies.
This is one of the most important functions of the modern holding
company. During the past fiscal year, for example, holding companies purchased securities of their subsidiaries totaling $216 million.
The review of these intercompany security sales is important because
of their effect u'pon the ultimate financial mtegrity of the utility operating subsidiaries,
The maintenance of sound and balanced financial
programing at this level is also an important aspect of the Commission's assistance to State regulatory commissions in preserving the
stability of utility enterprises operating within their jurisdiction.
Public utilities, unlike most other industries, are usually faced with
the problem of expanding plant facilities in periods of depression as
well as prosperity. A high degree of financial flexibility is therefore
essential in order to insure maintenance of adequate service to
consumers.
A smaller proportion of the applications under section 10 relates to
the acquisition of securities, assets or other interests outside the previous scope of operation of the applicant systems. In many cases
these acquisitions reflect the growing trend of positive integration
reported in earlier years. Important examples during the fiscal year
1951 included the American Gas and Electric Company's acquisition
of the common stock of Central Ohio Light & Power Company, acquisition of the stock of Birmingham Electric Company by The Southern
Company from Electric Bond and Share Company and other holders,
the acquisition by Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation of certain
properties from two non-affiliated companies in the State of New York,
the purchase by Eastern Utilities Associates of additional common
stock of Fall River Electric Light Company from New England Electric System, and the acquisition by a subsidiary in the Consolidated
Natural Gas Company system of gas utility assets from a subsidiary of
West Penn Electric Company. An exchange of property was also
consummated between Louisiana Power & Light Company, a subsidiary of Middle South Utilities, Inc., and Gulf Public Service Company, Inc., a subsidiary of an exempt holding company.
Well over $1 billion of utility assets have been acquired by holding

company systems and utility operating companies over the past several
years thereby effecting a greater degree of integration of facilities.
FINANCING

During the 12 months ending June 30, 1951, 313 questions were
presented to the Commission for determination pursuant to sections 6
and 7 of the act, under which the Commission is required to pass upon
the issuance of securities, and assumptions of liability and alterations
of rights of securities, by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries. A total of 326 questions were disposed of during the year,
including a few carried over from the latter part of the preceding year.
All but 37 of these related to issues of securities. In the fiscal year
1950,337 questions were disposed of under sections 6 and 7.
Following the pattern established in 1948,financing during the past
year has been predominantly for the purpose of meeting very heavy
construction expenditures. On an industry-wide basis, expenditures
of electric and gas utilities for the past year, exclusive of investment in
natural gas transmission facilities, are estimated to have been in excess
of $2,400,000,000. However, public offerings of securities for the
fiscal year 1951 did not match in volume the total for 1950which established a peak level for the industry. The tabulation set forth below
includes all security sales for cash, plus refunding exchanges, by electric and gas utility operating companies which have been approved
under sections 6 and 7 of the act. The table also includes similar
security sales by all other electric and gas utility companies in the
United States which have registered their issues with the Commission
under the Securities Act of 1933. The data for gas utilities cover
only those companies which are engaged in the retail distribution of
natural or manufactured gas. Private placements of securities not
subject to either the Holding Company Act or the Securities Act of
19~3 are separately identified, although the figures are at best rongh
estimates,

ernment bond market, thereby inducing a substantial reduction in the
prices of corporate bonds and preferred stocks. Market receptivity
for preferred issues has been affected to a much greater degree than
was the case with bonds and debentures, and the growth of private
placements may also be traced, in part, to the same causes. An encouraging aspect of the over-all pattern of utility financing has been
the sustained employment of common stock offerings, which contributes to the long-term stability of the industry.
With the further contraction in the numbers of companies subject
to active regulatory jurisdiction under the act, as a result of divestments under section 11, there has been some corresponding decline in
the volume of financing approved under sections 6 and 7, although
the trend seems to be levelling off as the program of integration and
simplification approaches completion. The expansion of the continuing systems is proceeding at a rapid pace, and their financing
requirements account for approximately one-third of the total for the
industry.
Furthermore, the intensification of defense preparations
and the persistence of a tense international situation suggest continuation of heavy cash requirements for an extended period.
The following tables analyze in detail the volume of securities sold
for cash, or issued in exchange for refunding, by registered holding
companies and their subsidiaries pursuant to authorization of the
Commission under sections 6 and 7. Portfolio sales and issues in connection with reorganization are excluded. Significantly, these data
reflect the use of a higher proportion of common equity financing by
utility companies subject to regulation under the act than is the case
for the industry as a whole, as reflected in the preceding tabulation.

In the fiscal year 1950, debt offerings of the electric and gas utilities
in registered holding company systems represented 61.6 percent
of the total financing of these companies, preferred stock accounted
for 7.6 percent and common stock 30.8 percent. In 1951 the proportions were as follows: debt, 60.0 percent; preferred stock, 11.3 percent;
common stock, 28.7 percent.
One of the most important functions of the public utility holding
company is the furnishing of capital to its subsidiaries.
During the
fiscal year 1951 holding companies registered under the act purchased
for cash $119,389,000 of common stocks issued by their subsidiaries, In
addition they purchased $102,290,000 of subsidiary debt securities and
preferred stocks. To raise the cash required for the assistance, registered holding companies sold $218,159,000 of their own securities to the
public, including $75,332,000 of common stock and $142,827,000 of debentures. In 1950 holding companies raised $299,909,000 through the
sale of $114,984,000 of their common stocks and $184,925,000 of senior
securities. With the proceeds they purchased $139,600,000 of the common stocks of their subsidiaries and $60,300,000 of subsidiary senior
securities. With respect to both years the sales of debt securities by
registered holding companies represent for the most part parent company financing in systems where the subsidiaries have little or no senior
securities in the hands of the public thereby enabling the holding
companies to issue senior securities without impairing the consolidated equitYfosition of the system.
The role 0 holding companies in the financing of their subsidiaries
today is in sharp contrast with the situation found by the Congress

SEVENTEENTH

109

in the investigation which it conducted prior to passage of the act.
During the seven-year period from 1924 to 1930 inclusive, public
utility holding companies sold approximately $4,856 million of their
securities to the public. The proceeds from this financing were devoted almost entirely to the purchase of outstanding securities. Only
a negligible portion went into the construction of plant facilities,"
Furthermore, for a period of many years up to 1928, it was the general
practice of holding companies to furnish capital to their subsidiaries
in the form of demand notes or open account advances bearing interest of from 6 to 8 percent and in some large systems the holding companies followed the regular practice of compounding interest
monthly or quarterly,"
By comparison, registered holding companies
have invested in excess of $540,000,000 in the common stocks of their
subsidiaries in the period from July 1,1947, to June 30, 1951.
Another important aspect of the financing of registered holding
company systems during the past year has been the predominance of
the rights offering as a vehicle for raising common equity money.
Total sales of common stocks to the public by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries in 1951 aggregated $144,560,000, of which
holding companies accounted for $75,331,000 and subsidiaries, $69,229,000. Of this amount 14 issues totalling $117,395,000 were sold by
means of rights offerings. In one instance there was a substantial
exercise of rights by a parent holding company. ~
 Stockholder acceptance was less than 100 percent in only three of the offerings.
Probably the most significant development in this group of issues
was the growing importance of the non-underwritten rights offering.
Only five offerings aggregating $37,897,000 were made with the aid
of firm underwriting commitments.
Four issues totalling $22,065,000
were offered without underwriting, but had the benefit of dealer solicitation. The remaining five rights offerings, amounting to $57,433,000 were sold without the benefit of underwriting or dealer solicitation assistance. All five were subscribed in percentages ranging from
106 to 188. In each of these cases the oversubscription privilege made
an important contribution to the success of the sale.
The utility bond market suffered a sharp decline in the last four
months of the fiscal year.
No perceptible change in rates was
evident until March 1951, when prIces of outstandmg utility issues
began to weaken along with the prices on long term government
bonds. The resulting uptrend in yields of outstanding issues, however, did not fully reflect the impact of the change upon new offerings. This becomes evident from a comparison of several successive
utility offerings, all classified by the investment rating agencies as of
generally comparable quality.
On December 7, 1950, an electric utility company offered $6 million
of 30 year mortgage bonds at a cost of money to the company of 2.87
percent. On April 5, 1951, some time after the decline in government
bond prices had set in, another electric utility of comparable credit
sold $10 million of mortgage bonds of similar maturity at a cost to
the company of 3.345 percent. This increase of almost one-half of

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

one percent brought interest costs to the highest level in several r,ears.
Although there was some leveling off in new money rates in April, the
relief was only temporary. On June 28, 1951, another offering of
electric utility bonds bearing the same credit rating and maturity
was made at a cost 3.675 percent. This issue represented the high
point of interest costs for the period and the issue was quickly absorbed by institutional purchasers. Subsequent offerings in the same
quality group were made at more favorable rates until early in
September 1951, when yields again turned upward.
This marked change in money costs may have a considerable impact
upon the industry. For a long period the low rates available on
senior security offerings were a significant offset to increased operating expenses and, in the financing of new construction, they provided
added assurance of an adequate return on new equity investment.
Further increases in the cost of raising new capital may result in
greater pressure on the utility rate structure, although throughout
this period of weakness in the prices of debt securities and preferred
stocks, utility common stocks have been readily saleable in substantial
amounts, and utility managements on the whole have taken advantage of the opportunities presented.
COMPETITIVE

BIDDING

Offerings of securities by issuing companies under sections 6 (b) and
7 of the act and portfolio sales by registered holding companies under
section 12 (d) are required to be made at competitive bidding in
accordance with the provisions of rule U-50. Certain special types
of sales, including issues of less than $1 million, short term bank
loans, issues the acquisition of which have been authorized under section 10 and pro rata issues to existing security holders are automatically exempt under clauses (1) through (4) of paragraph (a) of
the rule. In paragraph (a) (5) the Commission retains the right
to grant exemptions by order where it appears that competitive bidding is not necessary or appropriate to carry out the provisions of the
act.
Securities sold at competitive bidding under rule U-50 from its
effective date, May 7, 1941, to June 30, 1951, total in excess of $6,770,000,000. A tabular presentation showing the various classes of
securities, number of issues and amounts, for the entire period and for

REPORT

The experience of the Commission in administering rule U-50 has
adequately demonstrated its workability and effectiveness in maintaining competitive conditions and in achieving minimum costs of
flotation. The Commission has always recognized, however, that
flexibility in administration was a necessity and it has granted a
considerable number of exemptions in cases where unusual circumstances were present. In the 10-year period since the rule became
effective, 202 security issues totalling in excess of $1,566,000,000 have
been exempted by Commission order from the competitive bidding
requirements. Ten issues with a value of $151,772,000 were exempted
in fiscal 1951. These are exclusive of the automatic exemptions. The
following table summarizes these exempted sales by type of security
and also shows the numbers and amounts of issues sold with and without underwriting arrangements.

REVISION

OF REGULATORY

PROCEDURES

Now that the task of integration and simplification of many of the
holding company systems has been substantially completed, steps have
been taken to streamline the procedures employed in regulation of the
continuing systems down to the simplest possible dimensions. As a
starting point, the Commission undertook during the past year a
thorough-going revision of its Form U5S which is required to be filed
annually by registered holding company systems. The modifications
which were incorporated in the new form were designed to minimize
reporting requirements and adjust its provisions to the pattern of the
surviving holding company systems. Under the revised form all
registered holding companies in the same system may join in the
filing of a single report. Another change permits copies of this report
(less certain exhibits) to be filed by registered holding companies in
complete satisfaction of all annual reporting requirements under sections 13 and 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Furthermore, the Commission abolished Form U-l4-3, an additional filing
heretofore required to be made annually by re~stered holding companies, as well as Forms U5-K and U5-MD which registered holding
companies formerly had the option of filing in lieu of Form 10-K.
Eighteen of the 31 registered holding companies required to file reports under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 elected to satisfy the

112

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

requirements of that act for the calendar year 1950 by filing duplicate
copies of the revised Form U5S. Additional systems are expected to
take advantage of this procedure in the coming year.
The Commission presently has under study the revision of Form
U-13-60 which is the annual filing required to be made by the service
companies associated with holding company systems. The objective of
this revision will likewise be maximum simplification, although it
should be noted that the opportunities for integration with the reporting requirements under other statutes administered by the Commission
are not nearly as great as in the case of Form U5S, because the utility
service company is a device peculiar to the registered holding company
system.
INVESTMENT BOND AND SHARE CORPORATION

In the spring of 1951, the staff of the Commission. made an investigation to secure additional details on the published story that three
officers of Investment Bond and Share Corporation ("IBS") proposed
to sell 80,000shares of common stock of Eastern Kansas Utilities, Inc.,
to Kansas City Power and Light Company, both of which companies
were formerly subsidiaries of United Light and Railways Company, a
registered holding company. The investigation disclosed that the
80,000 shares proposed to be sold included 15,299shares owned by IBS,
a Delaware corporation whose principal officesare located in Chicago,
Illinois. It further revealed that IBS, though a holding company as
defined by the statute, for a number of years had taken no steps to effect
its registration or to apply for exemption.
As a direct result of the investigation, IBS registered on July 2,
1951, and on August 8, 1951, submitted a plan under section 11 (e)
designed to effect its ultimate liquidation and dissolution in compliance
with the provisions of section 11 (b).
ORIGINAL COST STUDIES

On April 21, 1941, the Commission adopted rule U-27 which, as
amended on:November 17, 1943, provides that every registered holding
company and every subsidiary thereof, which is a public utility company and which is not required by the Federal Power Commission or a
State commission to conform to a classification of accounts, shall keep
its accounts in accordance with the designated systems adopted by the
Commission for electric and gas utility companies. These systems
specifically provide that utility plant accounts shall be stated at the
original cost incurred by the persons who first devoted the property to
utility service.
Some field examinations of the utility companies' original cost and
reclassification studies were begun in 1945,but it was not until later in
1946 that a staff of accountants was organized for this work and field
audits undertaken on a comprehensive scale. As of June 30, 1951,
the staff had completed the field audits of sixteen companies in various
States which do not have regulatory commissions. During the intervening years, some of the reports filed with this Commission were
transferred to other regulatory authorities for audit due to changes in
applicable jurisdiction as a result of mergers, consolidations and
divestments.
Formal proceedings have been completed and orders of the Commission have been issued with respect to nine of the sixteen companies

examined. Amendments giving effect to the recommendations of the
Commission's staff have been filed by five companies, and these matters
will be closed at an early date. Recommended adjustments affecting
accounts of the other two companies are still under discussion.
The results of examinations conducted by the Commission disclosed
that the utility plant of the companies involved had an original cost
value of approximately two-thirds of the amounts recorded per books
prior to reclassification.
The remaining one-third of the recorded
amounts was transferred to adjustment accounts. Almost 75 percent
of the difference between the amount recorded per books and original
cost has been classified as Account 107, Plant Adjustments, and required to be written off immediately. The balance has been classified
as Account 100.5, Plant Acquisition Adjustments, and will be amortized over a period of years, except in those cases where the company
has elected to dispose of all adjustments immediately.
COOPERATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL REGULATORY AUTHORITIES

The policy of the Commission always has been to cooperate to the
fullest extent with State and local regulatory authorities. Aside from
the many informal contacts and conversations between the Commission
and other agencies, which are too numerous to detail, there were several instances of cooperation during the past year which are worthy of
mention.
An example of the type of cooperation which is possible between the
Federal agency and a State Commission is an investigation which was
conducted by this Commission at the request of a State Commission
during the past year. Because of the confidential nature of the investigation it is possible to give the facts here only in outline. The investigation was conducted under powers granted by the act which, in part,
authorizes the Commission at the request of a State Commission to
...
investigate, or obtain any information regarding tbe business, financial
condition, or practices of any registered holding company or subsidiary company
thereof of facts, conditions, practices, or matters affecting the relations between
any such company and any other company or companies in the same holding
company system.

The State Commission had pending before it a rate proceeding, in the
course of which question had arisen as to the cost of a power plant
which had been constructed for a public utility company by a supplier
of equipment. The equipment supplier, through the indirect ownership of securities, was an affiliate of the public utility company. The
State Commission had doubts as to its jurisdiction over the equipment
supplier and accordingly requested this Commission to conduct an
investigation of the relationships between the utility and the supplier.
The Commission ordered a private investigation and designated four
senior staff members to conduct the inquiry. Hearings were held both
in Washington and elsewhere. The State Commission was invited to
have a representative attend the hearings, which were not open to the
public, and a member of the State Commission did attend a portion of
the hearings. Thereafter the Commission transmitted a confidential
report of its investigators to the State Commission.
American Power & Light Company, a registered holding company in
the Electric Bond and Share COmpany system, is under an order to
liquidate and dissolve. On February 15, 1951, American notified the
Commission of its intention to sell its entire interest in one of its sub-

114

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sidiaries, Washington Water Power Company, to certain public utility
districts. Under the provisions of rule U-44 (c) promulgated under
the act, the proposed divestment could be consummated without further proceedings unless, within 10 days after filing of the notice of
intention, the Commission notified American that a declaration or
other formal filing should be filed with respect to the proposed transaction. Thereupon the Commission issued an order to show cause in
which, among other issues, the question was raised as to whether the
Commission had jurisdiction to require American to file a declaration
with respect to the sale of Washington Water Power to public utility
districts. At the request of the State Commissions of Washington and
Idaho the Commission moved its hearings to the territory affected in
order to facilitate the presentation by local people of their views.
Hearings were held in Spokane, Washington, at which a Commissioner
of the Securities and Exchange Commission presided. The hearings
were well attended, and anyone who desired to be heard on the subject
was given an opportunity to appear.
Green Mountain Power Corporation, a Vermont public utility company and a subsidiary of New England Electric System, made application pursuant to section 11 (e) of the act for apJ?roval of a plan of
reorganization.
The Vermont Commission was vitally interested in
the whole program, and during the course of the proceedings its chairman and staff experts conferred with members of the Commission staff,
resulting in a mutually helpful exchange of ideas. The AttorneyGeneral of the State of Vermont appeared on behalf of the Vermont
Commission at the hearings on the plan.
In August 1950 the Commission instituted proceedings pursuant to
section 11 (b) (1) of the act directed to WIsconsin Electric Power
Company and its subsidiaries. Wisconsin Electric Power Company
is both a holding company and an electric utility operating company,
with its property located in the State of Wisconsin. It also has a
gas utility subsidiary and a transportation subsidiary, both operating
III that state.
Prior to a hearing in these proceedings representatives
of the Commission's staff visited the officesof the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin and discussed the matter with members of its
staff. Since the proceedings have been in progress, the scheduling of
adjourned hearings has been made after determining what dates would
be convenient for representatives of the State Commission, and copies
of the transcript of testimony have been forwarded to it.
In connection with the preparation for hearing of proceedings under
section 11 (b) (1) directed to General Public Utilities Corporation,
to determine whether or not the company might retain its gas 1?roperties along with its electric properties, members of the Commission's
staff visited the officesof the State Commissions of Maryland, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and
Connecticut. This field trip was made for the purpose of obtaining
statistical and other data regarding comparative cost of operations of
manufactured gas utilities versus manufactured gas departments of
predominantly electric utility companies. The Commission staff members were afforded full cooperation.
In the same case, but involving the question of the extent of the
principal integrated electric utility system of General Public Utilities
Corporation, an attorney and an engineer of the Pennsylvania Commission attended the Securities and Exchange Commission hearings

as observers and had discussions with members of the latter Commission's staff with regard to the questions involved.
UTIGATION

UNDER THE PUBUC

UTIUTY HOLDING COMPANY ACT

During the fiscal year 1951 the Commission participated in 18 judicial proceedings involving issues arising under the Holding Company
Act. Eleven of these proceedings concerned the enforcement of voluntary" plans filed under section 11 (e) of the act, and the other seven
were initiated by petitions to review orders of the Commission. Fifteen of these cases were finally adjudicated favorably to the Commission and the remaining three were pending at the close of the fiscal
year. Over the 16 years since enactment of the Holding Company Act,
a total of 274 civil and criminal proceedings, exclusive of Bankruptcy
Act proceedings, in which the validity or enforcement of the statute
was in issue, have been initiated in the courts. Three proceedings
were pending on June 30, 1951, and of the 271 which have been litigated to finality, only one case was terminated adversely to the Commission. In two other cases, decisions adverse to the Commission were
vacated as moot. The Commission's activity in the courts during the
1951 fiscal year is shown in the following tables:

Actions to Enforce Voluntary Plans Under Section 11 (e)

Two applications for enforcement of voluntary plans were pending
in United States district courts at the beginning of the fiscal year 1951.
One of these plans related to the liquidation of Market Street Railway
Co. The Commission had found that counsel for a preferred stockholders' committee was not entitled to receive a fee for his services
since he had been acting in his own interest primarily rather than in
the interests of the committee and of the company and that, although
he had rendered valuable services, his failure to devote his time and
efforts solely to the interests of his clients precluded him from being
compensated for such services," The district court agreed with the
Commission on all phases of the plan except that which denied the
attorney's fee and remanded the plan to the Commission for reconsideration," The Commission took an appeal from the court's refusal
to approve the denial of a fee, and a cross-appeal was also filed. The
plan was then amended to separate into Step One the settlement of
claims and the distribution of the major assets of Market Street, and
into Step Two the attorney's application for a fee and certain other
matters. The Commission approved Step One of the plan and reserved jurisdiction over Step Two. Upon application the district
court approved Step One.' An appeal from the district court's order
was taken and was consolidated with the pending appeals. A stay
was denied and Step One was consummated. These appeals were pending at the close of the fiscal year. The second plan provided for a
partial liquidation of American Power and Light Company. The
district court approved the plan without opinion and no appeal was
taken.
Five applications for enforcement of voluntary plans were filed in
United States district courts during the fiscal year. The first of these
plans involved the question of what additional amounts, if any, should
be paid to holders of certificates representing claims on $6 and $5 preferred stock of Electric Bond and Share Company which had been
retired. The Commission decided, and the district court agreed," that
the holders of the $6 certificates were entitled to an additional $10 plus
compensation for delay in receipt of that amount, and that the $5 certificates were entitled to nothing more. Appeals were taken from the
order of the district court and Bond and Share petitioned the Supreme
Court to review the district court order. The Supreme Court denied
Bond and Share's petition 0 and after the close of the fiscal year, the
appeals were dismissed on stipulation of the parties.
One of the remaining four plans paralleled the Bond and Share
case and presented the question what additional amounts, if any,
should be paid to $7 and $6 prior lien preferred stockholders of New
England Public Service Company. Th.e Commission's determination
that they should receive, respectively, $12.25 and $2.25 per share, plus
compensation for delay, was confirmed by the district court and no
appeals were taken from the enforcement order."
The third of these plans concerned the distribution of escrowed
common stock of Interstate Power Company. The principal question

presented was what participation should be accorded Ogden Corporation in its dual position as creditor and stockholder of Interstate visa-vis public security holders. The Commission found fair and equitable a compromise of the issues and the plan was approved by the
district court," No appeal was taken from the Commission's order.
A plan providing for a recapitalization of Green Mountain Power
Corp. and a settlement of claims between Green Mountain and its
parent, New England Electric System, was enforced without opposition. The remaining plan was pending in the district court at the
close of the fiscal year.
Shortly before the close of the preceding fiscal year a plan of recapitalization of Eastern Gas & Fuel Associates had been approved by
a district court. At the time of approval the court reserved jurisdiction to approve the amount at which the common stock of the company
might be surrendered for which the stockholders would be paid in cash.
The company petitioned for and was granted a supplemental order
approving an amount of $11.00 per share as the settlement price.
Two plans were pending in United States courts of appeal at the
beginning of the fiscal year. The first of these plans, approved by the
Commission and the district court, involved the liquidation of The
Commonwealth & Southern Corporation (Del.) in which the holders
of option warrants were denied any participation.
As originally submitted to the Commission this plan left undecided the disposition of
residual assets of Commonwealth.
Prior to consummation of the plan,
it was amended to provide that the residual assets should be transferred
to The Southern Company, a subsidiary holding company created to
own the capital stock of certain former subsidiaries of Commonwealth.
An investment banker's petition to intervene in the district court was
denied. During the fiscal year the court of appeals affirmed orders
of the district court denying intervention" and approving the plan,"
and petitions for writs of certiorari were subsequently denied.>
The second plan which was pending at the beginning of the fiscal
year and which was affirmed related to an order of a district court
which approved and enforced a plan for the dissolution of Federal
'Water and Gas Corporation. The appellants were officers, directors
and controlling stockholders of a predecessor company, Federal Water
Service Corporation. They asserted that the district court erred in
approving that part of the plan which excluded them from participation as stockholders in the distribution of the assets of Water and
Gas with regard to preferred stock of Water Service which they had
acquired during the course of reorganization of Water Service. The
'Vater Service plan had provided that they receive cash representing
their cost of the Water Service preferred, and not new stock of Water
and Gas, and the Commission's approval of that plan had been upheld
by the Supreme Court." The court of appeals held that the prior
decision was res judicata and affirrred the district court enforcement

The Supreme Court denied petitions for certiorari seeking
review of the district court order 17 and of the court of appeals order.Is
At the end of the preceding fiscal year a court of appeals had reversed an order of a district court approving a plan for the reorganization of Long Island Lighting Company.w Appellants had asserted on
appeal that the Commission, in passing upon the plan of Long Island,
had not given consideration to earnings which would accrue as the
result of the reorganization and that in determining the fairness of
the allocation of new securities the Commission had erred. The Commission petitioned for a modification of the decision of the court of appeals and for approval of the plan on the basis of a supplemental
opinion showing that full consideration had been given to such benefits. The petition was granted during the fiscal year 1951,2Â° One
proceeding involving reorganization plans of Niagara Hudson Power
Corporation was pending in the Supreme Court at the beginning of the
fiscal year. The Commission had held that the holders of option warrants were not entitled to participate in the reorganization.
The
district court had approved the plans, and the court of appeals had
reversed the district court order on this one point."
Petitions for a
rehearing had been denied and the Commission and the company had
petitioned for certiorari, which had been granted by the Supreme
Court. During the fiscal year the Supreme Court reviewed the plan,
reversed the order of the court of appeals and affirmed the order of the
district court."
Petitions to Review Orders of the Commission

Three petitions to review orders of the Commission were pending in
United States courts of appeals at the beginning of the fiscal year and
three petitions were filed during the fiscal year. In four cases the
Commission's order was affirmed, and in the other two cases the appeals
were dismissed.
Two of the petitions which were pending were from orders of the
Commission approving various matters collateral to the reorganization of the Niagara Hudson Power Corporation system. The Commission had approved an application of The United Corporation to
distribute approximately half of its holdings of Niagara Hudson
common stock to its own common stockholders.
The Commission's
order was affirmed." The other such petition sought review of an
order of the Commission approving the exchange by United of common stock of Niagara Hudson for the capital stock of Niagara Mohawk Power Corporation, the surviving top company in the reorganization of the Niagara Hudson system. The appeal was dismissed
without opinion."

One of the three petitions filed during the fiscal year sought review
of an order of the Commission which had denied a committee authority to solicit stockholders of The United Corporation for proxies in
connection with a yending- plan. The Commission found that the
solicitation materia contained false and misleading statements, and
that the proposed solicitation would be detrimental to the pending
reorganization proceeding. The Commission's order was affirmed,"
Another review proceeding was initiated by two petitions seeking
review of an order which granted to preferred stockholders of Federal Light and Traction Company an additional amount over that
previously received, together with interest for delay in receipt of
the payment. These petitions were consolidated on appeal. The court
of appeals affirmed the Commission's order and certiorari was denied."
The third petition for review initiated during the fiscal year sought
reversal of a Commission order which had denied the application of
a registered holding company for an examiner's report with respect
to the petition of the company in opposition to solicitation of stockholders. The appeal was dismissed for lack of jurisdiction."
During the preceding fiscal year a United States court of appeals had

PART IV
PARTICIPATION OF THE COMMISSION IN CORPORATE RE.
ORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACI', AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations (other than railroads) in the Federal courts.
The Commission's duties under Chapter X are, at the request or with
the approval of the court, to participate in proceedings to provide
the court and investors with independent expert assistance on the
various legal and financial questions that arise in the proceeding and
to prepare for the benefit of the courts and investors advisory reports
on plans of reorganization. The Commission has no statutory right
of appeal in a Chapter X proceeding, but it may participate in appeals
taken by others.
COMMISSION'S

FUNCTIONS

UNDER

CHAPTER

X

The role of the Commission under Chapter X is different from that
under the statutes which it administers. The Commission does not
administer Chapter X. It acts in a purely advisory capacity. It has
no authority either to veto or to require the adoption of a plan of
reorganization or to render a decision on any other issue in the :proceeding. The facilities of its technical staff and its recommendations
are at the service of the judge and the security holders, affording
them the views of experts in a highly complex area of corporate law
and finance.
Generally, the Commission has sought to participate only in proceedings in which there is a public investor interest; $250,000 of publicly
held securities is the rough guide used in deciding whether there is
enough public interest to make it worth while for the Commission to
participate.
Sometimes the Commission has entered smaller cases,
particularly when requested by the court, where public security holders are not adequately represented, where it appears that the proceedings are being conducted in violation of important provisions of the
Act, or where the Commission may otherwise be useful by participat-

mg.
Even where the public interest is too small to warrant active intervention by the Commission, the staff may follow a case and watch the
course taken by the proceedings in order to make suggestions or comments on an informal basis when requested or when it is deemed desirable. Because of its nation-wide activity and its experience in
Chapter X cases the Commission is able to respond to requests for help
in the interpretation and application of the provisions of Chapter X.
The Commission and its staff are often called upon by trustees or their
counsel, other parties, referees, special masters, and judges for advice
or comments.
SUMMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission actively participated during the 1951 fiscal year
in 64 reorganization proceedings involving the reorganization of 87

companies with aggregate stated assets of $774,252,000 and aggregate

with aggregate stated assets of $3,243,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $3,028,000. At the close of the year, the Commission
was actively participating in 53 reorganization proceedings involving
75 companies with aggregate stated assets of $129,402,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $454,852,000.
Some of the more important matters and issues with which the
Commission was concerned during the last fiscal year in connection
with its Chapter X functions are discussed in the following paragraphs:
Activities Relating to the Trusteeship

A fundamental feature of Chapter X is that in every case involving
a corporation of substantial size an independent trustee is appointed
to be primarily responsible for the operation of the corporation's business during the proceeding, to examine and evaluate the reasons for
the debtor's financial difficulties, to appraise the ability and fidelity
of its management and to formulate and file a plan of reorganization.
The success of the reorganization depends largely on the thoroughness,
skill, and loyalty with which he and his counsel perform their tasks.
The Commission customarily examines the qualifications of trustees
in the light of the standards of disinterestedness prescribed by the
statute for trustees and their counsel.
In M 088er v. Darrow, a broadly significant case emphasizing the
high fiduciary standards applicable to trustees, the Commission was
upheld by the United States Supreme Court. As reported in the
Sixteenth Annual Report, the Commission had sought to surcharge
a former trustee for profits made by his employees through trading
in securities of the debtor's subsidiaries. The Court of Appeals for
the Seventh Circuit reversed an order of the district court insofar
as it surcharged the trustee. The Supreme Court in turn reversed the
Court of Appeals and held that the trustee should be surcharged to
the extent of the profits made by the trustee's employees," In its
opinion the Court pointed out that bankruptcy trustees are permitted
no interest adverse to the trust because such interests "are always corrupting." Equity seeks, the Court stated, to avoid "delicate inquiries"
into the conduct of trustees by exacting forbearance of all opportunities to advance their self-interest. Recognizing that "these strict
prohibitions would serve little l?urpose if the trustee were free to
authorize others to do what he IS forbidden," the Court said: "We
think that which the trustee had no right to do he had no right to
authorize." To permit such conduct would, in the Court's opinion,
open up opportunities for devious dealings in the name of others by
the trustee. Answering the argument that a surcharge here creates
a very heavy liability upon one who did not personally profit, the
Court stated that, while courts are likely to protect trustees from disinterested mistakes in business judgment, a trusteeship is a serious business and is not to be undertaken lightly or so discharged, and that the

most effective sanction for good administration is personal liability
for the consequences of forbidden acts.
In one case,a the Commission objected to the retention in office of a
trustee who was also the court-appointed trustee of the debtor's parent
corporation. The Commission pointed out that, since the parent company owned all the stock of the debtor, its position was adverse to that
of the bondholders of the debtor and that the trustee stood in the position of the parent company and was thus subject to a conflict of interest. The Commission's recommendations were not taken by the district
court. An appeal from the court's ruling was filed by a bondholder
and is pending.
The statute permits the appointment of an "additional trustee" who
may be a director, officeror employee of the debtor for the limited purpose of participating with the disinterested trustee in the operation
of the business and the management of the debtor's property. The
Commission has always held the view that this exception to the rule
requiring a trustee to be completely independent and disinterested
should not be used freely or loosely. It has been the Commission's
position that the provision was intended only for the exceptional case
where the services and experience of such a person are essential to the
business operations of the trusteeship and would not otherwise be
available; it was certainly not intended to detract in any degree from
the fundamental purpose of eliminating management control of reorganization proceedings. During the past fiscal year, in the Chapter
X case involving Ooeasi Oit'V Automobile Bridge Oompany;' the Commission had occasion to reiterate this position as amicus curiae in a
brief before the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit. The Commission also pointed out the dangers inherent in the appointment of
additional trustees: the conflicts which may arise when business
decisions affecting the interests of the management must be made,
the difficulties and embarrassment when the independent trustee must
investigate the past conduct of such persons or their associates either in
evaluating management or in determining whether causes of action
exist. In accord with the Commission's ~ew, the Court stated:
The legislative history indicates that it was the intention of Congress that an
additional operating trustee should be appointed only in those exceptional cases
where the services of an individual who had been a director, officeror employee
of the debtor were necessary to operate its business and manage its property and
it was not feasible for the trustee to secure the services of the individual in
question by employing him in the ordinary way. It was only in an unusual case
of that kind that a director, officer,or employeeof the debtor was to be appointed
as an additional operating trustee.

The Court went further and held that, while an additional trustee
may be an officer, director or employee of the debtor, he may not have
any other conflicting relationship or interest as enumerated in the
statute. Thus he may not be a creditor, stockholder, underwriter or
attorney for the debtor or underwriter, or have any material interest
adverse to any class of creditors or stockholders. The Court believed
the exception for an "additional trustee" was not intended to open
the door to persons who had a financial stake in the debtor's future
which might make it difficult for them to act independently.
The Commission is also interested in assuring that the appointment
of trustees does not in itself operate as a drain on the debtor's assets.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

In one case during thelast fiscal year, the Commission felt that the
continuation in office 0 two trustees was an unnecessary expense to
the debtor. The two trustees had been appointed when the company
was still in operation.
Eventually, however, the business activities
were terminated and the duties of the trustees became ministerial in
nature. The business of the reorganization had become primarily a
matter of the disposition of various claims in litigation.
For this
reason the Commission petitioned the court to reduce the number of
trustees to one. The district court denied the petition and the question was appealed. The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed the lower court and directed that one of the trustees be removed,"
Problems in the Administration of the Estate

One of the objectives of Chapter X is that judicial supervision of
the reorganization process and creditor and stockholder participation
therein is based upon complete and impartial information regarding
the affairs of the debtor. Thus, the independent trustee, at the direction of the court, is required to investigate the acts, conduct, property,
liabilities, and financial condition of the debtor, the operation of its
business, and the desirability of the continuance thereof, and to transmit a report of his investigation to creditors and stockholders. Such
reports aid the court in considering problems in the administration
of the estate as well as the fairness and feasibility of a plan of reorganization, enable security holders and other parties to a proceeding
to make helpful and effective suggestions for a plan of reorganization
and give security holders the necessary information to determine the
desirability of accepting a proposed plan.
.
The Commission has continued its policy of consultation through
its staff with trustees in connection with their investigations and the
preparation of their reports.
On the basis of its own investigations
and its wide experience the Commission has been able to supply data
and suggestions useful to the trustee. It has also continued to assist
trustees in their investigation of possible claims against the old management and other persons.
In the Chapter X proceedings involving South Bay Oonsolidated
Water 00., Inc.,s questions have been raised regarding the allowance
of large debt claims asserted by New York Water Service Corporation,
parent company of the debtor. These issues are still unresolved and
may not require determination in view of the probable payment in full
of the claims and interests of all public bondholders and preferred
stockholders under a plan of reorganization with cash obtained from
the condemnation of the debtor's property and from operations., The
claims asserted by New York Water Service are based III part uJ?on advances made to South Bay by New York Water Service and III part
upon a note issued in 1931 by South Bay to Federal Water Service
Corporation, which was the parent company of New York until 1947.
New York Water Service acquired the note from Federal in 1947 as
part of a divestment plan of Federal under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act. New York Water Service paid $1,000 for the note,
the principal amount of which was $227,000 with accrued interest of
over $200,000. In addition to other defenses and counterclaimsz investigation by the trustee, with the active assistance of the Commission's

staff, revealed that if Federal had not made certain alleged excessive
service charges, had not entered into certain real estate transactions
in which South Bay sustained losses, and had paid to South Bay for
certain properties the same price at which it contemporaneously sold
those properties to New York Water Service, the large advances to
South Bay would have been unnecessary and South Bay would not be
faced with claims of over $1,000,000, including interest charges.
Claims directly against Federal arising out of the transactions
mentioned above were asserted by the trustee and were settled by the
payment of a substantial sum to South Bay. While the trustee and the
Commission's staff were engaged in investigating the relationship of
the debtor to New York Water Service and to Federal, the trustee
was informed that Federal had proposed to compromise various claims
that New York Water Service was asserting against Federal before
the Commission under the Holding Company Act in connection with
the liquidation and distribution of Federal's assets. The proposal
was to pay New York Water Service $250,000, including $7,000 to
reflect minor claims presented by New York Water Service on behalf
of South Bay. The trustee thereupon asserted his own claims on behalf of South Bay, based upon allegations respecting excessive service
charges, over-payments for real estate sold to South Bay, underpayments for securities purchased from South Bay, and claims that
certain advances should have been made as equity capital investment.
Negotiations ensued and an independent settlement was reached between Federal and the trustee of South Bay under which South Bay
was to receive $250,000. The settlement was approved by the Commission after a hearing upon notice under the Holding Company
Act and by the District Court in the Chapter X proceeding.
During the past fiscal year one case presented a novel question arising out of the provisions of New York law. New York statutes
provide that a corporate director who is the successful defendant in an
action involving his directorship may assess his litigation expenses
against the company. A director who had successfully defended an
action brought by the trustee moved, under the authority of the
statute, to assess his expenses against the trustee. The court 7 held
that assuming the statute to be applicable to an action brought pursuant to Chapter X the assessment could not be made because the statutory language did not provide for assessment against a trustee. The
court did not, therefore, reach the question whether the statute constituted an encroachment on the jurisdiction of the bankruptcy court.
A recurrent question is whether the enterprise should be liquidated
through a sale or continued as a going concern through an mternal
plan of reorganization.
The Commission does not support the sale
type of reorganization merely because of its simplicity or certainty
of result, but urges a decision based upon what will yield the greatest
benefit for creditors and stockholders. Where the decision has been
made to sell the assets of the debtor there has been some tendency to
attempt to complete the sale as an a~strative
matter prior to, and
not as part of, a plan of reorganization with its attendant safeguards
for investors. The Commission has urged that where substantially
all of the assets of the debtor are sold the sale should be a part of a
plan of reor~anization, unless some emergency is involved, such as
the need to dispose of perishable property .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

The Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld the Commission's theory in In re Solar Manufacturing Corp.,s holding that no
emergency is created when a prospective purchaser imposes a condition that his offer of purchase must be accepted within a short time.
The Solar case was followed during the fiscal year in In re American
Bantam Oar 00.9 where the court, after hearing the Commission's argument, refused to set a hearing on a proposed sale. The judge advised the trustee that a plan of reorganization should be filed and if
possible the purchase offer should be included in the plan. The Commission has consistently taken the position that when a sale is contemplated the trustee should develop competitive bidding by taking
active affirmative steps in making known the availability of the property. Despite the fact that maintenance of competitive conditions,
through public auction or otherwise, is called for in the best interests
of security holders, the Commission has had occasion to overcome
reluctance on the part of some trustees to develop real competition.
The Commission has pointed out that even where the plan does not
call for a public sale and competitive bidding, the plan may be successively improved by higher offers even after approval by the court
and security holders.
Responsibilities of Fiduciaries

Assuring adherence to the high standards of conduct required of
fiduciaries has continued to be one of the important activities of the
Commission in Chapter X proceedings. We have indicated above
our concern that the independent trustee be free from any conflicts of
interest. The Commission is concerned also with the qualifications of
other fiduciaries in the proceeding, such as indenture trustees, committees, attorneys, and other representatives of security holders.
In one case during the past fiscal year the Commission objected
to the allowance of any fees to a firm of attorneys who had been
subject to conflicting interests. The Commission pointed out that
they had not only represented the petitioning creditors but also the
debtor and the mortgagee in possession of the debtor's plant who was
the debtor's landlord. In addition they represented the president of
the debtor against whom the estate had a claim. The referee, following the Commission's suggestions, recommended that the attorneys De denied any fees. The court agreed that the rule of law required the disallowance of the attorneys' requests for fees.10 The
same case also presented a different and unique question as to the
allowance of fees. The president of the debtor requested compensation for his services as additional trustee of the debtor for the
period up to his resignation. The Commission argued that there existed valid bases for the estate to assert claims against him because of
his conduct as president prior to the proceeding and that the primary
reason these claims were not pressed was the doubt that any judgment
would be collectible. It was urged that the court had summary jurisdiction on an application for fees, in the circumstances here, to consider the clear liability of the president to the estate as offsetting any
fee he might be entitled to. Both the referee and the court agreed
with the Commission, and a fee was denied as in effect a set-off

against the claims of the estate. The determinations in this case were
affirmed after the close of the fiscal year.ll.
Activities With Respect to Allowances

The Commission in its advisory capacity endeavors to protect the
estate from excessive and inequitable charges for fees and expenses
while at the same time providing fair treatment to applicants which
will adequately compensate them for services rendered and encourage
legitimate creditor and stockholder participation in the reorganization process.
The Commission itself receives no allowances from estates in reorganization. It attempts to obtain a limitation of the aggregate
fees to an amount which the estate should fairly and can feasibly pay.
In each case, the applications are carefully studied and recommendations are made in the light of applicable legal standards and, in
general, on the basis of beneficial contributions to the administration
of the estate and to the adoption of a plan of reorganization.
Specific recommendations are made to the courts in cases in which the
Commission has been a party and in which it is familiar with the
services of the various parties and all significant developments in the
case.
The Childs 00.12 case aptly illustrates the contribution the Commission may make in recommending allowances. Fees totaling $1,400,000 were requested; the Commission recommended approximately
$750,000. The District Court originally awarded approximately
$965,000, but on appeal the Court of Appeals for the Second CirCUIt
reversed those allowances and, in remanding the case for further consideration, indicated that the Commission's recommendations, if
adpoted, would be considered affirmatively reasonable and properly
allowable." At subsequent hearings in the District Court a substantial dispute existed over the proper interpretation of the opinion of
the Court of Appeals. It was urged by various applicants that under
the appellate court's decision, the District Court had discretion to
allow more than the amounts recommended by the Commission if
special findings were made showing the necessity therefor. The District Judge, however, doubted the propriety of increasing the recommended allowances and, following the suggestion of the appellate
court, adopted the Commission's recommendations. The Court pointed
out that there were no new facts or conclusions presented to him
but that there was simply a disagreement as to the value of the
services rendered, a matter upon which the Court of Appeals had
plainly issued its mandate.
The matter of allowances frequently involves the application of
Section 249 which prohibits compensation or reimbursement of expenses where an attorney or other fiduciary has purchased or sold the
securities of the debtor. In proceedings in the chiea{/o Surface Lines
and Ohica{/oRapid Transit 14 cases, the Commission objected to the
allowance of fees and expenses for some participants on various
grounds, among which was the fact that they had bought or sold securities during the proceedings. The Commission argued that these
transactions were in contravention of the equitable rule which was

codified by Section 249. The special master, overruling these objections, allowed fees and expenses to many of these applicants, and the
District Court later affirmed the master's conclusions. The Court's
action was based on its position that the reorganization proceeding
had commenced as an equity receivership proceeding, had not come
under Chapter X until 1944, and that, absent the strict application
of Section 249, the Court had discretion as to whether to bar or permit

decisions,"
The Commission has sought a rigid adherence to the provisions of
Section 249 in a field where the underlying principles might easily
be whittled away by exceptions and hardship cases. Supporting the
Commission's position, strict application of Section 249 was made by
the District Court in Norwalk Tire &: Rubber OO'lTl/Panycase,"
The Commission urged that the application of the secretary of a debenture holders' committee be denied because his firm participated
in several transactions involving securities of the debtor during the
reorganization.
The court stated that, while it felt that these transactions generally could be considered de minimis, the rigidity of Section 249 required that the request for fees be rejected.
We have mentioned above the matter of denial of fees to attorneys
who represented conflicting interests in the American Acoustics case.
In such cases, the denial of fees is a prophylactic measure designed
to implement the basic rule against/divided
loyalties and to assure
that services will be rendered in the proceeding by those with a
single-minded devotion to their cause. In the International Railway
Oompany 17 case, at the instance of the Commission, a bondholders
committee had been held to be disqualified and was forced to withdraw
because it had been organized by a management group with interests
adverse to those of the public bondholders.
Upon the presentation
of applications for final allowances, members of this committee and
their counsel were denied any fee for their services or reimbursement
of expenses by the District Court in affirmation of the principle prohibiting fees to those subject to a conflict of interest in the reorganization proceeding.
During the past fiscal year, several cases presented the question of
the propriety of awarding interim allowances prior to the completion
of the reorganization proceedings. The matter of interim allowances
presents the court with the difficult task of determining whether and
in what amount the estate may safely make payments on account of
administration costs prior to the completion of the reorganization.
Since the extent of beneficial contribution to the administration of
the estate or to the adoption of a plan of reorganization is the primarl
measure of the value of services rendered to the estate, an applicant s
efforts cannot properly be evaluated until the proceeding is substantially completed. This fact militates against the allowance of interim
fees except in the most unusual circumstances, and then only in a small
amount. Where the trustee and his counsel devote a substantial por.. See In re Paramount-Publill: coro., 12 F. Supp. 823 (D. C. S. D. N. Y. 1935) ; In re

tion of their time to the reorganization, they may require, as a matter
of necessity, the payment of some money as current income. To secure
adequate services by them it may be desirable to permit interim allowances, but even in such cases the Commission feels that interim payments ought not to be generous, otherwise procrastination and unnecessary work will be encouraged against the best interests of the debtor.
This position was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit in In re McGann Mfg. 00.18 The District Court had allowed
interim fees and expenses to the trustee and his counsel, to counsel
for the debtor, and to a committee. The Commission was not a party
to the proceedings, On appeal, the Commission presented its views as
omicue curiae. In reversing the District Court, the Court of Appeals
stated that interim allowances are justified only where a trustee or his
counsel regularly devotes a portion of his time, daily or weekly, to
the affairs of the estate, especially where the trustee operates a business, but that interim allowances are not justified where the duties
performed by them are not substantial. Pointing out that the trustee's
activities were routine and ministerial in nature, the Court of Appeals
held that the grant of interim allowances to the trustee and his counsel
was an abuse of discretion. As to applicants other than the trustee
and counsel, the Court agreed that only under extraordinary circumstances should interim allowances be granted to them, particularly
since the proper measure of compensation to them is the benefit derived
by the estate from their services which can normally be evaluated only
after consummation of the reorganization.
Hence the Court reversed
the lower court on this point also.
Subsequently, in the Solar M anufactwring Oompany 19 case, the
Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit upheld, as a matter of judicial
discretion, an allowance by the district judge of interim allowances to
the trustees and their counsel. In its opinion, however, the Court
stated that if it were exercising its own judgment in the first instance
it would not have made an allowance to the trustees although it would
to counsel who, it found, had done a great deal of work during the
year. The trustees, on the other hand, were no longer operating a
business and their duties had become simpler. However, the Court
of Appeals did not feel it could substitute its own judgment for the
District Court because the trustees had expended a great deal of time
on the case.
An instance where unusual circumstances may warrant the awarding of interim allowances is represented by the American Fuel & Power
Oompatny case.20 There, the efforts of a committee and its counsel contributed substantially to the recovery of assets for the benefit of the
estate. A great amount of time was spent over a period of many years,
the services partook of the nature of trustee's services because the committee and its counsel took the laboring oar in the litigation, the efforts
were successful, and, although a plan of reorganization had yet to be
approved, the recovery of the fund was assured. In these circumstances the Commission felt that an interim allowance well below what
might be allowed as a final fee could properly be made. The District
Court has not yet acted upon the application.

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

PLANS OF REORGANIZATION

UNDER CHAPTER

X

The formulation and consummation of a fair and feasible plan of
reorganization is, of course, the primary purpose of the proceeding
under Chapter X. Accordingly, the most important function of the
Commission under Chapter X is to aid the courts in achieving this
objective.
Fairness of Plan

Basic to the Commission's approach to questions involving the
fairness of reorganization plans under Chapter X is the fixed principle, firmly established by Supreme Court decisions, that full recognition must be accorded to claims in the order of their legal and
contractual priority either in cash or in the equitable equivalent of
new securities and that junior claimants may participate only to the
extent that the debtor's properties have value after the satisfaction
of prior claims or to the extent that they make a fresh contribution
necessary to the reorganization of the debtor. A valuation of the
debtor is essential to provide a basis for judging the fairness as well
as the feasibility of proposed plans of reorganization. In its oral
statements and in its advisory reports the Commission continues to
urge that the proper method of valuation for reorganization purposes
is primarily an appropriate capitalization of reasonably prospective
earnings.
In connection with the fairness of plans and the treatment of
claims against the estate, the Commission has given careful consideration to situations where, because of mismanagement or other misconduct on the part of a parent company or a controlling or affiliated
person, the claims of the parent or affiliate should be subordinated to
the claims of the public investors or these claims limited to cost. All
the facts and circumstances in these instances are investigated since
they form an integral part of the concept of the "fair and equitable"
plan. Questions of this kind assumed importance in several proceedings during the past fiscal year. InIn re Inland Gas Oorporation, the
Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had rendered a decision directing subordination of the claims of Columbia Gas System, Inc. to
those of all other creditors. In the subsequent formulation of a plan
the question arose whether Columbia's claims in Inland Gas Corporation should be subordinated to those of the public creditors of American
Fuel & Power Co. and Kentucky Fuel Gas Co., which companies
owned almost all of the stock of Inland Gas Corporation but practically no other assets. The District Court read the mandate of the
Court of Appeals to require only that Columbia's interest in each
corporation be subordinated to the other creditors of such corporation.
ThIS determination was appealed to the Court of Appeals and that
Court was asked to interpret its prior holdings.
The Commission's position that the American Fuel system should
be viewed as an integrated enterprise was upheld by the Court. The
Commission urged that all pubhc security holders of the three companies had been injured by Columbia's conduct and that the Court
should interpret its former mandate to require the subordination of
Columbia's claims not only to the claims of Inland's own creditors
but also to those of American Fuel and Kentucky Fuel. The Court
found that the holders of the notes secured by Inland stock were,

SEVENTEE~

~AL

REPORT

131

in a very true sense, creditors or quasi-creditors of Inland and as
such were entitled to participate in Inland's assets as creditors prior
to Columbia." Having found a creditor status in Inland Gas for
the American Fuel and Kentucky Fuel creditors, the Court did not
make any provision for the slight Inland Gas stock interest (1.4
percent) held by public investors, as recommended by the Commission.
The Commission took the opposite position with respect to a contention, in the Inland Gas Oorporation case, that the claims of American
Fuel against Inland Gas, its majority-owned subsidiary, be subordinated or treated as capital contributions because of the undercapitalization of Inland Gas. Except for a single situation calling for
limitation to cost,22the Commission pointed out that the relationship
between the two companies did not call for treatment of American
Fuel's claims different from that of other creditors. No mismanagement or overreaching was shown; American Fuel was organized by
the promoters of the system after Inland Gas was created and the
American Fuel creditors were in the position of advancing funds
to Inland Gas at a time when it needed capital badly; American
Fuel creditors ought not equitably to be charged with the conduct of
the promoters. The Court of Appeals agreed that this did not present a case for subordination and affirmed the holding of the District
Court.
In the International Power Securities Oorp. case an issue regarding
subordination and limitation to cost was resolved by a settlement incorporated in a plan of liquidation which was recommended as fair
and feasible by the Commission and approved by the Court in May
1951. The debtor had been' organized to finance the development of
hydro-electric power in Northern Italy and deal generally in the investment of funds. Its major assets became mortgages on the property of an Italian public utility, Societa Edison of Milan, and its
income was largely the interest paid on those obligations. In 1940
it became impossible for the Societa Edison to make dollar payments,
and the debtor consequently could not make interest payments on
its own bonds, outstanding in the principal amount of more than
$16,000,000.
A petition for reorganization was filed in February
1941. After World War II Societa Edison sent a representative to
this country to discuss that company's affairs and settlement of the
debtor's claims against it. It was then learned that Societa Edison
had acquired a large amount of the debtor's bonds at a substantial
discount. It was subsequently alleged that while the representative
was in this country, Societa Edison had purchased $1,250,000 principal amount of the debtor's bonds. These and other purchases would
bring the total holding of Societa Edison in the debtor's bonds to
$6,543,000 principal amount. Meanwhile agencies of the Italian government acquired $1,098,000 principal amount of the bonds from
Italian nationals.
It was contended by a bondholders' committee that these bondholdings should be limited to cost or subordinated completely to pubn tn rÂ« Inland Gas Oorp.,187 F. 2d 813 (C. A. 6, 1951) .
.. In this instance, American Fuel acquired Inland Gas bonds for Inland Gas sinking
fund purposes. The Commission argued that American Fuel, as parent of Inland Gas,
could not make a profit on the acqutsttton of bonds where Inland Gas was "in the field"
to acquire them itself though it lacked funds to do so, distinguishing ManUfacturers Trust
00., Trustee v. Becker, 338 U. S. 304. The Court held that the transaction was in essence
a loan and no profit should be realized thereon by the parent company.

licly held bonds or applied as a set-off because Societa Edison's relationship to the debtor and its bondholders was such that it could be
considered the real obligor of the debtor's bonds, or at least a guarantor of them. Proceedings were commenced to determine the ownership and status of the bonds and orders were obtained from the court
directing Societa Edison and the Italian Government to file claims.
An application to restrain the transfer of the $1,250,000 of bonds
in the custody of a bank in this country, however, was denied. On
appeal the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reversed, holding
that the injunction was within the jurisdiction of the court and that
it was error for the court not to prevent the transfer of the bonds
until the issues respecting their ownership and status were determined." Societa Edison did not file its claims, but proceeded with an
offer of settlement. After extensive negotiations, a proposal was made
under which the Italian Public Credit Institute would settle Societa
Edison's obligations by the issuance of $26,600,000 of bonds, equal
to principal and interest of the Italian company's mortgage debt.
For their holdings of the debtor's bonds of about $11,000,000including interest, Societa Edison and the Italian Government agencies were
to be allowed a credit of only $8,600,000, leaving $18,000,000 of Institute bonds to go to the American bondholders. In addition, interest and amortization terms of the proposal were made more favorable than other Institute bond issues as part of the settlement.
The trustee's plan, based upon acceptance of this settlement, contemplates issuance of liquidation trust certificates to bondholders
upon which payments will be made by a trustee out of the funds received upon the Institute bonds held by"the trustee until the bondholders are fully paid, principal and interest. The balance of payments starting in 1967, which would normally have been paid to the
preferred stockholders of the debtor, in accordance with their priority, will, under the plan, become the property of the holders of
subordinated liquidation trust shares. These suhordinated shares will
be purchased for investment by Italian interests for a net sum of
$1,190,000 which, under the plan, will be apportioned between bondholders and preferred stockholders in compromise of their claims to
this cash. The Commission did not render a formal advisory report,
but informed the Court in a full oral presentation that it considered
the plan fair and equitable. Thereafter the Court approved the plan.
The required majorities of the bondholders and preferred stockholders
voted in favor of the plan and in June 1951 it was confirmed by
the Court.
In our Sixteenth Annual Report, we described in some detail the
proceedings involving Silesian-American Corporation. We discussed
the trustee's plan which incorporated a proposal by Swiss banks for
the acquisition by them of securities of the proposed reorganized
company, the transfer to the debtor of certain funds held by them
to enable a cash distribution to be made to public bondholders, and
the release of claims of the debtor against the banks. We also discussed the Commission's advisory report which concluded that the
trustee's plan was unfair and unfeasible in important respects and
that other plan proposals were either not fair or not feasible. We
pointed out that the District Court had overruled our recommenda.. In re International Power Securities Corp., 170 F. 2d 399 (C. A. 3, 1948).

tions except for some minor points and that appeals had been taken
~y a bondholders' committee and other parties from the District
Court's order approving the trustee's plan.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission actively participated
in this appeal before the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit,
urging that the District Court committed error in approving the
trustee's plan. In an elaborate detailed opinion, the Court of Appeals reversed the lower court's order." The case is of particular
significance in the field of bankruptcy reorganizations because of
the clear statement of the important weight which should be accorded advisory opinions of the Commission. The Court stated:

* * * Since decision here is so highly a matter of judgment, indeed of shrewd
appraisal of what may be the possibilities of lengthy litigation as against
an immediate smaller payment in hand, we obviously cannot find any sure
or pat answer. The trustee naturally urges that we must give strong weight
to the decision below, suggesting that it must be sustained as a finding of fact
based on the preponderance of credible evidence, and therefore not "clearly
erroneous" under F. R. 52 (a). But we are not justified in thus oversimplifying
this difficult problem, so much more one of forecasting the future than of restating the past. Naturally careful consideration is due the conclusion of the
able district judge who has had this lengthy reorganization so long under his
control. At the same time we cannot overlook the fact that the governmental
agency charged with substantial responsiblllty in the premises, the Securities
and Exchange Commission, has made an extensive investigation resulting in a
detailed and helpful report with a reasoned conclusion which the trial judge
has rather summarily rejected. If the considered findings of this agency, with
so much better faclllties for investigation than those possessed by either this
or the trial court, are to have any force beyond their initial impact below,
then we think that they will largely offset the usual presumption accorded a
decision of first instance. Otherwise much of the statutory purpose in creating
an expert body for the consideration of technical problems will be set at
naught. Compare 6 Collier on Bankruptcy Par. 7.30, 14th Ed. 1947. We have
elsewhere stressed the importance of due regard for Commission findings,
Finn v, Ohilds 00., 2 Cir. 181 F. 2d 431, 438; and we are clear that here, too,
we must give weight to the detailed evaluation of the facts made by this reliable and experienced public agency and the conclusion reached, even though
this was not accepted by the trial judge.
After discussing the history of the debtor and its affairs and the
terms of the Swiss offer and the trustee's plan, the Court set forth
the Commission's position at length "both because of its statutory
responsibility and because of the thoroughness with which it has
worked out its position." The Court then analyzed the principal
issue in the case, the causes of action against the Swiss banks, and
concluded, as had the Commission, that there was lack of an adequate
showin that the adjustment with the Swiss banks embodied in the
trustee s plan was fair or just, particularly in the light of what seemed
to be strong indications to the contrary. The case was therefore remanded for further proceedings. The Court did not prescribe what
these should be, indicating that a new plan might be substituted or
action against the Swiss banks instituted here or in Switzerland.
In any event, the Court directed that some detailed examination be
made of the Swiss transactions, Swiss law and the position of the
Swiss Government agency in charge of the transactions.
Inview of this conclusion, the Court did not finally determine other
issues in the case but as an aid to a reappraisal of those issues, commented upon them. The Court felt that certain claims of the debtor
against a German mining company were uncollectible in point of fact .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

As to the correctness of the trustee's decision not to sue promoters of
the debtor, the Court was divided in view, stating that it was clear
that the promoters realized large profits but that it was not clear from
the record whether the promoters, as charged by the Commission, were
liable for a misleading bond circular, a write-up of the debtor's Polish
assets and overvaluation of those assets and prospects. The suggestions of the Commission not followed by the lower court as to the details of the plan, including the issuance of contingency certificates
to those who gave value for their securities, seemed to the Court to
have merit.
In our Sixteenth Annual Report, we outlined the status of the reorganization proceedings involving Central States Electric Corporation, an investment company owning and controlling directly and
through two subsidiaries assets of over $50,000,000. We mentioned
the important problems involved in the effectuation of a plan of reorganization for the Central States system; the treatment of some
of these problems in our advisory report on five proposed plans of reorganization j the adoption by the District Court of the Commission's recommendation that the trustees' plan be approved and other
plans be disapproved; and the denial by the District Court of a request to stay a preliminary step involving the dissolution of American
Cities Power & Light Corporation, one of the subsidiaries, pending an
appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit. Briefs were
filed and argument held on this appeal during the past fiscal year in
July 1950. The Court of Appeals upheld the Commission's view of
the case in a detailed opinion handed down in August 1950.25
The Court dismissed the plans of reorganization proposed by certain junior security holder groups as objectionable "for reasons which
the Commission has very clearly pointed out."
As to the contention of common stockholders that the case should be
delayed until litigation against the former management shall be terminated, the Court quoted from the Commission's advisory report that
"to request delay when immediate reorganization is practicable is to
disregard the rights of creditors, as well as senior stockholders, '" '" '"
and to continue to subject them to the risk of loss." As to the argument that the trustees' plan of reorganization proposing a single openend investment company for the system was a "liquidation," the
Court agreed with the Commission that there was no basis for this
conclusion, stating "This is just the sort of matter as to which the
Securities and Exchange Commission is best qualified to judge and no
good reason is suggested which would warrant the courts in substitutmg their judgment as to this for the expert judgment of the Commission." That stockholders might exercise their option under the
charter of the reorganized company to redeem their stock was found
not objectionable for another reason, since, as the Court stated, it is
not the purpose of Chapter X to compel security holders to continue
a business if they, the owners, desire otherwise.
On the question of valuation, the Court upheld the Commission's
view that the proper method of valuing the assets of an investment
company such as Central States is not prospective earnings but the
realizable market value of the securities on hand. The Court pointed
out that the case was to be distinguished from that of a business
corporation where the value of the unit as a whole often exceeds the

value of the separate parts due to the unitary functioning of all parts
as a whole. The Commission's advisory report and brief were quoted
from with approval.
The Court affirmed the holding that the senior preferred stockholders were entitled to share in the assets of the debtor on the basis
of their liquidating preferences prior to junior stockholders and
distinguished the line of cases under the Public Utility Holding Company Act where the rights of preferred stockholders are generally not
considered 'matured. The Court also approved the plan provision
which allocated additional compensation to the bondholders amounting
to 5 percent of their claim because of their loss of seniority in the
reorganized company through the issuance to them of new common
stock.
The Commission filed a brief in opposition to petitions to the Supreme Court for writs of certiorari. The same contentions were raised
by the junior interests, excluded from participation in the physical
assets of the debtor, that they raised in the courts below. Certiorari
was denied in January 1951.26 In the meantime, the trustees' plan of
reorganization was confirmed by the District Court as recommended
by the Commission over the objection of the junior interests. An
appeal to the Court of Appeals from the order of confirmation was
dismissed. Thereafter certain common stockholders moved to dismiss
the entire proceeding on the ground that the debtor was solvent and
could pay its debts (debentures of $22,000,000,principal plus interest)
through a sale of assets or by borrowing or a combination of both.
The Commission opposed the motion to dismiss on the grounds that
this issue had been decided in the prior appeal; that the need for and
practicability of reorganization is the basic test to determine whether
a case should be dismissed or not and not whether a debtor is or has
become solvent; and that the reorganization of solvent debtors in need
of rehabilitation is expressly contemplated by Chapter X. The District Court denied the motion, On appeal, the Commission filed a
brief and argued in support of the order denying the motion. The
Court of Appeals affirmed on several ~ounds.
Of broad import in
Chapter X is the Court's opinion that' the idea that jurisdiction over
reorganization proceedings is lost because of a fortunate administration of the corporation's assets under the Court's direction is supported
neither in law nor in common sense and is violative of the well settled
rule that a court of equity, having once taken jurisdiction, will do
complete justice in the premises." The Court of Appeals also pointed
out that to dismiss the proceedings would have meant turning back
control of the company to the former management against whom suit
for a substantial sum was pending and that such a course was "hardly
thinkable." 26a
The Court of Appeals refused a stay of the proceedings, stating
that for persons holding insignificant interests in so large an enterprise to liold up and delay a plan where the security holders having
substantial interests had given their approval and the Commission,
the District Court and that Court had likewise given their approval,
is an abuse to which the Court would lend no encouragement. The
mandate was directed to be issued in fifteen days unless application
for certiorari were made to the Supreme Court. The common stockholders did apply for certiorari and the Commission, among other

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

parties, filed a brief in opposition. Certiorari was denied in J una
1951.21
Thereafter the plan of reorganization was speedily consummated.
A new open-end investment company, called Blue Ridge Mutual
Fund, Inc., emerged as the reorganized company, resulting from the
merger of Central States Electric Corporation and its subsidiary,
Blue Ridge Corporation. American Cities Power and Light Corporation, another subsidiary, had been dissolved during the previous year.
Common stock of the new company was distributed to the bondholders
and 7 percent preferred stockholders of Central States and to the
common stockholders of Blue Ridge in accordance with their interests. The new company commenced operations with about $45,000,000. Requests for redemptions, which will substantially reduce the
assets of the company, may be offset by sales of new stock. As permitted by the plan, an underwriting arrangement and a management
contract were entered into, with the approval of the Court, with
Reynolds and Company, an investment banking and securities firm.
The new contracts were reviewed by the Commission, not only from
the point of view of Chapter X standards, but also to assure compliance with the Investment Company Act of 1940. It is contemplated that the new company will make a continuous offering of
Its stock as is the practice of other investment companies of this
type. The Commission also closely reviewed the charter and bylaws of the new company to see that proper safeguards in the interests
of investors were incorporated therein.
Feasibility of Plan

A prerequisite to the court's approval of a plan of reorganization is its feasibility. In order to assure a sound reorganization, which
will not result in the debtor's return to Chapter X because of financial
difficulties, the Commission gives a great deal of attention to the
various factors affecting feasibility. Generally speaking, these factors involve the adequacy of working capital, the relationship of
funded debt and the capital structure as a whole to property values,
the adequacy of corporate earning power for interest and dividend
requirements, the possible need for capital expenditures, and the
effect of the new capitalization upon the company's prospective
credit. The Commission's views of feasibility as relating to various
types of enterprises have been announced in some detail in its advisory
reports. Although no advisory reports were issued durin~ the past
fiscal year, the Commission's views on the subject of feasibility were
expressed orally in several cases along lines previously set forth in
its published reports.
Consummation

of Plan

The Commission gives detailed scrutiny to the corporate charters,
by-laws, trust indentures, and other instruments which are to govern
the internal structure of the reorganized debtor. In general the
Commission strives to assure to investors the inclusion of protective
features and safeguards which its experience has shown to 00 desirable.
The Commission's interest in the entire reorganization process includes not only the consummation of the plan and the winding up
1'7341 U. S. 91$2.

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

137

of the affairs of the trusteeship (which may occur many years after
a plan has been consummated) but may also extend to the interpretation and enforcement of the terms of the plans by the reorganized
company. The value of such continued interest was shown by the
decision of the Third Circuit Court of Appeals in In Be Pittsburgh
Terminal Ooal 00rp.,28 discussed at length in the Sixteenth Annual Report. During the past fiscal year, application for, certiorari to the
Supreme Court from this decision was opposed by the Commission
on the ground that the decision of the Court of Appeals was correct
in applying to the facts of this case the established principle that a
bankruptcy court has jurisdiction to protect its decrees, to interpret,
enforce and carry out the plan of reorganization and to prevent interference with the plan or its operation. The Commission also urged
that the decision was not in conflict with other decisions and distinguished the decisions relied upon by the petitioner which held in
general that the Chapter X Court has no power to interfere in the
affairs of a corporation after a plan has been consummated. The
Supreme Court denied certiorari."
Another matter in connection with the consummation of plans of
reorganization which has been of concern to the Commission is the
problem of unexchanged securities. The Commission found that
many security holders had not submitted their old securities in exchange for new securities or cash distributable under the plan. Chapter X provides that a period of not less than 5 years may be fixed by
the judge within which security holders may make the exchange under
the plan, after which they are barred. After some experience with
the operation of this provision, the Commission concluded that, in
the larger cases, 5 years may be too short a period, depending on the
facts, and recommended a bar period of 10 years.
More important than the lengthening of the exchange period, the
Commission believes that efforts to locate security holders must be
intensified in order to reach as many investors as possible. The Commission has, therefore, urged trustees, exchange agents, and others
who have the responsibility for distributing the new securities or
cash, to send registered letters with return receipts requested, to
publish notices in leading newspapers, and to retain professional
tracers in the business of locating missing security holders.

PART V

ADMINISTRATION OF THE TRUST INDENTURE
ACT OF 1939
NATURE OF TRUST INDENTURE REGULATION

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, sold, or delivered after sale through the mails or in interstate commerce (except
as specifically exempted by the Act) be issued under an indenture
which meets the requirements of the Act and which has been qualified
with the Commission.
Individual holders of bonds, notes, debentures, and similar debt
securities often find it difficult and expensive to enforce their rights
under indentures and generally must rely upon the trustee named in
the trust indenture to protect them. The Trust Indenture Act of 1939
requires the inclusion in the trust indenture of specified provisions
which facilitate the protection and enforcement of such rights. Thus
there must be a corporate trustee free from stated conflicts of interest;
such trustee must not after default, or within 4 months prior thereto,
improve its position as a creditor to the detriment of the indenture
securities; it must make annual and periodic reports to bondholders;
it must maintain bondholders lists to provide a method of communication between bondholders as to their rights under the indenture and
the bonds; and it must be authorized to file suits and proofs of claims
on behalf of the bondholders. The Act prohibits exculpatory clauses
used in the past to eliminate the liability of the indenture trustee to
the indenture security holders and imposes on the trustee, after default, the duty to exercise the rights and powers vested in it, and
to use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent
man would use or exercise in the conduct of his own affairs. Specified
evidence must be supplied by the obligor to the indenture trustee with
respect to the recording of the indenture and with respect to conditions precedent to action to be taken by the trustee at the request of
the obligor.
INTEGRATION WITH SECURITIES ACT OF 1933

The exemption provisions of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 incorporate most of the exemptions contained in the Securities Act of
1933 and include certain other exemptions. The provisions of these
Acts are so integrated that registration pursuant to the Securities Act
of 1933 of securities to be issued under a trust indenture and not
exempt from the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, is not permitted to become effective unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of
the latter Act, and such an indenture is automatically "qualified"
when registration becomes effective as to the securities themselves. An
application for qualification of an indenture, covering securities not
required to be registered under the Securities Act of 1933, which is
filed with the Commission under the Trust Indenture Act is processed

in connection with the issuance or distribution of the indenture securities. The reason for requiring the filing of this material is to facilitate the Commission's examination of such applications.

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT COMPANY
ACT OF 1940
The Investment Company Act of 1940 requires registration of, and
provides for certain types of regulation of, investment companiescompanies engaged primarily in the business of investing, reinvesting,
and trading in securities. Among other things, the Act requires disclosure of the finances and investment policies of these companies in
order to afford investors full and complete information with respect
to their activities; prohibits such companies from changing the nature
of their business or their investment policies without the approval of
their stockholders; bars persons guilty of security frauds from serving
as officers and directors of such companies; regulates the means of custody of the assets of investment companies and requires the bonding
of officers and directors having access to such assets; prevents underwriters, investment bankers, and brokers from constituting more than
a minority of the directors of such companies; requires management
contracts in the first instance to be submitted to security holders for
their approval; prohibits transactions between such companies and
their officers and directors except with the approval of the Commission; forbids the issuance of senior securities of such companies except
in specified instances; and prohibits pyramiding of such companies
and cross-ownership of their securities. The Commission is authorized to prepare advisory reports upon plans of reorganizations of
registered investment companies upon the request of such companies
or 25 percent of their stockholders and to institute proceedings to
enjoin such ,elans if they are grossly unfair.
The Act requires face
amount certificate companies to maintain reserves adequate to meet
maturity payments upon their certificates.
REGISTRATION UNDER THE Acr

During the 1951 fiscal year, 12 new investment companies registered
under the Investment Company Act of 1940, of which 5 were open-end
management companies (companies which redeem their shares on
presentation by the stockholders) and 7 were closed-end management
companies (companies in which the shareholder can realize on his
security only by selling it in the open market).
During the nearest
comparable period for which data are available, the 12 months ended
March 31, 1951, about 211 registered open-end management and closedend management investment companies reported to the Commission
sales to the public of approximately $594,000,000 of their securities and
redemptions and retirements of approximately $336,000,000, leaving a
net investment by the public in such companies over the period of
approximately $258,000,000. As of June 30, 1951, 368 investment
companies were registered under the Act, and on that date it is estimated that the value of their total assets was approximately $5,600,000,000. This represents an increase of approximately $1,000,000,000
in such valuation over the corresponding total at the beginning of the
year.

DURING

FISCAL YEAR

As indicated, 12 investment companies registered under the Act
during the fiscal year. Of these, five were open-end management
investment companies actively offering their securities to the public.
One of these companies stressed as an advantage the fact that it
charged no sales load in the purchase of its shares. Another proposed
a so-called formula of investment designed to require purchase and
sales of securities on the happening of specified events. As a result
of examination by the Commission's staff, the prospectus of the company as finally used makes it clear that the so-called 'formula is not
infallible and that losses can result from investment in the company.
None of the closed-end management companies registered during
the year is offering or intends to offer its securities to the public. One
of such companies was created in connection with a merger of companies manufacturing
locomotives and other heavy machinery as a
repository for certain securities not necessary to the operation of the
business of the combined companies. The stock of the investment
company so formed was distributed to the stockholders of the locomotive company. Thus the investment company became publicly
held and was required to register under the Act. Some others of the
newly registered companies were created for similar reasons.
The remaining companies were required to register because of the
fact that during the fiscal year the number of their stockholders
reached 100 or more, thus removing the exemption in the Act for
investment companies having less than 100 stockholders.
The most
interesting of these companies is Delaware Realty and Investment
Company which owned approximately 33 percent of the voting securities of Christiana Securities Company, which in turn owned 27 percent of the common stock of E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Company,
one of the country's largest industrial concerns.
SELLING LITERATURE

The Act requires literature (other than the statutory prospectus)
used by issuers or underwriters in selling open-end investment company shares to be filed with the Commission within 10 days after such
literature is first employed as selling material. During the preceding
1950 fiscal year there had been a substantial increase in the use of both
literature purporting to describe investment companies generally and
literature purporting to describe a specific company. Of considerable
concern to the Commission was the fact that in a substantial number
of cases this literature used by issuers, underwriters, and dealers to
attract investors might be materially misleading in many respects.
In addition, there was serious doubt that certain of such literature
could be generally circulated under the Securities Act of 1933. Accordingly, before the beginning of the 1951 fiscal year the Commission

SEVENTEENTII ~AL

143

REPORT

with the cooperation of the National Association of Securities Dealers
undertook a study of such literature in an attempt to eliminate any
misleading elements contained therein. During the 1951 fiscal year
there was promulgated, as a result of the cooperative effort of the
Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers, a
Statement of Policy governing the contents of such literature. In
addition, during the 1951 fiscal year, the Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers worked out a procedure for
submission of selling literature to staff members for scrutiny as to
compliance with the Statement of Policy before such literature is used.
Furthermore, after considerable discussion the Commission permitted the use under certain circumstances of charts indicating the
performance of investment companies as selling literature provided
such charts were contained in a standard book of reference, reflected
the performance of a substantial number of investment companies,
were prepared uniformly on a non-misleading basis, and were exhibited as a book to investors.
During the 1951 fiscal year, discussions were initiated between the
National Association of Investment Companies and the Commission
with a view to simplifying the registration requirements for such
companies under the Securities Act and Investment Company Act,
the objective being to obtain a short readable prospectus which would
nevertheless fully inform investors as to the facts with respect to the
particular company.

FILED

One of the functions of the Commission under the Act is to pass
on applications by investment companies for exemptions which the
Act permits under appropriate standards.
Some of the most complex problems arise out of the provisions of
the statute which forbid, in the absence of approval by the Commis-

144

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

sion, purchases or sales of property or securities among investment
companies and their affiliated persons. To approve such transactions
the Commission must find that they are fair as to price and involve
no overreaching. As a result, the applications in many instances
involve unusual questions of valuation and inside influence. During
the year 21 applications of this type were filed.
During the fiscal year 78 applications were filed under the various
provisions of the Act, 62 of these for orders of the Commission relating to exemption from requirements of the Act, and the remaining
16 for a determination of the Commission that the applicant has
ceased to be an investment company within the meaning of the Act.
At the beginning- of the fiscal year 34 applications were pending.
These pending applications, together with the 78 filed during the year,
totaled 112 applications which required the appropriate examination
and consideration of the Commission during the year. As a result
of the Commission's action 71 of these applications were disposed of
during the year and 41 were pending on June 30, 1951. The various
sections of the Act under which these applications were filed, and the
disposition of the applications during the fiscal year, are shown in
the following table (since an application may involve more than one
section of the Act, the numbers are not totaled) :

CHANGES IN RULES, REGULATIONS, AND FORMS

Bonus. profit 8haring and pension. plans.-Section
17 (d) of the
Act authorizes the Commission to promulgate rules designed to prevent unfair use of their position by insiders to engage in joint transactions with the investment companies they manage or with companies controlled by such investment companies. To carry out this
purpose the Commission in 1946 enacted rule N-17D-1 which in effect
required submission to and approval by the Commission of bonus,
profit sharing and pension plans granted by investment companies

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

or their controlled companies for the benefit of officers or employees,
prior to their adoption. During the last fiscal year, as a result of
the Commission's experience with the original rule, it was amended
to eliminate the necessity of prior submission to the Commission of
a variety of bonus, profit sharing and pension plans. .Among such
plans no longer required to be submitted to the Commission for approval are pension plans for employees of investment companies in
which the company's contributions are based on a percentage of
annual payroll and the plan has been qualified as non-discriminatory
under section 165 of the Internal Revenue Code. Similarly, all bonus,
pension or profit sharing plans of companies controlled by investment companies (other than other investment companies) are exempted if no affiliated persons of the controlling- investment company
participate in the plans. Finally, payments of bonuses up to 5 percent
of the net income of the investment company, giving effect to any
net unrealized depreciation in its assets, may be paid without the
necessity of approval by the Commission. It is believed that these
amendments to the rule will substantially lessen the administration
burden of both the Commission and registered investment companies,
without sacrifice of adequate protection to investors in such companies.
Registration
form to'/' face-amount oertificate oom.pamies-s-The
Commission during the year adopted a form of registration statement
to be filed under the Act by registered face-amount certificate companies. These companies offer to investors certificates entitling their
holders to a definite sum of money at the end of a prescribed period
upon payments by the investor during such period, usually in monthly
installments, of sums aggregating less than the amount to be paid
by the company at maturity.
The Act requires the companies to
maintain reserves invested in qualified investments sufficient to meet
the face amount of certificates held by investors at maturity. The
new form, among other things, requires pertinent information to
enable the Commission to determine whether such reserves are being
maintained by the companies.
In addition to the new form a rule was adopted permitting the
use of information previously filed by face-amount certificate companies with the Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 or section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. Both the form
and the rule were previously published in draft form for comments
and suggestions by the companies affected and other interested persons. Extended conferences were held with the representatives of
some of the companies affected and the form adopted by the Commission reflects the incorporation of a number of comments and suggestions so received.
Bonding of office'/'s and employees of investment oompamies-Â«
The Act empowers the Commission to require the bonding of officers
and employees of registered investment companies who have access
to securities owned and other assets of such companies. Pursuant to
such statutory authority the Commission had adopted rule N-17G-1.
During the fiscal year the Commission amended rule N-17G-1 by
adding to such rule a definition of the terms "officers" and "employees."
The amendment provides that for the purposes of this rule such terms
shall include the depositor or investment adviser and its officers and
employees in cases where the investment company is an unincorporated
company managed by a depositor or investment adviser.

ADMINISTRATION OF THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS
ACT OF 1940
The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration as
investment advisers of persons engaged :for compensation in the
business of advising others with respect to securities. The Commission is empowered to deny registration to or revoke registration
of any adviser who, after notice and opportunity for hearing, is
found by the Commission to have been convicted or enjoined because
of misconduct in connection with security transactions or to have
made false statements in his application for registration. The Act
makes it unlawful for investment advisers to engage in practices
which constitute fraud or deceit; requires investment advisers to
disclose the nature of their interest in transactions executed for their
clients; prohibits profit-sharing arrangements; and, in effect, prevents assignment of investment advisory contracts without the
client's consent.

ACTIVITIES

OF THE COMMISSION

COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year, are
contained in the appendix tables.
At the beginning of the 1951 fiscal year there were pending in the
courts 18 injunctive and related enforcement proceedmgs instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices in
the sale of securities, 21 additional proceedings were instituted during
the year and 19 cases were disposed of, so that 20 of such proceedings
were pending at the end of the year. In addition the Commission
participated in a large number of reorganization cases under Chapter
X of the Bankruptcy Act; in 15 proceedings in the district courts under
section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act and in 14
miscellaneous actions, usually as amicus curiae, to advise the court of
its views regarding the construction of J?rovisions of statutes administered by the Commission which were mvolved in private lawsuits.
The Commission also participated in 41 appeals. Of these, 8 came
before the courts on petition for review of an administrative order;
17 arose out of corporate reorganizations in which the Commission
had taken an active part; 2 were appeals in actions brought by or
against the Commission; 9 were appeals from orders entered pursuant
to section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company Act; and 5
were appeals in cases in which the Commission appeared as amioue
curiae,
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during the
year are discussed in the sections of this report devoted to the statutes
under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

The statutes administered by the Commission provide for the transmission of evidence of violations to the Attorney General who may
institute criminal proceedings.
The Commission, largely through its
regional offices, investigates suspected violations and, in cases where
the facts appear to warrant criminal proceedings, prepares detailed
reports which are forwarded to the Attorney General. Commission
employees familiar with the case often assist the United State attorneys in the presentation to the grand jury, the conduct of the trial,
and the preparation of briefs on appeal. The Commission also transmits parole reports prepared by its investigators relating to convicted offenders. Where an investigation
discloses violations of
statutes other than those administered by the Commission, the Commission advises the appropriate Federal or State agency.
Indictments were returned against 2,133 defendants 1 in 477 cases
1In dtseusslons
of criminal cases in previous annual reports the figure used for the
number of defendants indicted was the sum of the number of defendants in all indictments

The figure currently used refiects an adjustment for the situation occasionally

A
similar adjustment has been made for the figure used for the number of defendants convicted. These adjustments eliminate seeming inconsistencies between fi~res prevtouslv

developed by the Commission prior to June 30, 1951.2 These figures
include 48 defendants in 24 cases in which indictments were returned
during the past fiscal year. At the close of the fiscal year 436 cases
had been disposed of as to one or more defendants. Convictions had
been obtained in 381 of these cases," over 87 percent, against a total
of 1,135defendants. Convictions were obtained against 15 defendants
in 12 cases during the past fiscal year! In addition, one defendant
was convicted of criminal contempt during this period," A judgment
of conviction was affirmed on appeal as to one defendant during the
year, and two cases, each involving a single defendant, remained pending on appeal at the close of the fiscal year.
As in prior years, the criminal cases during the past year which
were developed and prosecuted covered a wide variety of promotions.
They included fraudulent securities sales in connection with the operation of purported investment plans, in connection with the promotion of various mining, oil and gas ventures, and in connection with
the promotion of inventions and other new businesses. They also included frauds perpetrated by securities brokers and dealers and their
representatives upon customers. In many of these fraudulent schemes,
the defendants wilfully avoided compliance with the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, which are designed to provide
investors with a full and fair disclosure of material facts about the
securities being sold. As a result, a number of fraud cases involved
violation of these registration provisions. In addition, in two indictments returned during the past year the charges were based solely
on the violation of these registration provisions.
The fraudulent sale of securities in connection with the operation
of purported investment plans was involved in the following criminal
proceedings during the past year: U. S. v. Frederick F. March (N. D.
Ill.) ("secret" financing plan) ; 6 U. S. v. Robert J. Dottle (D. Mass.)
(securities trading account); 7 U. S. v. Jim May (S. D. Tex.) (grain
trading venture); U. S. v. Russell D. Hanson (N. D. Ill.) (securities tradi.!!g financing plan); and U. S. v, Mercedes Buschman et al.
(W. D. Wash.) (note discounting plan). The defendants in the
first two cases were convicted on charges of obtaining funds from
investors upon the representation that they would be used for legitimate investment purposes, whereas in fact the defendants converted
such funds and used them in large part for gambling purposes. Similar fraudulent conduct is alleged in the Hanson case, in which an
indictment was returned during the past year. The conversion of
investors' funds also was involved in the May case, where the defendant was convicted during the past fiscal year. The indictment..
pending in the Buschman case, charges, among other things, that the
defendants induced investors to purchase accommodation notes which
the defendants had fraudulently obtained from various persons, upon
the false representation that such notes had been issued by financially

responsible persons and represented payments due on stock sold to
these persons. In all of these cases the defendants also were charged
with employing the fraudulent "Ponzi" technique, in that, in order to
induce investors to make further investments, they returned to them
as "profits" a portion of their capital contributions.
Convictions involving mining promotions were obtained during the
past year in U. S. v. Charles Phillips (W. D. Tex.) ; U. S. v. Lawrence
L. Kelling (D. Kan.) and U. S. v, James Reese Davis, Sr. et al. (D.
Idaho) . The sale of securities in Mexican gold mining and lumber
ventures known as Orozona, S. A. & Transconstruccion, S. A. was
involved in the first case and the second case related to the sale of preorganization subscriptions of a corporation to be organized to develop
a coal mine in Colorado. The indictments in these cases charged the
defendants with misrepresenting the use which was to be made of the
funds received from the sale of these securities and various other
matters.
In the last case, Davis pleaded guilty to charges of violation
of the registration provisions of the Securities Act in the sale of notes
issued by him and secured by an interest in the production from certain
mining properties located in Idaho and Oregon.
Indictments were
returned during the year in two other mining promotion cases: U. S. v,
ErnestR. Henmefer et al. (D. Utah) and U.S. v. WilliamB. LaVeyet
al. (D. Mont.). The former case related to the development of phosphate properties and involved the sale of stock of Utah Phosphate
Company. The latter case involved the sale of stock of Victory Divide
Mining Company in connection with a gold mining venture. The
defendants in these cases were charged with making false representations with respect to the nature, amount and value of the ore deposits
controlled by these companies, the value of the stock, the profits which
investors would receive and other matters. After the close of the fiscal
year, convictions were obtained against certain defendants in each of
these cases.
The fraudulent sale of securities relating to the promotion of
various oil and gas properties resulted in convictions during the year
in U. S. v. George E. Baldwin (N. D. Ill.); U. S. v. J. Stacey Henderlion (W. D. Term.) is and U. S. v, Emory Stokes (E. D. Tex.), The
indictments in the first two cases alleged misrepresentations with respect to such matters as the quantity of oil production being obtained,
the period in which investors would receive repayment of their investments and the amount of profits which they would receive. In
the Stokes case, the defendant was charged with falsely representing,
among other things, that he would act as agent for investors in purchasing oil and gas leases and that the amounts paid by investors for
such leases represented the amounts he had paid to landowners to
obtain these leases. The indictment returned during the year in
U. S. v. Lawrence L. Kelling et al. (D. Kan.), a pending case, includes
charges of misrepresentation with respect to the amount of oil being

for oil and mining frauds, was convicted of fraudulently selling stock
of Penner Oil & Gas, Inc. by means of a large scale mail campaign.
Proof at the trial showed that at one time during the course of this
promotion some 28 stenographers were employed to work on the company's sales literature and that orders for the printing of such literature called for as many as 58,000 pieces per 'printing. According to
the indictment some of the false representations made in these sales
letters were that one block of leases controlled by the company should
produce over 6,000,000 barrels of oil having a value in excess of $15,000,000, that another block of leases should yield a net profit of $7,000
per acre and that a net profit of $3,000,000 could be obtained from still
other acreage. It was further charged that the defendant failed to
disclose to investors that the "special process," which was represented
as having been used in locating wells drilled by the company, was an
instrument commonly known as a "doodle bug," based upon no scientific principle.
The fraudulent sale of stock in connection with the promotion of
so-called "Road-A-Scopes," a device proposed to be installed along
highways which purportedly would enable motorists to see around
curves and over hills, resulted in the indictment during the year in
U. S. v, J ames P. Anderson et al. (D. Ariz.). Among other things,
it was charged that the defendants falsely represented that the proceeds from stock sales would be deposited in a trust account to be
used only for the purpose of manufacturing and installing the RoadA-Scope device and that the defendants made false and extravagant
statements regarding the income to be received from advertising placed
on the Road-A-Scope device and failed to disclose to investors that
the promotional company had never received any advertising revenues
or other income except III a nominal amount. The promotion of an
allegedly new type of lawnmower was involved in U. S. v, James D.
Bobbrof] et ai. (D. Nev.)," where the indictment charged misrepresentations, among other things, with respect to the use which was to be
made of the funds received from investors and the status of production
of the lawnmowers involved. Convictions were obtained after the
close of the fiscal year in both of these cases.
Misrepresentations with respect to the use of funds as well as numerous other matters are included in the fraud charges contained in the
indictment in U. S. v. Siegfried Bechbold et al. (S. D. Fla.) a pending
case, which involved the sale of stock and franchises of Ribbonwriter
Corporation of America in connection with the promotion of a typewriter attachment device, known as "Rib-N-Rite," which allegedly
would make duplicate copies by means of ribbons and thus eliminate
the use of carbon paper.
The promotion of a small loan business at Jackson, Mississippi, resulted in a conviction during the year in U. S. v, Paul A. Schumpert

tate the sale of stock, without disclosure that such dividends had not
been earned but were being paid out of capital and actually represented a partial return of the investors' own funds.
After the close of the fiscal year convictions were obtained against
a number of defendants in U. S. v. Alejandro D. Llanos (D. Hawaii) /3
in which the indictment alleged a wide-spread scheme to defraud
residents of the Territory of Hawaii, principally plantation laborers,
in connection with the sale of securities issued by the defendant
Alejandro D. Llanos and others associated with him in what was
loosely called "Llanos and Company." In the sale of these securities,
it was charged that the defendants falsely stated to investors that
the funds received from them would be wagered on "fixed" volley ball
games or, in other instances, would be invested in various business
enterprises with a guarantee against loss, or that the funds were
needed to meet expenses in order to accomplish the withdrawal and
distribution of millions of dollars among the "members of Llanos &
Company." In this connection, according to the indictment, the defendants falsely represented, inter alia, that the defendants controlled a prominent California shipbuilding company, which was indebted to Llanos in the amount of $6,000,000 and that the Llanos
group also had on deposit in an Hawaiian bank an additional $6,500,000 and that these tremendous sums ultimately would be distributed among the persons investing in "Llanos & Company."
Convictions involving securities brokers and dealers and their representatives were obtained during the year in V. S. v. Wade F. Ooley
(W. D. S. C.), where it was charged that the defendant while insolvent
operated a securities business, converted customers' funds and securities, maintained false and fraudulent books and records, made false
representations to representatives of the Commission and filed false
and misleading financial statements with the Commission; and in
U. S. v, EugeneF'. Luok (S. D. Fla.) 14 and U. S. v. Paul R. Warwick,
Jr. (N. D. Tex.), in which cases the conversion of customers' monies
or securities constituted a part of the frauds charged. Similar fraudulent conversions are charged in the indictments returned during the
year in U. S. v. Iiiohard E. Slaugenhaupt (W. D. Pa.) and U. S. v.
Sidney W. Tuttle (E. D. Pa.). After the close of the fiscal year, the
defendant in the latter case was convicted.
In V. S. ewrel S. E. O. v. J osiah Marshall Kirby (N. D. Ohio), the
defendant Kirby was convicted of criminal contempt, for continuing
to act as an over-the-counter securities broker and dealer, without
being registered under section 15 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, in violation of preliminary and final injunctive decrees obtained in 1948 and 1949, respectively.
The indictment returned during the year in V. S. v. Eldridge S.
Price (N. D. Ohio) ,15 charged violations solely of the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, in connection WIth the sale in
large amount of investment contracts involving oil and gas lease assignments on lands located in Runnels County, Texas, In this case it

and gas lease assignments, coupled with collateral promises that oil
wells would be drilled to prove the acreage involved, when no registration statement was in effect as to such securities with the Commission. After the close of the fiscal year, the defendant was convicted
on these charges. In U. 8. v. O. L. Lloyd (N. D. Ill.) , a pending case,
involving the former Chairman of the Board of Nu Enamel Corporation, an indictment was returned during the year, charging violations
by Lloyd of the registration provisions of the Act in connection with
sales of his stock of this corporation.
In the only appellate case involving criminal prosecution decided
during the fiscal year, Allen v. U. S., 186 F. 2d 439 (C. A. 9, 1951),
certiorari denied 341 U. S. 948, the defendant's conviction for the
fraudulent sale of securities in connection with the promotion of a
number of mining companies was sustained.
COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

The Commission is authorized to conduct investigations and, except
in criminal prosecutions, to institute and pursue its own remedies. In
the main, these are injunctive actions in the United States District
Courts or administrative proceedings before the Commission. Where
criminal prosecution is sought the evidence is referred to the Department of Justice and the United States attorneys.
Information leading to investigations comes from varied sources.
Frequently, violations are indicated by material required to be filed
with the Commission, such as registration statements, annual and
quarterly reports, ownership reports, etc. Other Federal agencies,
State authorities and official and unofficial bodies concerned with
finance and law enforcement cooperate in informing the Commission
of suspected violations. However, members of the investing public
who write to the Commission or call at its officesto make inquiry or
register complaints account for the bulk of the Commission's investigations. During the 1951 fiscal year, 10,100 letters were received relating to possible violations of the Securities Act and the Securities
Exchange Act. In addition, many complaints were received by telephone and by personal interviews.
Letters and calls received and handled by the ten regional offices
are not included.
The ~rimary responsibility for investigation rests with the Commission s regional administrators whose investigators conduct most
of the field work. The principal office also temporarily assigns personnel to assist regional officesin investigations.
Investigations are classified by the Commission as preliminary investigations and docketed cases. A preliminary investigation is one
of limited scope for the purpose of determining whether a full scale
investigation is warranted.
If so, it becomes a docketed case. In
many situations, it is determined at the outset that an extensive investigation is warranted and a docketed investigation file is opened.
During the fiscal year, 1951, the Commission instituted a total of 665
new investigations.
Of these, 367 were preliminary and 298 were
docketed. In addition, 60 cases which were opened as preliminary
were later docketed. During the same period, 413 investigations were
closed, leaving 1,109 as the total of all investigations pending at the
end of the fiscal year.

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL

REPORT

155

Many preliminary investigations are carried on by telephone,
through correspondence, officeresearch or limited interviews and often
disclose violations of a minor nature not necessitating further investigation or the use of any sanction. Such violations, for the most
part, occur either because of a lack of knowledge of the Federal securities laws or misinterpretation of these Acts. When such persons
learn they are violating the law, they usually are quite willing to agree
to take necessary corrective steps without the use of sanctions. This
procedure serves the dual purpose of effectively preventing the contmuance of minor violations and at the same time educating the public concerning the requirements of the Securities Acts. The following
are examples, among many, of this type of case:
The controlling interest in a large chain of grocery stores was held
by members of the same family. The chief stockholders, through
underwriters, sold a considerable portion of their stock although not
enough to transfer control out of the family. While the distribution
was continuing, the chief stockholders were informed by representatives of the Commission that they were violating the law. They immediately cancelled all sell orders and, at considerable expense to themselves, were able to reverse most of the transactions.
One of the
brokers also bought back a considerable block of stock at a loss. In
view of the good faith of the subjects in attempting to correct their
error and the lack of substantial damage to the public, no action was
taken.
In another instance, information reached the Commission that a
committee representing a minority group of a Central European
country was offering bonds for sale within the United States to ex-nationals of that country. Investigation disclosed that, while some of
such persons had been solicited to purchase bonds, actual sales were
de minimu..<;. Those responsible denied any intent to violate the law,
discontinued solicitation and returned the purchase price to the few
who had responded to the offering. Hence the Commission took no
action.
If the preliminary investigation shows the need of further inquiry,
a case is docketed and a full and detailed investigation is made. The
Commission has power to issue subpoenas and administer oaths to
witnesses for the purpose of conducting investigations and may delegate such power to members of its staff. This power is used only when
the investigation could not otherwise proceed. In each such instance,
the facts disclosed by preliminary investigation and the reasons why
subpoena power is necessary are presented orally to the Commission.
If the Commission decides that proceeding by subpoena is justified,
it issues an order which designates officers with the power to subpoena
records, administer oaths and take testimony. Such power is limited
to the specific subject matter of a particular investigation.
During the fiscal year 1951 the Commission delegated subpoena
power by issuance of formal orders of investigation in 47 cases. Of
these, 32 related solely to possible violations of the registration and
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and possible violations of the Securities Act were included in seven other orders which
also involved indicated violations of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940. Seven orders related only to possible viola-

156

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

tions of the Securities Act of 1934 and one solely to the Investment
Advisers Act.
When an investigation has been completed, a report is submitted
to the appropriate Regional Administrator who, after review, forwards it to the principal officewith his recommendation. That recommendation may take anyone of several forms, among which are (1)
reference to the Department of Justice for criminal action, (2) the
institution of injunctive or other proceedings in the civil courts, (3)
administrative action by the Commission, or (4) reference to another
agency or department of the Federal Government or to State authorities, for appropriate action. In each instance, the report and recommendation of the Regional Administrator is reviewed by the staff
of the Commission's principal office and the matter is then presented
to the Commission in detail. All formal investigations (where subpoena power has been authorized) or where the Commission has officially taken some other action such as reference to the Department
of Justice, are again presented to the Commission and reviewed by
them before the files are ultimately closed.
.
In some instances, complaints appeared to involve violations of law
but, upon investigation, did not justify action. As an example, the
Commission received several letters from stockholders of a longestablished oil and gas producing company claiming that its management had entered into a deal to sell its stock to another company at a
price which was inadequate. The minority stockholders had received
the same offer but had not been given adequate information on which
to base an informed judgment as to the acceptance of the offer. Investigation established that the price offered to minority stockholders
was substantially over the market, that the deal between the controlling stockholders and the buyers had been negotiated at arms' length
on the basis of competent reports by geological engineers as to the
value of the underlying assets and that no VIolation of the Securities
Act was involved.
In another case, information reached the Commission that the bonds
of a Central American republic had been sold within the United
States in violation of the registration provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933. Various persons in the securities industry and others reported rumors that a large amount of such bonds were being sold or
were about to be sold within the United States. Investigation disclosed that, while various American firms had from time to time submitted proposals to finance, by the sale of bonds, a program to develop
the natural resources of the country, none had, as yet, materialized and
no public offering of bonds had been made. The interested parties
were instructed concerning applicability of the Securities Act to any
future transactions involving public distribution of bonds in the
United States. Some contractors and others who had received bonds
for work and services apparently had contemplated disposing of them
in this country without registration.
Their plans were abandoned
when it became known that the Commission was investigating the
matter. The Commission's files in the matter were made available
to the Bureau of Internal Revenue at its request in connection with
possible violations of the tax laws.
In another instance the Commission received information that
Chinese Communist interests, through their sympathizers in this country, were conducting a campaign to sell their bonds in the United

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

157

States. This was reported to be a part of a larger movement throughout the world to force the sale of these bonds to persons of Chinese
extraction under threat of reprisal against their relatives in China.
Detailed investigation failed to disclose concrete evidence of the public offering or sale of such bonds within the United States, and therefore the matter was not subject to the jurisdiction of this Commission.
However, in the course of the investigation, the Commission cooperated with the Federal Bureau of Investigation and other agencies
charged with security protection and made its files available to them
for security purposes.
Complainants sometimes seek personal retaliation rather than public benefit. A typical case occurred when an attorney complained to
one of the Commission's regional officesthat the stock of a cooperative
apartment corporation had been sold in violation of the registration
and fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933. The statement
was sufficiently convincing to require detailed examination of books
and records of the corporation and the taking of testimony from various witnesses. However, it turned out that no violations of law or
other irregularities were involved, that the complainant was a discharged employee of the corporation who had stated that he would
"get even--if
it took all his life" and had made complaints not
only to the Commission but to the Attorney General of the State and
the District Attorney of the County.
The Commission enforcement investigations are confidential and
no information may be divulged to persons other than Commission
employees unless the Commission itself makes it public. Private litigation often arises from the same subject matter as Commisison investigations. Frequently, litigants ask for the Commission's evidence
to assist their causes. Such requests are denied unless unusual and
compelling reasons require a contrary course. Such cases are extremely rare. However, the Commission, upon request, in proper
cases makes its evidence available to Federal and state law enforcement authorities. Also, Committees of Congress have been provided
with evidence touching upon subjects under their inquiry. Among
these were the Senate Committee to Investigate Organized Crime in
Interstate Commerce.
The Commission maintains constant liaison with other Federal and
state enforcement agencies in the securities field. During the past
fiscal year, the Commission opened its confidential investigation files
in 19 cases to such agencies. In other cases, where the subject matter
involves apparent violations of both Federal and state laws, the Commission's investigators and those of state securities authorities jointly
conduct the investigation which may result in both state and Federal
action. Also, a constant exchange of information as to securities
enforcement action is maintained with state and Canadian authorities. The following are concrete examples of this type of cooperation:
In a typical case the subject of investigation who had formerly been
convicted of grand larceny in New York in connection with a securities
transaction and was also permanently enjoined from-engaging in the
securities business in that state was found to have sold approximately
$15,000 worth of oil royalties to persons with whom he had come in
contact in his business of sending food packages and cash to persons
in Germany as agent for their friends. In these sales, the value of the
oil royalties had been grossly misrepresented. The state authorities

158

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

requested that the Commission turn its evidence over to them. While
technically a violation of the fraud provisions of the Securities Act
of 1933 was involved, essentially it was a local matter and lent itself
to prosecution in the state courts. The Commission opened its files
to the state authorities and permitted one of its investigators to testify,
as a result of which charges were preferred against the defendant in
the New York State Court, charging various violations of the state
securities laws.
In another case, the Commission's investigation disclosed that the
subject had swindled a Nebraska farm widow of approximately
$18,000 in the sale of securities. Concurrently, the Nebraska authorities learned of the incident and requested access to the Commission's
files. It appeared that the matter was one which lent itself more
readily to state than Federal prosecution and the Commission made
its evidence available to and otherwise cooperated with the state. As
a result, the Governor appointed a special prosecutor who obtained
a conviction of the defendant, who was sentenced to twelve years in
the State Penitentiary.
The Assistant Director and Counsel of the
Bureau of Securities in Nebraska described the cooperation between
the Commission and his Bureau in part as follows:
There
agencies
valuable
evidence

has always been a fine relationship and cooperation between the two
and the Securities and Exchange Commission has rendered a very
service in all of these matters which has permitted the obtaining of
beyond our control.

In summary, during the fiscal year, the Commission's investigative
staff processed thousands of complaints and other communications,
as a result of which 665 new investigations were undertaken. At the
beginning of the period, 857 investigations were carried over. Within
the year, 413 investigations were closed, leaving a total of 1,109
il!.vestigations pending at the end of the year. While only a comparatively small percentage of such investigations resulted in the
imposition of coercive sanctions or reference for criminal prosecution,
the effectiveness of the Commission's investigative activities may not
be measured by this standard alone.
One of the principal results of the Commission's investigative
activity has been the prevention of violation of the Federal Securities
laws and the continuing education of the public and the investment
industry in the application of those statutes and coercive sanction
in all cases involving technical violations of the law has been found not
to be necessary adequately to protect investors and serve the public
interest.

Sales of Canadian Securities Within the United States

For many years, the Commission has attempted to stop the sale
of unregistered Canadian securities in the United States. In all cases
involving mass-mailing campaigns and telephone selling of such securities that we have been able to investigate fully, we have found the
sales to be attended by fraudulent methods; in virtually all such cases
the securities have proved to be worthless. Although evidence sufficient to convict the sellers of violations of the registration and fraud
provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 is obtained in these instances,
the Commission's efforts have been in a large measure thwarted because the existing extradition treaty with Canada does not permit
rendition of the violators to the United States authorities for
prosecution.
Practically all such illegal offerings emanate from Toronto, Ontario,
and the securities are sold through intensive mail and telephone campaigns over the border to all parts of the United States. During the
past two years, the Commission has obtained evidence establishing
that upwards of 200 such unregistered Canadian issues have been
offered for sale within the United States. The sales pattern is uniform and simple, though apparently convincing to many United States
investors. The victim is first solicited by mail, told of the great moneymakin~ possibilities of the mine or oil well involved, and asked merely
to sena. his name and address on a prepaid post card. Within a few
days he receives a telephone call from Toronto in which he is promised
large and immediate profits if he invests at once. The salesman
usually tells the victim that oil, gold or uranium (depending on the
promotion) has just been discovered in large quantities and he is being
let in "on the ground floor." The victims are almost always inexperienced in investment matters and persons who can ill afford the
inevitable loss of their savings.
Complaints from the public, Better Business Bureaus and state
authorities have been received in large number from all parts of the
United States. Securities commissions and other authorities of many
states have continued to issue cease and desist orders and injunctions
where solicitations have been made in violation of their securities laws.
Various newspapers, magazines and radio commentators, both American and Canadian, have performed a valuable service in educating the
public to the danger involved in responding to such solicitations. The
Post Office Department has continued to give full cooperation to the
Commission in attempting to protect the public from these illegal mass
mail campaigns. During the fiscal year, the Commission has provided
the Post OfficeDepartment with evidence which resulted in the issuance
of fraud orders against 41 such persons, and fictitious name orders
against 4 individuals and firms. While this campaign has been partially successful, the ingenuity of the fraudulent brokers and dealers
in Canada and the lack of sufficient personnel in the Post OfficeDepartment adequately to screen the mail has detracted from its efficiency.
During the fiscal year, the principal office of this Commission received 4,488 letters from persons who had been solicited to purchase
unregistered Canadian securities. Each day the principal office and
the ten regional officesreceive telephone calls and personal visits from
victims of this vicious "racket." Unfortunately, many such victims
have parted with their savings prior to contacting the Commission.
Despite the failure of earlier attempts to negotiate a suitable extra-

160

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

dition treaty to cover these cases, the Commission, in conjunction
with the State Department, continued to press for necessary treaty
revisions. After the close of the fiscal year, in October 1951, such a
supplementary treaty was signed. If ratification is obtained and
the treaty is implemented, as we expect it to be, by cooperative action
on the part of local Canadian authorities, we should be in a position to
provide adequate and much needed protection to our investors.
SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

In the first year of its existence the Commission established a section
of Securities Violations for assistance in the enforcement of the various statutes which it administers and to provide a further means of
preventing fraud in the purchase and sale of securities. This section
has developed files which provide the basis of maintaining a clearing
house of information concerning persons who have been charged with
violations of various Federal and State securities statutes.
The
specialized information in these files has been kept current through
the cooperation of the United States Post Office Department, the
Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation officials, State
securities commissions, Federal and State prosecuting attorneys, police
officers, Better Business Bureaus, and members of the United States
Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the 1951 fiscal year these records
contained data concerning 54';887 persons against whom Federal or
State action had been taken in connection with securities violations.
During the past year alone additional items of information relating
to 5,168 persons were added to the records of this section, including
information concerning 1,725 persons not previously identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearing house of information.
During
the past year, in connection with the maintenance and preventive application of these records, the Commission received 4,454 "securities
violations" letters or reports (apart from those which are classified
as "complaint enforcement") and dispatched 2,654 communications in
turn to cooperating agencies.
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

The detailed provisions of the several Acts administered by the
Commission contain wide recognition of the fact that much of the data
necessary to investment or other financial decisions consists of financial
statements and related material and that, accordingly, accountants
and accounting perform a vital role in achieving the statutory objectives of full and fair disclosure, the prevention of fraud or inequitable
and unfair practices, and control and regulation. Thus, for example,
the Securities Act provides not only for inclusion in the registration
statement and prospectus of data as to financial structure and other
similar material but also provides for the furnishing of balance sheets
and profit and loss statements."
Similar provisions as to registration
statements and periodic reports are contained in the Securities Exchange Act,l1 the Holding Company Act 18 and the Investment Company Act.IO In order to ensure that in the furnishing of such financial
information the statutory objectives as to investors and public pro11 Sees.

tection are met, the Acts vest the Commission with broad authority in
matters of accounting and financial statement presentation.
The
Securities Act, for example, authorizes the Commission to define
accounting terms, to prescribe, among other matters, "the form or
forms in which required information shall be set forth, the items or
details to be shown in the balance sheet and earning statement, and
the methods to be followed in the preparation of accounts ... " 20
Substantially equivalent authority is contained in the Securities Exchange Act,21 and more comprehensive powers are embodied in the
Holding Company Act 22 and the Investment Company Act.23
The Securities Act provides that the required financial statements
shall be certified by "an independent public or certified accountant." 24
The other three statutes above mentioned provide that the Commission
may require, and its rules do require, that such statements be accompanied by a certificate of independent public accountants," The value
of certification has for many years been conceded but the requirement
as to independence, long recognized by some individual accountants,
was for the first time authoritatively and explicitly stated by its introduction into the statutes. Out of this initial provision in the Securities
Act and the resulting rules established by the Commission 26 there
have grown concepts that have materially strengthened the protection
afforded investors by eliminating certain unhealthy accountant-client
relationships which theretofore were quite common.
Although the statutes administered by the Commission give it wide
rule-making power, accounting, based as it is largely upon convention
and existing financial and business concepts, is of such a nature that
the Commission has not yet found it necessary or desirable in most
areas to establish extensive accounting rules and regulations dealing
with accounting problems. The Commission has prescribed uniform
systems of accounts for certain public utility holding companies and
for public utility mutual and subsidiary service companies. It has
adopted rules under the Securities Exchange Act governing accounting and auditing of exchange members, brokers, and dealers. In the
wider area dealing with industrial, commercial, and investment companies under the Securities Act, Securities Exchange Act, and Investment Company Act the form and content of most financial statements
are governed by the Commission's Regulation S-X.
The rules and regulations thus established do not prescribe the
accounting to be followed except in certain basic respects. In the
large area not covered by such rules the Commission's principal reliance for the protection of investors is on the determination and
application of accounting standards which are recognized as sound
and which have come to have general acceptance. This policy of the
Commission is expressed in Accounting Series release No.4 (1938)
(one of the series of such releases, of which there are now seventy-two,
inaugurated in 1937 for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in major accounting
questions) .

COMMISSION

One of the inevitable results of this policy has been constant contact
and cooperation between the Commission and accountants, both individually and through such groups as the American Institute of Accountants, the American Accounting Association, the Controllers
Institute of America, the National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners and others, and other regulatory agencies. The
importance of, and necessity for, this cooperation is emphasized by the
great influence and responsibility inherent in the Commission's authority over the several thousand financial statements filed every year with
it by most of the important commercial and industrial companies in
the United States.
The accounting staff of the Commission is organized to handle the
many day-to-day accounting problems that arise in the course of its
work and to provide central responsibility for aiding the Commission
in matters of accounting policy. The chief accountant has general
supervision with respect to accounting and auditing policy and its
application. He is assisted directly by a staff of trained accountants,
and, in addition, by assistant chief accountants assigned to and responsible for the examination of financial data and other operating
work in the Division of Corporation Finance, Division of Public
Utilities, and Division of Trading and Exchanges.
Examination of Financial Statements

The majority of the accounting problems with which the Commission is concerned arise from examination of financial statements or
other data required to be filed with the Commission. In general,
deficiencies revealed by examination are called to the attention of the
registrant by letter. These letters of comment and the correspondenc-e
or conferences that follow have proved to be a most convenient aid in
effecting corrections and improvements in financial reporting. Few
matters involve prolonged discussion or dispute in spite of the tremendous volume of financial data reviewed each year by the Commission; and it is only in rare instances that formal procedures are
necessary in order to procure disclosure.
Many problems arise as a result of inquiry by representatives of
registrants, their accountants or counsel in advance of the actual filing
of the material involved. Advance discussion of this kind is encouraged and experienced practitioners regularly follow this procedure in dealing with unique problems, thus saving valuable time for
themselves and their clients. As a natural outgrowth of the fact
that the Commission is the repository of a vast amount of financial
data, the staff is frequently called on to aid in the preparation of
studies of current problems such as those involved in formulating the
background of legislative proposals.
Amendment of Regulation S-X

During the year a general revision of Regulation S-X, the Commission's principal accounting and auditing regulation relating to the
form and content of financial statements filed with it, was accomplished. This regulation was originally adopted in February 1940
after extensive reconsideration of the predecessor requirements theretofore contained in the respective registration and annual report
forms.
In the Commission's annual reports for the last two years reference
has been made to the relatively infrequent (but important) new provisions added to the regulation since adoption and to the apparent

SEVENTEENTH

163

need for a complete reappraisal of the regulation that would include
within its scope reconsideration of all rules." These reports reviewed
the efforts made, from the preliminary proposal sent out in September
1949 to the formally announced proposal on July 12, 1950, to obtain a
wide expression of views not only as to staff suggestions but as to
possible amendments to the regulation not sponsored by the staff.
Following the formal announcement of proposed amendments under
the Administrative Procedure Act, as to which more than 3,000 persons received copies, again approximately 175 persons commented
upon the proposals.
The suggestions were carefully considered and
in a number of instances formed the basis of changes incorporated
in the final amendments.
In addition, a special committee of the
American Institute of Accountants, at its request, was informally
heard by the Commission in support of its views on certain points it
believed should be reflected in the revision. The final amendments
were promulgated December 20, 1950, in Accounting Series release

No. 70.
Among the amendments to Regulation S-X that are of major importance to registrants filing financial statements with the Commission
and also to professional accountants whose reports must accompany
such statements is a new provision contained in rule 1-01 (a) that
in effect makes the previously referred to A.ccounting Series releases
a part of the regulation.
Many of such releases contain highly significant statements the applicability of which, under the amended rule,
is not now likely to escape the attention of interested persons, and
which, it should be clear, continue to reflect considered Commission
policy. This is particularly important with respect to release No.4,
to which reference has been made above, because of its controlling
provisions in areas where the largest volume of accounting problems
fall.
The definitions of terms used in the regulation have now been made
complete by bringing into rule 1-02 a substantial group of terms for
which previously a reference to other regulations was necessary.
In Article 2 which deals with the certification of financial statements
the provisions contained in rules 2-01 (b) and 2-01 (c) relating to
the certifying accountant's independence as to a person were extended
to any affiliate of the person, and the previous specification, in rule
2-01 (b), as to the interest in such person (or affiliate) that will result
in the accountant being considered not independent was changed from
"any substantial interest" to "any financial interest," thus conforming
the rule to established Commission policy and to the prevailing practice in professional circles.
An important change was effected in rule 3-11 of the regulation.
Before amendment the rule exempted public utility companies from
the requirement, and otherwise universal practice, of deducting, on the
balance sheet, depreciation, depletion, amortization or retirement reserves from the specific assets to which they apply. The amendment,
adopted after full consideration of the conflicting views of interested
parties, removes the exemption.
Opposition to this change was confined to representatives of the public utility industry who were concerned about the possible effect in certain jurisdictions upon utility

rate-making of showing utility plant accounts net of related reserves.
The elimination of the exemption was predicated upon the belief that
there was no necessary relationship between balance sheets prepared
for investors or the public generally and the processes of regulating
rates for utility services.
Previous Commission policy as to disclosure of certain commitments
is now codified in rule 3-18 of the regulation. In addition to the provision in paragraph (a) for a statement of material firm commitments
involving permanent investments and fixed assets there is required by
paragraph (b) appropriate disclosure of annual rentals and other
pertinent facts in cases where rentals or obligations under long-term
leases are material. The development of policy in this respect was
referred to in the annual reports of the last two years.28
The rapid expansion of the number of corporate pension and retirement plans that began during World War II and continued to the
present time focused considerable attention upon the proper accounting for the much enlarged liabilities and payments associated with the
plans. The Commission's views were first discussed in the thirteenth
annual report after extensive experience with the many pension plan
problems that arose." Later, after additional experience and reconsideration of views, due in part to special problems introduced by the
pension-plan results of union-company negotiations in several industries, notably the steel producing industry, the Commission's policy
was again indicated in the sixteenth annual report." With this background, and after the benefit of discussion among leaders in finance
and of comment prompted by announced proposals, there was included
in rule 3-19 (e) the requirement that balance sheets should be accompanied by (1) a brief description of the essential rrovisions of any
such plan; (2) an indication of the estimated annua cost of the plan ;
and (3) if the plan is not funded or otherwise provided for, a diselosure of the estimated amount that would be necessary to accomplish
this.
.
One of the principal responsibilities of the Commission is to obtain for the investing public financial statements that are the most
informative and which are the least likely to mislead, especially,
those who are not experienced in the significance of such statements.
In previous annual reports 81 reference was made to a problem which
has long been under consideration and which has been the subject
of repeated exchanges of views between the Commission's staff and
representatives of the American Institute of Accountants and other
interested parties, namely, the concept of income and the proper form
of income or profit-and-loss statement.
The main point of difference has been the propriety of excluding
from the determination of Net Income, and the inclusion thereof in
Earned Surplus, major items which are extraordinary in nature or
which had their origin in prior years. A workable solution to this
problem was commented upon as follows in Accounting Series release No. 70, issued on December 20, 1950, which announced the revision of Regulation S-X:

The principal new requirement pertains to Profit and Loss or Income Statements and is contained in Rule 5-03 (a) which states:
"All items of profit and loss given recognition in the accounts during
the period covered by the profit and loss or income statements shall be
included."
The inclusion of this requirement, which states a long established policy of
the Commission,is deemed necessary because of the not always consistent practice followed by some registrants of excluding certain items from the profit and
loss or income statements with the result that the amount shown thereon as
net incomeor loss has been susceptible to misinterpretation by investors. Recognizing that there might be exceptional circumstances which would make it appropriate to deviate from this rule, but keeping in mind the Commission's responsibility for prohibiting the dissemination of financial statements which
might be misleading to investors, Rule 5-03 was amended to read:
"Except as otherwise permitted by the Commission,the profit and loss
or income statements ftled for persons to whom this article is applicable
shall complywith the provlstons of this rule." [Underscoredphrase added
in revision.]
The purpose of this revision is to make clear to registrants that they are not
forestalled from giving exceptional treatment to exceptional items when both
the representatives of the registrant and the Commission are convinced that
such treatment is appropriate.
Notwithstanding this provision, representatives of the Executive Committee
ot the American Institute of Accountants appeared before the Commissionand
proposed that either Rule 5--03 (a) be eliminated from the regulation or the
requirements with respect to the presentation of the final section of profit and
loss or income statements be amended to permit, where appropriate, the exclusion of extraordinary items from those making up the caption net income
or loss.
To accomplish this, additional items, described in Rules 5-03 (17) and 5-03
(18), were added to those previously set forth in the regulation, and the last
three items of the section pertaining to profit and loss or income statements
(Rule 5-03) now appear as follows:
"16. Net income or loss.
"17. Special items.-State separately and describe each item of profit
and loss given recognition in the accounts, included herein pursuant to
Rule 5-03 (a), and not included in the determination of net income or
loss (Item 16).
"18. Net income or loss and special items."
Captions 17 and 18 are to be used in those instances where it is believed
that the showing of a single unqualified figure of net income or loss might be
misconstrued.
DIVISION OF OPINION WRITING

The Division of Opinion Writing aids the Commission in the preparation of findings, opinions, and orders promulgated by the Commission in contested and other cases arising under the Securities Act of
1933, the Securities' Exchange Act of 1934, the Holding Company Act
of 1935, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, the Investment Company Act
of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. These statutes
provide for a wide variety of administrative proceedings which require quasi-judicial determination by the Commission. Formalopinions are issued in all cases where the nature of the matter to be decided,
whether substantive or procedural, is of sufficient importance to warrant a formal expression of views.
The Division of Opinion Writing is an independent staff officewhich
is directly responsible to the Commission. It receives all assignments
and instructions from and makes recommendations and submits its
work to the Commission directly.
It is headed by a director, who is

166

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

assisted by an assistant director, supervising attorneys, and a staff of
drafting attorneys and a financial analyst.
While engaged in the preparation of opinions assigned to the Division of Opinion Writing, the members of this division are completely
isolated from members of the operating division actively participating in the proceedings and it is an invariable rule that those assigned
to prepare such an opinion must not have had any prior participation
in any phase of the proceedings with respect to which the opinion is
to be prepared, Commission experts are from time to time consulted
on techmcal problems arising in the course of the preparation of opinions and findings, but these experts are never individuals who have
participated in the preparation of the case or testified at the hearing.
The director or assistant director of the Division of Opinion Writing, together with the members of the staff of the division who are
assigned to work on a particular case, attend the oral argument of the
cases before the Commission and frequently kee;p abreast of current
hearings. Prior to the oral argument, the division makes a preliminary review of the record and prepares and submits to the Commission
a summary of the facts and Issues raised in the hearings before the
hearing officer, as well as in any proposed findings and supporting
briefs, the hearing officer's recommended decision, and exceptions
thereto taken by the parties. Following oral argument or, if no oral
argument has been held, then at such time as the case is ready for
decision, the Division of Opinion Writing is instructed by the Commission respecting the nature and content of the opinion and order to
be prepared.
In preparing the draft of the Commission's formal opinion, the
entire record in the proceedings is carefully read by at least one member of the staff of the Division of Opinion Writing and in some cases a
narrative abstract of the record is prepared. Upon completion of a
draft opinion and abstract of the record, and after review and revision
of the opinion within the Division of Opinion Writing, they are submitted to the Commission. If the study of the record in the case by
the Division of Opinion Writing has revealed evidence of violations
warranting a reference to the Attorney General for criminal prosecution, or has disclosed the desirability or the need for any changes in
administrative procedures or techniques, appropriate recommendations are made to the Commission at the time the draft opinion in the
case is submitted.
The draft opinion as submitted may be modified, amended, or completely rewritten in accordance with the Commission's final instructions. When the opinion accurately expresses the views and conclusions of the Commission, it is adopted and promulgated as the official
decision of the Commission. In some cases concurring or dissenting
opinions are issued by individual Commissioners who wish to express
their separate views on matters covered by the opinion adopted by
the majority of the Commission. In such cases the Division of Opinion Writing is occasionally instructed to prepare drafts of such concurring or dissenting opinions and confers respecting them with the
individual Commissioners involved, submits drafts directly to them,
and makes such modifications and revisions as are directed.
The findings of fact, opinions, and orders adopted and promulgated
by the Commission serve as an aid and guide to the bench and bar.
With minor exceptions (e. g., certain opinions dealing with requests

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

167

for confidential treatment) all are publicly released and ~ist;ibut~~ to
representatives of the press and persons on the Commission s mailing
list. In addition, the findings and opinions are printed and published
by the Government Printing Office in bound volumes under the title
"Securities and Exchange Commission Decisions and Reports."
The creation of the Division of Opinion Writing as an independent
staff unit in 1942 was based on the view that the fair exercise of the
Commission's adjudicatory functions in many types of cases made it
appropriate that it be assisted in that function by members of its staff
who were independent of units engaged in investigation or prosecution of cases. Originally initiated as a matter of Commission policy,
the desirability of this arrangement was subsequently given express
recognition in specific provisions of the Administrative Procedure
Act, which in certain types of cases requires that there be a complete
separation of function between quasi-prosecutory functions and quasijudicial functions. The existence of the Division of Opinion Writing
thus made it possible for the Commission, even before the passage of
the Administrative Procedure Act, to meet fully the separation of
function requirements contained in sections 5 (c), 7, and 8 of that Act,
The Commission, through its revised rules of practice, has sought
to provide a flexible procedure which will be suited to the needs and
desires of the participants in the proceeding before it, as well as
guarantee to them the procedural safeguards required by the general
principles of due process and the provisions of the Administrative
Procedure Act. Thus, at the request of some participants, the Commission has in many cases availed itself of the assistance of the Division of Opinion Writing in the preparation of its findings even though
separation of functions was not required by law.
In addition to its primary function, the Division of Opinion Writing is also given assignments of a general nature which are not inconsistent WIth the objective of the separation of the investigatory and
quasi-judicial functions. Thus, the division has been assigned continuing joint responsibility with the office of the General Counsel
in dealing with problems arising under the Administrative Procedure
Act. It has also been given the responsibility of preparing a compilation of administrative decisions and other authorities under the
various statutes administered by the Commission.
The Division of Opinion Writing assists the operating divisions of
the Commission in the preparation of opinions in certain uncontested
cases where participation by the operating division in the decisional
process is proper under the Administrative Procedure Act. In some
instances members of the Division of Opinion Writing are assigned
to assist the Office of the General Counsel in connection with court
appeals taken from Commission decisions initially drafted in the
division.
Some of the more significant opinions issued by the Commission
during the year are commented upon in this report under the discussions of the various statutes.

During the fiscal year 1951 registration statements covering $730,760,812 of securities issued by foreign issuers, governmental and

168

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

private, were filed under the Securities Act of 1933. The largest of
these issues was that of the State of Israel amounting to $500,000,000.
Issues of the Government of Canada and Canadian provinces and
municipalities aggregated $180,468,000. Canadian private issues
accounted for most of the balance.
Following extended negotiations with the Ministry of Finance of
the Japanese Government, through the Supreme Commander for the
Allied Powers, the Japanese Government in November 1950 filed with
the Commission a report under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
relating to the status of the outstanding bonds. Upon the filing of
this report the Commission withdrew its request that brokers and dealers refrain from effecting transactions in Japanese bonds, and dealings
in these bonds were resumed on the New York Stock and New York
Curb Exchanges.
Upon the announcement of the West German Government in March
1951 of its recognition of prewar external debts, the Commission consulted with the Department of State as to the eventual resumption of
trading in bonds of German issues. In view of events which have
taken place in Germany since these bonds were suspended from dealings and the lack of current information on the status of the bonds, the
Department of State and the Commission concluded that it would not
be III the interest of United States foreign policy or of public investors
to approve the resumption of trading III German bonds at this time.
The Commission in a public statement of March 6, 1951 advised that
"it does not intend to withdraw its request that brokers and dealers
refrain from effecting transactions in German securities until assurances can be given to investors through validation procedures now
under consideration that only bonds which will constitute 'good delivery' will be afforded a market in the United States and appropriate
reports are filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934."
The Commission has participated in discussions which have been
held by the Department of State with representatives of the holders
of German dollar bonds and of the trustees and paying agents for these
bonds on drafts of German legislation for the validation of all outstanding bonds of German public and private issuers denominated in
foreign (non-mark) currencies. The Commission has also participated in the drawing up of an Executive Agreement between the
United States and the Republic of Germany to implement this legislation as to dollar bonds. These drafts are having the consideration of
the German authorities.
Through its representation on the Interdepartmental
Committee
on German Debts, the Commission has contributed to the establishing
of principles and procedures for bringing about a settlement of the
public and private prewar debts of Germany. The Commission is
represented on this Committee and at conferences on the German debt
problem by its Foreign Economic Adviser.
The Commission has also continued its representation on the Staff
Committee of the National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial Problems and has continued to cooperate with
other agencies concerned with the development and administration
of the Government's foreign economic program. During the year
its Foreign Economic Adviser has had frequent discussions with

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL REPORT

169

representatives of foreign governments who were seeking information
upon the regulations, procedures and practices of the United States
capital markets applicable to the raising of private capital by foreign
companies through the issuance of securities.
By amendment to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act securities
issued or guaranteed as to principal and interest by the International
Bank for Reconstruction and Development are deemed to be exempted
securities under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Commission in consultation with the
National Advisory Council on International Monetary and Financial
Problems is authorized to suspend the provisions of this amendment
at any time. The amendment requires the Commission to include in
its annual reports to Congress such information as it shall deem
advisable with regard to the operation and effect of the amendment,
and in connection therewith to include any views submitted for such
purpose by any association of dealers registered with the Commission.
The Commission has received no views from such association of
dealers.
In February 1951 the International Bank offered in the United
States a new issue of $50 million 3 percent bonds due in 1976. In the
distribution of these bonds the Bank did not, as in its previous bond
issue, employ the method of competitive bidding but it formed a
"sponsoring group" of commercial banks and investment firms whose
function was to advise the Bank on its financing, arrange for sales
to larf,e institutional investors and for subscriptions by the "selling
group' which consisted of 421 brokers and dealers. Of the $50 million of bonds offered, it is estimated that 98 percent was purchased by
institutional investors such as insurance companies, pension and trust
funds, savings and commercial banks. In this distribution the Bank
made available to members of the sponsoring and selling groups a
prospectus relating to the new bonds giving information about the
Bank's structure and operations. It also filed with the Commission
pursuant to regulation BW adopted by the Commission under the
amendment to the Bretton Woods Agreements Act information comparable to that which would be required if its securities had been registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934.
ADVISORY AND INTERPRETATIVE

ASSISTANCE

The importance of the advisory and interpretative service maintained by the Commission is emphasized by the continued volume
of inquiries received from attorneys, accountants, persons engaged
in the securities business and members of the general public. Requests
relate to the applicability of the provisions of the various Acts administered by the Commission and the regulations thereunder to every
phase of corporate financing.
While this informal advice primarily is intended to assist the public
it is equally valuable to the Commission. Many problems which appear complicated to those persons unfamiliar with securities legislation can readily be solved by the staff attorneys who are expert in
these matters. Those seeking help, however, are not confined to the

170

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

uninformed and many novel situations arise which give concern to
the veteran corporate lawyer. Often, by reason of this timely advice,
violations of certain provisions of the Acts or the pursuit of improper
procedure which otherwise might unwittingly result are avoidedthus saving the Commission as well as the public much time and
expense.
The Commission's readiness to render all possible assistance has
encouraged the solicitation of preliminary advice to such an extent
that it is not possible to determine to any degree of accuracy the number of possible violations that may have been avoided. However,
during the 1951 fiscal year several thousand letters of an advisory
nature were written by the Commission's central office. Many more
questions were answered in personal or telephone conferences between
members of the staff and the public. In addition, the Commission's
ten regional offices answer thousands of inquiries during the year.
Uniformity of interpretations is maintained through a procedure
whereby each regional officeis advised concerning inquiries received
in the central office originating from persons located in the region
served by that office and whereby the central office reviews interpretations given by the regional offices. Also, all regional offices are
advised by the central office concerning any unprecedented interpretation made at headquarters which has any general applicability or
which relates to any unique situation.
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF APPUCATIONS,
DOCUMENTS

REPORTS, OR

The Commission is empowered to grant confidential treatment,
upon application by registrants, to information contained in reports,
applications, or documents which they are required to file under the
Securities Act of 1933,the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,the Public
Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, the Investment Company Act
of 1940, and the Investment Advisers Act of 1940. Under the Securities Act of 1933 the Commission has adopted rule 485, which provides
that information as to material contracts, or portions thereof, will
be held confidential by the Commission if it determines that disclosure
would impair the value of the contracts and is not necessary for the
protection of investors. The other four statutes, in general, empower
the Commission to hold confidential under certain conditions any
information contained in any reports required to be filed under those
statutes. Disclosure of information confidentially filed under the
latter statutes is made only when the Commission determines that
disclosure is in the public interest. As described elsewhere in this
report, the Commission has adopted rules reintroducing the procedures followed under the former rules 171, X-6, and U-105, which
were in effect during World War II, to permit the omission or confidential treatment of certain information as called for in all filings
under the first three named statutes where its disclosure would be
detrimental to the national security.
Substantially over a hundred applications for confidential treatment were received and acted upon by the Commission during the 1951
fiscal year as indicated below.

STATISTICS AND SPECIAL STUDIES

In general, the statistical activities of the Commission relate to
(a) operational data derived from official filings with the Commission
and (b) data of general application on groups of companies subject
and not subject to the legislation administered by the Commission.
Operational

Statistics

In order to meet the Commission's responsibilities to the public, it
is essential to organize and present in meaningful and convenient
form, out of the masses of information filed with the Commission, pertinent data on registered issues and issuers. Much of these data are
not available elsewhere, nor in such complete form. Filed under strict
requirements, they are notable for accuracy. Extending over the years,
they present an ever widening base for comparisons and aggregates.
Data made available by the Commission are availed of in many forms
by the investing public, by the registrants themselves, by investment
advisers, accountants, trade organizations, and by numerous government agencies, national and state. Numerous reports have been compiled and tabulated contributing materially to the satisfaction of the
needs of the Congress and defense agencies during the present national emergency.
Survey of American Listed Corporations

Corporate data have been published annually by the Commission
for the years 1934-1947, under the title "Survey of American Listed
Corporations" covering well over half of all national manufacturing
based on asset size. More recent figures are in many cases available
or in course of preparation.
Registration

Statistics

Data are published quarterly in the Statistical Bulletin and yearly
in the Annual Report of the Commission, covering registration of all
securities under the Securities Act of 1933. The data, taken from the
filings made by registrants with the Commission, include purpose of
registration, method of offering, compensation to distributors, total
expenses, intended use of proceeds, type of security, and industry
classification.
Underwriting

Statistics

Underwriting statistics cover participations of investment bankers
in effectively registered issues, a showing of the leading underwriters,
and of firms managing the groups. The data carryon a series commenced in 1938, and are reported quarterly in the Statistical Bulletin.

172

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Cost of Flotation

Data on the cost of flotation of issues effectively registered with the
Commission under the Securities Act of 1933 have been published for
the years 1945-1949, inclusive, under the title "Cost of Flotation,"
dated in February 1951. Quarterly compilations under the same title
have been made and published separately commencing with the first
quarter of 1950. While these studies are prepared primarily for the
operational uses of the Commission's staff, they are also available to
issuers and distributors of securities and other interested persons.
Investment Companies

Investment company data are published quarterly in the Statistical
Bulletin, on about 200 registrants, segregated by open and closed-end
types. The coverage includes purchases and sales of their own securities, portfolio changes, and aggregates of securities and assets.
Saving Study

The Commission continued its series of guarterly releases on the
volume and composition of individuals' savmg in the United States.
These releases show the aggregate volume of individuals' saving as
well as the components contributing to the total, such as changes in
securities, cash, insurance and consumers' indebtedness, etc. These
data have been extremely useful in the determination of fiscal policy
and as a measurement of the inflationary potential.
Financial Position of Corporations

The Commission together with the Department of Commerce continued the joint series of quarterly releases on the plant and equipment expenditures of United States business other than agricultural.
Shortly after the close of each quarter these releases present industry
totals on the actual capital expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the next two quarters, In addition a survey
is made at the beginning of each year of the plans of business as regards expansion during that year. These data have provided a useful
index of present and future activity in the capital markets and of business in general. In view of the volatile nature of capital expenditures and their relation to the level of production and employment,
the series has been of considerable importance for business management and in the formation of government policy.
The series of quarterly releases on the working capital position of
all United States corporations exclusive of banks and insurance companies was also continued. These releases show the principal components of current assets and current liabilities and an abbreviated
analysis of the sources and uses of corporate funds. These data are
important in measuring the liquid position of the corporate segment
of the economy taken as a whole.
The Commission together with the Federal Trade Commission continued the joint series of quarterly industrial financial reports. These
reports developed as an extension of the working capital series and
present a complete balance sheet and an abbreviated income account
for manufacturing corporations as a whole. In addition the data
are shown for various size groups of corporations and for minor industry groups. The financial report program includes data on manufacturers' profits, which are extremely Important m the formulation
of a tax program and renegotiation policy. The data are basic to

SEVENTEENTH

ANNUAL

173

REPORT

any appraisal of corporate financial position and any analysis of corporation finance and the capital markets.
During the past fiscal year the report on manufacturing was adapted
to the needs of the Office of Price Stabilization in connection with the
determination of price policy. The program was also expanded at
their request to cover wholesale and retail trade.
Capital Markets

The Commission has also continued its monthly series on new securities offerings published in the Statistical Bulletin, and a quarterly
series published together with a brief analysis in release form. These
data show the volume and character of all securities offerings in the
United States, both registered and unregistered, public offerings and
private placements.
Collateral studies based on these data have been
undertaken from time to time pursuant to the Commission's needs and
requests from other branches of the government, and the public.
These included a study of the cost of flotation of privately placed
securities and a survey of issues offered under Regulation A.

During the fiscal year, the Commission lost a considerable number
of its experienced employees whose specialized skills were in great
demand by newly created or rapidly expanding defense agencies.
Some 80 employees transferred to other agencies, and 10 employees
entered on full time active duty in the military service. In addition,
about 20 employees were granted leave for tours of military training
duty.
The loss of these employees, representing almost 10 percent of the
entire staff, created serious problems for the Commission in carrying
out its important role in the Nation's economy. However, inasmuch
as the needs of the defense agencies for the services of these employees
were even more urgent, no objections to their release were interposed
by the Commission.
Two major revisions in the Commission's personnel management
program were effected during the year. A Performance Rating Plan,
designed to strengthen work performance and employee morale, was
developed pursuant to the Performance Rating Act of 1950 and put
into operation.
To facilitate the identification and recognition of
employees having a potential for development, and to further insure
that its capable employees would have a real opportunity for career
service, the Commission revised and formally restated its promotion
policy, incorporating in it certain standards prescribed by the Civil
Service Commission.
Staff assistance on all personnel matters is provided by the Commission's Division of Personnel.
The regular work of this Division

174

embraces employment, placement and separation; job evaluation and
classification; employee relations and services; training; operation of
various committees and boards such as the Committee of Expert E.xaminers (which conducts examinations for positions peculiar to the
Securities and Exchange Commission); wage administration; the
performance rating program; administration of Commission regulations governing the [ersonal securities and commodities transactions
of its personnel; an processing, recording and reporting of all personnel matters. A staff of eight employees is assigned to this work,
representing a ratio of one personnel employee to each 130 Commission employees.
In addition, the Division of Personnel is responsible for the conduct
of pre-appointment character investigations, leave administration and
accounting, retirement counseling, and the maintenance of an emergency medical unit. Four additional employees, including a registered nurse, are assigned to the Division of Personnel to carry out
these functions.

reference room in Washington. In addition to providing facilities for
personal inspection of registered public information, there were received in the public reference room thousands of letters and telephone
calls from persons requesting registered public information and copies
of forms, releases, and other material of a public nature. There were
2,633 persons who visited this public reference room seeking such information during the fiscal year 1951. Through the facilities provided
for the sale of photocopies of public registered information, 1,610
orders involving a total of 99,586 pages were filled. In addition to
