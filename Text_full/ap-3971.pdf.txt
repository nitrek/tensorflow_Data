ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-16463

In the Matter of
AEGIS CAPITAL, LLC,
CIRCLE ONE WEALTH MANAGEMENT, LLC,
DIANE W. LAMM,
STRATEGIC CONSULTING ADVISORS, LLC, AND
DAVID I. OSUNKWO

ORDER ON DIVISION’S
OBJECTIONS

The Division of Enforcement has filed objections to the witness and exhibit lists filed by
Respondents Strategic Consulting Advisors, LLC, and David I. Osunkwo. On relevance
grounds, the Division objects to the inclusion of three witnesses on Respondents’ witness list.
The Division objects to Respondents’ exhibit list because, although the parties were obligated to
file exhibit lists and exchange pre-marked exhibits by June 27, 2016, Respondents waited until
July 4, 2016, to e-mail their exhibit list and, as of July 5, 2016, have not provided pre-marked
copies of their exhibits.
The Division’s objection to Respondents’ witnesses is DENIED without prejudice to
renewal during the hearing. I will defer consideration of the Division’s objection to
Respondents’ exhibits. Respondents shall forthwith respond to the Division’s objection and
explain the reason for their delay in complying with the deadline related to exhibits and their
exhibit list. The Division’s deadline to file motions in limine related to Respondents’ exhibits is
extended to July 14, 2016. Owing to their delay in submitting their exhibit list, Respondents
shall have until 1:00 p.m. EDT on July 19, 2016, to respond to any such motion in limine. The
Division’s current objection, Respondents’ response, and any motion in limine related to
Respondents’ exhibits will be addressed during a prehearing conference currently scheduled to
occur on July 20, 2016. That conference will take place at 1:30 p.m. EDT.
