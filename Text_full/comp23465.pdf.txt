SUMMARY
4.

From at least mid-2009 through at least December 2010, Defendant

11

Jilbert Tahmazian (“Defendant” or “Tahmazian”), a lawyer licensed in the state of

12

California, participated in a fraudulent “prime bank” scheme. Prime bank schemes

13

involve the offer and sale of fictitious investment programs claiming that investors’

14

funds will be used to purchase and trade “prime bank” financial instruments on

15

clandestine overseas markets to generate huge returns in which the investor will

16

share. However, neither these instruments, nor the markets on which they allegedly

17

trade, exist.

18

5.

Tahmazian and his co-schemer offered and sold bogus investment

19

contracts purporting to provide investors access to “a Financial Instrument issued by

20

a top rated financial institution/top 50 bank with a minimum face value of $100

21

million” and “designated toward a 40-week private placement program.” However,

22

no such “financial instrument” or “private placement program” existed. Nonetheless,

23

under the purported terms of the fraudulent investment contracts, investors were

24

promised that they would receive a return of 15% to 30% per week from their

25

investment or, if their money was not invested within 15 or 30 days, their funds, plus

26

a 2% penalty, would be returned. Tahmazian and his co-schemer obtained

27

approximately $6 million from at least four investors, who purchased these fraudulent

28

investment contracts.
COMPLAINT

Case 2:16-cv-00954 Document 1 Filed 02/11/16 Page 3 of 11 Page ID #:3

1

6.

Tahmazian was an integral and knowing participant in the fraud.

2

Among other things, investors were directed to deposit their money in Tahmazian’s

3

attorney-client trust account. However, the investors’ funds were never applied

4

toward any investment. Instead, after retaining a substantial “fee” for himself,

5

Tahmazian transferred the investors’ remaining money from his attorney-client trust

6

account to his co-schemer, who in turn misappropriated the investors’ money for their

7

personal use, including lavish spending at Las Vegas casinos and high-end retail

8

stores. The victims of the scheme lost their entire investments, with the exception of

9

one investor who received a partial refund from Tahmazian of $100,000 from another

10
11

investor’s money that was being held in Tahmazian’s attorney-client trust account.
7.

In 2011, one of the victims of the scheme sued Tahmazian in California

12

state court. The trial court found that Tahmazian and his co-schemer had perpetrated

13

a “very sophisticated and financially successful fraud” and that Tahmazian’s

14

participation, as a licensed attorney, was “highly instrumental” to soliciting investors

15

by adding an air of legitimacy to the scheme. The court ultimately found that

16

Tahmazian was “a knowing participant in the fraud,” adjudged him liable on multiple

17

claims, and ordered him to pay back all of the investor’s money – nearly $1.2 million.

18

The judgment against Tahmazian was subsequently affirmed on appeal.

19

8.

The Commission brings this action seeking permanent injunctive relief

20

to prevent future violations of the federal securities laws, disgorgement of ill-gotten

21

gains with prejudgment interest, civil penalties, and any other appropriate relief.

22

THE DEFENDANT
9.

California, is an attorney licensed to practice in California since 1989.

25
26

Jilbert Tahmazian (age 55), a U.S. citizen and a resident of Glendale,

FACTUAL ALLEGATIONS
10.

Tahmazian maintains a solo, general law practice in Glendale,

27

California, focused primarily on representing clients in criminal matters. In or about

28

June 2009, Tahmazian met an individual who leased office space near Tahmazian’s

Case 2:16-cv-00954 Document 1 Filed 02/11/16 Page 4 of 11 Page ID #:4

1

law practice and with whom he would eventually perpetrate the fraud underlying this

2

action (together with an entity owned and controlled by that individual and its

3

employees, Tahmazian’s “co-schemer”). Shortly thereafter, Tahmazian began

4

providing general advice and other assistance to his co-schemer, and subsequently

5

attended business meetings and communicated with potential investors in the

6

fraudulent scheme.

7

11.

Tahmazian and his co-schemer enticed investors to enter into fake

8

“prime bank” investment contracts on the promise of huge investment returns. For

9

example, two investors entered into a so-called “Management Agreement Contract”

10

(“MAC”) with an entity owned and controlled by Tahmazian’s co-schemer. Under

11

the MACs, investors agreed to send a certain sum on money to Tahmazian’s attorney-

12

client trust account. The MACs provided that, within fifteen days for one investor

13

and within 30 days for another, the funds would be used to participate in a “private

14

placement” in financial instruments, which, unbeknownst to the investors, did not

15

exist. One MAC claimed enormous historical average returns of 15% per week;

16

another claimed historical average returns of an astronomical 30% per week. The

17

MACs did not describe how the purported investment would produce such huge

18

returns. Investors were further promised in the MAC that if their funds were not

19

invested within 15 or 30 days, the funds would be returned with a 2% penalty. On

20

information and belief, each investor in the fraudulent scheme entered into

21

substantially similar bogus investment contracts.

22

Investor A

23

12.

On or about December 21, 2009, Investor A entered into one such

24

fraudulent investment contract and sent $2 million to Tahmazian’s attorney-client

25

trust account. Upon receipt of the funds, Tahmazian disbursed $1,734,980 to his co-

26

schemer, kept $40,000 for his fees, and disbursed the remainder to five other

27

individuals. On February 11, 2010, Investor A, through counsel, sent a letter to

28

Tahmazian, stating that Tahmazian had failed to respond to repeated requests to
COMPLAINT

4

Case 2:16-cv-00954 Document 1 Filed 02/11/16 Page 5 of 11 Page ID #:5

1

provide “an escrow letter or other verification that you are holding or disbursed such

2

escrowed funds.” In addition, Investor A demanded a refund of its $2 million.

3

13.

On February 19, 2010, Investor A’s counsel called Tahmazian to discuss

4

the status of the investment. During that call, to placate Investor A’s concerns,

5

Investor A’s counsel was assured that returns on the investment would be

6

forthcoming. Tahmazian, however, knew that Investor A’s money had been

7

dissipated in contravention of the MAC. Specifically Tahmazian knew but concealed

8

that the funds had not been invested, would not generate any profits, and had not been

9

refunded.

10

Investor B

11

14.

On January 25, 2010, another individual investor, Investor B, entered

12

into a “Management Agreement Contract” (“MAC”) with an entity owned and

13

controlled by Tahmazian’s co-schemer. Under the MAC, Investor B agreed to send

14

$1 million to Tahmazian’s attorney-client trust account. Within fifteen days, the

15

funds would be used to “reserve a Financial Instrument issued by a top rated financial

16

institution/top 50 bank with a minimum face value of $100,000,000 . . . .” The MAC

17

stated that the funds were to be “designated toward a 40-week private placement

18

program” with historical returns averaging 15% per week, but did not describe how

19

the purported investment would produce such huge returns. Investors were further

20

promised in the MAC that if their funds were not invested within 15 days, the funds

21

would be returned with a 2% penalty. Tahmazian received and read a copy of the

22

MAC provided to Investor B.

23

15.

Exhibit A to the MAC included Tahmazian’s attorney-client trust

24

account information as the location for the investors to deposit funds. Investor B

25

believed that Tahmazian would hold the funds in his attorney-client trust account

26

until they were either invested or returned in accordance with the MAC.

27
28

16.

In accordance with Exhibit A of the MAC, and with Tahmazian’s

knowledge and consent, Investor B wired $1,000,000 to Tahmazian’s attorney-client
COMPLAINT

1

trust account in three installments on January 27 and 29, 2010. A few days later, on

2

February 2, 2010, Tahmazian transferred a total of $979,940 to his co-schemer in

3

three wire transfers and paid wire transfer fees of $60. Tahmazian kept the remaining

4

$20,000 of Investor B’s investment as a 2% “fee” paid for his services, general

5

corporate work, and attending meetings with investors. Contrary to the express terms

6

of the MAC, no investment was purchased or made with those funds and the funds

7

were not returned within 15 days with the 2% penalty.
17.

8
9

When Investor B did not receive the promised return on his investment,

he attempted to contact but had experienced difficulty communicating with

10

Tahmazian and his co-schemer. Investor B eventually contacted Tahmazian and

11

demanded a refund of his $1 million investment with the 2% penalty set forth in the

12

MAC.

13

18.

In an attempt to mollify Investor B, Tahmazian’s co-schemer sent a

14

letter to Investor B and others via e-mail dated March 5, 2010 (more than a month

15

after all funds were sent to Tahmazian’s account), apologizing “for having to ask you

16

to hold on for almost 6 weeks to start your trade as agreed upon by your contract . . .

17

and/or pay out returns in some cases due to my serious battle with STOMACH

18

Cancer [emphasis in original] . . . .” Investor A’s counsel forwarded this e-mail to

19

Tahmazian asking, “[c]an I safely assume that this came from [the co-schemer]?” At

20

that time, Tahmazian knew that, contrary to the terms of the agreement that he had

21

reviewed, Investor B’s funds had not been invested in a “financial instrument” or

22

placed into a 40-week “private placement program” and that the amounts also had not

23

been returned to Investor B with a 2% penalty, as contemplated under the MAC.

24

19.

Investor B continued to contact Tahmazian during 2010 to request a

25

refund. On October 26, 2010, Tahmazian refunded $100,000 to Investor B.

26

Tahmazian used money received in his attorney-client trust account from another $2

27

million investment made by another investor (Investor D discussed below) to fund

28

Investor B’s partial refund. Nothing in the MAC permitted Tahmazian to use one
COMPLAINT

6

Case 2:16-cv-00954 Document 1 Filed 02/11/16 Page 7 of 11 Page ID #:7

1

investor’s funds to repay another investor. Tahmazian did not disclose the source of

2

the refund to Investor B, and did not disclose the blatant misuse of Investor D’s funds

3

to Investor D.

4

Investors C and D

5

20.

On or about January 12, 2010, another investor, Investor C, sent

6

$1,000,000 to Tahmazian’s attorney-client trust account pursuant to a similar

7

fraudulent investment contract. As with Investors A and B, Tahmazian knew that

8

Investor C’s money would not be, and ultimately was not, invested consistent with

9

the investment contract and thus that it would not generate any profits and would not

10

be refunded. Similar to Investors A, B and C, on October 20, 2010, another investor

11

– Investor D – also executed a similar fraudulent investment contract. Investor D

12

wired $2 million to Tahmazian’s attorney-client trust account, having been promised

13

the same investment opportunity and huge short-term returns on the investment.

14

Again, Tahmazian knew that the funds would not be and, ultimately, were not

15

invested or returned to Investor D as required by the terms of the MAC. Rather,

16

almost immediately upon receipt of the funds, as noted above, on October 27, 2010,

17

Tahmazian used part of the money to refund $100,000 to Investor A and, on

18

November 3, 2010, sent a check for $1.5 million to a third-party. Tahmazian kept the

19

remaining $40,000, in violation of the MAC, for his “fees.”

20

The Fake Investment Contracts were Securities that were Offered and Sold in

21

Unlawful Unregistered Transactions

22

21.

Sections 5(a) and (c) of the Securities Act prohibit the direct or indirect

23

offer or sale of securities through the mail or interstate commerce unless a

24

registration statement has been filed and is in effect. No registration statement or

25

exemptive form was filed with the Commission, and no exemption was applicable,

26

with respect to the offer and sale of the “prime bank” investments by Tahmazian and

27

his co-schemer. Additionally, Tahmazian and his co-schemer did not provide any

28

financial statements to investors, who were located in various states, and made no

1

effort to determine whether the investors were “accredited investors” to whom an

2

exemption from registration might apply. In fact, they did not obtain financial

3

information beyond whether investors had the ability to pay the initial fees.

4

Tahmazian Found Liable in State Court Suit and Ordered to Return $1.2 Million

5

to Investor B

6

22.

On June 16, 2011, Investor B filed suit against Tahmazian and his co-

7

schemer for fraud and other claims in Los Angeles County Superior Court. Default

8

judgments were entered against the co-schemer and the business entity he owned,

9

controlled and used, with Tahmazian, to perpetrate the fraudulent scheme. Tahmazian

10

appeared and defended the lawsuit. After a bench trial, the trial court found that

11

Tahmazian was “a knowing participant in the fraud” on Investor B and had converted

12

the $20,000 in “escrow fees.” The trial court also rejected Tahmazian’s principal

13

defense, finding that “[b]ased upon the evidence, and the aforementioned lack of

14

credibility of Tahmazian, the Court simply does not believe that the admitted

15

business attorney . . . merely reviewed the Contract and found it to be legitimate”

16

(emphasis in original). The trial court adjudged Tahmazian liable on multiple claims,

17

and a judgment was entered requiring him to return Investor B’s money – nearly $1.2

18

million including interest. The judgment was subsequently affirmed on appeal.
