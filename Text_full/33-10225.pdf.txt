In the Matter of
THOMAS C. GONNELLA

ORDER GRANTING PARTIAL STAY
On August 10, 2016, the Commission issued an opinion and order (the “Order”) finding
that Thomas C. Gonnella, a proprietary trader at Barclays, violated the antifraud provisions of
Section 17(a)(1) of the Securities Act of 1933, Section 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934, and Exchange Act Rule 10b-5(a) and (c) by engaging in prearranged trades in order to
convey the false appearance of compliance with Barclays’s aged inventory policy and to avoid
nonrefundable charges to his trading profits.1 The Commission also found that Gonnella aided,
abetted, and caused Barclays’s failure to keep accurate books and records in violation of
Exchange Act Section 17(a) and Exchange Act Rule 17a-3(a)(2).2 The Commission barred
Gonnella from the securities industry with a right to reapply in five years; entered a cease-anddesist order; and assessed a civil money penalty of $82,500.3

Gonnella now requests a stay of the $82,500 civil money penalty pending judicial review.
He states that “[n]o later than October 10, 2016 [he] will file a written petition with the U.S.
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit” requesting that the Order be set aside. The Division of
Enforcement does not oppose Gonnella’s request.
The party seeking a stay has the burden of establishing that relief is warranted.4 In
determining whether to grant a stay, the Commission considers four factors: (1) whether there is
a strong likelihood that the moving party will succeed on the merits of its appeal; (ii) whether the
moving party will suffer irreparable harm without a stay; (iii) whether any person will suffer
substantial harm as a result of a stay; and (iv) whether a stay is likely to serve the public interest.5
Gonnella’s motion for a stay addresses only his likelihood of success on the merits. He
argues that he is likely to succeed because Barclays concluded after an internal investigation that
it was neither deceived nor defrauded; that he did not act deceptively because he sent emails to
third parties that were subject to monitoring by Barclays; that the conduct at issue did not affect
his compensation; that he self-reported the conduct to his supervisors; that his conduct did not
meet the definition of stock “parking”; and that the Division’s cooperation agreement with the
counterparty to his trades violated due process. Because the Commission already rejected each
of these arguments,6 Gonnella has not demonstrated a likelihood of success on appeal.7
Nonetheless, the Commission “has at times stayed monetary sanctions pending appeal
without reference to the applicant’s likelihood of success on the merits or the other components
of the four-factor test.”8 Under the circumstances, including that the Division does not oppose
the stay, and as a matter of discretion, we elect to stay the requirement in the Order that Gonnella
pay a civil money penalty pending the filing of a petition for review with a United States Court
of Appeals and, upon the timely filing of such a petition, pending the determination of that
appeal.

Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the requirement in the Order that Thomas C. Gonnella
pay a civil money penalty of $82,500 is stayed for sixty days from August 10, 2016 pending the
filing of a petition for review with a United States Court of Appeals and, upon the timely filing
of such a petition, pending the determination of that appeal and the issuance of the Court’s
mandate. The Order remains effective in all other respects.
For the Commission, by the Office of the General Counsel, pursuant to delegated
authority.
