ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDING
File No. 3-17083

In the Matter of
ORDER
JASON BO-ALAN BECKMAN

On February 23, 2016, I stayed this proceeding as the parties had agreed in principle to a
settlement of this proceeding on all major terms and the Division of Enforcement represented
that it had mailed to Respondent a proposed settlement offer. Jason Bo-Alan Beckman, Admin.
Proc. Rulings Release No. 3634, 2016 SEC LEXIS 660. The stay was granted subject to
compliance with Rule of Practice 161(c)(2), 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(c)(2), requiring that my office
be notified promptly if any of the requirements of the rule were not met. Id.
On March 23, my office received an email from Division counsel, which forwarded a
March 22 email from Respondent that he was “finally able to get the agreement notarized today
and will put it into the mail tomorrow during the ‘legal mail’ call.” Due to Respondent’s
incarceration, the settlement process understandably may encounter delays. Nonetheless,
because a signed settlement offer was not submitted to Commission staff within fifteen business
days of the stay as required by Rule 161(c)(2), the STAY HAS LAPSED and this proceeding
will continue absent a motion to reinstitute the stay. See 17 C.F.R. § 201.161(c)(2)(i)-(ii).
