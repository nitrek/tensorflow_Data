SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
17 CFR Part 240
Release No. 34-74581; File No. S7-05-15
RIN 3235-AL65
Exemption for Certain Exchange Members
AGENCY: Securities and Exchange Commission.
ACTION: Proposed rule.
SUMMARY: The Securities and Exchange Commission (“Commission”) is proposing to
amend Rule 15b9-1 (“Rule”) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Act” or “Exchange
Act”), which exempts certain brokers or dealers from membership in a registered national
securities association (“Association”). The proposed amendments would replace the current
gross income allowance in the Rule with a narrower exemption from Association membership
for a broker or dealer that carries no customer accounts and effects transactions on a national
securities exchange. The proposed amendments would create an exemption for a dealer that
effects transactions off the exchange of which it is a member solely for the purpose of hedging
the risks of its floor-based activity, or a broker or dealer that effects transactions off the exchange
resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to
prevent trade-throughs consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation NMS.
DATES: Comments should be received on or before June 1, 2015.

Background

Rule 15b9-1generally provides an exemption for certain broker-dealers from the
Exchange Act requirement to become a member of an Association. However, the equities
markets have undergone a substantial transformation since the Commission previously
considered the Rule. Over time, active, cross-market proprietary trading firms began relying on
the Rule 15b9-1 exemption in ways that were not envisioned when the Rule was adopted or
amended. The Commission is proposing to amend Rule 15b9-1 to better align the scope of its
exemption, in light of today’s market activity, with Section 15(b)(8) of the Exchange Act and the
Commission’s purposes underlying the adoption of Rule 15b9-1.
When the Exchange Act was adopted in 1934, the exchanges were the only selfregulatory organizations (“SROs”) 1 and were charged with regulating the activities of their
broker-dealer members. 2 Congress soon recognized, however, that the benefit of exchange
regulation could be undermined by the absence of a complementary regulatory framework for
the off-exchange market 3 and, in 1938, Congress provided for the creation of national securities
1

An SRO is defined, in relevant part, as “any national securities exchange, registered
securities association, or registered clearing agency. . . .” 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(26). See also
infra notes 26-28 and accompanying text.

2

See, e.g., 15 U.S.C. 78f(b) (requiring exchanges to be so organized as to enforce
compliance by their members and persons associated with their members with the
provisions of the Exchange Act).

3

“Off-exchange” trading as used herein means any securities transaction in an exchangelisted security that is not effected, directly or indirectly, on a national securities exchange.
4

associations. 4 Congress later mandated Association membership for all off-exchange market
participants through Section 15(b)(8) of the Exchange Act, 5 which requires a broker-dealer to
become a member of an Association unless it effects transactions solely on an exchange of which
it is a member. This provision, among others, reflects an overarching principle in the Exchange
Act that the SRO best positioned to conduct regulatory oversight should assume those
responsibilities 6 and, correspondingly, that off-exchange trading is primarily the responsibility of
an Association or Associations.

See 17 CFR 240.600(b)(45) (defining “national securities exchange”). Off-exchange
trading includes securities transactions that occur on alternative trading systems and
directly with a broker-dealer, acting either as agent or principal, and is also referred to as
over-the-counter (“OTC”) trading. The term “off-exchange” as used herein does not
refer, as it does in some contexts, to transactions in securities, either in equities or other
instruments, that are not listed on a national securities exchange.
4

See infra notes 31-33 and accompanying text (describing the early history and
background behind the creation of national securities associations).

5

15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8). Section 15(b)(8) of the Exchange Act was adopted in 1964. See
infra notes 36-37 and accompanying text. Notably, however, from 1976-1983, brokerdealers engaged in off-exchange trading could either join an Association or be subject to
direct regulation by the Commission under the SEC Only (“SECO”) Program. See infra
notes 38-48 and accompanying text.

6

As originally adopted in 1934, the regulation of broker-dealer activities on national
securities exchanges was excluded from the Commission’s authority. See Section 15 as
adopted in 1934, Pub. L. No. 73-291, 48 Stat. 881, 895-96 (1934), infra note 27. Rather,
regulation of broker-dealer activities on exchanges continued to be conducted by the
exchanges themselves, many of which existed prior to the enactment of the Exchange
Act. Consequently, this left regulation of the off-exchange market with the Commission,
until passage of the Maloney Act in 1938, providing for the creation of voluntary, selfregulating Associations with powers to adopt and enforce rules to regulate the offexchange market. Pub. L. No. 75-719, 52 Stat. 1070 (1938) (the “Maloney Act”); see
also infra note 23 and accompanying text.
In the Exchange Act Amendments of 1975 (Pub. L. No. 94-29, 89 Stat. 97 (1975), the
“1975 Amendments”), Congress recognized that, at the time, the allocation of selfregulatory responsibilities among SROs resulted in some cases in duplicative regulation
of firms that were members of multiple SROs and varying standards, both in substance
and enforcement, among SROs. S. Doc. No. 93-13 at 164-165 (1973). As a result,
Congress adopted Section 17(d) of the Act, which provides the Commission with the
5

Section 15(b)(9) of the Exchange Act, 7 provides the Commission with authority to
exempt any broker-dealer from the requirements of Section 15(b)(8), if that exemption is
consistent with the public interest and the protection of investors. Pursuant to that authority, the
Commission adopted Rule 15b9-1, 8 which was last substantively updated in 1983. 9 That Rule

authority to allocate regulatory responsibilities among SROs with respect to matters as to
which, in the absence of such allocation, such SROs would share authority. 15 U.S.C.
78q(d). In adopting Section 17(d), a Senate Report accompanying the 1975 Amendments
expressed the view that “the Commission should play an affirmative role in allocating
inspection and enforcement responsibilities among the self-regulatory organizations” and
that “for reporting purposes each broker-dealer [should] be assigned to a designated
principal self-regulator or government regulator who will be responsible for determining
the broker-dealer’s operating and financial status.” See 1975 Amendments, Report of the
Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs to Accompany S. 249, S.
Rep. No. 94-75, 94th Cong., 1st Session 33 (1975).
As a general matter, SROs and the Commission have used the flexibility provided by
Section 17(d) of the Act to allocate regulatory responsibilities in such a manner. 15
U.S.C. 78q(d). See, e.g., Exchange Act Release No. 63750 (January 21, 2011), 76 FR
4948 (January 27, 2011) (order approving 17d-2 plan to allocate regulatory responsibility
to FINRA relating to surveillance, investigation, and enforcement of insider trading
rules); Exchange Act Release No. 70052 (July 26, 2013), 78 FR 46665 (August 1, 2013)
(order approving 17d-2 plan to add Topaz Exchange, LLC to existing plan with all other
options exchanges to allocate regulatory responsibility to FINRA relating to, among other
things, opening of accounts, supervision, suitability, discretionary accounts, advertising,
customer complaints, customer statements, disclosure documents, and certification of
personnel); Exchange Act Release No. 73641 (November 19, 2014), 79 FR 70230
(November 25, 2014) (order approving 17d-2 plan to allocate regulatory responsibility to
FINRA for the Miami International Securities Exchange, LLC (“MIAX”), with respect to
examination and enforcement responsibility relating to compliance by common members
with the substantially similar rules of the two SROs and applicable provisions of the
federal securities laws). See also infra notes 62-63 and accompanying text (discussing
the allocation of regulatory responsibilities among SROs).

“The Commission by rule or order, as it deems consistent with the public interest and the
protection of investors, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt from paragraph (8)
of this subsection any broker or dealer or class of brokers or dealers specified in such rule
or order.” 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(9); Pub. L. No. 98-38, 97 Stat. 205 (1983).

was intended to address the limited activities of exchange-based specialists and floor brokers that
were conducted off the exchange of which they were a member and that were ancillary to their
floor-based business. 10 Specifically, the Rule exempts a broker-dealer from the requirement to
become a member of an Association if it is a member of a national securities exchange, carries
no customer accounts, and has annual gross income of no more than $1,000 that is derived from
securities transactions effected otherwise than on a national securities exchange of which it is a
member (the “de minimis allowance”). Importantly, the Rule permits income derived from
transactions for the dealer’s own account with or through another registered broker-dealer, to not
count toward the $1,000 de minimis allowance (hereinafter, the “exclusion for proprietary
trading”). 11 As discussed more fully below, the de minimis allowance originally was designed to
permit broker-dealers doing business on exchange floors to share in the commissions paid on
occasional off-exchange transactions in customer accounts they introduced to other brokerdealers, up to a nominal amount. 12 In addition, when the exclusion for proprietary trading was

1983) (“SECO Programs Release”).

10

See infra note 22 and accompanying text (explaining that the Rule is limited to receipt of
a portion of the commissions paid on occasional over-the-counter transactions and certain
other activities incidental to their activities as specialists).

11

The exclusion for proprietary trading (conducted with or through another registered
broker-dealer) was not part of the original exemption, but was added in 1976. See infra
notes 43-44 and accompanying text.

12

See Qualifications and Fees Relating to Brokers or Dealers Who Are Not Members of
National Security [sic] Association, Exchange Act Release No. 7697 (September 7,
1965), 30 FR 11673, 11675 (September 11, 1965) (“Qualifications and Fees Release”)
(describing specialist or floor broker’s proprietary off-exchange activity as generally
limited to occasional commissions on introduced accounts and other transactions
incidental to their activity as specialists or floor brokers). See also infra note 22.

7

adopted in 1976, 13 the circumstances under which an exchange specialist or floor broker would
trade proprietarily off-exchange remained quite limited, such as when a regional exchange
specialist would hedge risk on the primary listing market. 14
Accordingly, those broker-dealers exempt from Association membership pursuant to
Rule 15b9-1 when it was first adopted were broker-dealers with a business focused on the floor
of an exchange of which they were a member. 15 The Commission crafted Rule 15b9-1 to
accommodate limited activities ancillary to that floor-based business, and thereby left it to the
exchange of which the specialist or floor broker was a member to continue to regulate the
entirety of that broker-dealer’s activities. Therefore, the scope of Rule 15b9-1 originally was
consistent with the principle underlying Section 15(b)(8) of the Exchange Act, noted above, that
the SRO best positioned to conduct regulatory oversight should assume those responsibilities.
13

In adopting the exclusion for proprietary trading, the Commission indicated that an
exchange floor broker, through another broker-dealer, could effect transactions for its
own account on an exchange of which it was not a member. The Commission noted that
such transactions ultimately would be effected by a member of that exchange. See
Extension of Temporary Rules 23a-1(T) and 23a-2(T); Adoption of Amendments to
SECO Rules, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 12160 (March 3, 1976), 41 FR 10599,
10600 (March 12, 1976) (“Adoption of Amendments to SECO Rules”). See also infra
note 44.

14

In the Special Study of the Securities Markets in 1963, the Commission described how
regional exchange specialists reduced their exposure, including by offsetting those
positions on other exchanges. The Commission noted that “[s]pecialists on the Boston,
Philadelphia-Baltimore-Washington, Pittsburgh, and Montreal stock exchange are in
communication with each other by direct wires linking their floors and each may trade on
the other exchanges at member rates” and “[s]pecialists who are sole members [of an
exchange] also offset [their positions] with over-the-counter houses dealing in listed
securities. Many of the offsetting transactions are done on the primary market, the
NYSE, with the [specialist] buying or selling on that exchange as his needs dictate.”
Report of Special Study of Securities Markets of the Securities and Exchange
Commission, H.R. Doc. No. 88-95, at 935 (1963) (“Special Study”). The Commission
believes that the business of regional exchange specialists was substantially the same
when the exclusion for proprietary trading in Rule 15b9-1 was adopted in 1976.

15

See infra note 22.

However, the equities markets have undergone a substantial transformation since the
Commission previously considered Rule 15b9-1, evolving from markets with both manual and
automated features and trading volumes concentrated on the primary listing exchanges, to a
highly electronic, decentralized market with substantial competition among a large number and
great variety of trading venues. 16 New types of proprietary trading firms have emerged,
including those that engage in so-called high-frequency trading strategies. These firms tend to
effect transactions across the full range of exchange and off-exchange markets, including
alternative trading systems (“ATSs”). 17 They also tend to use complex electronic trading
strategies and sophisticated technology to generate a large volume of orders and transactions
throughout the national market system. 18
16

See Concept Release Concerning Equity Market Structure, Exchange Act Release No.
61358 (January 14, 2010), 75 FR 3594, 3594-3596 (January 21, 2010) (“Concept
Release”) (discussing the evolution from “a market structure with primarily manual
trading to a market structure with primarily automated trading”).

17

ATSs fall within the statutory definition of national securities exchange, but are exempt
from having to register as an exchange if they comply with Regulation ATS. See
Regulation of Exchanges and Alternative Trading Systems, Exchange Act Release No.
40760 (December 8, 1998), 63 FR 70844, 70856 (December 22, 1998). Regulation ATS
requires ATSs to be registered as broker-dealers with the Commission, which entails
becoming a member of an Association and complying with the broker-dealer regulatory
regime. 17 CFR 242.301(b)(1). Unlike a registered national securities exchange, an ATS
is not required to file proposed rule changes with the Commission. ATSs include both
dark pools and electronic communications networks (“ECNs”). ECNs provide their bestpriced orders for inclusion in the consolidated quotation data, while dark pools do not.
See Concept Release, supra note 16 at 3599. See also infra notes 158 - 161 and
accompanying text (describing some of these firms’ activity on exchanges). ATSs did
not exist when Rule 15b9-1 was last amended in 1983.

18

Many, but not all, such proprietary trading firms are often characterized by: (1) the use of
extraordinarily high-speed and sophisticated computer programs for generating, routing
and executing orders; (2) the use of co-location services and individual data feeds offered
by exchanges and others to minimize network and other types of latencies; (3) the use of
very short time-frames for establishing and liquidating positions; (4) the submission of
numerous orders that are cancelled shortly after submission; and (5) ending the trading
day in as close to a flat position as possible (that is, not carrying significant, unhedged
9

Over time, active, cross-market proprietary trading firms began relying on the Rule 15b91 exemption in ways that were not envisioned when the Rule was adopted or amended. 19 As
noted above, the de minimis allowance of Rule 15b9-1, and the subsequent exclusion of income
derived from proprietary transactions conducted with or through another registered broker-dealer
from such allowance, were designed to permit exchange-based specialists or floor brokers to
conduct limited activities off-exchange. However, because the Rule does not explicitly limit this
exclusion from the de minimis allowance to dealer activities ancillary to a floor-based business, a
broker-dealer, with or without a floor presence, may engage in unlimited proprietary trading in
the off-exchange market without becoming a member of an Association. Consequently, many of
the most active, cross-market proprietary trading firms have been able to rely on the exemption
from Association membership, despite effecting a significant volume of transactions offexchange.
As a result, an exemption that was developed to address limited off-exchange activity by
exchange-based specialists or floor brokers is today being used by many broker-dealers without a
floor-based business, and that conduct a substantial percentage of the volume of off-exchange
trading in the U.S. securities markets. Specifically, during the fourth quarter of 2014, brokerdealers that are not Association 20 members (“Non-Member Firms”) accounted for 45% of orders

positions over night). See Concept Release, supra note 16, at 3606. See also Staff of the
Division of Trading and Markets, Commission, “Equity Market Structure Literature
Review, Part II: High Frequency Trading,” at 4-5 (March 18, 2014) (available at
http://www.sec.gov/marketstructure/research/hft_lit_review_march_2014.pdf).
19

These firms are registered with the Commission as broker-dealers but have elected to
avail themselves of the Rule 15b9-1 exemption from membership in an Association.

20

Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, Inc. (“FINRA”) is currently the sole
Association. See infra note 34. In 1939, the Commission approved the National
Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (“NASD”) as the first national securities
association. See 4 FR 3564 (August 9, 1939). In 2007, the Commission approved
10

sent directly to ATSs, a significant category of off-exchange trading venue. 21 Preliminarily, the
Commission does not believe the public interest finding that originally supported the adoption
and amendments of Rule 15b9-1continues to apply today in this context.
Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule 15b9-1 to better align the
scope of its exemption, in light of today’s market activity, with Section 15(b)(8) of the Exchange
Act and the Commission’s original purpose in adopting Rule 15b9-1, which was to accommodate
broker-dealer activities ancillary to a floor-based business while preserving the traditional role of
the exchange as the entity best suited to regulate member conduct on the exchange. 22 A broker-

changes that consolidated the member firm regulatory functions of the NASD, an
Association, and NYSE Regulation, Inc., and changed the name of the combined entity to
FINRA. See Exchange Act Release No. 56145 (July 26, 2007), 72 FR 42169 (August 1,
2007).
21

ATSs received approximately 230 billion orders during 2014 that were sent directly to an
ATS (i.e., orders received by a broker-dealer that are then sent to another trading desk of
that broker-dealer (so called “desk-reports”) are generally excluded from these order
totals). Orders from Non-Member Firms accounted for 49% of orders sent directly to
ATSs during the first quarter of 2014, 49% of orders sent directly to ATSs during the
second quarter of 2014, 48% of orders sent directly to ATSs during the third quarter of
2014, and 45% of orders sent directly to ATSs during the fourth quarter of 2014. In
2013, ATSs received approximately 163 billion orders that were sent directly to an ATS.
Orders from Non-Member Firms accounted for 34% of orders sent directly to ATSs
during the first quarter of 2013, 38% of orders sent directly to ATSs during the second
quarter of 2013, 42% of orders sent directly to ATSs during the third quarter of 2013, and
45% of orders sent directly to ATSs during the fourth quarter of 2013. On a volumeweighted basis (i.e., accounting for variations in total order volume sent to ATSs), NonMember Firms accounted for 48% of orders sent directly to ATSs in 2014, 40% in 2013,
and 32% in 2012. This information is from data obtained from FINRA’s Order Audit
Trail System (“OATS”).

22

In adopting Rule 15b8-1, the Commission stated: “Among the broker-dealers that are not
members of a registered national securities association are several specialists and other
floor members of national securities exchanges, some of whom introduce accounts to
other members. The over-the-counter business of these broker-dealers may be limited to
receipt of a portion of the commissions paid on occasional over-the-counter transactions
in these introduced accounts, and to certain other transactions incidental to their activities
as specialists. In most cases, the income derived from these activities is nominal.” See
Qualifications and Fees Release, supra note 12, at 11675.
11

dealer that conducts off-exchange transactions outside the limited scope of Rule 15b9-1, as
proposed to be amended, would be required to become a member of an Association.
Consequently, such a broker-dealer would be subject, with respect to its off-exchange
transactions, to the oversight and rules of an Association, the category of SRO primarily
responsible for regulating trading in the off-exchange market in accordance with Section
15(b)(8). 23 Further, as a result of the proposal, a broker-dealer that does not trade off-exchange
but that trades indirectly on multiple exchanges would be required in accordance with Section
15(b)(8), to become a member of an Association, or alternatively, a member of each exchange
where it effects transactions other than transactions to hedge the risks of its floor-based activities.
A. Regulatory History
The primary purpose of an SRO is to regulate its members. 24 Although the Act provides
a limited and targeted exception to Association membership requirements for broker-dealers, its
approach to effecting supervision is relatively uniform: broker-dealers must be members of the
SROs that regulate the venues upon which they transact. Section 19(g)(1) of the Act, among
other things, requires every SRO to examine for and enforce compliance by its members and
associated persons with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the SRO’s own rules,
unless the SRO is relieved of this responsibility pursuant to Section 17(d) or Section 19(g)(2) of
23

See Pub. L. No. 75-719, 52 Stat. 1070 (1938) (The Maloney Act, which established the
concept of and framework for Associations, states in its preamble that its purpose was
“[t]o provide for the establishment of a mechanism of regulation [Associations] among
over-the-counter brokers and dealers operating in interstate and foreign commerce or
through the mails, to prevent acts and practices inconsistent with just and equitable
principles of trade, and for other purposes”). See also infra notes 26, 28-33 and
accompanying text (describing the early history of the Maloney Act).

24

See, e.g., S. Doc. No. 93-13 at 147 (1973) (describing the structure of the self-regulatory
system in which SROs “are delegated governmental power in order to enforce, at their
own initiative, compliance by members of the industry with legal and ethical standards
going beyond the basic requirements laid down in the Act.”).

12

the Act. 25 A primary purpose of an Association as an SRO, among other things, is to regulate
the off-exchange market. 26 Under the Exchange Act, as adopted in 1934, the direct regulation of
broker-dealer activities on national securities exchanges was to be conducted by the exchanges
themselves. As there was no SRO for the off-exchange market, regulation of the off-exchange
market was to be the Commission’s responsibility. 27 Congress recognized that the benefits of
exchange regulation could be undermined in the absence of a complementary regulatory
framework for the off-exchange market 28 and provided the Commission the authority to adopt

25

15 U.S.C. 78q(d); 15 U.S.C. 78s(g).

26

The Maloney Act authorizes an Association to, among other things, establish rules
“designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices, to promote just and
equitable principles of trade, to foster cooperation and coordination with persons engaged
in regulating, clearing, settling, processing information with respect to, and facilitating
transactions in securities, to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free
and open market and a national market system, and, in general, to protect investors and
the public interest.” 15 U.S.C 78o(b)(6). See also First Jersey Sec., Inc. v. Bergen, 605
F.2d 690, 692 (3d Cir. 1979) (“The purpose of [NASD] is to provide self-regulation of
the over-the-counter securities market.”); Special Study, supra note 14, at 65 (describing
the NASD as “the agency with primary self-regulatory responsibility for over-the-counter
markets.”).

27

As adopted in 1934, Section 15 of the Exchange Act read, in relevant part: “It shall be
unlawful, in contravention of such rules and regulations as the Commission may
prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest and to insure to investors
protection comparable to that provided by and under authority of this title in the case of
national securities exchanges, (1) for any broker or dealer . . . to make or create, a market,
otherwise than on a national securities exchange, for both the purchase and sale of any

which they make or create a market and may make special provision with respect to
securities or specified classes thereof listed, or entitled to unlisted trading privileges,

In considering adopting the Maloney Act, the House noted that: “The committee has been
convinced that effective regulation of the exchanges requires as a corollary a measure of
13

rules and regulations concerning the off-exchange market to achieve investor protections
comparable to those on exchanges. 29 After further study, 30 however, in 1938 Congress imposed
a comprehensive regulatory framework for the off-exchange market through the Maloney Act. 31
The Maloney Act added Section 15A to the Act, 32 providing for the creation of national
securities associations of broker-dealers, with powers to adopt and enforce rules to regulate the
off-exchange market. 33 This led to the creation of NASD, the predecessor of FINRA, and the

control over the over-the-counter markets. The problem is clearly put in the recent report
of the Twentieth Century Fund on ‘Stock Market Control’: ‘The benefits that would
accrue as the result of raising the standards of security exchanges might be nullified if the
over-the-counter markets were left unregulated and uncontrolled. . . . To leave the overthe-counter markets out of a regulatory system would be to destroy the effects of
regulating the organized exchanges.’” H.R. Doc No. 1383, 73d Cong. 2d Sess. at 4
(1934) (quoting report on “Stock Market Control” by the Twentieth Century Fund).

two alternative programs by which this problem [of regulation of the off-exchange
market] could be met. The first would involve a pronounced expansion of the
organization of the Securities and Exchange Commission; the multiplication of branch
offices; a large increase in the expenditure of public funds; an increase in the problem of
avoiding the evils of bureaucracy; and a minute, detailed, and rigid regulation of business
conduct by law. . . . The second of these alternative programs, which the committee
believes distinctly preferable to the first . . . is based upon cooperative regulation, in
which the task will be largely performed by representative organizations of investment
bankers, dealers, and brokers, with the Government exercising appropriate supervision in
the public interest, and exercising supplementary powers of direct regulation.”). See also
S. Rep. No. 74-1455, at 2-3 (1938) (“It has been deemed advisable to authorize the
Commission to subject such activities [i.e., trading in the over-the-counter markets] to

Section 15(b)(8) of the Act, enacted in 1964, 36 further strengthened regulatory oversight
of the off-exchange market by prohibiting a broker-dealer from effecting any transaction
“otherwise than on a national securities exchange” unless the broker-dealer was either a member
of an Association, or met the Commission’s standards with respect to training, experience, and
other relevant qualifications. 37 In 1965, the Commission adopted Rule 15b8-1 to establish the

the withdrawal of securities from listing on exchanges, and by transferring trading therein
to ‘over-the-counter’ markets where manipulative evils could continue to flourish,
unchecked by any regulatory authority”) (quoting S. Rep. No. 73-792, at 6 (1934)). See

See supra note 20. The National Futures Association (“NFA”), as specified in Section

respective markets has not been materially altered from a statutory perspective since its
establishment. See Concept Release Concerning Self-Regulation, Exchange Act Release

or induce the purchase or sale of, any security (otherwise than on a national securities

SECO Program, which provided for the direct regulation by the Commission of broker-dealers
that effected transactions off-exchange and that chose not to join an Association. 38
Rule 15b8-1 provided for an exemption from the SECO Program, and by extension from
Association membership, for those broker-dealers that: (1) were members of a national
securities exchange; (2) did not carry customer accounts; and (3) had annual gross income
derived from off-exchange activity that amounted to no greater than $1,000. 39 This set the basic
framework for the Rule 15b9-1 exemption from Association membership that exists today. The
Commission recognized that, at that time, exchange-based specialists and other floor brokers,
which were comprehensively regulated by the exchange of which they were a member,
occasionally introduced accounts to other members and shared in the commission revenues. 40
Rule 15b8-1 permitted these broker-dealers, who were not required to register with the

38

Under the SECO Program, every associated person engaged directly or indirectly in
securities activities for or on behalf of a non-member broker-dealer, and every associated
person who supervised others engaged in any securities activities, was required to
successfully complete either the general securities examination prescribed by the
Commission or an alternative examination deemed satisfactory by the Commission. See
Qualifications and Fees Release, supra note 12, at 11676 (defining the term “nonmember
broker or dealer” as “any broker or dealer, including a sole proprietor, registered under
section 15 of the Act, who is not a member of a national securities association registered
with the Commission under section 15A of the Act.”). Any broker-dealer could choose
to join an Association or be regulated by the Commission directly under the SECO
Program.

39

“Under Rule 15b8-1 (17 CFR § 240.15b8-1), any broker-dealer who is a member of a
national securities exchange is exempt from the rule if he does not carry customers’
accounts and if his annual gross income derived from his over-the-counter business is no
more than $1,000. Should a broker-dealer’s over-the-counter income exceed these limits
for an accounting year, such broker-dealer and all persons associated with him become
subject to the requirements of the rule.” Id. at 11675.

Commission as broker-dealers at the time, 41 to receive a portion of the commissions paid on
occasional off-exchange transactions on these introduced accounts without becoming subject to
the SECO rules and broker-dealer registration, so long as the income derived from those
activities was nominal. 42
In 1976, the Commission amended Rule 15b8-1 to provide that income derived from
transactions for the dealer's own account effected with or through another registered brokerdealer would not count towards the $1,000 de minimis allowance. 43 In adopting this amendment
to Rule 15b8-1, the Commission noted that an exchange-based floor broker could effect

41

Until 1975, broker-dealers who traded exclusively on the floor of a national securities
exchange were exempt from registration with the Commission. The 1975 Amendments
required all broker-dealers, including exchange specialists and floor brokers, to register
with the Commission, and extended the Commission’s SECO rulemaking authority to
any exchange member trading on an exchange other than an exchange of which it was a
member. 1975 Amendments, supra note 6, at 121. The 1975 Amendments revised
Section 15(b) such that the substance of then existing Section 15(b)(8) was captured in
Sections 15(b)(7) - (9). See id. at 131. One purpose of the 1975 Amendments was to
assure that the Commission could regulate and recoup the costs of regulating transactions
of exchange members conducted on exchanges of which they were not a member. See
1975 Amendments, supra note 6, at 125 (amending Section 15 of the Exchange Act to
provide the Commission with authority to “prescribe reasonable fees and charges to
defray its costs” of regulation).

42

See Adoption of Amendments to SECO Rules, supra note 13. See also supra note 22
(noting that the over-the-counter business of these broker-dealers may be limited and the
income derived from these activities is nominal).

43

“Any nonmember broker or dealer who is a member of a national securities exchange
shall be exempt from this rule if (1) he carries no accounts of customers, and (2) his
annual gross income derived from purchases and sales of securities otherwise than on a
national securities exchange of which he is a member is an amount no greater than
$1,000. Provided however, [t]hat gross income derived from transactions otherwise than
on such national securities exchange which are effected for his own account with or
through another registered broker or dealer shall not be subject to such limitation.” See
Adoption of Amendments to SECO Rules, supra note 13, at 10601. Thus, broker-dealers
registering with the Commission as a result of the 1975 Amendments became subject to
the SECO rules in 1976, but could remain exempt from such rules pursuant to Rule 15b81 and its exclusion for proprietary trading.

transactions through another broker-dealer for its own account on an exchange of which it was
not a member, and indicated that such transactions ultimately would be effected by a member of
that exchange. 44 At the time this provision was adopted, the circumstances under which an
exchange specialist or floor broker would trade proprietarily off the exchange were quite limited,
such as when a regional exchange specialist would hedge risk on the primary listing market. 45
In 1983, Congress amended the Act to eliminate the direct oversight of broker-dealers by
the Commission. 46 Congress maintained the exception from membership in an Association in
Section 15(b)(8) of the Act for those broker-dealers that effected transactions in securities only
on an exchange of which they were a member. Congress also left unchanged the ability of the
Commission to expand upon the statutory exception in Section 15(b)(8) through exemptive
44

The Commission provided the following example to describe the application of the
exclusion for proprietary trading: “a broker who is acting as a floor broker on a particular
exchange, and who effects transactions for his own account otherwise than on that
exchange through another broker-dealer who acts as a clearing member for the floor
broker, would be permitted to effect transactions on exchanges of which neither he nor
his clearing broker are members without becoming subject to the SECO rules.” Id. In
this example, “[t]he clearing broker would, of course, effect transactions on an exchange
of which he was not a member through a member of that exchange.” Id. at 10602, n. 8.

45

See supra note 14.

46

At that time, direct oversight of broker-dealers by the Commission was conducted
through the SECO Program. 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8), as amended by Pub. L. No. 98-38, 97
Stat. 205, 206 (1983). See also H.R. Rep. No. 98-106, at 597 (1983) (citing a preference
for self-regulation over direct regulation by the Commission. Among other benefits of
self-regulation, the report noted that NASD had available a broader and more effective
range of disciplinary sanctions to employ against broker-dealers than had the
Commission).
Section 15(b)(8) is virtually the same as it was in 1983: “It shall be unlawful for any
registered broker or dealer to effect any transaction in, or induce or attempt to induce the
purchase or sale of, any security (other than or commercial paper, bankers’ acceptances,
or commercial bills), unless such broker or dealer is a member of a securities association
registered pursuant to section 15A of this title or effects transactions in securities solely
on a national securities exchange of which it is a member.” 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8). In
1986, Congress enacted non-substantive amendments modifying a few terms in the
statute. Pub. L. No. 99-571, 100 Stat. 3208, 3218 (1986). 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8).

authority in Section 15(b)(9) of the Act. 47 When the SECO rules were abolished in 1983, the
Commission amended and renumbered Rule 15b8-1. 48 The substance of newly renumbered Rule
15b9-1 remained largely the same as Rule 15b8-1, with modifications that primarily
accommodated transactions effected through the new Intermarket Trading System (“ITS”)
linkage, 49 and eliminated references to, and requirements under, the SECO Program.
Under the Rule as amended in 1983, a broker-dealer was not required to become a
member of an Association if: (1) it was a member of a national securities exchange, (2) carried
no customer accounts, and (3) had annual gross income no greater than $1,000 that was derived
from securities transactions effected otherwise than on a national securities exchange of which
the broker-dealer was a member. 50 As under the SECO rules, income derived from transactions
effected for a broker-dealer’s own account with or through another broker or dealer was not
included in the $1,000 de minimis allowance. 51

2005 to update cross-references when the Commission adopted Regulation NMS. 52
B. Regulatory Oversight of Off-Exchange Trading Activity
Section 19(g)(1) of the Act requires every SRO to examine for and enforce compliance
by its members and associated persons with the Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the
SRO’s own rules, unless the SRO is relieved of this responsibility pursuant to Section 17(d) or
Section 19(g)(2) of the Act. 53 Without this relief, the statutory obligation of each individual
SRO would result in duplicative examinations and oversight of broker-dealers that are members
of more than one SRO (“common members”). Section 17(d)(1) of the Act is intended, in part, to
eliminate overlapping examinations and regulatory functions. 54 With respect to a common
member, Section 17(d)(1) authorizes the Commission, by rule or order, to relieve an SRO of the
responsibility to receive regulatory reports, to examine for and enforce compliance with the
applicable statutes, rules, and regulations, or to perform other specified regulatory functions. 55
To implement Section 17(d)(1), the Commission adopted two rules: Rule 17d-1 and Rule
17d-2 under the Act. 56 Rule 17d-1 authorizes the Commission to name a single SRO as the
designated examining authority (“DEA”) to examine common members for compliance with the

To address regulatory duplication in areas other than financial responsibility, including sales
practices and trading practices, the Commission adopted Rule 17d-2 under the Act. 58 Rule 17d-2
permits SROs to propose joint plans among two or more SROs for the allocation of regulatory
responsibility with respect to their common members. 59 The regulatory responsibility allocated
among SROs only extends to matters for which the SROs would share authority, which means
that only common rules among SROs can be allocated under Rule 17d-2. Under paragraph (c) of
Rule 17d-2, the Commission may declare such a plan effective if, after appropriate notice and
opportunity for comment, it finds that the plan is necessary or appropriate in the public interest
and for the protection of investors, to foster cooperation and coordination among SROs, or to
remove impediments to and foster the development of a national market system and a national
clearance and settlement system and in conformity with the factors set forth in Section 17(d) of
the Act. 60 Commission approval of a plan filed pursuant to Rule 17d-2 relieves an SRO of those
regulatory responsibilities allocated by the plan to another SRO. 61

SRO contractually agrees to perform regulatory services for another. See, e.g., FINRA
News Release, FINRA Signs Regulatory Services Agreement with the Chicago Board
21

The principle underlying the self-regulatory structure in the Exchange Act is the concept
that the SRO best positioned to conduct regulatory oversight should assume responsibility for
that oversight. 62 As a general matter, the SROs and the Commission have used the flexibility
provided by Section 17 to allocate responsibilities in such a manner. 63 Section 15(b)(8) of the
Exchange Act further implements this construct of effective regulatory oversight by requiring
Association membership of a broker-dealer unless it effects transactions solely on an exchange
of which it is a member. Those exempt from Association membership pursuant to Rule 15b9-1
originally were exchange specialists and other floor members, and the off-exchange activity
permitted under Rule 15b9-1 (including its predecessor rule) was intended only to accommodate
limited activities ancillary to that floor-based business.
As the sole currently registered Association, FINRA is the SRO primarily responsible for
regulating trading in the off-exchange market. 64 FINRA also conducts the vast majority of

Options Exchange, Incorporated (“CBOE”) and C2 Options Exchange, Incorporated
(“C2”) (December 22, 2014), available at
http://www.finra.org/newsroom/newsreleases/2014/p602174. However, RSAs do not
relieve the contracting SRO from regulatory responsibility for the performance of any
regulatory services allocated pursuant to the RSA and are not filed with the Commission
for approval.
62

Section 17(d)(1) of the Act provides that the Commission, in allocating authority among
SROs pursuant to Section 17(d)(1), shall “take into consideration the regulatory
capabilities and procedures of the self-regulatory organizations, availability of staff,
convenience of location, unnecessary regulatory duplication, and such other factors as the
Commission may consider germane to the protection of investors, cooperation and
coordination among self-regulatory organizations, and the development of a national
market system . . .” 15 U.S.C. 78q(d)(1).

broker-dealer examinations, 65 mandates broker-dealer disclosures, and writes and enforces rules

income, and other traded products, and investigates and brings enforcement actions against
members for violations of its rules, the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board, and
the Exchange Act and the rules thereunder. 67 As noted above, the regulatory focus of national
securities exchanges, which are also SROs, has been more narrow, with primary responsibility to
regulate trading by their members on their respective exchanges, 68 enforce conduct rules (if they
have not been relieved of that responsibility by 17d-2 Agreements), and otherwise perform
member regulation for their members that are not also members of FINRA. Most exchanges
have entered into 17d-2 Agreements with FINRA that allocate regulatory responsibility over
common members to FINRA for compliance with common conduct rules. 69
FINRA has developed a transparency and regulatory regime for the off-exchange market.
All off-exchange trades are reported to FINRA, 70 and as a result FINRA has developed a set of

See Part V.B.4 discussing the competitive effects of off-exchange market regulation.

24

As noted, Rule 15b9-1 in its current form allows a broker-dealer to engage in unlimited
proprietary trading in the off-exchange market without becoming a member of an Association, so
long as its proprietary trading activity is conducted with or through another registered brokerdealer (i.e., not with a customer). In practice, this allows many cross-market proprietary trading
firms to avoid Association membership, despite their effecting a significant volume of
transactions in the off-exchange market. Non-Member Firms are not subject to oversight by an
Association and their off-exchange transactions typically are not overseen by the exchanges of
which they may be members. Exchanges traditionally have not assumed the role of regulating
the totality of the trading of their member-broker-dealers, and exchanges are currently not wellpositioned to assume that role, in light of the statutory scheme and, among other things, their
limited access to data 76 and the proper rule set to regulate off-exchange trading. Exchanges
generally do not have a detailed set of member conduct rules and non-exchange-specific trading
rules, thus allowing such broker-dealers and their personnel to conduct business under a less
specific regulatory regime than FINRA members. In this context and consistent with the
statutory framework that places responsibility for off-exchange trading with an Association,
therefore, the Commission preliminarily believes that an Association is better suited to regulate
off-exchange trading.
The Commission estimates that, today, there are approximately 125 broker-dealers
exempt from Association membership. 77 This group includes some of the most active cross-

76

See Exchange Act Release No. 67457 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR 45722, 45728-30 (August
1, 2012) (discussing the use and limitations of current SRO audit trails and noting that
“[m]ost SROs maintain their own specific audit trails applicable to their members” and
“each SRO only has direct access to its own audit trails . . .”).

77

The Commission believes that the majority of these firms rely on the Rule 15b9-1
exemption rather than the statutory exception from Association membership under
25

market proprietary trading firms, which generate a substantial volume of orders and transactions
in the off-exchange market. For example, the Commission estimates that orders from NonMember Firms represented a volume-weighted average of approximately 32% of all orders sent
directly to ATSs during 2012. 78 By 2014, these Non-Member Firms represented a volumeweighted average of approximately 48% of orders sent directly to ATSs. 79
Accordingly, the Commission believes that many of the broker-dealers today that rely on
the Rule 15b9-1 exemption are very different from those for which the Rule originally was
intended—exchange-based specialists and other floor members that focused their business on a
single exchange of which they were a member. The presumption built into Section 15(b)(8) and
further extended by Rule 15b9-1, namely that the exchange of which the firm is a member is in
the optimal position to provide self-regulatory oversight, does not appear to hold for those firms
that avail themselves of the exemption but are engaged in a significant amount of off-exchange
trading. 80 For broker-dealers that conduct business only on one exchange, the exchange SRO is
well-positioned to oversee the activities of those broker-dealers and write and enforce rules

Section 15(b)(8) of the Act, 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8), because the Rule-based exemption is
more permissive than the statute, allowing, for example, unlimited proprietary trading on
an exchange of which a broker-dealer is not a member. The estimate of 125 firms is
based on publicly available data reviewed by staff during March of 2015. See infra note
148.
78

This estimate is based on data from OATS. See supra note 21.

79

This information is based on data from OATS. In 2013, these Non-Member Firms
represented a volume-weighted average of approximately 40% of orders sent directly to
ATSs. Id.

80

For example, based on disclosures on Form BD as of March 2015, there were 13 NonMember Firms that are members of only CBOE, an options exchange, that do not
disclose as part of their business activities on Form BD being a “put and call broker or
dealer or option writer.” Similarly, five Non-Member Firms disclose on Form BD that
they are a “broker or dealer making inter-dealer markets in corporate securities over-thecounter” and are not members of FINRA.

tailored to their business model and conduct. For a broker-dealer that trades electronically across
a range of exchange and off-exchange venues, however, the individual exchange or exchanges of
which the broker-dealer may be a member are not able to as effectively regulate the off-exchange
activity of the broker-dealer because such exchange(s) today has neither the resources nor the
necessary expertise to oversee such off-exchange activity. 81 The Commission is concerned that
the reliance on the Rule 15b9-1 exemption by cross-market proprietary trading firms, given that
exchanges focus their regulatory oversight on their respective exchanges, undermines the
effectiveness of the regulatory structure of the off-exchange market and the equities markets
more broadly.
As noted, FINRA currently is the SRO to which off-exchange trades are reported. 82
However, because it does not have jurisdiction over Non-Member Firms, it is unable to enforce
compliance with the federal securities laws and rules, or apply its own rules, to broker-dealers
that conduct a significant amount of off-exchange trading activity, including those that engage in
so-called high-frequency trading strategies. As a result, FINRA’s ability to perform
comprehensive market surveillance, especially for violations of Commission rules, as well as its
ability to understand and reconstruct activity in the off-exchange market generally, is limited
because Non-Member Firms are not consistently identified in trade reports to the TRFs 83 or the

81

The Commission notes that, while today an exchange may not be able to effectively
regulate off-exchange activity, it may be able to acquire the resources and expertise to do
so.

82

See supra note 70.

83

Reports to the TRFs can only be made by FINRA members. See FINRA Rules 7210A(k)
and 7210B(i) (defining the term “Trade Reporting Participant” or “Participant” as “any
member of FINRA in good standing that uses the System”).

ADF, and their order activity is not captured by OATS. 84 Accordingly, FINRA is unable to
monitor the off-exchange market activity of Non-Member Firms, and detect potentially
manipulative or other illegal behavior, as efficiently or effectively as it can with FINRA
members. 85 Obtaining additional data, such as through the Consolidated Audit Trail (“CAT”), 86
or the assumption of post-trade surveillance and investigation by the Non-Member Firm’s

84

When a Non-Member Firm routes an order to a FINRA member which then routes the
order to an exchange or off-exchange for execution, OATS data would indicate only that
the FINRA member received an order from a Non-Member Firm. The identity of the
Non-Member Firm is often not captured because such Non-Member Firms are not
required to use a unique Market Participant Identifier (“MPID”) or other identifier when
routing orders to a FINRA member. In some cases, FINRA is able to identify the NonMember Firm that participated in a transaction if, for example, it has an MPID and
provides it to the firm to which it routed an order and that firm reports it to FINRA.
FINRA has solicited comment from its members on a proposed FINRA rule change that
would require FINRA members to identify Non-Member Firms in off-exchange
transactions reported to OATS. See FINRA Regulatory Notice 14-51, Equity Trading
Initiatives: OATS and ATS Reporting Requirements (November 2014), available at
https://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@reg/@notice/documents/notices/p6016
81.pdf. This proposal has not yet been filed with the Commission pursuant to Section
19(b)(1) of the Act. 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1).

85

Non-Member Firms that engage in off-exchange transactions are not required to submit
audit trail data to FINRA. See FINRA Rules 6610 and 6622(a)(i). The Commission
believes that this lack of audit trail reporting is problematic because an Association has
statutory responsibility for regulatory oversight of the off-exchange market. Although
the Commission understands some off-exchange trades between Non-Member Firms are
voluntarily reported by clearing firms, clearing firms are not obligated to report such
transactions. Lack of comprehensive reporting of off-exchange transactions to FINRA,
among other things, undermines FINRA’s ability to effectively surveil the off-exchange
market. By extension, this also undermines the ability of the Commission and investors
to fully benefit from the self-regulatory model envisioned by Congress in the Exchange
Act.

86

Rule 613 under the Act requires SROs to jointly submit to the Commission a national
market system plan (“NMS Plan”) to create, implement, and maintain a consolidated
order tracking system, or consolidated audit trail, with respect to NMS securities, that
would capture customer and order event information for NMS securities, across all
markets, from the time of order inception through routing, cancellation, modification, or
execution. See Exchange Act Release No. 67457 (July 19, 2012), 77 FR 45721 (August
1, 2012) (“CAT Release”); 17 CFR 242.613.

member exchange, would neither confer jurisdiction nor provide needed oversight tools to
FINRA over Non-Member Firms that participate in the off-exchange market. No exchange
currently is positioned to regulate its members’ conduct in the off-exchange market, as the
exchanges generally have access only to order and trade data for transactions effected on their
markets. 87 Moreover, even if exchanges were able to access the necessary trading data (a
possibility that would increase with the deployment of CAT), 88 the Commission believes that
piecemeal regulation of the off-exchange market by multiple SROs based on the membership
status of the participants and a web of regulatory allocations among SROs, through the use of
multiple 17d-2 agreements, is significantly less efficient and frustrates the structure established
by Congress that an Association regulate the off-exchange market. 89 In addition, an
Association’s regulatory responsibility for the off-exchange market includes an obligation to
monitor those markets for operational and regulatory issues, as well as issues relating to market
87

While some exchanges have rules requiring the reporting of certain off-exchange
transactions by their members, these rules, as they currently exist, would not provide the
exchanges with the complete view of the market that the Commission believes is
necessary to effectively regulate the off-exchange market. For example, NYSE MKT
LLC (“NYSE MKT”) Rule 410B - Equities (Reports of Listed Securities Transactions
Effected Off the Exchange) only requires reporting of off-exchange transactions in
securities listed on NYSE MKT that are not reported to the Consolidated Tape. See
Exchange Act Release No. 58705 (October 1, 2008), 73 FR 58995 (October 8, 2008)
(order approving, among other things, NYSE MKT Rule 410B); see also, e.g., CBOE
Rule 6.49 (Transactions Off the Exchange) (requiring that CBOE members executing
transactions in options listed on the exchange other than on CBOE merely keep a record
of such transaction for a period of one year).

88

The Commission notes that the CAT NMS plan would not be implemented for several
years. In accordance with Rule 613, the SROs would be required to report the required
data to the central repository within one year after effectiveness of the NMS plan; brokerdealers, other than small broker-dealers, would be required to report the required data to
the central repository within two years after effectiveness of the NMS plan; and small
broker-dealers would be required to report the required data within three years after
effectiveness of the NMS plan. 17 CFR 242.613.

disruptions. 90 The Commission is concerned that the inability of an Association to reliably
identify and enforce regulatory compliance by cross-market proprietary trading firms that are
Non-Member Firms in the off-exchange market, creates a risk to the fair and orderly operations
of the market.
Further, because FINRA is unable to apply the rules it has developed for the offexchange market to Non-Member Firms, its ability to create a consistent regulatory framework
for the off-exchange market is undermined. FINRA has sought to establish a robust regulatory
regime for broker-dealers, including broker-dealers conducting business in the off-exchange
market, and has developed a detailed set of rules in core areas such as trading practices, 91
business conduct, 92 financial condition and operations, 93 and supervision. 94 Because Non-

91

See FINRA Rule 5000 Series – Securities Offerings and Trading Standards and
Practices. For instance, FINRA has rules prohibiting members from coordinating prices
and intimidating other members. See FINRA Rule 5240(a), providing, among other
things, that “[n]o member or person associated with a member shall: (1) coordinate the
prices (including quotations), trades or trade reports of such member with any other
member or person associated with a member, or any other person; (2) direct or request
another member to alter a price (including a quotation); or (3) engage, directly or
indirectly, in any conduct that threatens, harasses, coerces, intimidates or otherwise
attempts improperly to influence another member, a person associated with a member, or
any other person.” The Commission notes that CBOE has stated that it views any
collusion, intimidation and harassment by a CBOE member as “inconsistent with the just
and equitable principles of trade.” See CBOE Regulatory Circular RG97-167 (February
7, 2000) and CBOE Rule 4.1. See also supra note 73 and accompanying text.

92

See FINRA Rule 2000 Series – Duties and Conflicts.

93

See FINRA Rule 4000 Series – Financial and Operational Rules. See e.g., FINRA Rule
4370(a) providing, among other things, that “[e]ach member must create and maintain a
written business continuity plan identifying procedures relating to an emergency or
significant business disruption. Such procedures must be reasonably designed to enable
the member to meet its existing obligations to customers. In addition, such procedures
must address the member's existing relationships with other broker-dealers and counterparties.” Although NYSE MKT LLC Equities Rule 4370 is similar to FINRA Rule
4370(a), for example, a number of other exchanges do not have such a rule.

30

Member Firms are not subject to these or other FINRA rules, they may be subject to a less robust
regulatory framework than FINRA members that themselves trade off-exchange. Non-Member
Firms also are not subject to the costs associated with FINRA membership. 95
As is discussed in more detail in the Economic Analysis, firms that become FINRA
members would become subject to the fees charged by FINRA to all of its member firms.
FINRA charges each member firm certain regulatory fees designed to recover the costs to
FINRA of the supervision and regulation of members, including performing examinations,
94

See FINRA Rule 3000 Series – Supervision and Responsibilities Relating to Associated
Persons. This rule series generally requires FINRA member firms to, among other
things, establish, maintain, and enforce written procedures to supervise the types of
business in which the firm engages and the activities of its associated persons that are
reasonably designed to achieve compliance with applicable securities laws and
regulations, and with applicable FINRA rules. See e.g., FINRA Rules 3110
(Supervision), 3120 (Supervisory Control System), and 3170 (Tape Recording of
Registered Persons by Certain Firms). See also FINRA By-Laws Article III –
Qualifications of Members and Associated Persons. Any person associated with a
member firm who is engaged in the securities business of the firm—including partners,
officers, directors, branch managers, department supervisors, and salespersons—must
register with FINRA. Other SROs do not have similar standards for associated persons
of member broker-dealers.

95

The Commission notes that FINRA may need to consider reassessing the structure of its
fees, including its Trading Activity Fee, in order to assure that it is fairly and equitably
applied to many of the Non-Member Firms that, as a result of the amendments to Rule
15b9-1, may join FINRA. FINRA uses the TAF to recover the costs to FINRA of the
supervision and regulation of members, including performing examinations, financial
monitoring, and policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and enforcement activities. See FINRA
Schedule A to the By-Laws of the Corporation, Section 1(a), available at
http://finra.complinet.com/en/display/display_main.html?rbid=2403&element_id=4694
(“FINRA Schedule A”). The TAF is generally assessed on FINRA member firms for all
equity sales transactions that are not performed in a broker-dealer’s capacity as a
registered exchange specialist or market maker. See id. at Section 1(b). As discussed
above, many of the broker-dealers that may be required to join FINRA if the proposed
amendments are adopted effect transactions in large volumes throughout the national
market system, and often in a capacity other than as a registered market-maker.
Accordingly, the Commission notes that FINRA may need to consider reevaluating the
structure of the TAF to assure that it appropriately takes into account this business model.
See also infra notes 174-175 and accompanying text for further discussion of the TAF.

31

financial monitoring, and policy, rulemaking, interpretive, and enforcement activities. 96
FINRA’s regulatory fees include a Trading Activity Fee (“TAF”). 97
The number of trades subject to the TAF in the off-exchange market—and thus the
aggregate fees collected by FINRA for that market segment—would not be expected to
materially change if the proposed amendments are adopted because, in general, the TAF
currently is assessed on the ATSs where Non-Member Firms effect off-exchange transactions,
rather than on the Non-Member Firms. However, it is likely that certain on-exchange trades by
Non-Member Firms that currently are not covered by the TAF would be captured. 98 As such, the
Commission preliminarily believes that FINRA may need to consider reevaluating its fee

96

FINRA Schedule A, supra note 95, at Section 1.

97

FINRA assesses each member a TAF on the sale of all covered securities. For the
purposes of determining the TAF, covered securities include, among other things, all
exchange-registered securities wherever executed and all other equity securities traded
otherwise than on an exchange. FINRA last adjusted the TAF rate for sales of covered
equity securities effective July 2012. FINRA’s regulatory fees also include a Gross
Income Assessment (“GIA”) and a Personnel Assessment.
In addition, Section 3 of Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws states that each member will
be assessed a regulatory transaction fee that is determined periodically in accordance with
Section 31 of the Exchange Act. Section 31(c) generally requires each national securities
association to pay the Commission a fee based on the aggregate dollar amount of sales of
certain securities transacted by or through any member of such association otherwise than
on a national securities exchange. 15 U.S.C. 78ee(c). The Commission preliminarily
believes that FINRA’s Section 3 fees will not change as a result of the proposed
amendments to Rule 15b9-1. The fees collected by FINRA under Section 3 are intended
to correspond to its obligations to the SEC under Section 31(c) of the Act. However, if
the proposal is adopted, as Non-Member Firms become FINRA members, FINRA could
seek to reallocate Section 3 fees among FINRA members. Nonetheless, because the
Commission generally believes that Section 3 fees are passed through by FINRA
members to the parties to covered transactions, we do not expect the burden of Section 3
fees to materially change.

98

As is discussed in more detail in the Economic Analysis, the Commission preliminarily
estimates that some firms could be subject to a TAF of up to $3.2 million based on their
current sales of covered securities. See Section V.C.2.

structure to ensure that it appropriately reflects the activities of, and regulatory responsibilities
towards, these FINRA members, if the proposal is adopted.
In addition, under the proposal a broker-dealer that effects transactions on multiple
exchanges, and not on ATSs or elsewhere in the off-exchange market, would need to become a
member of an Association if it effects transactions indirectly on exchanges of which it is not a
member (i.e., through another broker-dealer that is a member of that exchange) in accordance
with Section 15(b)(8), unless one of the specified exceptions in the proposed amendment is
available. 99 The Commission believes that this is consistent with the statutory framework and
would address an activity potentially not subject to effective regulatory oversight in today’s
market. Specifically, if such a broker-dealer were a member of one exchange but conducted a
significant amount of activity indirectly on other exchanges of which it was not a member, the
exchange of which it was a member would not be well-positioned to regulate the member’s
activity on those other exchanges. As with the off-exchange market, individual exchanges today
lack access to data, 100 the proper rule set and the necessary expertise to regulate trading on other
exchanges. Under these circumstances—where the broker-dealer would not be conducting “offexchange” activity but would be effecting transactions on an exchange of which it is not a
member, the Commission believes that an Association is best-positioned to oversee this
activity. 101 As discussed elsewhere in this release, FINRA currently conducts cross-market
99

The Commission is not currently aware of any broker-dealer with such a business model.

100

See supra note 76.

101

The Commission also believes that this would be consistent with the statutory
framework, which subjected broker-dealers that effect transactions on an exchange of
which they are not a member first to Commission, and then to Association, oversight. In
amending Rule 15b8-1 in 1976 to add the exclusion for proprietary trading, the
Commission also revised the text of Rule 15b8-1 by substituting the phrase “otherwise
than on a national securities exchange of which he is a member” to replace the phrase
33

surveillance and is provided exchange audit trail data pursuant to existing RSAs and 17d-2
agreements. 102 In contrast, exchanges generally do not conduct cross-market surveillance and
most have allocated this responsibility to FINRA. Accordingly, the Commission believes that, as
a practical matter and consistent with Section 15(b)(8), FINRA is currently in the best position to
regulate cross-market activity103 by broker-dealers that effect transactions on exchanges other

“otherwise than on a national securities exchange.” See Adoption of Amendments to
SECO Rules, supra note 13, at 10600. The Commission made this revision “to conform
the scope of the SECO rules to the Commission’s authority” under Section 15(b)(8) and
15(b)(9) (as revised in 1975) to subject “broker-dealers who effect transactions on
exchanges other than those of which they are members to the SECO rules.” Id. This
change reflected the Commission’s understanding that broker-dealers effecting
transactions on exchanges of which they were not a member should be subject to the
then-existing regulatory framework (i.e., either Association membership or direct
Commission regulation under the SECO program) governing off-exchange trading. As
noted above, Congress amended the Act in 1983 “to eliminate direct regulation of brokerdealers by the Commission through the SECO Program and to require any broker-dealer
engaged in an over-the-counter (‘OTC’) securities business to join a registered securities
association.” See SECO Programs Release, supra note 9, at 53688. Consistent with the
Commission’s rationale in 1976, the Commission believes that broker-dealers that effect
transactions on exchanges of which they are not a member should be subject to the
current regulatory framework governing off-exchange trading, namely, membership in an
Association.
102

See, e.g., News Release, FINRA, BATS Global Markets, FINRA Enter Regulatory
Service Agreement (February, 6, 2014), available at
https://www.finra.org/Newsroom/NewsReleases/2014/P443474. Such agreements
provide detailed data that allow FINRA to comprehensively identify the market-wide
activity of broker-dealers, and to surveil behavior for violative activity that might
otherwise go undetected if surveillance were only being conducted on an exchangespecific basis.

103

In advance of the 1975 Amendments, Congress contemplated reforms to the regulatory
structure of the securities markets in which an Association’s role would be expanded,
while exchanges would focus their regulatory activities on their respective markets: “. . .
the time has come to begin planning a framework which will guide the development of
the self-regulatory system in the future. In the revised system, a single nationwide entity
[an Association] would be responsible for regulation of the retail end of the securities
business, including such matters as financial responsibility and selling practices, while
each exchange would concentrate on regulating the use of its own trading facilities . . .
the regulatory activities of the NASD (the only organization presently registered as a
national securities association) would encompass many of the present regulatory
34

than those of which the broker-dealer is a member, even if they do not effect transactions in the
off-exchange market. 104
In sum, the Commission is concerned that some of the most active cross-market
proprietary trading firms may not be subject to effective regulatory oversight by an exchange or
Association with respect to the full range of their market activity. Accordingly, the Commission
is proposing to amend Rule 15b9-1, as described below, to appropriately tailor the exemption
from Association membership for today’s markets.
II.

Discussion of Amendments to Rule 15b9-1

A. Prior Comments on Association Membership
In 2010, the Commission issued a Concept Release that, among other things, solicited
comment on whether all proprietary trading firms should be required to register as broker-dealers
and become members of FINRA to help assure that their operations were subject to full
regulatory oversight. 105 The Commission received six comment letters that directly addressed
the question as it relates to FINRA membership, including one comment letter from FINRA. 106

‘expanded’ NASD would have direct responsibility, subject to SEC oversight, for
enforcing SEC rules and its own rules . . .” S. Doc. No. 93-13 at 16, 169 (1973).
104

A broker-dealer would not need to become a member of an Association if it conducts no
activity in the off-exchange market and it becomes a member of each exchange upon
which it effects transactions. Although the Commission is not aware of such brokerdealer business model existing today, if one were to arise, the Commission notes that the
exchanges upon which such broker-dealer directly effects transactions could enter into an
RSA to ensure effective cross-market supervision of this activity. The Commission
acknowledges that in the future another SRO could assume these responsibilities pursuant
to 17d-2 Agreements, subject to Commission approval, and RSAs.

The six comment letters offered contrasting views. Three commenters expressed their support
for enhanced oversight of proprietary trading firms, including a requirement to become members
of FINRA, generally asserting that because proprietary trading firms are not all members of
FINRA there is a lack of uniform regulation among registered broker-dealers. 107 Three
commenters expressed opposition to the idea of requiring proprietary trading firms to become
FINRA members, asserting their belief that such firms are already subject to full regulatory
oversight, 108 requiring such firms to join FINRA would be costly and burdensome, 109 and that,

regulatory gaps through a holistic, cross-market approach to regulation that can detect
problematic activity across multiple markets and products).

108

See Allston Letter, supra note 106, at 14-15 (stating that it is inaccurate to say that

See Berkowitz Letter, supra note 106, at 1 (stating that requiring proprietary trading firms
to register as broker-dealers and become members of FINRA would add significant costs
and burdens to those firms).

36

because proprietary trading firms do not have customers, there would be no benefit to requiring
such firms to become members of FINRA. 110 The Commission has considered these comments,
and, for the reasons set forth throughout this release, is proposing to amend Rule 15b9-1 as
described herein.
B. Overview of Amendments
As noted above, Section 15(b)(8) 111 of the Act 112 generally prohibits any registered
broker or dealer from effecting transactions in securities unless it (1) is a member of an
Association or (2) effects transactions in securities solely on an exchange of which it is a
member. Section 15(b)(9) 113 of the Act provides the Commission authority to exempt any
broker or dealer from the requirements of Section 15(b)(8). The Commission has, by rule,
exercised its exemptive authority. Specifically, Rule 15b9-1 114 generally exempts any broker or
dealer from membership in an Association if it: (1) is a member of a national securities
exchange; (2) carries no customer accounts; and (3) has annual gross income of no more than
$1,000 that is derived from purchases or sales of securities effected otherwise than on an
exchange of which it is a member. However, income derived from transactions for the dealer’s

110

See DRW Letter, supra note 106, at 4 (stating that FINRA’s focus is on investor
protection and not proprietary trading, and, therefore, there would be no benefit to
requiring proprietary trading firms that do not undertake a customer business to become
members of FINRA).

own account with or through another registered broker or dealer, 115 or through the ITS, is
excluded from such de minimis allowance.
The Commission is proposing to eliminate the existing de minimis allowance (including
the exclusion for proprietary trading) and replace it with a more targeted exemption from
Association membership for a broker-dealer that conducts business on a national securities
exchange, to the extent it effects transactions off-exchange for the dealer’s own account with or
through another registered broker-dealer, that are solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of
its floor-based activities, by reducing or otherwise mitigating the risks thereof. The proposed
amendments also include an exemption for a broker-dealer to the extent it executes orders that
are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs
on such national securities exchange consistent with the provisions of Rule 611 of Regulation
NMS.
C. Elimination of the De Minimis Allowance
The Commission proposes to eliminate the de minimis allowance in its entirety.
Specifically, the Commission is proposing to delete the following language from Rule 15b9-1(a):
“and (3) has annual gross income derived from purchases and sales of securities otherwise on a
national securities exchange of which it is a member in an amount no greater than $1000.” The
Commission also is proposing to delete paragraphs (b) and (c) of the Rule, as they set forth two
exceptions to the de minimis allowance. 116 Paragraph (b) provides that income derived from (1)
transactions for the dealer’s own account with or through another registered broker-dealer, and

115

38

(2) transactions through the ITS, do not count toward the $1,000 de minimis allowance, and
paragraph (c) defines the ITS.
As discussed above, the $1,000 de minimis allowance originally was intended to permit
exchange specialists and other floor members to receive a nominal amount of commissions on
occasional off-exchange transactions for accounts referred to other members, without subjecting
them to SECO rules and broker-dealer registration and, later, Association membership. 117 Since
the de minimis allowance was first adopted in 1965, the securities markets have undergone a
significant transformation. At that time, virtually all trading activity was conducted manually on
the floors of national securities exchanges. 118 Today, however, electronic cross-market order
routing and trading strategies are a significant component of the markets, and exchange floorbased businesses represent only a small fraction of market activity. The $1,000 de minimis
allowance has never been adjusted, and the Commission is unaware of any floor members today
that refer accounts to other broker-dealers in exchange for a share of the broker’s commission
revenues. Although the Commission is proposing to eliminate the de minimis allowance, it is
soliciting comment on whether the de minimis allowance might continue to be appropriate in
today’s markets. In particular, the Commission seeks responses to the following questions:
1. Do exchange floor members currently rely on the $1,000 de minimis allowance?
If so, how? Please describe the number and types of floor members that rely on
the allowance. Please provide the nature and extent of reliance on the allowance.
Also, please provide any available data on the amount and frequency of
117

See supra note 39 and accompanying text.

118

See, e.g., Special Study, supra note 14, at 98 (“Trading by NYSE members on the
Exchange but from off the floor accounts for approximately 5 percent of total Exchange
purchases and sales . . .”).

39

commissions or referral fees that floor members may continue to receive with
respect to off-exchange transactions.
2. If the de minimis allowance is being used by exchange floor members, is it being
relied upon for its original purposes (i.e., accommodating occasional commission
splitting or referrals by such members)? If not, for what purposes are floor
members today relying on the de minimis allowance?
3. If exchange floor members currently rely on the de minimis allowance and the
Commission retains that allowance, should the $1,000 limit be changed? Why or
why not? What should the limit be?
4. If the de minimis allowance were eliminated, as proposed, would some exchange
floor members be required to become members of an Association? If so, how
many? Please provide the basis of any estimate. What would be the effect on
those firms?
5. Do other broker-dealers that are not floor members rely on the de minimis
allowance? If so, for what activities? Specifically, do cross-market proprietary
trading firms, as discussed above, rely on the allowance? If so, why? Are there
other types of businesses that use the allowance? If so, please describe them.
How and why do they rely on the allowance?
6. If the de minimis allowance were eliminated, what would be the effect on these
non-floor-based broker-dealer firms? For example, if the allowance were
eliminated, would there be effects on the business of firms that would be required
to register with an Association, and if so what would they be? Would business
incentives change such that firms might adjust their business model or their

40

trading volume by leaving the off-exchange market, moving transactions onexchange, or leaving the markets altogether? Would the effects be different on
broker-dealers trading equities from those trading options?
D. Floor Member Hedging Exemption
Although the Commission proposes to eliminate the de minimis allowance in its entirety,
it also proposes to replace the allowance with an exemption from Association membership for
exchange member broker-dealers that operate on the floor of the exchange, to the extent they
effect transactions off-exchange solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of their floor-based
activities. The Commission proposes the hedging exemption be limited to firms that trade on the
floor of a national securities exchange, as the Commission understands that currently, brokerdealers that trade exclusively on a single exchange do so on a physical exchange floor. 119
Accordingly, the Commission is proposing to add the following language to Rule 15b9-1: “and,
(c) Effects transactions solely on a national securities exchange of which it is a member, except
that . . . (1) A dealer that conducts business on the floor of a national securities exchange may
effect transactions, for the dealer’s own account with or through another registered broker or
dealer, that are solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activities, by
reducing or otherwise mitigating the risks thereof. A dealer seeking to rely on this exception
shall establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to
ensure and demonstrate that such hedging transactions reduce or otherwise mitigate the risks of
the financial exposure the dealer incurs as a result of its floor-based activity. Such dealer shall
preserve a copy of its policies and procedures in a manner consistent with 17 CFR 240.17a-4

119

Currently, NYSE Arca Options, NYSE Amex Options, NASDAQ OMX Phlx, CBOE,
NYSE, and NYSE MKT have physical exchange floors.

41

until three years after the date the policies and procedures are replaced with updated policies and
procedures.”
The Commission understands that today there are some broker-dealers that continue to
limit their activities to exchange floors, particularly in the options markets. 120 As discussed
above, at the time Rule 15b9-1 was adopted, the circumstances under which an exchange
specialist or floor broker would trade proprietarily off-exchange were quite limited, such as
where a regional exchange specialist would hedge risk on the primary listing market. The
Commission believes that those broker-dealers that today continue to limit their trading activities
to an exchange floor may seek to hedge the risks of their floor-based activities on other markets,
both on national securities exchanges and off-exchange. 121 Therefore, the Commission proposes
to retain a more focused exemption from Association membership for the type of activity for
which the Commission believes the exclusion for proprietary trading in Rule 15b9-1 was
originally designed. 122
The availability of the proposed hedging exemption would be limited to dealers that
conduct business on the floor of a national securities exchange and are members of that
exchange. Section 15(b)(8) requires Association membership for all registered broker-dealers
120

Based on disclosures on Form BD, as of February 2015, the Commission understands
that there are approximately 43 Non-Member Firms that are members of one national
securities exchange and that disclose being engaged in floor activities on Form BD. The
business model of these firms varies widely, and may include market making, other
proprietary trading and agency business.

121

For example, a broker-dealer may operate a floor-based business on one or more options
exchanges. As a result of this activity, the broker-dealer may need to mitigate the risk of
its options positions, resulting from such activity, on other options markets or in the
equities markets. The proposed floor member hedging exemption would allow the
broker-dealer to enter into transactions on other markets solely for the purpose of hedging
this risk.

122

See supra note 39 and accompanying text.

42

other than those that effect transactions solely on an exchange of which they are a member.
Broker-dealers that limit their activities in this manner generally are specialists or floor brokers
based on the floor of an individual exchange. In exercising its exemptive authority when it
adopted Rule 15b8-1 in 1965, the Commission sought to accommodate off-exchange activities
ancillary to that floor-based business. The Commission believes that, today, few broker-dealers
limit their activities to a particular exchange. Those broker-dealers that do limit their business to
an exchange floor, however, may continue to seek to hedge the risk of their floor-based activities
by effecting transactions on another exchange or in the off-exchange market.
The Commission preliminarily believes that a floor-based dealer seeking to rely on the
proposed hedging exemption in Rule 15b9-1 should be required to establish, maintain and
enforce written policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure and demonstrate that its
off-exchange transactions are solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based
activities, by reducing or otherwise mitigating the risks thereof. Such hedging should reduce or
otherwise mitigate the risks of the financial exposure the dealer incurs as a result of its business
on the floor of an exchange of which it is a member. Because such hedging transactions must be
solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of the dealer’s floor-based activities, the transactions,
of course, should not be for the purpose of increasing the aggregate risk of the dealer. The
Commission notes that whether a transaction or transactions entered into to reduce or otherwise
mitigate risk results in a profit or loss is not dispositive of whether or not such a transaction or
transactions meets the terms of the proposed floor member hedging exemption. A floor-based
dealer seeking to rely on the proposed hedging exemption would be required to preserve a copy

43

of its policies and procedures in a manner consistent with Rule 17a-4 until three years after the
date the policies and procedures are replaced with updated policies and procedures. 123
The Commission preliminarily believes that requiring written policies and procedures, as
described above, would facilitate SRO supervision of broker-dealers relying on the proposed
hedging exemption, as it would provide an efficient and effective way for regulators to assess
compliance with the proposed exemption. The determination of whether an off-exchange
transaction by a floor-based dealer reduces or otherwise mitigates the risk of the financial
exposure incurred as a result of the dealer’s floor-based business may vary depending on the
nature of the business of the floor-based dealer, its financial position, and the particular
transactions effected. Consequently, the Commission preliminarily believes that requiring floorbased dealers to develop written policies and procedures will provide sufficient flexibility to
accommodate the varying business models of floor-based dealers and appropriate hedging
activities.
The Commission notes, however, that such written policies and procedures must be
reasonably designed to ensure and demonstrate that the floor-based dealer’s off-exchange
hedging transactions reduce or otherwise mitigate the risks of the financial exposure it incurs as a
result of its floor-based activity. Accordingly, a dealer seeking to rely upon the proposed
hedging exemption should maintain documentation that, in the context of an SRO or
Commission examination, would enable it to show how the hedging transactions it effects off the
exchange reduce or otherwise mitigate the risks of its floor-based business.
The Commission notes that the exchange of which the dealer is a floor member would be
responsible for enforcing compliance with the hedging exemption, including reviewing the
123

17 CFR 240.17a-4.

44

adequacy of the dealer’s written policies and procedures and whether the dealer’s off-exchange
transactions comply with those written policies and procedures, including the requirement that
the hedging transactions reduce or otherwise mitigate the risks of financial exposure the dealer
incurs as a result of its floor-based activity and that the policies and procedures are reasonably
designed to so demonstrate. 124
Because the proposed hedging exemption is intended to allow a dealer to reduce or
otherwise mitigate risk incurred in connection with its floor-based activities, it would be limited
to transactions for the dealer’s own account. In addition, because the floor-based dealer would
not itself be a member of the national securities exchange on which transactions may be effected,
or an Association, such transactions would need to be conducted with or through another
registered broker-dealer that is a member of such other national securities exchange or a member
of an Association (or both).
Finally, a dealer seeking to rely on the proposed hedging exemption would be required to
preserve a copy of its policies and procedures in a manner consistent with Rule 17a-4 under the
Exchange Act until three years after the date the policies and procedures are replaced with
updated policies and procedures. Accordingly, a dealer must keep the policies and procedures
relating to its use of the hedging exemption as part of its books and records while they are in
effect, and for three years after they are updated.
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed hedging exemption in
Rule 15b9-1. In particular, the Commission seeks responses to the following questions:
124

See 15 U.S.C. 78f(b)(1) which requires that an exchange is so organized and has the
capacity to be able to carry out the purposes of the Exchange Act and to comply, and to
enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members, with the
provisions of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the
exchange.

45

7. To what extent do exchange floor members that are Non-Member Firms today
effect transactions in the off-exchange market to hedge the risk of their floorbased activities? What is the nature and extent of such off-exchange market
activities? Do these activities tend to focus on particular products? The
Commission specifically seeks data from exchange floor members that
demonstrates the extent to which they trade off the exchange floor and how such
off-exchange trading relates to their floor-based business, including to hedge the
risks thereof, as such data may be particularly helpful in assessing a potential
floor member hedging exemption when the Commission considers adoption of the
proposed amendments.
8. Is the Commission’s proposed description of hedging transactions appropriate? Is
it sufficiently defined? If not, how should it be modified or supplemented? Is the
phrase “solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based activities,” as
used in the proposed amendments, sufficiently precise that broker-dealers will
know what activities are allowed under the proposed floor member hedging
exemption from Association membership? If not, what should be changed or
what guidance should be provided?
9. Will broker-dealers seeking to rely on the floor member hedging exemption be
able to evaluate whether, and demonstrate that, off-exchange transactions are
“solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of floor-based activities”? Please
provide specific examples. What would be the associated costs?
10. Should there be a hedging exemption at all? Why or why not?

46

11. Should the Commission narrow or broaden the proposed floor member hedging
exemption in any way? If so, how and why?
12. Do exchange floor members that are Non-Member Firms effect transactions in the
off-exchange market, or on exchanges of which they are not a member, for
purposes other than hedging the risk of their floor-based activities? If so, please
describe the nature and extent of such activities. Should there be an exemption
for these activities? Why or why not?
13. Are there non-floor-based exchange members that today focus their business
activities on a single exchange? If so, what is the nature of their business
activity? Should there be an exemption for such activities? Why or why not?
14. The proposed floor member hedging exemption is limited to transactions effected
with or through another registered broker-dealer. Are there circumstances where
an exchange floor member that is a Non-Member Firm, might need to hedge the
risk of its floor-based activities through a transaction with a non-registered
broker-dealer counterparty? If so, please describe the nature and extent of such
transactions and the particular reason(s) that such transactions should be covered.
15. The proposed floor member hedging exemption is limited to transactions for the
dealer’s own account. Are there circumstances where an exchange floor member
that is a Non-Member Firm might need to hedge the risk of customer activity on
the exchange, as agent, in the off-exchange market or on exchanges of which it is
not a member? If so, please describe.
16. Is the proposed policies and procedures requirement appropriate for the floor
member hedging exemption? What would be the costs of establishing,

47

maintaining and enforcing the policies and procedures, and the related recordkeeping requirements? How are such costs determined? Please provide evidence
of the nature, timing, and extent of such costs. Would such costs deter dealers
from relying on the floor member hedging exemption? Are there more efficient
and effective alternatives to a policies and procedures approach? If so, what are
they? Have the transactions executed by floor members pursuant to the current
Rule’s exclusion for proprietary trading posed issues of regulatory compliance,
market surveillance, or enforcement? If so, please describe in detail.
17. Will the proposed requirement to establish, maintain, and enforce written policies
and procedures enable floor members to efficiently hedge their floor-based
activities while effectively ensuring the floor member hedging exemption is used
as intended? Is there another approach that would better achieve these goals?
18. Would the proposed floor member hedging exemption present compliance risks or
otherwise raise concerns regarding the protection of investors or the maintenance
of fair, orderly, and efficient markets? If so, please describe.
19. Would current exchange surveillance and enforcement mechanisms be effective
to monitor trades that would be executed pursuant to the proposed floor member
hedging exemption? Please explain.
a. If not, should the Commission require additional reporting by registered
broker-dealers acting as agent for dealers relying on the floor member hedging
exemption? For example, should they report to an exchange or an Association
(i) the identity of the floor member effecting the hedging transaction; and (ii)
the fact that the transaction was a hedging transaction? Is such a requirement

48

necessary to assure the adequacy of market surveillance and compliance? Or,
alternatively, is the registered broker-dealer acting as agent on behalf of the
dealer subject to sufficient rules and regulations (including Rule 15c3-5 under
the Exchange Act, 125 known as the Commission’s “Market Access Rule”)?
Please explain.
b. Could a Non-Member Firm execute a hedging transaction directly with
another Non-Member Firm? If so, how would the transaction be subject to
surveillance? How would this activity affect the enforcement of the
exemption? Please explain.
c. Would exchanges otherwise have the ability to assess compliance of brokerdealers relying on the Rule?
20. Should the proposed floor member hedging exemption be subject to any
quantitative or qualitative limitations, or to special reporting obligations? Please
explain.
21. Should the proposed floor member hedging exemption require the floor member
to retain records demonstrating how each off-exchange transaction complies with
its policies and procedures? Why or why not? What would be the associated
costs, and what is the basis for those costs? Would the cost associated with
recordkeeping on a transaction by transaction basis be overly burdensome, or
unnecessary given the Commission’s proposed policies and procedures
requirement?

125

17 CFR 240.15c3-5.

49

22. Should the Rule contain an anti-evasion provision to prevent floor members from
attempting to circumvent the limitations in the floor member hedging exemption?
Is there a better method than the proposed policies and procedures approach to
ensure that floor members do not misuse the proposed floor member hedging
exemption? If so, what is it? Alternatively, are the existing Commission antifraud and anti-manipulation rules sufficient to prevent misuse of the proposed
floor member hedging exemption?
23. Should floor members have to make a certification in connection with their
reliance on the floor member hedging exemption? Why or why not? If a
certification should be required, what would be the key elements thereof? How
frequently should the certification be made? Who should make it? What
qualifications, if any, to such certification might be appropriate (e.g., reasonable
basis to believe, best of my knowledge)? Should the certification be made in
conjunction with an internal compliance review? If so, what type of internal
compliance review should be conducted?
24. Are certifications an appropriate way to promote compliance with the hedging
exemption? Do certifications bring more accountability, or do they create
compliance costs and therefore a barrier to entry?
25. Is data currently available that could be used by regulators to monitor the use of
the proposed floor member hedging exemption? Are there other approaches that
would do more to enhance regulatory surveillance, protect investors, or ensure
fair, orderly, and efficient markets?

50

26. Are there other mechanisms the Commission could consider to monitor
compliance with the floor member hedging exemption? If so, please explain.
E. Regulation NMS Routing Exemption
The Commission proposes to eliminate a portion of subparagraphs (b)(2) and all of
subparagraph (c) from Rule 15b9-1, because both contain outdated references to the “Intermarket
Trading System.” 126 ITS was a national market system plan (“ITS Plan”) operated by the
national securities exchanges and NASD that required each participant to provide electronic
access to its displayed best bid and offer to other participants and provided an electronic
mechanism for routing orders, called commitments to trade, to access those displayed prices. 127
This permitted ITS Plan members at each market to have limited access to the other markets for
the purpose of avoiding trade-throughs 128 and locked markets. 129 However, the ITS Plan was
eliminated in 2007, when it was superseded by Regulation NMS. 130 Accordingly, the
Commission is proposing to eliminate the following language, which creates an additional

126

The full title of the ITS Plan was “Plan for the Purpose of Creating and Operating an
Intermarket Communications Linkage Pursuant to Section 11A(c)(3)(B) of the Exchange
Act of 1934.” The ITS Plan was initially approved by the Commission in 1978.
Exchange Act Release No. 14661 (April 14, 1978), 43 FR 17419 (April 24, 1978). All
national securities exchanges that traded exchange-listed stocks and the NASD were
participants in the ITS Plan.

127

Id.

128

See 17 CFR 242.600(b)(77) defining a “trade-through” under Regulation NMS.

129

A “locked market” occurs when a trading center displays an order to buy at a price equal
to an order to sell, or an order to sell at a price equal to an order to buy, displayed on
another trading center.

Notice of Filing and Immediate Effectiveness of the Twenty Fourth Amendment to the
ITS Plan Relating to the Elimination of the ITS Plan, Exchange Act Release No. 55397
(March 5, 2007), 72 FR 11066 (March 12, 2007). Today, Regulation NMS contains an
updated trade-through rule, and contemplates the use of private linkages by trading
centers to route orders to avoid trade-throughs. 17 CFR 242.610-611.

51

exception to the de minimis allowance, from Rule 15b9-1 (b): “or (2) through the Intermarket
Trading System.” In addition, the Commission is eliminating in its entirety subparagraph (c) of
the Rule, which defines the ITS as follows: “(c) For purposes of this section, the term
Intermarket Trading System shall mean the intermarket communications linkage operated jointly
by certain self-regulatory organizations pursuant to a plan filed with, and approved by, the
Commission pursuant to §242.608 of this chapter.”
Today, Rule 611 of Regulation NMS requires trading centers to establish, maintain and
enforce policies and procedures reasonably designed to prevent trade-throughs in exchange-listed
stocks, subject to certain exceptions. 131 In general, Rule 611 protects automated quotes that are
the best bid or offer of a national securities exchange or Association. 132 To facilitate compliance
with Rule 611 of Regulation NMS, national securities exchanges have developed the capability
to route orders through broker-dealers (many of which are affiliated with the exchanges) to other
trading centers with protected quotations.
As discussed above, the Commission understands that some broker-dealers today
continue to limit their activities to exchange floors, and believes that Rule 15b9-1 should
continue to accommodate transactions away from the exchange of which they are a member that
are necessary to comply with regulatory requirements. A floor-based member may at times seek
to effect a transaction on the exchange at a price that would trade-through a protected quotation
on another trading center. In such a case, the exchange would need to route the member’s order,
through a routing broker-dealer, to that other trading center before it could execute any
131

Exchange Act Rule 611 states, in part, that “a trading center shall establish, maintain, and
enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to prevent tradethroughs on that trading center of protected quotations in NMS stocks. . . .” 17 CFR
242.611.

remainder of the floor-based member’s order on the exchange. Therefore, a broker-dealer may
be required, as a necessary part of its business, to effect transactions otherwise than on the
exchange of which it is a member as a consequence of the requirements of Rule 611 of
Regulation NMS.
The Commission preliminarily believes that transactions effected solely to comply with
Rule 611 regulatory requirements should not require membership in an Association by a brokerdealer that otherwise limits its activities to an exchange of which it is a member. Accordingly,
the Commission proposes to add the following language to create a second exemption from the
requirement under proposed Rule 15b9-1(c) that a broker-dealer effect transactions solely on an
exchange of which it is a member: “(2) a broker or dealer may effect transactions off the
exchange resulting from orders that are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a
member, to prevent trade-throughs on that national securities exchange consistent with 17 CFR
242.611.” The Commission believes that permitting such routing only by a national securities
exchange of which the broker-dealer is a member will provide the exchange with visibility into
the routing of transactions by its members to other exchanges, and thus maintain the exchange’s
ability to effectively oversee the entirety of its member’s activity.
The Commission requests comment on all aspects of the proposed Regulation NMS
routing exemption in Rule 15b9-1. In particular, the Commission seeks responses to the
following questions:
27. Is the proposed routing exemption necessary and appropriate? Why or why not?
28. Is the scope of the proposed routing exemption sufficient to provide for all offexchange transactions that might be effected by floor members as a necessary

53

consequence of compliance with Rule 611 of Regulation NMS? If not, how
should it be changed?
29. Does the proposed routing exemption allow transactions beyond those necessary
to comply with Rule 611 of Regulation NMS? If so, is that appropriate and
should it be narrowed or broadened?
30. Are there other off-exchange transactions that a floor member might need to
effect in order to comply with regulatory requirements? If so, please describe
those transactions and the relevant regulatory requirements.
III.

Effective Date and Implementation

The Commission recognizes that firms will require time to comply with Rule 15b9-1 if
the amendments are adopted in order to become a member of an Association, or modify the
firm’s business practices to conform to the requirements of the Rule, as amended. As noted
previously, FINRA is currently the only Association. To become a FINRA member, a brokerdealer must complete FINRA’s New Member Application and participate in a pre-membership
interview. 133 The broker-dealer and its associated persons must comply with FINRA’s
registration and qualification requirements. 134 The amount of time that it takes to become a
FINRA member would depend on a number of factors, including the nature of the brokerdealer’s business, the level of complexity or uniqueness of the firm’s business plan, the number
of associated persons the firm employs, and whether the firm has an affiliate that is already a
133

wtoBecomeaMember/index.htm (last visited on March 9, 2015).

See NASD Rule 1010 – Membership Proceedings, which sets out the substantive
standards and procedural guidelines for the FINRA membership application and
registration process.

54

member of FINRA. 135 The Commission understands, based on conversations with FINRA that,
on average, the FINRA membership application process generally takes approximately four
months.
Alternatively, if the proposed amendments are adopted, a Non-Member Firm not eligible
for, or choosing not to rely on, an exemption may become a member of additional exchanges
upon which it trades or otherwise modify its business model to conform with the proposed
amendments to the Rule. The Non-Member Firm may also need to modify its systems or take
other steps to achieve compliance.
The Commission preliminarily believes that 360 days after publication in the Federal
Register of any final rules that the Commission may adopt should provide firms enough time to
comply with the amended Rule. Therefore, the Commission proposes that the compliance date
for the proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1 would be 360 days after publication of the final
rule in the Federal Register. The Commission solicits comment on the adequacy of this proposed
implementation timeline. In particular, the Commission seeks responses to the following
questions:
31. Does 360 days after publication in the Federal Register provide firms with
sufficient time to comply with the revised Rule? Would firms be in a position to
comply with the revised Rule earlier than 360 days after publication?
32. How long does the registration process with FINRA, should a firm decide to
register, typically take? Please include the estimated time to prepare the
application as well as the estimated time for FINRA to process the application.

135

See Section V.C. discussing the costs of joining FINRA.

55

33. Do commenters believe that a longer or shorter period is appropriate to determine
whether becoming a member of an Association is preferable to changing a firm’s
business model to remain within the exemptions provided by the Rule, as
amended (i.e., ceasing all off-exchange activity and becoming a member of each
exchange on which the firm trades, or limiting the firm’s off-exchange activity to
comply with the floor member hedging exemption and/or NMS routing
exemption)?
34. How long does it typically take to complete the application process with a
national securities exchange? Please include the estimated time to prepare the
application as well as the estimated time for an exchange to process it.
35. To the extent a firm intends to rely on one or more of the proposed exemptions,
how long would it take such firm to make the required systems changes to
comply? Are there other steps that would need to be taken to achieve
compliance? If so, what is the estimated time to accomplish those steps?
IV.

General Request for Comments

The Commission seeks comment on all aspects of the proposed amendments to Rule
15b9-1. Commenters should, when possible, provide the Commission with data to support their
views. Commenters suggesting alternative approaches should provide comprehensive proposals,
including any conditions or limitations that they believe should apply, the reasons for their
suggested approaches, and their analysis regarding why their suggested approaches would satisfy
the objectives of the proposed amendments.
36. The Commission requests comment generally on whether narrowing or
broadening the current exemption is appropriate. In particular, the Commission

56

seeks comment on whether the fact that Non-Member Firms currently must use an
Association member firm to report off-exchange trades gives an Association
sufficient information and jurisdiction to effectively regulate the off-exchange
market. Are there off-exchange transactions between two Non-Member Firms
that occur that are not reported?
37. The Commission requests comment on whether the current exemption should be
eliminated entirely. What would be the benefits or drawbacks of doing so?
38. Other than the proposed hedging exemption and Regulation NMS routing
exemption, are there any other exemptions that the Commission should consider?
39. Have transactions effected pursuant to the current Rule posed compliance issues
in the past? If so, please describe in detail.
40. In addition, the Commission is interested in data indicating how many entities
rely either on Rule 15b9-1 in its current form, or exclusively on the statutory
exception in Section 15(b)(8) of the Exchange Act. Reliance on Rule 15b9-1 is
currently self-effecting (i.e., does not require the reporting of such reliance to the
Commission or any other regulatory authority). In lieu of the proposed
amendments, should the Commission require broker-dealers relying on Rule
15b9-1 to report such reliance to the Commission or to the exchange of which the
broker-dealer is a member? If so, what form should such reporting take and what
information should be provided to the Commission or the exchange of which the
broker-dealer is a member? If not, why not and what alternative means could be
used to collect data about reliance on Rule 15b9-1?

57

41. If the Commission were instead to eliminate Rule 15b9-1 altogether, how many
broker-dealers would: (i) restrict their business to only those national securities
exchanges of which they are a member; (ii) become members of other national
securities exchanges; and/or (iii) become members of an Association? Would
implementation of the proposed amendments have an effect on market liquidity?
If so, please estimate that effect. Could broker-dealers that currently rely on the
Rule respond to its elimination in other ways to avoid Association membership?
If so, please explain.
42. Should the Commission allow Non-Member Firms that conduct off-exchange
trading activity to remain exempt from membership in an Association? If so,
why? Would membership by Non-Member Firms in multiple exchanges prove an
efficient and effective substitute for Association membership? Should the level of
off-exchange activity affect the ability of a firm to be exempt from Association
membership? Why or why not?
43. Should the Commission require the exchanges to engage in joint plans to ensure
that the on-exchange cross-market activity of their members is effectively
regulated? How might this improve the oversight of on-exchange trading
activity? What problems or inefficiencies would relying on joint plans for the
regulation of on-exchange trading activity by exchanges create?
44. Is Association membership an efficient or effective approach for the regulation of
firms that trade across multiple exchanges but do not trade off-exchange? Are
there more effective alternatives?

45. Under the proposed amendments to the Rule, a Non-Member Firm that conducts
no off-exchange trading, but trades on an exchange of which it is not currently a
member, would, in accordance with Section 15(b)(8), have to either join an
Association or become a member of each exchange upon which it trades. Should
the proposed amendments be revised to provide an exemption from Section
15(b)(8) to permit such a Non-Member Firm, with no off-exchange trading, to
remain exempt from membership in an Association and continue trading on
exchanges of which it is not a member, so long as certain conditions are met, such
as the exchange of which it is a member entering into appropriate contractual
arrangements such that the exchange is in a position to effectively surveil all of
the trading activities of that firm?

What specifically should be changed and how?

Economic Analysis

As discussed above, the Commission is proposing to amend Rule 15b9-1 to better align
the scope of its exemption, in light of today’s market activity, with Section 15(b)(8) of the
Exchange Act and the Commission’s original purpose in adopting Rule 15b9-1. Currently, a
broker-dealer can engage in unlimited proprietary trading in the off-exchange market without
becoming a member of an Association, so long as its proprietary trading activity is conducted
with or through another registered broker-dealer. For a broker-dealer that trades electronically
across a range of exchange and off-exchange venues, however, the individual exchanges of
which the broker-dealer may be a member are not well-positioned to oversee the off-exchange
activity of the broker-dealer, as was previously discussed. The Commission preliminarily

59

believes that this oversight role can best be fulfilled by an Association, which is the SRO
intended and authorized by Congress to regulate the trading activity of off-exchange market
participants, monitor their financial and operational condition, and enforce their compliance with
federal securities laws and Association rules.
The Commission is sensitive to the economic effects of its rule, including the costs and
benefits and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation. Section 3(f) of the
Exchange Act requires the Commission, whenever it engages in rulemaking pursuant to the
Exchange Act, and is required to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, to consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether
the action would promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 136 In addition, Section
23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission, when making rules under the Exchange
Act, to consider the effect such rules would have on competition. 137 Exchange Act Section
23(a)(2) prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on
competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 138
The Commission discusses below a number of economic effects that are likely to result
from the proposed amendments. As discussed in detail below, many of the effects are difficult to
quantify with any degree of certainty. Although the Commission is providing estimates of direct
compliance costs where possible, the Commission also anticipates that broker-dealers affected by
the proposed amendments, as well as competitors of those broker-dealers, may modify their
business practices regarding the provision of liquidity in both off-exchange markets and on

exchanges. Consequently, much of the discussion below is qualitative in nature, but where
possible, the Commission has provided quantified estimates. 139
A. Baseline
1. Regulatory Structure and Activity Levels of Non-Member Firms
The Exchange Act governs the way in which the U.S. securities markets and its brokerdealers operate. Section 3(a)(4)(A) of the Act generally defines a “broker” broadly as “any
person engaged in the business of effecting transactions in securities for the account of
others.” 140 In addition, Section 3(a)(5)(A) of the Act generally defines a “dealer” as: “any person
engaged in the business of buying and selling securities for . . . such person’s own account
through a broker or otherwise.” 141 The Commission oversees approximately 4,209 brokerdealers, of which approximately 4,057 are members of FINRA, currently the only Association. 142
Generally, any firm that interacts directly with a securities exchange must register with
the Commission as a broker-dealer to gain direct access to the exchange. Consequently, there is
diversity in the size and business activities of broker-dealers. 143 Carrying broker-dealers hold
customer funds and securities; some of these are also clearing broker-dealers that handle the
clearance and settlement aspects of customer trades, including record-keeping activities and

effects likely to result from the proposed amendments.

15 U.S.C.78c(5)(A).

142

There were approximately 4,209 broker-dealers registered with the Commission as of
March 2015.

143

A firm that wishes to transact business upon an exchange without becoming a brokerdealer can do so by engaging a broker-dealer to provide market access and settlement
services. While effecting transactions in the off-exchange market does not require
registering as a broker-dealer, it does require obtaining the services of a broker-dealer to
handle settlement at a minimum.

61

preparing trade confirmations. 144 However, during the fourth quarter of 2014, only 284 of the
4,184 registered broker-dealers were classified as carrying or clearing broker-dealers. Thus, the
majority of broker-dealers engage in a wide range of other activities, which may or may not
include handling customer accounts. These other activities include intermediating between
customers and carrying/clearing brokers; dealing in government bonds; private placement of
securities; effecting transactions in mutual funds that involve transferring funds directly to the
issuer; writing options; acting as an exchange floor broker; and the provision of liquidity to
securities markets, which includes, but is not limited to, the activities of registered market
makers.
Broker-dealers are diverse in size as well as scope of activity. Most broker-dealers are
small, with 67% of broker-dealers employing 10 or fewer registered individuals and only 4% of
broker-dealers employing over 151 registered individuals. 145 Although the majority of brokerdealers are small, there are a few very large broker-dealers as well. Further, while there are
many registered broker-dealers, a small minority of broker-dealers controls the majority of
broker-dealer capital and has the ability to affect the allocation of capital to liquidity provision.
As of December 31, 2014, the majority of broker-dealers each had total capital of less than
$500,000, while the ten largest broker-dealers in terms of capital accounted for more than 53%
of total broker-dealer capital, with each disclosing more than $10 billion in total capital. 146
As of March 2015, 125 of the approximately 4,209 registered broker-dealers were not
members of FINRA, currently the only Association. The Commission believes the majority of

144

Non-Member Firms rely on the Rule’s exemption from Association membership. 147 Because of
the exclusion for proprietary trading, a broker-dealer that does not carry customer accounts is not
required to join an Association, even when that broker-dealer has substantial off-exchange
trading activity.
Non-Member Firms are diverse in their types and activities. Of the 125 Non-Member
Firms, 77 disclose engaging in floor activities on a national securities exchange, as reported on
Form BD. 148
There is significant diversity in the business models of Non-Member Firms. Some NonMember Firms may limit their trading to a single exchange, while others trade on multiple
venues possibly including off-exchange venues like ATSs. Some firms are significant
contributors to both off-exchange and exchange volume. Because any off-exchange activity that
involves a FINRA member firm (“Member Firm”) generates certain audit trail data, FINRA and

147

See supra note 77. Historically, these floor brokers had only incidental trading on
exchanges of which they were not members, and limited off-exchange trading activity.
The background and history of Rule 15b9-1 are discussed in Section I.

148

See Form BD data for Non-Member Firms during March of 2015. Of the 125 NonMember Firms, 77 Non-Member Firms disclose engaging in floor activities on a national
securities exchange; 76 firms disclose acting as a put and call broker or dealer or option
writer; and 89 firms disclose trading securities for their own account. Other businesses
cited by multiple Non-Member Firms include: national securities exchange commission
business other than floor activities (6); making inter-dealer markets in corporate
securities off-exchange (5); selling corporate debt securities (2); dealing in government
securities (4); and other business (18).
Currently, a Non-Member Firm that is a member of a single exchange but is not engaged
in floor-broker activity may engage in trading upon other exchanges using access
provided by a broker-dealer that is an exchange member of the destination exchange.
These single-exchange member Non-Member Firms may also engage in off-exchange
trading with or without the intermediation of a Member Firm. Under the proposed
amendments, both of these activities would be disallowed except as outlined in the Floor
Member Hedging Exemption (see Section II.D.) and the Regulation NMS Routing
Exemption (see Section II.E.).

63

the Commission are able to quantify the aggregate off-exchange activity of Non-Member
Firms. 149 During the fourth quarter of 2014, there were 104.5 billion orders reported in the offexchange market. Of these 104.5 billion orders, 36.9 billion (35.31%) were received from NonMember Firms. 150 Non-Member Firms submitted 44.99% of all orders within ATSs in the fourth
quarter of 2014.
Although the Commission can observe the aggregate off-exchange trading of NonMember Firms, it is unable to quantify the off-exchange trading of all Non-Member Firms on an
individual basis because Member Firms currently are not required to report the identifiers of
Non-Member Firms with whom they transact to OATS. 151 However, some Member Firms
voluntarily report the exchange-issued identifiers of the Non-Member Firms with which they

149

Most off-exchange interactions involve a Member Firm at some point in the order audit
trail for routing, and therefore produce OATS data, although identification of the firm
that submits the order is not required by OATS. Interactions between Non-Member
Firms without the involvement of a Member Firm are possible and would not generate
audit trail data, but the Commission believes these interactions are infrequent for two
reasons. First, all ATSs are operated by Member Firms, so all orders submitted to ATSs
are reported to OATS. Second, although two Non-Member Firms could theoretically
interact on a Non-Member Firm operated single dealer platform, the Commission is
unaware of any single dealer platform that is operated by a Non-Member Firm. Such a
platform would be visible in OATS data as a routing and execution destination if it were
accessed by Member Firms. Although it is possible that a Non-Member Firm could
approach another Non-Member Firm directly to negotiate a transaction outside of an
automated venue, the Commission believes large Non-Member Firms transact with each
other almost exclusively through ATSs and do not seek each other out as trading partners.
Further information about off-exchange trading outside of ATSs is provided by Tuttle,
Laura, 2014, Over-the-Counter Trading: Description of Non-ATS OTC Trading in

interact. 152 Using this data, the Commission can estimate the ATS activity level of the 14 NonMember Firms that connected to ATSs directly without the intermediation of another brokerdealer during the fourth quarter of 2014. 153 Based on this data, at least 19.31% of all ATS orders
is attributable to the Non-Member Firm that was the most active in ATS orders during the review
period. 154 The least active of the 14 identifiable Non-Member Firms has almost no order

152

Data provided by FINRA. This does not include activity submitted by firms not
registered as broker-dealers, including data on buy-side activity. In the fourth quarter of
2014, approximately 46.42% of ATS orders from Non-Member Firms included an
exchange-issued identifier that allows identification of the Non-Member Firm submitting
an order. The set of ATS clients that are not FINRA members also includes substantial
buy-side activity, but this analysis is limited to firms that are also registered brokerdealers: the 125 Non-Member Firms.
Although the analysis here focuses on ATS activity, Non-Member Firms interact with
Member Firms outside of ATSs as well, primarily on single-dealer platforms. Across all
off-exchange executions, in the fourth quarter of 2014, 3.26% of share volume (10.56%
of dollar volume) was attributable to the trading of Non-Member Firms.

153

Although these 14 Non-Member Firms connect to ATSs directly without the assistance of
another broker-dealer, the ATSs are operated by Member Firms and these orders are
therefore permitted under the current rule.
The Commission believes that these 14 Non-Member Firms represent a subset of the
largest Non-Member Firms that actively trade across multiple exchanges and offexchange and thus may not be representative of the broader set of 125 Non-Member
Firms. As such, estimates of these 14 firms’ ATS activity levels and the regulatory fees
that the activity would generate exceed those expected from typical Non-Member Firms.

154

Non-Member Firms submitted 32.9 billion of the 66.8 billion ATS orders during the
fourth quarter of 2014. ATSs reported Non-Member MPIDs for 15.3 billion of these
Non-Member Firm orders. The Non-Member Firm most frequently identified as the
source of ATS orders submitted 4.9 billion ATS orders (7.30% of all orders and 39.20%
of all Non-Member Firm ATS orders for which a Non-Member Firm MPID is reported).
With the assumption that this firm also submitted 39.20% of the Non-Member Firm ATS
orders to ATSs that do not report Non-Member Firm MPIDs, this firm would account for
19.31% of all ATS orders.
ATSs generally provide the exchange-issued MPIDs of Non-Member Firms submitting
orders either for all orders or for none of the orders received directly from Non-Member
Firms. For purposes of our analysis, we assume that the proportion of orders submitted
by individual Non-Member Firms to ATSs that report identifiers is equal to that
proportion for ATSs that do not report Non-Member Firm MPIDs. It is possible that
65

activity. In total, five of the 14 Non-Member Firms are each responsible for 1% or more of all
orders sent directly to an ATS for the review period.
The business of providing liquidity off-exchange is competitive. Off-exchange equity
trading occurs across many trading venues. In May 2012, 44 ATSs actively traded NMS stocks,
comprising 12.12% of NMS share volume. 155 Furthermore, 255 broker-dealers transacted a
further 18.75% of NMS share volume off-exchange without the involvement of an ATS. 156
Although many market participants provide liquidity within this market, Non-Member Firms are
particularly active within ATSs, as discussed above. Although Non-Member Firms may trade in

some Non-Member Firms transact only in ATSs that do not report these identifiers to
FINRA; if that is true, our estimate of the activity level of the 14 identified Non-Member
Firms would be upwardly biased because we would attribute the ATS volume of the
unidentified Non-Member Firms to those that have been identified. Furthermore, our
estimate that 14 Non-Member Firms connect to ATSs directly would be downward
biased. It is also possible that the proportions of orders attributable to individual NonMember Firms are materially different on ATSs that do not report Non-Member Firm
identifiers, although any error introduced by this would likely not be directional.
Additionally, some Non-Member Firms may submit orders to Member Firms that are
then routed to ATSs or elsewhere off-exchange. Such activity would cause us to
underestimate the activity of these 14 Non-Member Firms within ATSs, although such
activity would still be counted at the aggregate Non-Member Firm level.

the Non-ATS segment of the off-exchange market, the Commission preliminarily believes they
rarely act as liquidity suppliers outside of ATSs. 157
While some Non-Member Firms trade actively off-exchange, some of these firms also
supply and demand liquidity actively on multiple exchanges. 158 The Commission is able to
identify the activity of 13 of the 14 Non-Member Firms identified as connecting directly with
ATSs on exchanges operated by BATS, NASDAQ-OMX, and NYSE during May of 2014. The
data show that these Non-Member Firms contribute substantially to exchange volume. 159 On
these exchanges, during May 2014, these 13 large Non-Member Firms that connect directly to
ATSs participate in at least 17.25% of all exchange trading volume. The highest Non-Member
Firm participation rate in the data is on BATS-Y, where 27.31% of trade volume involves NonMember Firms that also connect directly to ATSs. The lowest participation rate is on NYSE,
where 5.54% of trading involves Non-Member Firms that connect directly with ATSs. One of
the Non-Member Firms that connects directly with ATSs cannot be identified in exchange

157

OATS data suggests that Non-Member Firms do not supply off-exchange liquidity to
Member Firms outside of ATSs and the Commission believes that Non-Member Firms
rarely transact with each other outside of ATSs. See supra note 149.

158

See Section V.D.3 for discussion of SRO cross-monitoring capabilities.

159

The estimates include only Non-Member Firms that connect directly to at least one ATS
that reports Non-Member Firm MPIDs in OATS. Consequently, some Non-Member
Firms are not included in these estimates. Therefore, the estimates underestimate the
importance of Non-Member Firms to exchange-based activity in aggregate.

67

data. 160 The 13 Non-Member Firms that are observed trading on exchanges tend to trade across
the majority of exchanges represented in the exchange data sample. 161
The market for liquidity provision on equity exchanges is also competitive. For example,
Nasdaq-listed equities, for which the Commission has relevant data, 162 each had 13 to 80 market
makers registered to provide liquidity on Nasdaq as of December 2014. The median Nasdaqlisted equity had 36 registered market makers, and 95% of securities had 20 or more registered
market makers. Because Nasdaq is not the only exchange trading its listed equities, these
statistics underrepresent the number of firms in the market that provide liquidity in Nasdaq-listed
equities. Although the Commission does not have readily available data to count the number of
market makers in equities listed on other exchanges, the Commission preliminarily believes that
the figures for Nasdaq-listed equities illustrate the magnitude of market makers in equities more
generally. Additionally, the Commission notes that while the number of market makers
represents the number of firms in the business of providing liquidity, it does not necessarily
indicate whether each market maker is an active competitor. However, the Commission believes
that many market makers actively compete to provide liquidity. The Commission currently lacks
data to quantify the liquidity provision activity attributable to Non-Member Firms.

160

Data from off-exchange markets and exchanges is matched on a firm-name basis in this
analysis. It is possible that one firm that cannot be identified in the exchange data is
present under a name that is not readily linked to the firm name cited in the off-exchange
data.

2. Current Market Oversight
The surveillance and regulation of each broker-dealer is dependent upon its individual
SRO membership status. Each SRO that operates an exchange has responsibility for overseeing
trading that occurs on the exchange it operates. Because of this, SROs that operate an exchange
possess expertise in supervising members who specialize in trading the products and order types
that may be unique or specialized within the exchange. This expertise complements the
expertise of an Association in supervising cross-exchange and off-exchange trading activity. 163
Exchanges generally have not monitored trading that their members conduct on other venues.
Approximately 68 Non-Member Firm broker-dealers are members of a single exchange
that supervises their activity overall. Exchanges regulate trading by broker-dealers on their
exchange and generally may focus examinations on the financial and operational requirements
associated with their membership. These requirements share many commonalities across SROs,
such as net capital requirements and books and records requirements. Because many brokerdealers are members of multiple SROs with similar requirements, one SRO is appointed as the
broker-dealer’s DEA. 164

163

See Section I.B. discussing the requirement for SROs to examine for and enforce
compliance with the Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder.

164

A DEA is an SRO assigned by the SEC that has certain specific supervisory
responsibility for a broker-dealer. The DEA usually performs financial and operations
examination activities on behalf of all SROs of which the broker-dealer is a member,
although SROs may also allocate other regulatory responsibilities under Rule 17d-2. See
supra note 69. These examinations, however, do not generally extend to compliance with
trading rules imposed by other SROs; nor do they facilitate surveillance for activity
across market centers. DEAs therefore cannot substitute for the surveillance of crossmarket and off-exchange trading provided by an Association. See 17 CFR 240.17d-1.
FINRA serves as the DEA for the majority of Member Firms; there are exceptions,
mostly involving firms that have specialized business models that focus on a particular
exchange that is judged to be best situated to supervise the Member Firm’s activity.
These firms are, however, subject to the same supervision of their trading activity as
69

All registered broker-dealers are required to join an Association unless they comply with
Section 15(b)(8) of the Act or Rule 15b9-1. The vast majority of broker-dealers join an
Association and, since there is currently a single Association, with the exception of Non-Member
Firms, broker-dealers are subject to relatively uniform regulatory requirements and levels of
surveillance and supervision. The supervision by FINRA, which is currently the only
Association, is more robust than that of individual exchange SROs because its rule set addresses
its need to supervise a market that is fragmented across many trading venues and more opaque
than exchange trading. 165 Specifically, FINRA’s rule set has provisions related to business
conduct, financial condition and operation, and supervision that may differ materially from
exchange SRO rule sets. 166
The existing Association, FINRA, serves crucial functions in the current regulatory
structure. 167 FINRA has primary responsibility for overseeing off-exchange trading. 168
Furthermore, FINRA provides cross-market trading supervision of broker-dealers that the
exchanges currently are not well-positioned to provide in light of the statutory framework that
other Member Firms for whom FINRA does act as DEA. Under the proposed
amendments, Non-Member Firms that join FINRA may or may not be assigned to
FINRA for DEA supervision. A firm with a specialized business model focusing on a
single exchange with floor activity may be able to continue trading off-exchange under
the proposed floor member hedging exemption without joining FINRA.
165

Comprehensive reporting requirements for all Member Firms that trade off-exchange
give FINRA information on market activity levels and market conditions off-exchange.
Because most off-exchange venues do not disseminate information on the liquidity
available in their systems, comprehensive information from all participants is necessary
for FINRA to analyze and surveil the off-exchange market. See infra note 204 for a
discussion of the off-exchange trading environment; see also Section I.B. for a discussion
of the differing scope of exchange SRO and Association rule sets.

places responsibility for off-exchange trading with an Association. Exchanges generally do not
have a detailed set of member conduct rules and non-exchange-specific trading rules and have
limited access to data, 169 thus allowing such broker-dealers and their personnel to conduct
business under a less specific regulatory regime than FINRA members. On the other hand,
FINRA has sought to establish a robust regulatory regime for broker-dealers, including brokerdealers conducting business in the off-exchange market, and developed surveillance technology
and specialized regulatory personnel to provide surveillance, supervision, and enforcement of
activity occurring off-exchange. Consequently, the current regulatory structure achieves crossmarket and off-exchange supervision through the surveillance actions of FINRA and its
examination of its members.
Currently, Non-Member Firms transact heavily in the course of normal business activities
within venues regulated by SROs of which they are not members. This is very different from
when Rule 15b9-1 was first adopted. The Act provides for regulation of exchange trading by the
exchanges themselves; it further provides for supervision of off-exchange trading by an
Association. Although the Act provides a limited and targeted exception to Association
membership requirements for broker-dealers, its approach to effecting supervision is relatively
uniform: broker-dealers must be members of the SROs that regulate the venues upon which they
transact. For each trading venue, whether an exchange or the off-exchange market as a whole,
the responsible SRO (an exchange SRO or FINRA) is obligated and empowered to fulfill its
regulatory responsibilities through its authority to adopt rules, surveil the markets, examine its
members’ activities and bring enforcement actions when necessary. To the extent that the
current regulatory structure undermines this functional approach, the ability of SROs to fulfill
169

See supra note 76.

71

their responsibilities to protect investors and promote fair and orderly markets may be
compromised.
Comprehensive supervision of cross-market and off-exchange activity requires data on
off-exchange activity, but this data for Non-Member Firms is often not readily available to
regulators. 170 FINRA’s rules require that nearly all Member Firms report order audit trail data
daily. 171 This data records the origination, receipt, execution, routing, modification or
cancellation of every order a Member Firm handles, with limited exceptions for certain activities
including market-making. Additionally, FINRA currently has RSAs with most exchanges 172 that
provide FINRA with detailed data that often allow FINRA to comprehensively identify the
market-wide activity of broker-dealers, and to surveil behavior for violative activity that might
otherwise go undetected on an exchange-specific surveillance basis. However, a significant
amount of activity remains missing from FINRA’s existing audit trail data (OATS) because it
does not include the orders that otherwise would be reported by Non-Member Firms if they were
members, and does not identify executions as those of a broker-dealer. Non-Member Firm
activity that involves a Member Firm (such as an ATS order or an order routed through a
Member Firm) does appear in OATS, although the identity of the Non-Member Firm sending the

FINRA has RSAs with all exchanges operated by Intercontinental Exchange, NasdaqOMX, and BATS. Together, these exchanges accounted for 99.6% of exchange-based
share volume in Tape A, B, and C securities during October 2014, based on data
available on the BATS website. See

order is not required to be reported. 173 Furthermore, some off-exchange activity that does not
involve a Member Firm (and thus creates no OATS data record) may be entirely unsurveiled by
FINRA and possibly not subject to rules that were intended to universally govern off-exchange
activity. In particular, an off-exchange trade between two Non-Member Firms is not subject to
FINRA’s audit trail and trade reporting rules.
Because Non-Member Firms are not required to join an Association, they are not required
to pay the costs of Association membership, which could be significant, especially for NonMember Firms with substantial trading activity. FINRA members currently pay a TAF for all
equity sales transactions that are not performed in the firm’s capacity as a registered specialist or
market maker upon an exchange. The Commission estimates that the annual TAF associated
with ATS trading for some Non-Member Firms would be as high as $3.2 million per year. 174
Additionally, a substantial portion of Non-Member Firms’ exchange-based activity may be
subject to TAF as well. 175 These estimates of TAF have substantial uncertainty. As discussed
previously, the Commission believes that FINRA may need to consider revising its fee structure

173

FINRA has proposed amendments to its rules pertaining to identification of Non-Member
Firms in OATS data. See supra note 84.

174

TAF incurred for off-exchange activity for Non-Member firms would be unavoidable as
the fee is currently structured. FINRA assesses it directly on FINRA members. TAF is
discussed further in Section V.C.2.b.

175

Schedule A of the FINRA By-Laws outlines which transactions are subject to the TAF.
Generally, equity sales both on and off-exchange are subject to the TAF unless the
member is acting in the capacity of a specialist or market maker on the exchange where
the transaction was effected.

FINRA fee burden. 176
Furthermore, FINRA currently cannot assess Non-Member Firms Section 3 fees for offexchange trading. The Section 3 fee is the second of two primary FINRA fees (the other being
TAF) that are assessed upon each off-exchange sale by or through a FINRA member. Under
Section 31 of the Act, 177 SROs must pay transaction fees based on the volume of their covered
sales. These fees are designed to offset the costs of regulation incurred by the government—
including the Commission—for supervising and regulating the securities markets and securities
professionals. FINRA obtains money to pay its Section 31 fees from its membership, in
accordance with Section 3 of Schedule A to the FINRA By-Laws. FINRA assesses these Section
3 fees on the sell side of each off-exchange trade, when possible. When the sell side of an offexchange transaction is a Non-Member Firm and the seller engages the services of a clearing
broker that is a Member Firm, FINRA can assess the Section 3 fee against the Member Firm
clearing broker. 178 When the seller is a Non-Member Firm that self-clears, FINRA has no
authority to assess the Section 3 fee against the seller. In such case, FINRA will seek to assess
the fee against the buyer, if the buyer includes a Member Firm counterparty or a Member Firm
acting as clearing broker for a Non-Member Firm buy side counterparty. Given that any firm
that carries customer accounts is required to be a member of an Association, firms that represent
the trading of the investing public may bear the fees that would be otherwise assigned to Non-

176

See supra note 95. Under the current TAF schedule, Member Firms may realize some
cost savings because they would no longer be assessed TAF when they buy shares from a
Non-Member Firm off-exchange. This is discussed further in Section V.B.3.

178

The seller’s clearing broker may pass that fee on to the Non-Member Firm.

74

Member Firms trading proprietarily in the off-exchange market. These costs may be passed on
to the investing public in whole or in part. Regardless of who ultimately bears the Section 3 fees,
these Non-Member Firms may face lower off-exchange trading costs than Member Firms due to
the allocation of these fees.
B. Broad Economic Considerations, Including Effects on Efficiency,
Competition and Capital Formation
As discussed above, the Commission is proposing amendments to Rule 15b9-1 to address
the off-exchange trading activity that may not currently be subject to effective regulatory
oversight that has developed with the advent of cross-market proprietary trading. In addition to
the specific, individual benefits and costs discussed below, the Commission expects the proposed
amendments to have several broad economic effects, including effects on efficiency,
competition, and capital formation. These effects are described in this section.
1. Effects on Regulatory Supervision
Non-Member Firms are significant contributors to off-exchange order and trade activity,
yet are not under the jurisdiction of an Association that supervises off-exchange trading activity.
The Commission preliminarily believes the current exemption of Non-Member Firms from
Association membership undermines the effectiveness of regulatory supervision. For example,
reliance by Non-Member Firms on the Rule 15b9-1 exemption leaves FINRA charged with
responsibility for the off-exchange market without jurisdiction over broker-dealers that conduct a
substantial amount of off-exchange trading activity. It also undermines the ability of an
Association to apply a consistent set of conduct, supervisory, and other rules to off-exchange

75

market participants, and to effectively surveil the trading activity of broker-dealers with a
significant presence in the off-exchange market. 179
As discussed further below, the Commission believes the proposed amendments will
have a beneficial effect on the efficiency of regulation of the equity markets. 180 In particular,
some broker-dealers are currently overseen by individual exchanges, which are not wellpositioned to oversee the off-exchange and cross-market activity of the broker-dealer. Under the
proposal, these broker-dealers would be supervised by an Association that has this expertise.
This improvement in regulatory oversight of the off-exchange market should achieve more
uniform and effective regulatory supervision of off-exchange and cross-exchange trading
practices by broker-dealers.
The Commission is aware that some of the 125 Non-Member Firms trade primarily on a
single exchange in a floor-based capacity. For these firms, especially those with specialized
business models that operate primarily on one exchange, their current exchange (not an
Association) may be best equipped to provide efficient supervision. The Commission believes
that many of these firms will not need to join an Association to comply with the proposed
amendments.
2. Firm Response and Effect on Market Activity
Although Non-Member Firms could seek to comply with the proposed amendments in
multiple ways, each route could involve changes to firms’ business models. Some Non-Member
Firms limit their trading to exchanges of which they are members, and the Commission believes
they do not trade off-exchange other than to hedge positions gained through floor broker activity.

179

See supra notes 91-94 and accompanying text.

180

See Section V.C.1.

76

These firms will remain exempt from the requirement to become a member of an Association, if
they comply with the Rule as proposed to be amended. 181 Other firms will no longer be exempt,
and will need to take action to comply with the amended rule. Under the revised Rule, a NonMember Firm that trades off-exchange, or upon exchanges of which it is not a member, can
comply in four ways. The first option would be to join an Association. This option does not
require the Non-Member Firm to restrict its current trading practices beyond those necessary to
comply with the rules of FINRA. The second option would be to join all exchanges upon which
the Non-Member Firm wishes to trade, and to cease any off-exchange trading, other than offexchange trading consistent with the floor-broker hedging exemption. Third, a Non-Member
Firm could comply by trading solely upon those exchanges of which it is already a member,
consistent with the statutory exception in Section 15(b)(8). 182 Finally, a Non-Member Firm
could cease trading equity securities.
The changes Non-Member Firms make to their business model in order to comply with
the amendments may affect competition in the market for off-exchange liquidity provision. In
particular, Non-Member Firms may be less willing to compete to provide liquidity off-exchange,
decreasing off-exchange liquidity. For example, Non-Member Firms may choose to cease their
off-exchange activity rather than join an Association – although it seems likely that firms that
trade heavily in the off-exchange market may find it less costly to join an Association. 183 In
181

Changes to the exclusion for proprietary trading are discussed in Section II.C. Changes
to the proposed floor member hedging exemption are discussed in Section II.D.

182

15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8).

183

Firms that do not connect directly may trade on ATSs through a Member Firm at much
lower activity levels. For firms with very limited off-exchange activity, ceasing offexchange activity is likely to be less costly than joining an Association. The costs of
joining FINRA are discussed in detail in Section V.C.2; for firms with very limited offexchange activity, it is unlikely that the profits generated from this activity would offset
77

addition, Non-Member Firms that choose to join an Association may reduce their off-exchange
trading because joining an Association would increase variable costs to trade in the off-exchange
market, as these trades will incur TAF and possibly additional Section 3 fees. 184 An increase in
cost would reduce the profitability of off-exchange trading and thus potentially reduce offexchange trading.
The removal of this liquidity could either improve or degrade execution quality on
ATSs. 185 To the extent that institutional investors transacting in ATSs are seeking institutional
investor counterparties that are not proprietary trading firms for their transactions, the removal of
Non-Member Firm liquidity may be seen by some institutional investors as improving liquidity
quality within ATSs. 186 It is also possible that reducing the activity of Non-Member Firms

FINRA membership costs. However, for firms that generate profits from off-exchange
activities that exceed FINRA membership costs, it may be less costly for these firms to
join FINRA than to cease their off-exchange activity. Firms with very low ATS activity
are unlikely to directly connect to an ATS, instead accessing ATSs through a Member
Firm.
The Commission is unaware of any Non-Member Firms operating single dealer platforms
upon which such firms could provide liquidity to orders routed by Member Firms outside
of an ATS.
184

As previously noted, FINRA may need to consider reevaluating the structure of the TAF
to assure that it appropriately takes into account the business model of certain NonMember Firms that may join FINRA as a result of the proposed amendments. See supra
note 95. The Commission’s analysis of TAF is based on current TAF structure as
outlined in the FINRA By-Laws, Schedule A. TAF and Section 3 fees are discussed
further in Section V.C.2.b. Firms will also face additional fixed costs both to establish
and maintain Association membership; those costs are discussed in Section V.C.2.

185

Non-Member Firms are likely to also reduce their off-exchange trading outside of ATSs,
such as on single-dealer platforms. However, Non-Member Firms can only take (not
make) liquidity on these platforms. It is possible that additional off-exchange liquidity
may be available outside of ATSs as a result of the proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1
due to a reduction in Non-Member Firm trading on single dealer platforms.

186

Industry white papers sometimes discuss the concept of natural counterparties for
institutional trades. These papers may explicitly or implicitly identify proprietary
automated trading firms as sources of information leakage in dark pools. See e.g., Mittal,
78

within ATSs may result in more ATS liquidity, if Non-Member Firms are acting as net takers of
liquidity within these systems. 187 Regardless, liquidity levels in ATSs may change. In addition,
these firms may reduce their off-exchange trading outside of ATSs such as on single-dealer
platforms. It is possible that this will result in a transfer of volume from off-exchange venues to
exchanges, but it is also possible that overall market trading volume will diminish if decreased
volume from off-exchange trading does not migrate to exchanges.
Changes in business models for Non-Member Firms may affect market quality on
exchanges as well. In addition to trading extensively in the off-exchange market, many NonMember Firms are among the most active participants on exchanges. Business model changes
by these firms may lead to less exchange liquidity for several reasons. First, Non-Member Firms
that choose not to join an Association would no longer be able to rely on the rule and trade

187

There is some evidence that proprietary electronic trading firms are net takers of liquidity
in equity markets, although the evidence is not conclusive. Using NASDAQ data from
2008-2010, Carrion estimates that these firms supply liquidity to 41.2% of trading dollar
volume and take liquidity in 42.2% of trading dollar volume. See Carrion, Al, 2013,
“Very fast money: High-frequency trading on the NASDAQ,” Journal of Financial
Markets 16, 680-711. Al Carrion currently serves as an Economic Fellow within the
Division of Economic and Risk Analysis. Another study finds that electronic trading
firms act as net liquidity suppliers during periods of extreme price movements. See
Brogaard, Moyaert, Riordan, Shkilko and Sokolov, 2015, “High Frequency Trading and
Extreme Price Movements,” working paper.

79

indirectly on exchanges of which they are not members. 188 Second, Non-Member Firms that do
not join an Association would no longer be able to access off-exchange liquidity to unwind
positions acquired on exchanges, except as outlined in the floor member hedging exemption.
This may reduce their willingness to provide liquidity upon exchanges. 189 Third, Non-Member
Firms that choose to join an Association may be subject to additional variable costs (primarily
regulatory fees) on their exchange-based trading as well as on their off-exchange trading. 190
These firms may respond by trading less actively on exchanges. Finally, Non-Member Firms
may choose to cease trading equity securities rather than join an Association or change their
business models. Reduced liquidity upon exchanges can result in higher spreads and increased
volatility. Increased spreads on exchanges can lead to increased costs for off-exchange investors
as well as investors transacting on exchanges, because most off-exchange transactions (including
many retail executions) are derivatively priced with reference to prevailing exchange prices.
The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments are not likely to
have an economically meaningful effect on direct capital formation (the assignment of financial
resources to meet the funding requirements of a profitable capital project, in this case, the
provision of liquidity to financial markets). However, the Commission believes that the changes

188

Currently, a Non-Member Firm can indirectly access an exchange of which it is not a
member through a firm that is an exchange member. In light of the proposed elimination
of the exclusion for proprietary trading, this activity would not be consistent with the
proposed amendments, unless the floor member hedging exemption or Regulation NMS
routing exemption applies.

189

These firms could unwind positions on other exchanges, but the cost to do so may be
higher than if all liquidity, including off-exchange liquidity, were available.

190

It is possible Non-Member Firms that choose to join an Association may avoid some
additional costs by registering as market makers on additional venues, mitigating these
charges. Furthermore, they may see a reduction in fees that were formerly paid to their
DEA if FINRA assumes that role.

80

in allocation of regulatory fees and more efficient supervision within the off-exchange market
may result in improved efficiency of capital allocation by the financial industry. Currently, NonMember Firms face lower regulatory costs and a lower degree of regulatory scrutiny of their offexchange trading activity than Member Firms. While the Commission believes that this imposes
certain costs on other market intermediaries and the investors they represent, there is another
externality as well: over-commitment of liquidity both to exchanges and the off-exchange
market. 191 This over-commitment is likely to have some positive effects on capital markets, such
as lower quoted spreads on exchanges. In addition to lowering immediate execution costs on
exchanges, lower exchange quoted spreads are likely to reduce transaction costs off-exchange as
well, because off-exchange trades are typically priced with reference to quoted exchange prices.
Adoption of the proposed amendments may reduce the capital commitment of Non-Member
Firms to equity market liquidity provision. It is possible that in response current Member Firms
may choose to commit additional capital to liquidity provision when the trading environment has
more uniform regulatory requirements. These reallocations of capital may improve or degrade
levels of liquidity, spreads and volatility measures on exchanges and within the off-exchange
market.
The magnitude of these competitive effects is impossible for the Commission to
determine at this time for a number of reasons. First, these effects involve strategic decisions by
Non-Member Firms that the Commission cannot predict, and a competitive response that the
Commission lacks information to anticipate. Second, even if the Commission could predict the
likely changes in capital commitment by market participants, the Commission lacks information
on how capital commitment by financial firms maps into market quality measures such as
191

There is likely to be a corresponding underinvestment of capital somewhere else.

81

spreads, levels of liquidity, and execution costs. 192 Due to the complexity of the economic
relationship between capital commitment and market quality measures, and inadequate
information on individual firm’s strategies, cost structures and likely competitive responses, the
Commission cannot estimate the likely magnitude of these effects.
3. Competition to Provide Liquidity Is Distorted by Regulatory Costs Borne
by Only a Subset of Competitors, Member Firms
Currently, Member Firms bear a number of costs not borne by Non-Member Firms
including a number of regulatory fees and indirect costs that are assessed or imposed upon
Member Firms. These costs include direct costs such as trading fees that are either assigned only
to Member Firms, such as TAF, or in the case of Section 3 fees, Member Firms may be assigned
costs that potentially could be assigned to Non-Member Firms selling securities off-exchange.
There are indirect costs of disparate regulatory regimes as well. For example, Member Firms
bear costs of interacting with regulators to accommodate supervision, and must comply with the
rules of an Association as well as rules adopted by the Commission. This inequality in
regulatory requirements may distort competitive forces in the market and these potential
distortions may be mitigated by the proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1, to the extent that
Non-Member Firms join an Association and subject themselves to comparable fees and
regulatory costs imposed on all other Member Firms.

192

The Commission has considered whether it is possible to model this response using
current data to estimate these effects. Even if CAT data were available today, the
Commission believes it would not have sufficient information for this estimation because
information on the daily and perhaps intra-day change in committed capital levels is not
available. Although the Commission has quarterly data on the net capital of brokerdealers, broker-dealers do not commit all of this capital to liquidity provision in equity
markets. Furthermore, on a daily or more frequent basis, a liquidity provider may choose
to fully or partially withdraw from the market for any reason.

82

The existing differential regulatory burden of Member Firms and Non-Member Firms
may have consequences with respect to market quality both for exchange-based and offexchange trading. For example, because Non-Member Firms, ceteris paribus, currently face
lower variable costs of trading compared to Member Firms, Non-Member Firms may be able to
provide liquidity at a lower cost than Member Firms. Because a low-cost competitor may be
able to quote at a price superior to that of his competitors, investors may incur lower transaction
costs than if Non-Member Firms faced the same costs as Member Firms. It may also reduce
direct execution costs (such as quoted and effective spreads) for both exchange and off-exchange
trades, the latter of which are normally derivatively priced with reference to prevailing exchange
quotes. The differential regulatory burden, however, may also reduce depth at best prices
because a Member Firm may not be able to trade profitably at a price established by a NonMember Firm that faces lower regulatory costs. Lower liquidity at best exchange prices implies
greater price effect of trades, which may increase trading costs, particularly for large orders. For
example, if the best price on an exchange is associated with 100 shares of depth, a 200 share
order will exhaust depth at the best price and the second 100 share lot will execute at an inferior
price. 193 If depth at best price tends to be larger, it is less likely that an order will exceed the
depth available at the best price. The change in best price associated with an execution that
exhausts the depth available at the best price is the price effect of the trade upon the exchange.
Because the Commission does not have access to consolidated audit trail data, the Commission
lacks data to quantify the percent of inside depth provided by Non-Member Firms and the
frequency with which only Non-Member Firms are quoting the best price on an exchange.
193

This assumes no hidden depth at the best price. If non-displayed depth is present at the
best price, the remaining 100 shares will be filled at the best price if at least 100 shares of
hidden depth exists at the best price.

83

However, the high participation rate of Non-Member Firms in exchange trading suggests they
provide a significant fraction of exchange liquidity. 194
4. Competitive Effects on Off-Exchange Market Regulation
Currently, FINRA is the only Association. It is possible, however, for new Associations
to enter the regulatory oversight market and compete with FINRA. The proposed amendments
to Rule 15b9-1 may create incentives for a new Association (or Associations) to form. The large
Non-Member Firms have commonalities in business models, for example, they typically do not
carry customer accounts. They may consider joining an Association concurrently. Because
these firms collectively conduct a significant portion of off-exchange volume, the creation of an
Association tailored to these firms may be economically viable.
To be registered as an Association, in addition to requirements that parallel the
requirements to be a national securities exchange, an Association must “[b]y reason of the
number and geographical distribution of its members and the scope of their transactions” be able
to carry out the purposes of Section 15A. 195 Additionally, for example, the Association must
permit any registered broker-dealer that meets the Association’s qualification standards to
become a member, 196 and it must have rules regarding the form and content of quotations
relating to securities sold otherwise than on a national securities exchange that are designed to
produce fair and informative quotations, to prevent fictitious or misleading quotations, and to
194

Participation rates of Non-Member Firms in exchange trading are discussed more fully in
Section V.A.1.

195

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3.

196

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(3). Section 15A of the Exchange Act specifically states that an
Association shall not be registered as a national securities association unless the
Commission determines, among other things, that “(3)…the rules of the association
provide that any registered broker or dealer may become a member of such association
and any person may become associated with a member thereof.”

84

promote orderly procedures for collecting, distributing and publishing quotations. 197 The
Association must also be so organized and have the capacity to enforce compliance by its
members and persons associated with its members with, among other things, its own rules and
the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 198
The ability to form an Association is characterized by barriers to entry. A new
Association would likely incur significant fixed costs to create the infrastructure needed to
perform the surveillance and oversight requirements imposed on Associations by statute and
regulation. It may also incur substantial costs, including personnel, training, travel, and other
costs to provide for an effective surveillance and supervision of the off-exchange market.
Indeed, as previously discussed, the only existing Association, FINRA, has resources and
demonstrated expertise that enable it to surveil and supervise the off-exchange market.
Duplication of that infrastructure could be costly for a new Association.
The proposed amendments may alter barriers to entry and thus affect the potential for
competition among regulators of off-exchange markets. Currently the primary barrier to entry is
the high fixed-cost involved in forming and operating an Association. If adopted, the
amendments would bring nearly all off-exchange trading under the jurisdiction of an
Association, including the trading of firms that currently are not members of an Association
(Non-Member Firms). If these firms join the only existing Association, FINRA, an Association
newly formed after this point may have increased difficulty attracting the members needed to
support the high fixed-costs associated with forming an Association because every broker-dealer
that participates in the off-exchange market would already be a FINRA member. This increased
197

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(11).

198

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(2).

85

difficulty results because many firms may be reluctant to change Associations, either because of
the costs to change compliance infrastructures or uncertainty in the regulatory environment of
the new Association. Thus, if the proposal results in more firms becoming members of the
existing Association, a new Association could face increased difficulties attracting members in
the future.
The proposed amendments do, however, temporarily lower the barriers to entry for a
competing Association. If these amendments are adopted, a number of firms with similar
business models and substantial off-exchange volume could contemplate Association
membership concurrently. This may provide the incentive to create and tailor a new Association
to specific business models of these firms. If a competing Association limited the scope of its
members or operations, it might not have to duplicate all of the surveillance and supervision
functions required to be provided by an Association that does not have those limits. This may
lower the costs of forming an Association and alter the barriers to entry. 199
The existence of multiple Associations might provide benefits to the market as a whole.
If a new Association could provide high quality services to members with a lower fee structure,
all Associations would have incentives to reduce fees to attract members. This could result in
cost savings to broker-dealers. Second, a new Association could innovate to develop different
surveillance and supervision methods that could be more efficient than FINRA’s methods.
Competition among Associations could also entail substantial costs. If a new Association
were to form, the necessary regulatory infrastructure including Information Technology (“IT”)
systems and personnel would need to be duplicated in the new Association. If the market for

199

Some limitations on Association membership or operations would require exemptive
relief for the Association to register with the Commission.

86

Associations is characterized by economies of scale, aggregate costs for the same level of
regulation would be higher in a market with two Associations than in a market with a single
Association. These additional costs would ultimately be borne by Associations’ broker-dealer
members. Second, Associations might compete on the basis of providing “light touch”
regulation, in essence surveiling less and providing less supervision. As a result, the quality of
market supervision might decrease, although the Commission does itself oversee self-regulatory
organizations, such as Associations, and accordingly, would not permit a “race to the bottom.” 200
C. Consideration of Costs and Benefits
This section discusses costs and benefits of the proposed amendments. While the
Commission has attempted, where possible, to provide estimated quantifiable ranges, both costs
and benefits are difficult to quantify for this proposal for a number of reasons. First, market
participants are heterogeneous in their type, existing exchange memberships, and activity level in
the off-exchange market. Consequently, compliance costs will vary across firms in a number of
dimensions. Second, estimating costs is complicated by the fact that Non-Member Firms can
comply with the proposal in a number of ways, and presumably each will choose to seek
compliance in the manner that minimizes the sum of its direct costs (related to joining and
maintaining memberships in additional SROs) and indirect costs (which include forgone
opportunities to trade profitably and costs associated with revising business strategies).
Furthermore, some firms are likely to remain exempt upon adoption of the proposed
amendments, but the Commission lacks data to identify those firms with certainty. 201 At the

200

See Section 19(g) and Section 19(h) of the Exchange Act.

201

Non-Member Firms that provide liquidity on multiple exchanges and trade heavily offexchange are unlikely to be small in terms of net capital, and are not low trading volume
firms by definition. However, as discussed in Section V.A.1, many Non-Member Firms
87

other end of the spectrum, the minority of Non-Member Firms that are large and contribute
significantly to both exchange and off-exchange trading are unlikely to remain exempt. 202 For
the 14 large firms that connect directly to ATSs, the Commission believes that all will lose their
exempt status, but cannot predict how those firms will seek to comply with the proposed
amendments. The Commission is unable to more precisely quantify the number of Non-Member
Firms that will lose their exemption from Association membership upon adoption of the
proposed amendments because it is unable to estimate the level of off-exchange trading for the
majority of the 125 Non-Member Firms. OATS reporting rules do not require Member Firms to
disclose the identities of broker-dealers that submit orders to a Member Firm, making it
infeasible to more precisely estimate non-ATS off-exchange trading for Non-Member Firms.
Quantifying costs is further complicated because Non-Member Firms do not report order
audit trail data. It is difficult to measure the trading of individual firms, although their activity as
a group is observable within audit trail data. Consequently, the Commission can measure the
approximate overall contribution of Non-Member Firms to off-exchange volume, but cannot
fully partition that volume across Non-Member Firms.
Some firms with substantial off-exchange trading activity may choose to change their
business models rather than join an Association. If such firms ceased off-exchange activity, they
would remain outside the supervision of an Association, and their decision to change business
models may affect market quality both on and off-exchange. The Commission does not have
are small in terms of net capital and may be members of a single exchange. Such firms
are more likely to have a floor-brokerage business model, or have limited exposure to
off-exchange markets. Such firms would either be exempt from the rule by virtue of
having no off-exchange trading or no trading on exchanges of which they are not
members, or be able to rely on the floor member hedging exemption to continue their
limited off-exchange trading related to floor brokerage activities.
202

The diversity of Non-Member Firms is discussed in Section V.A.1.

88

ready access to statistics on the liquidity provision of Non-Member Firms on and off exchanges.
As such, the Commission cannot quantify the potential changes in transaction costs, even under
broad assumptions about how Non-Member Firms will change their business models. This is
discussed further in Section V.B.2.
The overall benefits of the proposed amendments relate to more comprehensive and
uniform surveillance of off-exchange activity by the regulator best positioned to oversee such
activity. The benefits the Commission anticipates from the amendments are largely qualitative
and by their nature difficult to measure.
1. Benefits
As discussed above, 203 some of the firms using the existing Rule 15b9-1 exemption are
significant participants in overall off-exchange market volume. Thus, a substantial share of offexchange volume is conducted outside of the regulatory jurisdiction of an Association that has
primary responsibility for overseeing off-exchange activity. Association membership would
supplement the oversight of the exchanges, which typically do not examine the off-exchange
activity of their members. This would further assist the Commission in obtaining a more
complete picture of the activity that occurs on ATSs and elsewhere in the off-exchange market
by entities that are not currently members of an Association. Investors and intermediaries
benefit when a specialized expert regulates and oversees the off-exchange market. 204 Investors

203

See Section I.

204

The off-exchange market is diverse and less transparent than exchanges. An exchange
typically has a single matching engine for a given security and a limited number of order
types that interact to create transactions while disseminating quote information publicly.
The off-exchange market encompasses over 40 ATS matching engines while more than
half of off-exchange volume occurs outside of ATSs with transactions reported by more
than 200 market participants. Only a few of these ATS venues disseminate quote
information. Surveillance and oversight of the off-exchange market requires proprietary
89

participating in the off-exchange market currently do not fully realize the benefits of such
expertise and regulatory oversight.
As discussed above, 205 the Commission preliminarily believes the inclusion of more NonMember Firms in an Association would improve such Association’s ability to supervise crossexchange trading activity. This would enhance regulators’ ability and—through the information
FINRA shares with the Commission—the Commission’s ability to effectively oversee regulation
of trading on multiple markets and of financial products.
The Commission also preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments to Rule 15b91 would improve supervision of Non-Member Firms. FINRA, currently the only Association,
has substantial experience and expertise from overseeing a large number of broker-dealers. This
makes FINRA’s potential regulation of Non-Member Firms with off-exchange or cross-market
trading activity particularly efficient.
The Commission preliminarily believes that this proposal provides significant benefits
even in the event that the Commission approves the CAT NMS Plan. 206 The CAT eventually
may address the regulatory audit trail data deficiencies discussed previously, 207 but the CAT will
not address FINRA’s lack of jurisdiction over Non-Member Firms participating in the off-

data from thousands of market participants, and regulatory personnel with knowledge of
the institutional detail of the workings of dozens of trading venues. At present, only
FINRA possesses those resources. Further detail on off-exchange market trading is

exchange markets, which FINRA is charged with overseeing, and the need for that enhanced
oversight.
While current members of an Association would not be directly affected by this rule, they
would benefit by having a more level playing field in terms of their regulatory requirements
relative to Non-Member Firms. Currently, competition in liquidity provision in equity markets is
distorted by inequalities in regulatory requirements. 208 With more uniform regulatory
requirements and oversight, firms may compete more equitably to supply liquidity both on
exchanges and off-exchange.
2. Costs
The proposed amendments, by narrowing the existing exemption, would result in brokerdealers that no longer qualify for the exemption having to comply with Section 15(b)(8) by either
limiting their trading to exchanges of which they are members or joining an Association. Under
the proposed amendments, therefore, Non-Member Firms that choose to continue any offexchange activity will be faced with choices that would involve corresponding costs. For
example, Non-Member Firms may incur costs related to membership in an Association or costs
necessitated by additional exchange memberships. Additionally, some Non-Member Firms may
incur the costs of losing the benefits of trading in the off-exchange market if they decide not to
join an Association.
Most of the costs incurred in joining an Association and maintaining membership therein
are dependent on firm characteristics and activity level. Furthermore, the Commission believes
that some Non-Member Firms may comply by ceasing their off-exchange trading activity,
avoiding many of these costs but forgoing the opportunity to trade profitably in some venues.
208

See Section V.B.3.

91

With certain assumptions, the Commission has attempted to estimate direct compliance costs that
a Non-Member Firm is likely to face to comply with the proposed amendments. The estimate
applies to the 14 Non-Member Firms that connect directly to ATSs; smaller firms that choose to
join an Association should face lower costs because they have less revenue and trading volume
that would be subject to GIA, TAF and Section 3 fees. The 14 Non-Member Firms that connect
directly to ATSs, assuming that trading volumes and gross income levels remain unchanged,
would face implementation costs of approximately $3.3 million per firm, with ongoing annual
costs ranging from about $2.3 million to $23 million depending on the firms’ off-exchange
trading volume. 209 Cost estimates (one time and annual) are broken down in the following tables
and are discussed in detail below:
Table 1: Median or Average Firm Implementation Costs
Median or Average 210

Cost

FINRA

$7,500

209

The largest contributor to the estimate of implementation and ongoing costs is the cost of
OATS reporting. Estimates for OATS reporting costs are taken from the CAT NMS Plan
and relate to implementing CAT reporting, which is expected to be more complex and
have more stringent requirements related to technology, such as more stringent clock
synchronization, than OATS reporting requires. Consequently, the Commission believes
these likely are overestimates of actual costs firms will face to implement OATS
reporting. See infra note 221 for further information on CAT NMS Plan cost estimates.
Each of the 14 firms is assumed to have implementation costs of $3,160,000 to initiate
OATS reporting, $82,500 in legal consulting costs, and an application fee ranging from
$7,500 to $12,500 depending on the number of registered persons. The Commission
derived these estimates from the CAT NMS Plan. See infra note 221 and accompanying
text for qualifiers on these estimates.

210

Medians are used where possible. For OATS-related costs, median values are zero, so
averages are used. This data is discussed further in note 219, infra. Cost estimates are
reported as ranges for legal consulting and compliance work; for these estimates, the
midpoint is used.

If all 14 of those Non-Member Firms that connect directly to ATSs were to join FINRA,
the aggregate cost of the proposal for these firms would be $42.5 million in implementation costs
and ongoing aggregate annual costs of $85.2 million, with the majority of the costs related to
implementing OATS reporting. 212 While the Commission is unable to aggregate the costs of the
proposal for the remaining 111 firms, the Commission believes that the aggregate costs for the
211

TAF is underestimated because it accounts for only ATS volume. See infra note 231 and
accompanying text. This TAF cost also represents a transfer from current Non-Member
Firms to current Member Firms. The Section 3 fee estimate assumes that the firms
currently pay no Section 3 fees. It is likely that firms that clear through a Member Firm
are currently assessed these fees indirectly.

212

See supra note 209 and infra note 221 related to OATS reporting costs derived from the
CAT NMS Plan. The total cost calculation assumes range midpoint costs for FINRA
application, legal consulting, and compliance work, as well as maximum costs for
implementation of OATS reporting. GIA, TAF, and Section 3 fees are calculated using
firm share and dollar volume activity estimates from FINRA data discussed further in
Section V.A.1.

93

subset of 14 represent the majority of the aggregate costs, even assuming that all 125 firms will
join FINRA. 213
a. Costs of Joining an Association 214
Based on discussions with FINRA, currently the only Association, and industry
participants, the Commission preliminarily believes that the direct compliance costs on NonMember Firms of joining FINRA are composed of the FINRA membership application fees,
costs associated with adapting IT infrastructure for regulatory data reporting requirements, and
any legal or consulting costs necessary for effectively completing the application to be a member
of FINRA (e.g., ensuring compliance with FINRA rules including drafting policies and
procedures as may be required).
The fees associated with a FINRA membership application can vary. As an initial matter,
the application fee to join FINRA is tier-based according to the number of registered persons
associated with the applicant. This one-time application fee ranges from $7,500 to $55,000. 215
213

The data provided to the Commission by FINRA describes the aggregate ATS activity
level of all 125 Non-Member firms. Further firm-level data for the 14 firms that directly
connect to ATSs can be inferred using exchange MPIDs that are reported by some ATSs.
Because these 14 direct-connecting firms account for the majority of Non-Member Firm
ATS activity, the Commission believes that the 111 remaining firms have much lower
ATS (and presumably other off-exchange) activity levels. Since transacted volume is the
primary driver of the variation in costs across firms that join FINRA, the Commission
believes that the remaining 111 firms will face far lower costs if they choose to join
FINRA.

214

The Commission recognizes that Non-Member Firms would incur compliance costs on
an initial and ongoing basis to comply with the proposed amendments. See Section
V.C.2.a. The Commission does not aggregate these costs across all Non-Member Firms
because the Commission does not have necessary information about the majority of the
Non-Member Firms and expects that costs would vary widely across firms. Where
possible, however, the Commission has provided estimates based on a subset of large
firms on which the Commission has sufficient information. The Commission expects
that smaller firms likely will face lower costs.

215

See FINRA By-Laws, Schedule A, Section 4.
94

The initial membership fee for FINRA is $7,500 for firms with ten or fewer representatives
registered with FINRA and $12,500 for firms with eleven to one hundred representatives
registered with FINRA. 216 Based on its knowledge of the size and business models of NonMember Firms, the Commission preliminarily believes that most Non-Member Firms would not
incur FINRA application fees exceeding $12,500. 217
Because most FINRA members have OATS reporting obligations, Non-Member Firms
that choose to join FINRA will incur costs related to initiating and maintaining data reporting. 218
Costs to initiate and maintain OATS reporting 219 will vary widely among firms, depending on
many factors including current IT infrastructure, complexity, and affiliation with a firm that
already reports OATS data. While we are unable to quantify these costs precisely, one point of
reference for the possible costs associated with OATS reporting obligations is the CAT NMS
Plan, that provides estimates of these costs for reporting CAT data. There are limitations,
however, to those estimates in this context in that CAT is an order audit system that will be
significantly more complex and larger in scope than OATS. 220 Because the projected scope of

Based on current FOCUS data, the Commission believes no Non-Member Firm has more

See FINRA Rule 7400 Series – Order Audit Trail System.

219

Pursuant to Rule 613 under the Exchange Act, the SROs have submitted a plan to
eliminate existing rules and systems that will be rendered duplicative by the CAT. 17
CFR 242.613(a)(1)(ix). To the extent that OATS is rendered duplicative by CAT, the
CAT NMS Plan proposes its elimination, and the Commission approves the CAT NMS
Plan, the OATS system may eventually be eliminated. If this occurs, the costs of OATS
reporting to Non-Member Firms may cease, but may be supplanted by other costs related
to order and transaction reporting requirements under the CAT NMS Plan.

220

The CAT NMS Plan proposal discusses OATS reporting requirement. These
requirements include having revenue of less than two million dollars. The Commission
believes that large Non-Member Firms would not qualify for OATS reporting
exemptions, were the Commission to approve the CAT NMS Plan as submitted on
95

CAT exceeds substantially the scope of OATS reporting, and implementation of CAT reporting
is expected to include technical requirements such as more stringent clock synchronization
requirements than OATS, the Commission believes these estimates provide (at best) an upperbound for OATS reporting costs. Furthermore, Non-Member Firms that are members of
NASDAQ or NYSE are already required to produce OATS data and report it to FINRA upon
request. Consequently, implementation costs likely overstate the costs these firms would face in
initiating OATS reporting because the Non-Member Firms may have already established some of
the necessary infrastructure. In addition, the Commission recognizes that the CAT NMS Plan
estimates are based on voluntary survey responses by a small number of broker-dealers. Finally,
the CAT NMS Plan has not yet been published for comment. Nevertheless, the Commission
believes that those estimates give a sense of the potential magnitude of initiating OATS
reporting.
The CAT NMS Plan details cost estimates for two types of broker-dealers. The first type
already reports OATS data; the second type does not. The Commission focuses on costs for
large firms that do not currently report OATS data. In these estimates, the average large firm
estimated CAT implementation costs are approximately $3,160,000; average implementation
costs for a small firm are estimated at approximately $131,200. The average large firm
estimated annual CAT reporting costs are $3,160,000 annually; average small firm reporting
costs are $121,200. 221 As discussed previously, these are, at best, upper-bounds on OATS

Costs estimates are the sum of hardware/software costs, full time employee costs, and
third party/outsourcing costs for firms that do not currently report to OATS. Within these
firms, median implementation and annual ongoing costs were estimated at zero. The

reporting costs because of differences in complexity and technical requirements for OATS and
CAT reporting.
In addition to the application fees and data reporting costs, the Commission has taken
into account the cost of legal and other advising necessary for effectively completing the
application to be a member of FINRA. Some firms may choose to perform this legal work
internally while others may use outside counsel for the initial membership application. In
making this choice, Non-Member Firms will likely take into account factors, such as the size and
resources of the firm, the complexity of the firm’s business model, and whether the firm
previously used outside counsel to register with any exchanges. Based on conversations with
industry participants that assist with FINRA membership, for Non-Member Firms that choose to
employ outside counsel to assist with their FINRA membership application, the cost of such
counseling ranges from approximately $40,000 to $125,000. Factors affecting the specific costs
of a particular firm include the number of associated persons, the level of complexity or
uniqueness of the firm’s business plan, and whether the firm has previously completed exchange
membership applications with similar requirements.
b. Costs of Maintaining an Association Membership
With respect to ongoing costs, the Commission preliminarily believes that the three
components of such costs are any ongoing fees associated with FINRA membership, costs of
CAT NMS plan discusses interpretation of the zero medians, saying “It is the
participants’ understanding that this is likely due to current operational practices among
broker-dealers that do not differentiate between technology and headcount costs that
support business functionality and regulatory reporting.” Consequently, the Commission
believes these estimates do not reflect the opportunity costs associated with assigning
employees to regulatory reporting tasks instead of other tasks they could be performing.

legal work relating to FINRA membership, and costs associated with additional compliance
activities.
The ongoing membership related fees associated with FINRA membership include the
annual gross income assessment; the annual personnel assessment; and the TAF and Section 3
fees, among others. The more significant fees are discussed below. 222
The annual Gross Income Assessment generally requires members to pay a percentage of
the Member Firm’s total annual revenue based on a graduated scale. 223 The magnitude of the
annual Gross Income Assessment is based on the total annual revenue, excluding commodities
income, reported by the Member Firm on its FOCUS Form Part II or IIA. 224 Based on FOCUS
Form data from Non-Member Firms in 2014, the Commission has determined that the average
annual total revenue of Non-Member Firms, excluding commodities income, is approximately
222

There are additional fees associated with maintaining an Association membership. There
is an annual Personnel Assessment fee ranging from $130 to $150 per employee that
applies to principals or representatives in the FINRA member’s organization. See
FINRA By-Laws, Schedule A, Section 1(e). Based on 2014 FOCUS reports, the number
of registered representatives of Non-Member Firms that connect directly to ATSs ranges
from 0-91, with an average of 18 and a median of 0. The Commission estimates that the
average Non-Member Firm would incur a Personnel Assessment fee of no more than
$2,520, and the median Non-Member Firm would incur a Personnel Assessment fee of
$0. The Commission further estimates that the maximum Personnel Assessment fee that
one of these Non-Member Firms would incur would be $11,830. There are also
additional continuing education and testing requirements which will impose costs upon
firms joining an Association. Additionally, there are de minimis fees (branch registration
fee and system processing fee, among others). See FINRA By-Laws, Schedule A.

223

Id. For example, FINRA imposes a Gross Income Assessment as follows: (1) $1,200 on
a Member Firm’s annual gross revenue up to $1 million; (2) a charge of 0.1215% on a
Member Firm’s annual gross revenue between $1 million and $25 million; (3) a charge of
0.2599% on a Member Firm’s annual gross revenue between $25 million and $50
million; and so on as provided in Schedule A. When a firm’s annual gross revenue
exceeds $25 million, the maximum of current year’s revenue and average of the last three
years’ revenue is used as the basis for the income assessment. Id.

$93 million, with a median of $86 million. 225 For the 14 large firms that connect directly to
ATSs, FINRA’s graduated Gross Income Assessment scale results in an average Gross Income
Assessment for these Non-Member Firms of $91,784 and a median Gross Income Assessment of
$113,824. 226
The magnitude of the TAF depends on the transaction volume of a FINRA member that
is covered by TAF as described in the FINRA Bylaws. 227 The Commission notes that FINRA
may need to consider reevaluating the structure of the TAF to assure that it appropriately takes
into account the business models of Non-Member Firms that may join FINRA as a result of the
proposed amendments. 228 Although the Commission lacks the data to comprehensively estimate
TAF that Non-Member Firms are likely to incur, data on ATS trading during the fourth quarter
of 2014 provided by FINRA allows the Commission to estimate the fees associated with ATS
activity for Non-Member Firms that connect directly to an ATS. 229 The Commission has
identified 14 Non-Member Firms that traded on ATSs directly without the intermediation of a

($1,200 for the first $1 million of revenue) + (0.1215% × annual revenue greater than $1

$50 million) + (0.0518% of annual revenue greater than $50 million up top $100 million)
+ (0.0365% of annual revenue greater than $100 million to $5 billion). As discussed
previously, Non-Member Firms vary in size. GIA for large firms used in these
calculations (the 14 that connect directly to ATSs), is anticipated to be far larger than for
the 111 remaining Non-Member Firms. See FINRA By-Laws, Schedule A, Section 1(c).

227

See FINRA By-Laws, Schedule A, Section 1(b).

228

See supra notes 95 and 184.

229

Some Non-Member Firms may trade on ATSs indirectly using the services of a Member
Firm. The Commission cannot identify the magnitude of these firms’ trading on an
individual basis because Non-Member Firms are not required to be identified in Member
Firms’ OATS data. The Commission thus cannot estimate the TAF that these firms
would incur as FINRA members.

99

Member Firm during the fourth quarter of 2014. 230 The Commission estimates that trading
activity fees incurred by these 14 large Non-Member Firms due to their ATS activity would
range from $0 to approximately $3.2 million annually, with a median incurred TAF of around
$40,000. 231 The Commission believes that TAF for Non-Member Firms not among the 14
identified will be far lower because the median Non-Member Firm has far lower trading volume
than the typical firm of the 14 identified in the data.
Some off-exchange trading that Non-Member Firms engage in currently may no longer
be profitable when TAF is incurred. Consequently, Non-Member Firms may reduce their trading
both on exchanges and off-exchange after joining an Association.

230

These 14 firms do not represent typical Non-Member Firms: they represent the largest of
the Non-Member Firms in terms of trading volume. Consequently, the median TAF
discussed here far exceeds what the majority of Non-Member Firms would pay if they
were to join FINRA.

231

Estimated TAF does not include any TAF related to firm’s exchange-based trading
activity, or off-exchange activity that occurs outside of an ATS. If a firm’s activity on an
exchange is related to normal market making operations, the activity does not incur TAF.
The Commission is unable to estimate the proportion of these firms’ exchange trading
that would incur TAF because the Commission does not have information on what
proportion of Non-Member Firm exchange activity would qualify for exemption from
TAF fees under FINRA By-Laws. Because other elements of the TAF are not included
in this calculation, it underestimates the actual TAF that firms would incur if they joined
FINRA. The magnitude of the underestimation may be significant, but firms that join
FINRA may be able to reduce their TAF cost by registering as Market Makers upon
additional exchanges. (TAF is not assessed for certain trades related to registered
market-making. See FINRA By Laws, Schedule A, Section (1)(b)(2)(F).) Estimates of
TAF are based on the percentage of ATS orders received by Member Firms that operate
an ATS and report the exchange-issued MPIDs of Non-Member Firms that place orders
within that system. The calculation assumes that these proportions are representative of
the trading of Non-Member Firms on all ATSs, and that the orders placed by these firms
are equally likely to be executed within ATSs. It also assumes that half of all executed
volume is sell volume, which incurs a TAF. The estimated TAF is equal to estimated sell
volume x $0.000119. The $0 minimum is associated with a firm that has almost no ATS
volume.

100

In addition to TAF, Non-Member Firms that choose to join FINRA may incur additional
Section 3 fees. Using data on ATS trading during the fourth quarter of 2014 provided by
FINRA, the Commission estimates that Section 3 fees incurred by the 14 large Non-Member
Firms due to their off-exchange trading would range from $0 to approximately $16.9 million
dollars annually, with a median incurred Section 3 fee 232 of $212,000. 233 As discussed in
Section V.A.2 above, some of these fees may already be paid by Non-Member Firms that engage
the services of a Member Firm clearing broker. However, FINRA lacks the authority to assess
Section 3 fees against Non-Member Firms that self-clear, in which case FINRA may assess the
fee to the Member Firm counterparty to the transaction. While these fees will represent a cost to
Non-Member Firms, the cost will be largely offset to the industry as a whole by a reduction of
Section 3 fees incurred by Member Firms (or clearing brokers acting on behalf of a Member
Firm) when they buy from a self-clearing, Non-Member Firm.
Ongoing compliance costs would depend on the business circumstances of each firm and
the types of issues that could arise. As in the case of the initial membership, some Non-Member
Firms may choose to conduct ongoing compliance activities other than regulatory data reporting
work (such as core accounting functions, updating policies and procedures, and updating forms
232

These estimates do not include fees related to off-exchange trading outside of an ATS;
the Commission is unable to estimate the magnitude of such fees that Non-Member Firms
would incur if they were to continue trading off-exchange upon adoption of these
amendments because in the absence of a consolidated audit trail, the Commission lacks
data on Non-Member Firm off-exchange activity outside of ATSs.

233

Section 3 fees are estimated using Non-Member Firm off-exchange dollar volume
reported by FINRA. Half of volume is assumed to be sell volume that would be subject
to Section 3 fees. Aggregate estimated sell volume is estimated across firms by assuming
that all non-member orders are equally likely to generate executions. For example,
assume firm ABC submitted 10% of all off-exchange orders submitted by Non-Member
Firms. Section 3 Fee obligation is calculated as: Non-Member Firm Dollar Volume x ½
x 10% x $18.40/$1,000,000.

101

filed with regulators) in-house while others may seek to outsource this work. The Commission
estimates, based on discussions with industry participants, that the ongoing compliance cost for
firms that outsource this work will range from $24,000 to $96,000 per year. 234 In the case of
some Non-Member Firms, i.e., those that are affiliates of FINRA members, this cost is likely to
be lower as they may be able to leverage compliance work already being performed.
In addition to the cost estimates discussed above, the Commission recognizes that both
Non-Member Firms and SROs will incur other direct and indirect costs because of the increased
regulatory requirements of the proposed amendments. Specifically, there will be compliance
costs associated with regulation by FINRA. 235 Generally, the SROs that supervise Non-Member
Firms are unable to provide the level of supervision of cross-market and off-exchange activity
that FINRA provides to its Member Firms. Consequently, firms that join an Association will
face costs associated with greater regulatory scrutiny, including the costs of comprehensive
examinations of activity that was previously subject to less regulatory review. To the extent that
this activity is permissible under Association rules, additional costs will be limited to those
activities that are required to accommodate normal supervision and examination by an
Association. To the extent that their activity does not already do so, firms will face additional
costs related to bringing activity into compliance with Association rules. For the reasons

234

For firms that choose to do this work in-house, the Commission preliminarily believes
that the costs of ongoing compliance may be less than $96,000. This figure assumes
Non-Member Firms may have experience in ongoing compliance work with SROs
through their exchange membership(s) and, therefore, only captures the incremental cost
of compliance with Association rules.

235

However, Non-Member Firms that choose to join an Association may have FINRA
assigned as their DEA. Such an assignment could eliminate separate DEA fees that the
Non-Member Firms may pay to their current DEA.

102

discussed above, the Commission is not able to estimate these costs, although the Commission
believes they will vary among Non-Member Firms.
c. Costs of Joining Additional Exchanges under the Rule as Proposed
to be Amended
Non-Member Firms must be members of all exchanges upon which they transact business
if they decide not to join an Association. With limited exceptions for some excluded activity
previously discussed, some Non-Member Firms may choose to join additional exchanges to be
excluded from the requirement to become a member of an Association. Alternatively, these
firms may cease trading on exchanges of which they are not members.
Based on discussions with FINRA and industry participants, the Commission understands
that completing a membership application with an additional exchange is generally less
complicated and time consuming than completing a membership application with FINRA.
Consequently, the Commission preliminarily believes that the compliance burden on NonMember Firms for joining an additional exchange is likely to be significantly less than that of
joining FINRA as those Non-Member Firms that choose to join an additional exchange are likely
able to perform this work internally, given that they are already members of at least one
exchange, and that such work should take less time than the time required to complete an
application with FINRA.
In addition to the legal burden, Non-Member Firms joining additional exchanges as a
result of the proposed amendments would incur membership and related fees. To the extent that
Non-Member Firms choose to become members of additional exchanges, the fees associated
with such memberships would vary depending on the type of access sought and the exchanges of
which Non-Member Firms choose to become members.

103

The Commission also believes that the exchange membership fees that would apply to
Non-Member Firms joining such exchanges would be those fees that apply to either introducing
broker-dealers or proprietary trading firms. This assumption is consistent with the fact that any
broker-dealers carrying customer accounts could not qualify for the current exemption of Rule
15b9-1. Thus, any exchange membership fees that apply to firms that provide clearing services
or conduct a public business would not apply to Non-Member Firms.
Furthermore, because all Non-Member Firms are members of at least one exchange, 236
they would have already completed a Form U4, to register associated persons. 237 Although
FINRA’s rules regarding registration of associated persons tend to be more specific than
exchange SRO rules regarding associated persons, the Commission believes Non-Member Firms
will not need to register additional associated persons because the exchange SRO rules are
already comprehensive in this regard. The Commission understands that all exchanges can
access the Form U4 filings within the CRD which is maintained by FINRA.
In order to obtain estimates of the cost of joining additional exchanges, the Commission
reviewed the membership related fee structures of all eighteen national securities exchanges. In
assuming that the potential burden of joining additional exchanges would likely be less than that
of joining FINRA, the Commission assumes that the costs imposed on Non-Member Firms by
the proposed amendments would be membership fees, not costs relating to trading, such as
236

For a broker-dealer to possibly be exempt from the requirement to be an Association
member currently or under the proposed amendments, the broker-dealer must be a
member of at least one exchange.

237

Form U4 is the Uniform Application for Securities Industry Registration or Transfer.
Representatives of broker-dealers, investment advisers, or issuers of securities use Form
U4 to become registered in the appropriate jurisdictions and/or with SROs. The
Commission understands that all SROs currently use Form U4. See, e.g., BATS Rule
2.5.01(c), ISE Rule 304(b), Phlx Rule 600(b).

104

trading permit fees and connectivity. The Commission recognizes that membership in an
exchange, alone, may not guarantee the ability to trade because many exchanges charge fees for
trading rights, ports, various degrees of connectivity, and floor access and equipment, should
those be desired. The Commission believes that the fees associated with trading on an exchange
are not the result of the proposed amendments because, under the proposed amendments, a NonMember Firm could continue to trade through another broker-dealer on an exchange as long as
that Non-Member Firm is a member of every exchange on which it trades or is a member of
FINRA. In other words, the proposed amendments themselves do not impose the cost of
connectivity and related fees, but only the costs associated with membership on exchanges on
which Non-Member Firms will trade. To the extent, therefore, that Non-Member Firms continue
to trade through other broker-dealers in a manner consistent with how they currently operate, the
proposed amendments impose only the costs associated with membership.
The Commission also recognizes that connectivity fees to additional exchanges can range
from the very low—approximately $500 a month for a workstation at NASDAQ—to upwards of
$100,000 monthly, depending on factors such as latency, distance, bandwidth, and co-location,
among others. Again, however, these costs are not a result of the proposed amendments because
the proposed amendments do not impose any connectivity requirements. They simply impose
membership requirements to facilitate regulatory supervision.
To arrive at preliminary estimates of the cost of joining additional exchanges, the
Commission aggregated any fees associated with a firm’s initial application to an exchange
(“initial fee”) and separately aggregated the fees associated with any monthly or annual
membership costs to obtain a separate annual cost (“annual fee”). Based on these aggregations,
the Commission obtained a preliminary range for both the initial fee and the annual fee across

105

exchanges. The initial fee is as low as $0 for some exchanges. Most exchanges have an initial
fee that is greater than $0 and no more than $5,000. 238
Regarding monthly or annual membership fees, most exchanges’ ongoing monthly or
annual membership fees generally range from $1,500 to $7,200. 239 Again, these ongoing
238

The BATS Exchanges do not assess any initial fees. See BATS BYX Exchange Fee

d. Policies and Procedures Related to the Hedging Exemption
Non-Member Firms that choose not to join an Association but wish to continue to trade
off-exchange (or on exchanges of which they are not members) must do so in a manner that
conforms to the hedging exemption. To do so, the proposal would require Non-Member Firms
to establish, maintain and enforce policies and procedures as discussed above. The Commission
estimates that firms will incur a burden of 16 hours in initially preparing these policies and
procedures. 240 Furthermore, the burden of maintaining and enforcing such policies and
procedures, including a review of such policies at least annually, would be approximately 96
hours. 241 The Commission estimates an initial implementation cost of approximately $5,000 and
an annual ongoing cost of approximately $18,000 for Non-Member Firms that wish to utilize the
hedging exemption and perform this work internally; for firms that outsource this work, costs are

5.pdf (last visited February 18, 2015) (assessing a monthly trading permit fee for an
“Electronic Exchange Member” of $1,500).
240

This figure is based on the following: (Compliance Manager at 10 hours) + (Compliance
Attorney at 5 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 1 hour) = 16 burden hours per dealer.
See infra note 271. As is discussed in more detail in the Paperwork Reduction Act
discussion, the Commission based this estimate on the estimated burdens imposed by
other rules applicable to broker-dealers, such as Regulation SHO. However, the
Commission preliminarily believes that the policies and procedures under the proposed
floor member hedging exemption will be substantially less burdensome than those
required by the Amendments to Regulation SHO because those policies and procedures
require certain technology and real-time monitoring components. In contrast, the policies
and procedures under the proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1 do not involve a realtime monitoring or technology component. See infra note 273.

241

See Section VI.D.

107

likely to be higher. 242 For firms that choose to join FINRA, the hedging exemption is not
relevant. They will not incur these costs.
e. Indirect Costs
In addition to possibly incurring costs related to joining exchanges, Non-Member Firms
that choose not to join an Association will lose the benefits of trading in the off-exchange
market, unless they meet the exemption for hedging. As mentioned above, Non-Member Firms
are significant participants in ATS activity. Much of this trading is attributed to 14 Non-Member
Firms, and the activity level across those firms varies widely. Assuming that order volume is
proportional to trade volume, the Commission estimates that the smallest of the 14 firms
executed 11 shares on ATSs during the fourth quarter of 2014. 243 The largest firm executed 13.3
billion shares. The median firm in the group of 14 large Non-Member Firms is estimated to have
executed 167.6 million shares. Although these share volumes are large, the Commission does
not have adequate data on these firms to estimate the proportion of their trading activity and
revenues that occurs on exchanges versus off-exchange. The Commission cannot judge the

242

For firms that perform this work internally, the initial cost estimate assumes 4 hours of
work performed by a Compliance Manager at an hourly rate of $283 and 12 hours
performed by Compliance Attorneys at an hourly rate of $334. The annual cost estimate
assumes 48 hours of work by Compliance Clerks at an hourly rate of $64, 32 hours by
Compliance Attorneys, and 16 hours by Compliance Managers. Hourly salary figure is
from SIFMA's Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2013,
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour work-year and multiplied by
5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits and overhead.

243

The composition of the list of Non-Member Firms that are identified in ATS trading data
changes across time periods. It is possible that the number of Non-Member Firms trading
directly on ATSs is higher than estimated here. Additional Non-Member Firms may
access ATSs through Member Firms, which would also exclude them from this analysis.
To address data limitation, the Commission assumes that ATS orders from each of the 14
Non-Member Firms observable in the data are equally likely to be executed.

108

likelihood of these firms choosing to cease off-exchange activity rather than joining an
Association.
Finally, those firms that choose not to join an Association would be limited in their
ability to route their own transactions in a manner so as to comply with the requirements of
Regulation NMS. 244 Their transactions would have to be routed through a broker-dealer of an
exchange of which they are a member, or routed by a broker-dealer only to those exchanges of
which they are members. The routing of orders of Non-Member Firms that do not join an
Association will be determined by the routing broker-dealer of the exchanges of which they are
members. This loss in choice could lead to higher costs for routing and costs associated with
increased latency because the exchange’s routing broker-dealer may have a telecommunications
infrastructure that is inferior to that of the broker-dealer that previously provided connectivity to
that exchange to the Non-Member Firm. 245
D. Alternatives
1. Elimination of the Floor Member Hedging Exemption
Although the proposed amendments would eliminate the exclusion for proprietary trading
activity for broker-dealers wishing to continue availing themselves of the exemption from
Association membership under Rule 15b9-1, it would maintain a limited exception for hedging
of floor-based activity. 246 Currently, Non-Member Firms are able to hedge their floor-based
244

The exemption related to routing to comply with Regulation NMS is discussed in Section
II.E.

245

Firms in the business of providing connectivity to exchanges are likely to compete on the
basis of their technology. The Commission assumes that some firms that do not join
FINRA will have some orders (those governed under the Regulation NMS provisions to
prevent trade-throughs) routed using technology inferior to the technology of their firm of
choice.

246

The floor member hedging exemption is discussed more fully in Section II.D.
109

activity through the exclusion for proprietary trading in Rule 15b9-1. The Commission does not
have data to estimate the number of Non-Member Firms that use the proprietary trading
exemption in this manner, or the dollar-value of trading that they hedge through the exemption.
One alternative considered by the Commission was the elimination of the hedging
exemption entirely. Elimination of the floor member hedging exemption would require any firm
that wished to hedge through off-exchange transactions to join an Association or become a
member of each exchange on which it trades and cease off-exchange trading. This would
improve the Association’s ability to monitor cross-market hedging activity that was conducted
off-exchange. The Commission recognizes, however, that there may be challenges for the
Commission, firms, and exchanges in proving compliance with the exemption. For example,
some broker-dealers may label activity as hedging activity that is not covered by the exemption.
A firm could establish a limited floor-based business and then inadvertently or deliberately claim
the hedging exemption covers significant trading off-exchange (and trading on exchange of
which the firm is not a member) that did not reduce or otherwise mitigate the risk of its floorbased activity. Further, firms that wish to avail themselves of the hedging exemption will incur
costs to establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures related to its use. 247
Without the hedging exemption, firms would not incur these costs, but would incur other costs.
In particular, without a hedging exemption, floor brokers on some exchanges might find that
hedging positions obtained through their normal activity limited to the floor of a single exchange
is less cost-effective. For example, a floor broker on an options exchange is currently exempt
from FINRA membership if he trades off-exchange under the exclusion for proprietary trading.
After entering an options position, the floor broker can enter an offsetting equity position by
247

See Section V.C.2.d.

110

trading on an exchange of which he is not a member (through a member broker-dealer) or in the
off-exchange market. Under the proposed amendments without the hedging exemption, the floor
broker would not be able to make such a hedging transaction without joining at least one
additional SRO (FINRA or another exchange where he could transact in equities). If participants
have less opportunity to hedge their positions, they may be less willing to provide liquidity in
their capacity as floor brokers. Therefore, the Commission is proposing a narrow hedging
exemption that covers only the activity it intends to exclude.
2. Improve Off-Exchange Supervision through Action of Other SROs
with or without CAT
The Commission also considered whether an alternative approach to achieving the
objectives of the proposed amendments would be to address the limitations in regulatory
oversight of off-exchange activity of Non-Member Firms through exchanges that act as their
DEAs or all exchanges of which they are members. The Commission preliminarily believes
either of these alternatives would frustrate the regulatory structure established by Congress and
would be inefficient. As discussed in detail above, exchanges traditionally have not assumed the
role of regulating the totality of the trading of their member-broker-dealers, and exchanges are
currently not well-positioned to assume that role, in light of the statutory framework and, among
other things, their limited access to data and the lack of a proper rule set to regulate off-exchange
trading. 248 Exchanges generally do not have as detailed a set of member conduct rules and do
not have non-exchange-specific trading rules, thus allowing such broker-dealers and their
personnel to conduct business under a less specific regulatory regime than FINRA members. 249

248

See supra notes 82-95 and accompanying text.

249

See supra note 75 and accompanying text.

111

As discussed above, in this context and consistent with the statutory framework, the Commission
preliminarily believes that an Association is better suited to regulate off-exchange trading. 250
With respect to having Non-Member Firms’ DEAs assume the regulatory oversight
responsibilities, the Commission could require the Non-Member Firm’s DEA to oversee the offexchange activity of the firm. This alternative may offer some benefit in terms of providing
efficient supervision. Non-Member Firms’ DEAs may have specialized knowledge of NonMember Firms’ businesses and operations that would facilitate efficient supervision of their offexchange activity. 251 Similarly, requiring all SROs to supervise the off-exchange activity of
their members might bring certain benefits. First, there might be innovation in surveillance
methodology because exchange SROs could need new surveillance systems and procedures
tailored to current market structure and practice. Second, this could foster competition among
SROs to provide regulatory services, which could lower costs to members.
However, with respect to DEAs, the supervision of trading activity is outside the scope of
typical DEA oversight responsibilities 252 and the Commission believes most exchanges contract
with FINRA to perform these examinations. Consequently, if exchange SROs were expected to
supervise the off-exchange activities of firms assigned to them for DEA examinations, the
exchanges would need to acquire the resources to provide this supervision.
Requiring all SROs to supervise their members’ off-exchange trading would also entail
substantial costs and create inefficiencies. As discussed previously, exchange SROs have not

250

See supra notes 82-95 and accompanying text.

251

See Allston Letter, supra note 106.

252

See supra note 164.

112

generally supervised their members’ activity outside of the markets they operate. 253 As
discussed above, FINRA has invested in the technological infrastructure, cooperative agreements
with other SROs, and specialized regulatory personnel to provide surveillance and supervision of
activity in off-exchange markets. 254 If each of the exchanges were required to supervise the offexchange activities of some or all of their members, the exchanges each would need to invest in
similar regulatory infrastructure. This investment would be costly to the exchanges; presumably
these costs would be passed on to exchange members and ultimately the investing public through
higher trading costs. In addition, assigning regulatory responsibility to an exchange SRO, which
may in turn contract with FINRA to provide those services, would be costly and inefficient.
Further, notwithstanding the potential benefits to innovation, the duplication in regulatory
oversight would also be duplication in regulatory resources as multiple SROs would surveil the
off-exchange trading of some firms. This approach also could be inconsistent with the allocation
of regulatory responsibilities contemplated by Section 17(d) of the Exchange Act. 255
Furthermore, FINRA has adopted rules that govern off-exchange trading, recognizing the
complexity and opacity of the off-exchange marketplace. If exchanges were required to
supervise the off-exchange activity of their members, exchanges would need to adopt rules that
were tailored to the institutional detail of the off-exchange market. This could result in offexchange trading rules that varied depending on the exchange membership status of individual
participants, resulting in inconsistent rules governing the same off-exchange trading activity.

113

Finally, the Commission has also considered whether the possibility that the exchanges
could obtain additional data through the CAT, or through a FINRA rule change if
implemented, 256 affects the Commission’s preliminary belief that an Association is better suited
to regulate off-exchange trading. Although there may thereby be additional data, these changes
would not address the underlying statutory scheme and resource issues that make FINRA wellpositioned to regulate off-exchange trading.
3. Exchange Membership Alternative
The proposed amendments would, in accordance with Section 15(b)(8), preclude any
firm that is not a member of an Association from trading on exchanges of which it is not a
member. 257 Further, under the proposed amendments, if a firm becomes a member of an
Association, it would not have to become a member of each exchange upon which it trades. 258
The Commission has also considered requiring broker-dealers to become a member of every
exchange on which they trade and to become a member of an Association in order to trade offexchange (“Exchange Membership Alternative”). In other words, under this alternative,
becoming a member of an Association would not alone allow firms to trade on exchanges of
which they are not members (as would be permitted under the proposed amendments).
In considering the Exchange Membership Alternative, the Commission weighed whether
the same issue of off-exchange activity not being subject to effective regulatory oversight that
exists when a Non-Member Firm trades off-exchange is present when a Member or Non-

256

See supra note 84.

257

The proposed amendments provide limited exemptions for hedging of floor-based
activity and order routing to satisfy certain provisions of Regulation NMS.

258

In order to trade on exchanges of which it is not a member, the firm would have to trade
with or through another broker-dealer that is a member of that exchange.

114

Member Firm trades on an exchange of which it is not a member (through a member of that
exchange). The Commission preliminarily believes that the proposed amendments adequately
address the issue of establishing effective oversight of off-exchange activity and that the more
onerous Exchange Membership Alternative would not provide any additional regulatory benefit
beyond the proposed amendments for several reasons. First, while exchanges lack the data,
surveillance technology and specialized regulatory personnel to surveil their members’ trading
off-exchange, FINRA has these resources to surveil the activity of Member Firms both on
exchanges and off-exchange. Accordingly, requiring Member Firms to also become members of
each exchange on which they effect transactions, including indirectly, would be unnecessarily
duplicative because FINRA can already surveil the activity of a Member Firm trading on an
exchange of which it is not a member. In addition, while exchanges do not have a specialized
rule set to govern their members’ activity in the off-exchange market, FINRA’s rules are
consistent with requiring Member Firms to adhere to the trading rules of exchanges on which
they transact. If a Member Firm were to violate an exchange rule on an exchange of which it is
not a member, FINRA would have the jurisdiction needed to address the resulting violation.
Therefore, requiring that the Member Firm also become a member of that exchange would not
prevent FINRA from exercising jurisdiction over the matter.
The Commission notes that the Exchange Membership Alternative might require firms to
become members of more SROs than required under the proposed amendments, which would
impose additional costs. In particular, some Non-Member Firms that would become Member
Firms under the Proposal would also need to become members of additional exchanges or cease
trading on these exchanges. In addition, some current Member Firms would also need to become
members of additional exchanges

115

4. Retaining the De Minimis Allowance
The Commission considered retaining the $1,000 de minimis allowance for trading other
than on an exchange of which the Non-Member Firm is a member. The Commission also
considered retaining the $1,000 de minimis allowance, but removing the exception for
proprietary trading conducted with or through another registered broker-dealer. As discussed
above, 259 the Commission believes that the magnitude of the de minimis allowance is no longer
economically meaningful. Furthermore, the Commission believes that the commission sharing
arrangements discussed previously260 are rarely if ever used. However, the Commission believes
that floor members on some exchanges may rely upon the exception for proprietary trading
conducted with or through another registered broker-dealer to hedge risks associated with floorbased activities. Consequently, the proposed amendments include a hedging exemption for
floor-based activity but no longer include a de minimis dollar amount associated with
transactions that do not fall under the limited hedging exemption.
5. The Commission Assumes Regulatory Oversight Role for NonMember Firms
The Commission considered assuming the role of providing direct primary regulatory
oversight for Non-Member Firms. We do not believe, however, that this is a reasonably
available alternative because of the judgments reflected in Congress’s determinations over time
about where to locate that oversight function and our own understanding of the entity best suited
to that role. As discussed in detail above, the Exchange Act, as originally adopted in 1934, left
regulation of the off-exchange market to the Commission.261 In 1938, Congress provided for the

116

creation of Associations, 262 and from 1965 until 1983, broker-dealers engaged in off-exchange
trading could become members of NASD or opt to be regulated directly by the Commission
under the SECO program. 263 In 1983, the Commission recommended that Congress eliminate
the SECO program because, among other things, only a limited number of broker-dealers chose
to be regulated under the SECO program 264 and maintaining the program disproportionately
affected the Commission’s resources. Congress then amended the Act to eliminate the SECO
program, 265 which had the effect of making the regulation of off-exchange trading under the
Exchange Act the responsibility of an Association. 266 Consistent with this, in this rulemaking
the Commission is proposing to modify the Rule 15b9-1 exemption so that, with limited
exceptions, the off-exchange transactions of broker-dealers will be subject to the oversight and
rules of an Association, the SRO primarily responsible for regulating trading in the off-exchange
market. As discussed throughout, we believe an Association is best positioned to regulate that
trading. Based on the foregoing, including the Congress’s determination to eliminate the SECO

262

See supra notes 31-33 and accompanying text.

263

As previously noted, broker-dealers that traded exclusively on the floor of an exchange
were exempt from broker-dealer registration with the Commission until the 1975
Amendments, which extended the Commission’s SECO rulemaking authority to any
exchange member trading on an exchange other than an exchange of which it was a
member. See supra note 41 and accompanying text. Broker-dealers registering with the
Commission as a result of the 1975 Amendments became subject to the SECO rules in
1976, but could remain exempt from such rules pursuant to Rule 15b8-1. See supra note
43 and accompanying text.

264

Because many broker-dealers chose to become members of NASD rather than
participating in the SECO Program, only 12 percent of all active Commission-registered
broker-dealers effecting transactions off-exchange were SECO broker-dealers by May
1982. House Comm. on Energy and Commerce, “Authorization of Appropriations for

broker-dealer oversight by the Commission as a reasonably available alternative.
E. Request for Comment on Economic Analysis
The Commission has identified above economic effects associated with the proposal and
requests comment on all aspects of its preliminary economic analysis. The Commission
encourages commenters to identify, discuss, analyze, and supply relevant data, information, or
statistics regarding any such economic effects. In particular, the Commission seeks comment on
the following:
47. Do commenters agree with the Commission’s analysis of the potential economic
effects of the proposed amendments? Why or why not?
48. Do commenters agree with the Commission’s assessment of the baseline for the
economic effects?
49. Is the supervision and surveillance of Non-Member Firms with substantial crossmarket or off-exchange trading sufficient under current rules? Why or why not?
50. How would further changes to the scope of existing Regulatory Services
Agreements between SROs affect regulators’ ability to effectively surveil crossmarket and off-exchange trading?
51. Do commenters believe that there are additional categories of benefits or costs
that could be quantified or otherwise monetized? If so, please identify these
categories and, if possible, provide specific estimates or data.

267

The report accompanying the amendments made to the Act in 1983 cited a preference for
self-regulation over direct regulation by the Commission. See supra note 46 and
accompanying text.

118

52. Are there any additional benefits that may arise from the proposed amendments?
Or are there benefits described above that would not likely result from the
proposed amendments? If so, please explain these benefits or lack of benefits in
detail.
53. Are there any additional costs that may arise from the proposed amendments?
Are there methods by which the Commission could reduce the costs imposed by
the proposed amendments enabling effective regulatory oversight of Non-Member
Firms? Please explain. Are there any other potential consequences of the
proposed amendments? Or are there costs described above that would not likely
result from the proposed amendments? If so, please explain these costs or lack of
costs in detail.
54. Does the release appropriately describe the potential effects of the proposed
amendments on the promotion of efficiency, competition, and capital formation?
Why or why not? If possible, commenters should provide analysis and empirical
data to support their views on the competitive or anticompetitive effects, as well
as the efficiency and capital formation effects, of the proposed amendments.
55. Are there alternative mechanisms for achieving the Commission’s goal of
improving regulatory oversight while promoting competition and capital
formation?
56. To the extent that there are reasonable alternatives to the proposed amendments,
what are the potential costs and benefits of those reasonable alternatives relative
to the proposed amendments? What are the potential effects on the promotion of
efficiency, competition, and capital formation of those reasonable alternatives?

119

57. Would the cost of FINRA or exchange membership cause some Non-Member
Firms to alter their activities in any way? If so, how would Non-Member Firms
alter their business? How would these changes affect competition and market
efficiency? How would these changes affect market quality?
58. Would the proposed amendments cause Non-Member Firms to exit the
marketplace? If so, how many Non-Member Firms would elect to restrict their
operations rather that become members of FINRA or one or more exchanges?
How would these changes affect competition and market efficiency? How would
these changes affect market quality? What would be the effect on liquidity of
Non-Members Firms exiting the marketplace?
59. Are there costs related to FINRA membership for Non-Member Firms that the
Commission has not considered? What are these costs? Please be specific.
60. For Non-Member Firms, how much will the cost of FINRA membership vary?
Will the cost of FINRA membership cause some firms to change the scope of
their business? If so, in what manner?
61. Do commenters agree with the assumptions underlying the Commission’s
estimates of the range for membership costs for exchanges?
62. Do commenters agree with the Commission’s preliminarily belief that the TAF
collected by FINRA would not be expected to materially change if the proposed
amendments were adopted? What would the effect of the proposed amendments
be on the TAF assessed to current FINRA members? What would the effect of
the proposed amendments be on the TAF assessed to Non-Member Firms that
choose to become FINRA members?

120

63. Has the Commission properly accounted for the compliance cost burden required
to achieve the access to exchanges necessary to comply with the proposed
amendments? Would any costs beyond basic membership be the direct result of
the proposed amendments?
64. If Non-Member Firms were to elect to join additional exchanges rather than
becoming members of FINRA, how many exchanges would they expect to join?
65. Is the Commission correct in assuming that the cost of membership is the relevant
compliance cost burden and that connectivity or trading related costs are optional
for most to all of the exchanges? Are there any exchanges on which connectivity
or trading rights costs are mandatory even if a broker-dealer trades through
another member broker-dealer that is paying the connectivity or trading rights
costs?
66. Are the Commission’s assumptions on the manner in which Section 3 fees are
allocated in off-exchange transactions with Non-Member Firms correct? Are
there mechanisms in place already that result in these fees being passed on to
Non-Member Firms that transact in ATSs, or elsewhere in the off-exchange
market?
67. Would a Non-Member Firm elect to become a member of one or more exchanges
rather than become a member of FINRA? If so, please discuss in detail why a
Non-Member Firm would make such an election. Which exchanges, in particular,
are Non-Member Firms likely to join, if they join additional exchanges, as a result
of the proposed amendments? How would these changes affect competition and
market efficiency? How would these changes affect market quality?

121

68. Has the Commission articulated all reasonable alternatives for the proposed rule?
If not, please provide additional alternatives and how their costs and benefits
would compare to the proposed rule. For the alternatives described above, has the
Commission accurately described the costs and benefits? If not, please provide
more accurate costs and benefits, including any data or statistics that support
those costs and benefits.
69. One alternative discussed is to effect improved off-exchange supervision through
the action of exchanges. Is this alternative practical? What resources would
exchanges have to acquire to provide efficient and effective supervision of their
members’ off-exchange trading activity?
70. What effects could the proposed amendments have on FINRA’s oversight of the
off-exchange market? How could FINRA’s revenues and cost of regulation be
affected? What changes should FINRA consider implementing should the
Commission approve the proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1? Please be
specific.
71. Would the proposed amendments create a barrier to entry for new prospective
Associations? Would there be benefits to competition among Associations?
VI.

Paperwork Reduction Act

Certain provisions of these proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1 contain “collection of
information requirements” within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995
(“PRA”). 268 As discussed in Part II.D, the proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1 would require
dealers relying on the floor member hedging exemption under Rule 15b9-1 to establish,
268

44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

122

maintain, and enforce certain written policies and procedures. Compliance with these collections
of information requirements would be mandatory for firms relying on the rule. The Commission
is submitting these collections of information to the Office of Management and Budget (“OMB”)
for review in accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507(d) and 5 CFR 1320.11. The title of new collection
of information is “Rule 15b9-1 Floor Member Hedging Exemption." An agency may not
conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information unless
the agency displays a currently valid control number.
A. Summary of Collection of Information
The proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1 would include a collection of information
within the meaning of the PRA for broker-dealers relying on the floor member hedging
exemption under the proposed Rule. The floor member hedging exemption under the proposed
amendments to Rule 15b9-1 would permit a qualifying dealer 269 that conducts business on the
floor of a national securities exchange to effect transactions for its own account with or through
another registered broker or dealer that are solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floorbased activities, by reducing or otherwise mitigating the risks thereof. Broker-dealers relying on
the floor member hedging exemption must establish, maintain, and enforce written policies and
procedures reasonably designed to ensure and demonstrate that such hedging transactions reduce
or otherwise mitigate the risks of the financial exposure the dealer incurs as a result of its floorbased activity. In addition, such dealers would be required to preserve a copy of their policies

269

A broker-dealer would have to meet the threshold requirements of proposed Rule 15b9-1.
Specifically, such broker-dealer would have to: (1) be a member of a national securities
exchange; (2) carry no customer accounts; and (3) effect transactions in securities solely
on a national securities exchange of which it is a member, except for transactions
complying with the floor member hedging exemption or the Regulation NMS routing
exemption.

123

and procedures in a manner consistent with Rule 17a-4 until three years after the date the policies
and procedures are replaced with updated policies and procedures.
B. Proposed Use of Information
The policies and procedures required under Rule 15b9-1 would be used by the
Commission and SROs to understand how dealers relying on the floor member hedging
exemption evaluate whether their off-exchange transactions are conducted solely for the purpose
of hedging risks incurred from the dealer’s floor-based business and that such dealers are
complying with the requirements of Rule 15b9-1. These policies and procedures will be used
generally by the Commission as part of its ongoing efforts to monitor and enforce compliance
with the federal securities laws, including Section 15(b)(8) and Rule 15b9-1 thereunder. In
addition, SROs may use the information to monitor and enforce compliance by their members
with applicable SRO rules and the federal securities laws.
C. Respondents
The Commission estimates that up to 100 dealers may rely on the floor member hedging
exemption contained in Rule 15b9-1. The Commission notes that, based on publicly available
information reviewed in the first quarter of 2015, there are currently 125 broker-dealers
registered with the Commission that are not members of an Association. Of those 125 brokerdealers, 77 broker-dealers currently disclose being an exchange member engaged in floor
activities on Form BD. 270 The Commission believes that while not all of these dealers will

270

Of the approximately 4,209 total registered broker-dealers as of March 2015, 182 brokerdealers in total disclose being an exchange member engaged in floor activities on Form
BD (note: the 182 broker-dealers includes the 77 broker-dealers engaged in floor
activities that are not members of an Association). The Commission preliminarily
believes that broker-dealers engaged in floor activities that are currently members of an
Association are unlikely to withdraw from Association membership and begin relying on
the floor member hedging exemption because such broker-dealers have already elected to
124

choose to avail themselves of the floor member hedging exemption contained in Rule 15b9-1
because the exemption restricts off-exchange transactions solely to those that hedge risks
incurred as a result of their floor-based activity, some firms not included in this number may
decide to avail themselves of the floor member hedging exemption. The Commission
preliminarily believes, however, that more of these firms are likely to want the ability to engage
in off-exchange transactions other than those that hedge the risk of their floor-based activity, and
may, accordingly, choose to join an Association as a result of the proposed amendments to Rule
15b9-1.
D. Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
The Commission estimates that the one-time, initial burden for a dealer to establish
written policies and procedures as required under Rule 15b9-1 would be approximately 16
hours. 271 This figure is based on the estimated number of hours to develop a set of written
policies and procedures, including review and approval by appropriate legal personnel. The
Commission notes that the policies and procedures required by the proposed Rule are limited to
hedging transactions that reduce or otherwise mitigate the risks of the financial exposure the
dealer incurs as a result of its floor-based activity. In addition, the Commission estimates the
annual burden of maintaining and enforcing such policies and procedures, including a review of
such policies at least annually, would be approximately 96 hours for each dealer. 272 This figure

join an Association and reliance on the floor member hedging exemption would limit
their permissible off-exchange activity solely to hedging risks incurred as a result of their
floor-based business.
271

This figure is based on the following: (Compliance Manager at 10 hours) + (Compliance
Attorney at 5 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 1 hour) = 16 burden hours per dealer.

272

This figure is based on the following: (Compliance Manager at 60 hours) + (Compliance
Attorney at 24 hours) + (Director of Compliance at 12 hours) = 96 burden hours per
dealer.
125

includes an estimate of hours related to reviewing existing policies and procedures, making
necessary updates, conducting ongoing training, maintaining relevant systems and internal
controls, performing necessary testing and monitoring of off-exchange hedging transactions as
they relate to the broker-dealer’s floor-based activities and maintaining copies of the policies and
procedures for the period of time required by the proposed rule.
The Commission estimates that the initial burden associated with Rule 15b9-1 would be
112 hours per dealer, which corresponds to an initial aggregate burden of 11,200 hours. 273 The
Commission estimates that the ongoing annualized burden associated with Rule 15b9-1 would be

273

This figure is based on the following: ((16 burden hours per dealer) + (96 burden hours
per dealer)) x (100 dealers) = 11,200 burden hours during the first year. In estimating
these burden hours, the Commission examined the estimated burdens imposed by other
rules applicable to broker-dealers. For example, amendments to Regulation SHO
adopted in 2010 required broker-dealers to establish, maintain, and enforce written
policies and procedures relating to Rule 201(c) and Rule 201(d)(6) to ensure short-sale
orders are, among other things, properly marked, are submitted at the proper price, or are
properly off-set (in the case of Rule 201(d)(6). See Exchange Act Release No. 61595
(February 26, 2010) 75 FR 11232, 11286 (March 10, 2010) (“Amendments to Regulation
SHO”). The policies and procedures relating to Rule 201(c) and Rule 201(d)(6) required
under the Amendments to Regulation SHO estimated an average initial one-time burden
of 160 burden hours per broker-dealer and ongoing compliance cost of 60 hours annually
to ensure the policies and procedures are up-to-date and remain in compliance as well as
an additional 336 hours annual to monitor, surveil, and enforce trading in compliance
with Rule 201. Id. The Commission preliminarily believes that the policies and
procedures under the proposed floor member hedging exemption will be substantially
less burdensome than those required by the Amendments to Regulation SHO because
those policies and procedures require certain technology and real-time monitoring
components. For example, under the Amendments to Regulation SHO described above,
broker-dealers’ policies and procedures must be reasonably designed to enable a brokerdealer to monitor, on a real-time basis, the national best bid so as to determine the price at
which a broker-dealer may submit a short sale order to a trading center in compliance
with Rule 201(c), and off-setting transactions under the riskless principal provision under
Rule 201(d)(6) must be allocated to a riskless principal or customer account within 60
seconds of execution. Id. at 11284. In contrast, the policies and procedures under the
proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1 do not involve a real-time monitoring or
technology component.

126

96 hours per dealer, which corresponds to an ongoing annualized aggregate burden of 9,600
hours. 274
E. Collection of Information is Mandatory
All of the collection of information discussed above would be mandatory.
F. Confidentiality of Responses to Collection of Information
To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to the
collection of information, such information will be kept confidential, subject to the provisions of
applicable law. 275
G. Retention Period for Recordkeeping Requirements
Dealers seeking to take advantage of the proposed hedging exemption would be required
to preserve a copy of their policies and procedures in a manner consistent with Rule 17a-4 276
274

This figure is based on the following: (96 burden hours per dealer) x (100 dealers) =
9,600 ongoing, annualized aggregate burden hours. In estimating these burden hours, the
Commission also examined the estimated initial and ongoing burden hours imposed on
registered security-based swap dealers under Regulation SBSR—Reporting and
Dissemination of Security-Based Swap Information. See Exchange Act Release No.
74244 (February 11, 2015) 80 FR 14564, 14683 (March 19, 2015) (“Regulation SBSR”).
Regulation SBSR requires registered security-based swap dealers to establish, maintain,
and enforce written policies and procedures that are reasonably designed to ensure
compliance with any security-based swap transaction reporting obligations. Id. The
estimated initial and ongoing compliance burden on registered security-based swap
dealers under Regulation SBSR were 216 burden hours and 120 burden hours
respectively. Id. The Commission preliminarily believes that the initial and ongoing
burden hours under the proposed floor member hedging exemption will be substantially
less than for registered security-based swap dealers under Regulation SBSR, because the
policies and procedures under Regulation SBSR require programing certain systems for
transaction reporting and performing testing of such systems. Id. In contrast, the
proposed floor member hedging exemption would not necessarily require programming
or testing of certain systems and is a much more discrete set of policies and procedures as
compared to the more comprehensive policies and procedures required by Regulation
SBSR, which cover, among other things, the full scope of reporting security-based swap
transactions by registered security-based swap dealers and others.

H. Request for Comments
Pursuant to 44 U.S.C. 3506(c)(2)(B), the Commission solicits comment to:
72. Evaluate whether the proposed collection of information is necessary for the
proper performance of our functions, including whether the information shall
have practical utility;
73. Evaluate the accuracy of our estimate of the burden of the proposed collection of
information;
74. Determine whether there are ways to enhance the quality, utility, and clarity of the
information to be collected; and
75. Evaluate whether there are ways to minimize the burden of collection of
information on those who are to respond, including through the use of automated
collection techniques or other forms of information technology.
Persons submitting comments on the collection of information requirements should direct
them to the Office of Management and Budget, Attention: Desk Officer for the Securities and
Exchange Commission, Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs, Washington, DC 20503,
and should also send a copy of their comments to Brent J. Fields, Secretary, Securities and

276

17 CFR 240.17a-4. Registered brokers and dealers are already subject to existing
recordkeeping and retention requirements under Rule 17a-4. However, proposed Rule
15b9-1 contains a requirement that a dealer relying on the floor member hedging
exemption preserve a copy of its policies and procedures in a manner consistent with
Rule 17a-4 until three years after the date the policies and procedures are replaced with
updated policies and procedures. The burdens associated with this recordkeeping
obligation have been accounted for in the burden estimates discussed above for Rule
15b9-1.

the collections of information between 30 and 60 days after publication, a comment to OMB is
best assured of having its full effect if OMB receives it within 30 days of publication.
VII.

Consideration of Impact on Economy

For purposes of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, 277 the
Commission requests comment on the potential effect of the proposed amendments to Rule
15b9-1 on the United States economy on an annual basis. The Commission also requests
comment on any potential increases in costs or prices for consumers or individual industries, and
any potential effect on competition, investment, or innovation. Commenters are requested to
provide empirical data and other factual support for their views to the extent possible.
VIII.

Regulatory Flexibility Act Certification

Section 3(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980 278 (“RFA”) requires the
Commission to undertake an initial regulatory flexibility analysis of the impact of the proposed
rule amendments on small entities unless the Commission certifies that the rule, if adopted,
would not have a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities. 279 For

purposes of Commission rulemaking in connection with the RFA, 280 a small entity includes a
broker or dealer that: (1) had total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than
$500,000 on the date in the prior fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were
prepared pursuant to Rule 17a-5(d) under the Exchange Act, 281 or, if not required to file such
statements, a broker-dealer with total capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than
$500,000 on the last day of the preceding fiscal year (or in the time that it has been in business, if
shorter); and is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small
business or small organization. 282 With regard to exchanges, a small entity is an exchange that
has been exempt from the reporting requirements of Rule 601 under Regulation NMS, and is not
affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is not a small business or small
organization. 283
The Commission examined recent FOCUS data for the 125 Non-Member Firms and
concluded that at most 11 of the affected entities have net capital of $500,000 or less, and some
of those might not be small entities because they might be affiliates of larger organizations.
Although the Commission lacks the data to quantify these firms’ off-exchange activity, it
does have FOCUS information on the firms’ disclosed activities. Based on this disclosure, the
Commission believes that many of these firms may be able to trade off-exchange under the

280

Although Section 601(b) of the RFA defines the term “small entity,” the statute permits
agencies to formulate their own definitions. The Commission has adopted definitions for
the term “small entity” for the purposes of Commission rulemaking in accordance with
the RFA. Those definitions, as relevant to this proposed rulemaking, are set forth in Rule
0-10 under the Exchange Act, 17 CFR 240.0-10. See Exchange Act Release No. 18451
(January 28, 1982), 47 FR 5215 (February 4, 1982) (File No. AS-305).

proposed floor member hedging exemption for a number of reasons. First, a number of firms
disclose floor-based activity that may allow them to trade off-exchange under the floor member
hedging exemption: five report writing options and six disclose floor activity. 284 Second, one
discloses only trading in government debt securities, so is unlikely to be affected by the proposed
amendments. Finally, only two of the eleven firms disclose proprietary trading activity. These
firms would be affected only by the elimination of the de minimis allowance, unless the firms
can rely on the floor member hedging exemption for such activity. 285 Therefore, the
Commission certifies that the proposed amendments to Rule 15b9-1 would not, if adopted, have
a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities.
76. We encourage written comments regarding this certification. We solicit comment
as to whether the proposed amendments could have impacts on small entities that
have not been considered. We request that commenters describe the nature of any
impacts on small entities and provide empirical data to support the extent of such
effect.
Such comments will be placed in the same public file as comments on the proposed
amendments to Rule 15b9-1. Persons wishing to submit written comments should refer to the
instructions for submitting comments in the front of this release.
IX.

Statutory Authority – Text of the Proposed Amendments

Pursuant to the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. 78a et seq., and particularly Sections 3,
15(b)(9), 15A, 17, 19, 23, and 36 thereof, the Commission is proposing amendments to Title 17,
Chapter II of the Code of Federal Regulations as follows.
284

Firms often disclose multiple activities, so the number of disclosed activities in this
discussion exceeds the number of firms.

285

Hedging activity is proprietary trading activity.

2. Section 240.15b9-1 is revised to read as follows:
§240.15b9-1 Exemption for certain exchange members.
Any broker or dealer required by section 15(b)(8) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8)) to
become a member of a registered national securities association shall be exempt from such
requirement if it:
(a) Is a member of a national securities exchange;
(b) Carries no customer accounts; and
(c) Effects transactions in securities solely on a national securities exchange of which it is
a member, except that with respect to this paragraph (c):

132

(1) A dealer that conducts business on the floor of a national securities exchange may
effect transactions off the exchange, for the dealer’s own account with or through another
registered broker or dealer, that are solely for the purpose of hedging the risks of its floor-based
activities, by reducing or otherwise mitigating the risks thereof. A dealer seeking to rely on this
exception shall establish, maintain and enforce written policies and procedures reasonably
designed to ensure and demonstrate that such hedging transactions reduce or otherwise mitigate
the risks of the financial exposure the dealer incurs as a result of its floor-based activity. Such
dealer shall preserve a copy of its policies and procedures in a manner consistent with 17 CFR
240.17a-4 until three years after the date the policies and procedures are replaced with updated
policies and procedures; and
(2) A broker or dealer may effect transactions off the exchange resulting from orders that
are routed by a national securities exchange of which it is a member, to prevent trade-throughs
on that national securities exchange consistent with 17 CFR 242.611.
