EXTENSION ORDER

The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time, until
January 30, 2014, for entry of an order approving or disapproving the proposed Plan of
Distribution that was noticed for public comment on September 30, 2013.
In its request, the Division states that since the issuance of the Commission’s July 20,
2012 Order Making Findings and Imposing Remedial Sanctions Pursuant to Section 203(f) of
the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 and Section 15(b)(6) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (“Order”), 1 Respondent Charles L. Rizzo paid disgorgement, prejudgment interest and
civil penalties to the Commission in accordance with the Order. Respondent Gina M.
Hornbogen has made disgorgement payments as set forth in the Order. The Order created a
Fair Fund pursuant to Section 308(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended.
On September 30, 2013, pursuant to Rule 1103 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair
Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 2 the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment (“Notice”) for the distribution of monies placed

into the Fair Fund. 3 The Notice provided all interested parties thirty (30) days from the date
of the Notice to submit a comment on the proposed Plan of Distribution.
The Commission received comments on the proposed Plan of Distribution. The
Division believes that further evaluation, analysis and consultation with other offices are
required to properly address the comments. Consequently, the Division requests that the
Commission extend the time to issue an order approving or disapproving a proposed plan of
distribution to January 30, 2014.
Accordingly, pursuant to Rule 1104 of the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and
Disgorgement Plans, 4 for good cause shown, it is hereby ORDERED that the time for entering
an order approving or disapproving the proposed Plan of Distribution is extended to January
30, 2014.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
