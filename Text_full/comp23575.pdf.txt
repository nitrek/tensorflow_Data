1

Case 2:16-cv-01413 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 2 of 16

SUMMARY OF THE ACTION
1.

This action concerns an elaborate and fraudulent scheme to evade the registration

provisions of Sections 5(a) and 5(c) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”) [15 U.S.C.
§§ 77e(a) and 77e(c)] in connection with securities issued by Defendant Hemp, Inc. (“Hemp”).
2.

This long-running and profitable scheme resulted in the sale of hundreds of

millions of unregistered and purportedly unrestricted Hemp shares to public investors. The
execution of this scheme involved, among other things, purported gifts and consulting
agreements that do not appear to have been bona fide and fraudulent statements made to
Commission-registered broker-dealers.
JURISDICTION AND VENUE
3.

The Commission brings this action pursuant to Sections 20(b) and 20(d) of the

Securities Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b) and 77t(d)] and Sections 21(d) and 21(e) of the Exchange
Act [15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78u(e)].
4.

This Court has subject matter jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Section 22

of the Securities Act [15 U.S.C. § 77v], Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C.
§§ 78u(d) and 78aa], and 28 U.S.C. § 1331.
5.

Venue in this District is proper pursuant to Section 22(a) of the Securities Act [15

U.S.C. § 77v(a)] and Section 27(a) of the Exchange Act [15 U.S.C. § 78aa(a)]. Acts, practices,
and courses of business constituting the violations alleged herein have occurred within the
jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the District of Nevada and elsewhere.
Moreover, certain defendants resided or transacted business in this district. Venue also is
appropriate pursuant to 28 U.S.C. § 1391. A substantial part of the events or omissions giving
rise to the claims discussed herein occurred within this district [28 U.S.C. § 1391(b)(2)].

STATEMENT OF FACTS
Background
15.

As CEO of Hemp, a company with unregistered securities, Bruce Perlowin is and

was by definition an “affiliate” of Hemp.
16.

In order to circumvent the limitation restricting the sale of unregistered Hemp

shares and obtain access to additional funds which could be raised through the sale of additional
Hemp shares while concurrently avoiding the registration of Hemp’s shares, Bruce Perlowin and
Barry Epling connived to have Bruce Perlowin convey to Barry Epling’s and Jed Perlowin’s
respective companies (Defendants Ferris, Hobbes, Diversified, and QEP) hundreds of millions of
Hemp shares so that the recipients could then, under the guise of being non-affiliates, sell those
purportedly unrestricted shares into the market.
FRAUDULENT SCHEME
17.

Each of the named Defendants was engaged as a component part of a coordinated

and fraudulent scheme to sell to public investors millions of unregistered and purportedly
unrestricted Hemp securities that were, in fact, restricted.

4

Case 2:16-cv-01413 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 5 of 16

A.

Epling, Ferris, and Hobbes
18.

Bruce Perlowin and Barry Epling connived to have Bruce Perlowin convey to

Barry Epling’s and Jed Perlowin’s companies hundreds of millions of Hemp shares to be sold
into the public market place.
19.

Barry Epling, through his companies Ferris and Hobbes, received large numbers

of Hemp shares via multiple transactions with Bruce Perlowin, Hemp, and other entities
affiliated with the foregoing.
20.

On August 2, 2011, Ferris entered into a consulting agreement with Hemp

pursuant to which it subsequently received 6,250,000 Hemp common shares.
21.

On August 1 and November 14, 2012, Ferris received a combined total of

100,000,000 Hemp common shares (50,000,000 on each date) as gifts from Harmony Financials,
LLC (“Harmony”) in recognition of “affection and appreciation for over 20 years of friendship
and loyal assistance.”
22.

On November 16, 2012, two days after Ferris received the second 50,000,000

Hemp share gift from Harmony, Ferris received another 40,000,000 Hemp shares as a gift from
Bruce Perlowin for the same stated reason.
23.

On September 9, 2013, Hobbes and QEP entered into an agreement by which

Hobbes was to provide “business consulting services” to QEP. Hobbes was paid for these
consulting services with 100,000,000 shares of Hemp.
24.

Barry Epling’s companies, Ferris and Hobbes, sold the Hemp shares they received

and used a material portion of the proceeds for the benefit of and at the direction of Bruce
Perlowin and Hemp.
25.

During the relevant period, the majority of Ferris’s revenue and all of Hobbes’

5

Case 2:16-cv-01413 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 6 of 16

revenue came from the sale of Hemp shares.
B.

Jed Perlowin, QEP, and Diversified
26.

In November 2011, QEP was formed by Bruce Perlowin. In October of 2012,

Bruce Perlowin transferred over 168 million preferred shares of Hemp to QEP.
27.

In June 2013, Bruce Perlowin and Craig Perlowin (an officer of Hemp and a

brother of Bruce Perlowin’s) resigned from QEP, and another of Bruce Perlowin’s brothers, Jed
Perlowin, purportedly took sole ownership and control of QEP. At the time, the company had an
asset value, based upon its ownership of Hemp stock, of over $9,000,000.
28.

After only one month of being in control of QEP, Jed Perlowin began selling

Hemp shares into the market by entering into agreements with third-party sellers and, later,
through the opening of brokerage accounts.
29.

Diversified was legally formed on March 20, 2014, with Jed Perlowin listed as its

managing member.
30.

Six days after the formation of Diversified, on March 26, 2014, Jed Perlowin

signed documents to establish a brokerage account in Diversified’s name with a Commission
registered broker-dealer.
31.

On April 7, 2014, 50,000,000 Hemp shares were issued to Diversified from

Bruce’s personal holdings. That same day, another 10,000,000 Hemp shares were issued to
Diversified from Eco-Harmony Festival Inc., another of Bruce Perlowin’s numerous entities.
32.

Jed Perlowin, beginning May 2014, transferred 20,000,000 shares of Hemp to the

brokerage account and began selling the shares into the market. An additional 6,640,000 were
later transferred into the brokerage account and sold into the market.
33.

QEP’s and Diversified’s income was almost entirely derived from the sale of

6

Case 2:16-cv-01413 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 7 of 16

Hemp shares.
34.

Jed Perlowin’s companies, QEP and Diversified, sold millions of Hemp shares

and used a material portion of the proceeds for the benefit and at the direction of Bruce Perlowin
and Hemp.
C.

Misrepresentations
35.

In furtherance of their scheme, Bruce Perlowin, Barry Epling, Jed Perlowin,

Hemp, QEP, and Hobbes in their written statements to Alpine Securities and Scottsdale Capital,
both of which are Commission-registered broker-dealers, engaged in misrepresentations
concerning the circumstances under which the Hemp securities had been obtained and their
restricted status in order facilitate the sale of the Hemp securities. Based upon these statements,
both Scottsdale Capital and Alpine Securities participated in the deposit and subsequent sale of
the restricted Hemp securities, and investors, who reasonably would have believed that Hemp
securities obtained via market transactions were unrestricted, went forward in purchasing them.
36.

These misstatements/omissions were material and made in connection with the

purchase or sale of Hemp securities.
C.

Summary
37.

Over the course of several years Hemp shares were gifted, sold, and transferred to

various entities and persons in order to attempt to remove the registration restriction and sell the
shares to public investors to obtain funding for Hemp and Bruce Perlowin.
38.

Through this scheme to evade the registration requirements of Section 5 of the

Securities Act, investors were deprived of material information concerning Hemp that would
normally be present in a registration statement filed with the Commission in connection with a
securities offering.

7

Case 2:16-cv-01413 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 8 of 16

39.

The Defendants’ scheme involved, among other things, the use of nominees,

phony gifting of stock, bogus consulting agreements, and forged documentation, all of which
were utilized to avoid registration requirements and sell Hemp securities.
40.

Bruce Perlowin, as CEO of Hemp; Barry Epling, as principal of Ferris and

Hobbes; and Jed Perlowin, as principal of Diversified and QEP; each possessed legal control of
their respective companies and knowledge of their companies’ actions. As the companies could
not act without, as applicable, Bruce Perlowin’s, Barry Epling’s, and Jed Perlowin’s impetus,
they each are control persons and, as such, subject to liability for their respective companies’
actions.
Scienter
41.

The Defendants acted with scienter. Barry Epling and Jed Perlowin were actively

and repeatedly sharing proceeds of the sales of their Hemp shares with or for the benefit of
Hemp and Bruce Perlowin and at his direction. The Defendants knew that the shares were
restricted and entered into a scheme to remove the restrictions, sell the shares, and receive funds
from the sale of such shares.
Materiality
42.

The misrepresentations and omissions made to Commission-registered broker-

dealers detailed above are material to a reasonable broker-dealer and to investors. Furthermore,
most or all of the investors who purchased the shares of Hemp sold by Ferris, Hobbes,
Diversified, and QEP would not have purchased the shares had they known the true restricted
nature of the securities.
43.

The inappropriate sale of Hemp securities by the Defendants deprived investors of

material information concerning Hemp that would normally be present in a registration statement

8

Case 2:16-cv-01413 Document 1 Filed 06/20/16 Page 9 of 16

filed with the Commission in connection with a securities offering.
UNREGISTERED TRANSACTIONS
44.

Hemp has never filed a registration statement with the Commission, nor has

Hemp ever qualified for any exemption from the registration requirement.
45.

Despite owning unregistered, restricted securities, the Defendants, over the course

of multiple years, directly and indirectly, sold unregistered Hemp securities into the market.
46.

Defendants, through the use of interstate commerce, sold millions of shares of

Hemp securities into the market through the use of brokerage accounts and selling agreements
with third-parties.
