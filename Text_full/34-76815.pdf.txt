The Division of Enforcement (“Division”) has requested an extension of time
until March 15, 2016 to submit a proposed Plan of Distribution under Rule 1101(a) of
the Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans, 17 CFR 201.1101(a).
On August 14, 2014, the Commission issued an Order Instituting
Administrative and Cease-and-Desist Proceedings, Pursuant to Sections 15(b) and 21C
of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, Making Findings, and Imposing Remedial
Sanctions and a Cease-and-Desist Order (“Order”) against Linkbrokers Derivatives
LLC (“Linkbrokers” or “Respondent”).1 The Order required Respondent to pay
disgorgement of $14,000,000 to the Commission within 14 days of the entry of the
Order.
On November 20, 2014, the Commission granted the Division’s request for an
extension until June 30, 2015 to submit a proposed plan of distribution. On July 1,
2015, the Commission granted the Division’s request for a second extension until

Exchange Act Release No. 72846 (Aug. 14, 2014).

December 31, 2015 to appoint a fund administrator and set an appropriate bond
amount for the fund administrator. Once the bond administrator was chosen a
proposed plan of distribution was developed in conjunction with the selected fund
administrator. The Division now requests a third extension. In its request for an
extension of time, the Division states that it requires additional time to finalize the
proposed plan of distribution.
Accordingly, for good cause shown, IT IS HEREBY ORDERED that the
Division’s request for an extension of time until March 15, 2016 to submit a proposed
Plan of Distribution is granted.
For the Commission, by its Secretary, pursuant to delegated authority.

Secretary
