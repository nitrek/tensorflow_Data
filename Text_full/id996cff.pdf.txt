INITIAL DECISION
April 5, 2016

Nancy A. Brown and Michael D. Birnbaum for the
Division of Enforcement, Securities and Exchange Commission
Scott S. Balber, Emily Abrahams, and David W. Leimbach of
Herbert Smith Freehills New York LLP for
Respondent Gilles T. De Charsonville

BEFORE:

Carol Fox Foelak, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This Initial Decision bars Gilles T. De Charsonville from the securities industry. He was
previously enjoined against violations of the antifraud provisions of the federal securities laws.
I. INTRODUCTION
A. Procedural Background
The Securities and Exchange Commission instituted this proceeding with an Order
Instituting Proceedings (OIP) on July 30, 2015, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). The proceeding is a follow-on proceeding based on SEC
v. Balboa, No. 1:11-cv-8731 (S.D.N.Y.), in which De Charsonville was enjoined against
violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act and of the Investment Advisers Act of
1940 (Advisers Act). In accordance with leave granted, the Division of Enforcement (Division)
filed a motion for summary disposition, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a); De Charsonville
filed an opposition, and the Division, a reply. See Gilles T. De Charsonville, Admin. Proc.
Rulings Release No. 3245, 2015 SEC LEXIS 4315 (A.L.J. Oct. 21, 2015).1

The motion for summary disposition, opposition, and reply, were timely filed on November 20,
2015, December 21, 2015, and January 8, 2016, respectively. Id.

This Initial Decision is based on the pleadings and De Charsonville’s Answer to the OIP.
There is no genuine issue with regard to any fact that is material to this proceeding. All material
facts that concern the activities for which he was enjoined were decided against him in the civil
case on which this proceeding is based. Any other facts in his pleadings have been taken as true,
pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.250(a). All arguments and proposed findings and conclusions that
are inconsistent with this decision were considered and rejected.
B. Allegations and Arguments of the Parties
The OIP alleges that De Charsonville was enjoined against violations of the antifraud
provisions in SEC v. Balboa. The Division urges that he be barred permanently from the
securities industry. De Charsonville opposes this, arguing that, at most, a censure or a temporary
suspension is an appropriate sanction.
C. Procedural Issues
1. Official Notice
Official notice pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323 is taken of the docket report and the
court’s orders in SEC v. Balboa.
2. Statute of Limitations
De Charsonville argues that the proceeding is barred because it was not brought within
the five-year statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2462.2 This argument fails. The
proceeding was initiated within five years of the July 17, 2015, injunction in SEC v. Balboa. De
Charsonville argues that since the violative conduct ended in 2008, the proceeding is untimely
because it was not brought within five years, noting that Exchange Act Section 15(b)(6)(A)(i)
authorizes the Commission to bar a person who “has committed or omitted any act, or is subject
to an order or finding, enumerated in [Section 15(b)(4)](A), (D), or (E)].” However, the instant
proceeding is not authorized by those sections but rather by Exchange Act Sections
15(b)(6)(A)(iii) and 15(b)(4)(C). De Charsonville in effect argues that the Commission was
required to institute this proceeding under Section 15(b)(6)(A)(i). This argument overlooks
prosecutorial discretion. See United States v. Batchelder, 442 U.S. 114, 124-26 (1979)
(upholding unfettered prosecutorial discretion to decide between statutes on which to charge a
defendant); see also Proffitt v. FDIC, 200 F.3. 859, 864-65 (D.C. Cir. 2000) (holding FDIC
action was within the statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C. § 2462 and stating “While the
FDIC might well have brought an action earlier under [another provision], its failure to do so

Recently, the Commission declared its non-acquiescence to the ruling of the U.S. Court of
Appeals for the D.C. Circuit in Johnson v. SEC, 87 F.3d 484, 488-92 (D.C. Cir. 1996), that
sanctions such as associational bars are subject to the statute of limitations set forth in 28 U.S.C.

does not render untimely, and therefore, unauthorized, its action based on the later occurring
effect.”).
3. Commission’s Authority
De Charsonville argues that this proceeding violates due process and the Appointments
Clause of the Constitution. However, the Commission has recently affirmed the constitutionality
of its administrative proceedings. See Raymond J. Lucia Cos., Exchange Act Release No. 75837,
2015 SEC LEXIS 3628, at *76-90 (Sept. 3, 2015), appeal pending, No. 15-1345 (D.C. Cir., filed
Oct. 5, 2015); accord Timbervest, LLC, Advisers Act Release No. 4197, 2015 SEC LEXIS 3854,

4. Collateral Estoppel
As the parties recognize, it is well established that the Commission does not permit a
respondent to relitigate issues that were addressed in a previous civil proceeding against the
respondent, whether resolved by summary judgment, as in SEC v. Balboa; by consent; or after a
trial. See John Francis D’Acquisto, Advisers Act Release No. 1696, 1998 SEC LEXIS 91, at *12 & n.1, *7 (Jan. 21, 1998) (injunction entered by summary judgment); Jeffrey L. Gibson,

Release No. 2151, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *2-10, *22-30 (July 25, 2003).
II. FINDINGS OF FACT
De Charsonville was enjoined in SEC v. Balboa from committing violations of Exchange
Act Section 10(b) and Rule 10b-5; Advisers Act Sections 206(1), (2), and (4) and Rule 206(4)-8;
and FINRA Rule 5210 on July 6, 2015. SEC v. Balboa, ECF No. 52. He was further ordered to
pay disgorgement of $297,174 plus prejudgment interest of $67,261.46 and third-tier civil
penalties of $260,000; he was ordered to pay these sums to the Commission by July 31, 2015. 3
SEC v. Balboa, ECF Nos. 52, 55.
Facts underlying SEC v. Balboa are set forth in the court’s July 6, 2015, Opinion and
Order, ECF No. 52, and are as follows: From 2003 through December 2011, De Charsonville
3

The court imposed the $260,000 penalty rather than possible higher amounts, in part because
“he is already paying a significant disgorgement award. . . . The Court believes such a penalty is
sufficient to deter future such conduct and to penalize De Charsonville for his violations, without
imposing undue hardship.” SEC v. Balboa, ECF No. 52 at 10-11. The Division represents that
De Charsonville has not paid the disgorgement, prejudgment interest, and penalty.

worked for BCP Securities, LLC, a broker-dealer. In 2007-2008, he worked out of BCP’s
Madrid office, brokering sales and purchases of emerging market bonds. He also provided his
clients with a complimentary mark-to-market service, providing valuations of securities in the
clients’ portfolios. At the same time, Michael Balboa, associated with Millenium Global
Investments, an investment manager, managed the portfolios for several Millenium Global funds
(the Funds). Investors were told that Balboa had no role in valuing assets. GlobeOp Financial
Services, LLC, was the Funds’ independent valuation agent. It valued the Funds’ holdings and
calculated their net asset values each month. For illiquid securities, GlobeOp solicited the
opinions of brokers or counter-parties trading such securities regarding their value. Under
Millenium’s agreement with GlobeOp, if Balboa and a counter-party disagreed, the counterparty’s valuation would control. Balboa suggested De Charsonville to GlobeOp as a broker who
could provide valuations. Each month, De Charsonville received a list of fifteen to twenty
securities from GlobeOp for which he was to provide valuations. Usually, he obtained
information by consulting Bloomberg, but for the Funds’ Nigerian warrants and Uruguayan
warrants, he used valuations supplied by Balboa. De Charsonville agreed to this approach with
Balboa in March or April 2007. In January 2008, De Charsonville began to suspect Balboa’s
valuations were not accurate. In May 2008, after GlobeOp questioned a valuation, De
Charsonville sought the true valuation from a third party and learned that Balboa’s valuations
were grossly inflated. He then asked Balboa to fabricate a justification that he would provide to
GlobeOp to support the inflated valuation. De Charsonville continued to participate in the
scheme because he did not want to lose Balboa as a client – in 2008 De Charsonville earned
$297,174 in profits from the fraud. In April 2008, De Charsonville confirmed Balboa’s false
valuations to Deloitte & Touche, which was auditing Millenium Global. When the Funds
collapsed in October 2008, De Charsonville lied to the Funds’ CEO, concealing the fact that the
valuations had come from Balboa and inventing explanations for the valuations. De
Charsonville also lied to Spanish and U.S. regulators about the scheme. Eventually, in January
2013, he provided the full truth after prosecutors refused to give him a deferred prosecution
agreement. Thereafter, he cooperated extensively with the Commission and the Department of
Justice, including testifying in the successful prosecution of Balboa.4 De Charsonville continues
to work as a broker selling emerging market securities.
Prior to the events related to Balboa, De Charsonville had an unblemished career for over
twenty years. Answer at 3. He no longer provides marks and will not do so in the future.
Answer at 5.
III. CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
De Charsonville has been been enjoined “from engaging in or continuing any conduct or
practice in connection with . . . the purchase or sale of any security” within the meaning of
Sections 15(b)(4)(C) and 15(b)(6)(A)(iii) of the Exchange Act.
4

Official notice, pursuant to 17 C.F.R. § 201.323, is taken of Balboa’s conviction of securities
fraud, wire fraud, and other violations. United States v. Balboa, No. 12-cr-196 (S.D.N.Y.).
Balboa was sentenced to forty-eight months of incarceration and ordered to pay restitution of
$390,243,873.92 and to forfeit $2,223,000. Id., ECF Nos. 160, 162.

IV. SANCTION
As the Division requests, a collateral bar will be ordered.
A. Sanction Considerations
The Commission determines sanctions pursuant to a public interest standard. See 15
U.S.C. § 78o(b)(6)(A). The Commission considers factors including:
the egregiousness of the defendant’s actions, the isolated or recurrent nature of the
infraction, the degree of scienter involved, the sincerity of the defendant’s
assurances against future violations, the defendant’s recognition of the wrongful
nature of his conduct, and the likelihood that the defendant’s occupation will present
opportunities for future violations.
Steadman v. SEC, 603 F.2d 1126, 1140 (5th Cir. 1979) (quoting SEC v. Blatt, 583 F.2d 1325, 1334
n.29 (5th Cir. 1978)), aff’d on other grounds, 450 U.S. 91 (1981). The Commission also
considers the age of the violation and the degree of harm to investors and the marketplace
resulting from the violation. Marshall E. Melton, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *4-5. Additionally,
the Commission considers the extent to which the sanction will have a deterrent effect. Schield
Mgmt. Co., Exchange Act Release No. 53201, 2006 SEC LEXIS 195, at *35 & n.46 (Jan. 31,
2006). The public interest requires a severe sanction when a respondent’s past misconduct
involves fraud because opportunities for dishonesty recur constantly in the securities business.
See Vladimir Boris Bugarski, Exchange Act Release No. 66842, 2012 SEC LEXIS 1267, at *18
n.26 (Apr. 20, 2012); Richard C. Spangler, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 12104, 1976 SEC
LEXIS 2418, at *34 (Feb. 12, 1976).
B. Sanction
As described in the Findings of Fact, De Charsonville’s conduct was egregious and
recurrent, over a period of more than a year. His conduct involved a high degree of scienter, as
shown by his continuing to participate in the scheme after realizing that Balboa’s valuations were
grossly inflated in order to keep Balboa as a client and by his lying to the Funds’ CEO, auditors,
and regulators about the scheme until January 2013. At that point, when faced with prosecution,
he cooperated extensively in the successful prosecution of Balboa. His occupation, if he were
allowed to continue it in the future, would present opportunities for future violations, despite his
assurance that he will refrain from providing marks. Absent a bar, he could continue in the
securities industry. The violations are neither recent nor distant in time. De Charsonville has
recognized the wrongful nature of his conduct. Any direct financial harm to investors solely
attributable to De Charsonville’s conduct cannot be quantified. However, as the Commission
has often emphasized, the public interest determination extends beyond consideration of the
particular investors affected by a respondent’s conduct to the public-at-large, the welfare of
investors as a class, and standards of conduct in the securities business generally. See
Christopher A. Lowry, Investment Company Act of 1940 Release No. 2052, 2002 SEC LEXIS
2346, at *20 (Aug. 30, 2002), aff’d, 340 F.3d 501 (8th Cir. 2003); Arthur Lipper Corp., Exchange
5

Act Release No. 11773, 1975 SEC LEXIS 527, at *52 (Oct. 24, 1975). An injunction involving
dishonesty weighs in favor of a bar, and because of the Commission’s obligation to ensure
honest securities markets, an industry-wide bar is appropriate.
De Charsonville notes that Balboa, not he, instituted the fraudulent scheme, and that he
was unaware of the fraud at first. However, the fact that others were involved in the misconduct
does not relieve him from responsibility. See James J. Pasztor, Exchange Act Release No.
42008, 1999 SEC LEXIS 2193, at *15-18, *25-29 (Oct. 14, 1999) (supervisor held liable for
registered representative’s execution of violative directed trades; supervisor had tried to stop the
trading but was overruled by broker-dealer’s owner who was friendly with the customer);
Charles K. Seavey, Advisers Act Release No. 2119, 2003 SEC LEXIS 716, at *12-14, *19-21
(Mar. 27, 2003) (associated person found liable where investment adviser required him to sign
materially misleading letter), aff’d, 111 F. App’x. 911 (9th Cir. 2004). De Charsonville also
points to his previously unblemished record in the securities industry, but a lack of a disciplinary
record is not an impediment to imposing sanctions for a respondent’s first adjudicated
disciplinary violation. See Robert Bruce Lohmann, Exchange Act Release No. 48092, 2003 SEC
LEXIS 3171, at *15-17 (June 26, 2003); Martin R. Kaiden, Exchange Act Release No. 41629,
1999 SEC LEXIS 1396, at *29-30 (July 20, 1999); see also Mitchell M. Maynard, Advisers Act
Release No. 2875, 2009 SEC LEXIS 1621, at *42 & n.39 (May 15, 2009) (“[T]he absence of
disciplinary history is not mitigative as securities professionals should not be rewarded for
complying with securities laws.”); accord Gary M. Kornman, Exchange Act Release No. 59403,
2009 SEC LEXIS 367, at *32 & n.40 (Feb. 13, 2009), pet. denied, 592 F.3d 173 (D.C. Cir.
2010).
De Charsonville argues, based on the Steadman factors, that any sanction should be
limited to a censure or suspension. However, the Commission considers an antifraud injunction
to be especially serious and to subject a respondent to the severest of sanctions. Marshall E.
Melton, 2003 SEC LEXIS 1767, at *29-30. Indeed, from 1995 to the present, there have been
over thirty-five litigated follow-on proceedings based on antifraud injunctions in which the
Commission issued opinions, and all of the respondents were barred 5 – thirty-four unqualified
bars and three bars with the right to reapply after five years.6 Further, in every such case that
followed the statutory provision of collateral bars, the Commission imposed a collateral bar
rather than an industry specific bar, reasoning that the antifraud provisions of the securities laws
apply broadly to all securities-related professionals and violations demonstrate unfitness for
future participation in the securities industry, even if the disqualifying conduct is not related to
5

The pre-Dodd-Frank cases imposed industry-specific bars, such as a bar from association with
an investment adviser on a respondent who had been associated with an investment adviser at the
time of his violation.
6

Those three were Richard J. Puccio, Exchange Act Release No. 37849, 1996 SEC LEXIS 2987
(Oct. 22, 1996); Martin B. Sloate, Exchange Act Release No. 38373, 1997 SEC LEXIS 524
(Mar. 7, 1997); and Robert Radano, Advisers Act Release No. 2750, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1504
(June 30, 2008). The Commission’s opinions do not make clear the factors that distinguished
these cases from those in which unqualified bars were imposed, but there is little difference
between a “bar” and a “bar with the right to reapply in five years.”
6

the professional capacity in which the respondent was acting when he or she engaged in the
misconduct underlying the proceeding. See John W. Lawton, Advisers Act Release No. 3513,
2012 SEC LEXIS 3855, at *42-43 (Dec. 13, 2012).
V. ORDER
IT IS ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 15(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
GILLES T. DE CHARSONVILLE IS BARRED from associating with any broker, dealer,
