FOREWORD
The 21st Annual Report of the Securities and Exchange Commission
to the Congress for the fiscal year July 1, 1954, to June 30, 1955,
describes the Commission's activities during the year in discharging
its duties under the statutes which it administers. These include
supervision of the registration of securities for sale in interstate
eommeree to the public, the surveillance of the interstate markets in
securities, regulation of the activities of brokers and dealers, regulation
of registered public utility holding company systems and investment
companies, as well as litigation in the courts.
In the fiscal year 1955 new issues of securities registered for public
) sale totaled almost $11 billion. This represents an increase of $1.8
I
billion over the previous fiscal year and compares with a previous
peak of $9.5 billion for the fiscal year 1952.
In addition to this increase in normal workload, the Oommission
has been engaged in a program to simplify forms, eliminate duplicate
filings and relieve those subject to regulation of unnecessary burdens
without prejudicing the interest of investors. Though a reduced
workload should ultimately result from this program, because of the
complexity of such matters, such a program involves a large expenditure of time by high grade personnel. This program is continuing
into fiscal 1956.
The Commission's work may be divided into two general classes.
First, there is the work which usually must be completed within
prescribed short-time limits. Examples of this are the registration
statements relating to the raising of capital, applications of public
utility companies for financing, proxy soliciting material, brokerdealer registrations, and certain types of enforcement activity. Other
work, however, has no fixed time limit and is necessarily performed as
the staff is available to do the work. Examples of this are the review
of annual and periodic reports filed with the Commission, brokerdealer inspections, and certain applications for approval of transactions
subject to the Investment Act of 1940. In allocating personnel, preference must be given 0 the first category of work mentioned above.
Any reduction in personnel, therefore, tends to defer the handling of
other essential work.
During this year the Commission has continued to use every
effort to render an effective administration at a minimum of cost.

PART I
REVISIONS OF RULES AND FORMS
Progress has been made in the continuous program of revising the
Commission's rules and forms to keep abreast of constantly changing
techniques in the securities industry. Revisions during the 1955 fiscal
year included those made in consequence of the enactment of Public
Law 577, 83d Congress, Chapter 667, 2d session (68 Stat. 683),
approved August 10, 1954 and effective October 10, 1954.1 Certain
of these and various other changes made during the year are outlined
below. Other revisions of ruIes which are of primary interest to
special groups, such as brokers and dealers and public utility holding
companies, are described in the parts of this report dealing with the
regulation of the activities of such persons and companies.
Rule 154.-Because of the decision in the Ira Haupt & Company
case, 23 SEC 589 (1946), increasing doubts had arisen as to the scope
of the exemption provided by section 4 (2) of the Securities Act for
brokers' transactions effected on behalf of controlling persons. When
the appropriate congressional committees were considering the legislative changes embodied in Public Law 577, 83d Congress, the Senate
Committee on Banking and Currency took note of the fact that the
Commission had under study the adoption of a ruIe that would deal
with this particular problem and expressed its hope that such a rule
wouId effectively solve it.2
After completing its study, in connection with which public hearings
were conducted to obtain the widest possible range of views, the Commission adopted an amendment to ruIe 154 which defines the term
"brokers' transactions" as used in section 4 (2) to include transactions
of sale executed by a broker for the account of any person controlling,
controlled by, or under common control with an issuer where the
broker performs no more than the usual and customary broker's
function and receives no more than the usual and customary commission, where neither he nor, to his knowledge, his principal solicits orders
to buy, and where he is not aware of circumstances indicating that his
principal is an underwriter or engaged in a distribution of securities.
The ruIe contains a definition of the term "distribution" which will
serve as a guide for distinguishing between a distribution and an
1 This major change in the Federal securities laws was discussed in the 1954annual report.
Also described
therein was the Commlssron's adoption on Jllly 21, 195401Form S-9 which greatly simpillied the procedure
for registration under the Securities Act of non-convertible fixed interest debt secnrlties of American and
Oanadlan companies.

ordinary trading transaction entitled to the brokerage transaction
exemption.
Changes in rules made to conform to Public Law 577, 83d Congress.-Rule 433 under the Securities Act was adopted to conform
existing regulations to the statutory amendments. Under this rule
it is now permissible to make written offers to sell and solicitations of
offers to buy during the statutory 20 day waiting period between the
filing date and the effective date of a registration statement by means
of a preliminary prospectus which meets specified co rditions and is
filed with the Commission before its use.
Rule 460, concerning the preparation and distribution of preliminary
prospectuses, provides certain standards for the acceleration of the
effective dates of registration statements which theretofore had been
dependent upon administrative practice.
Rule 153,with respect to the delivery of a prospectus in a transaction
in a registered security effected on a national securities exchange was
amended to reduce from 1 year to 40 days the period after the commencement of an offering during which prospectuses must be made
available to the exchange for its members.
Rule 427 permits prospectuses used more than 9 months after the
effective date of a registration statement under the Securities Act to
omit required information insofar as information as of a date within
16 months of its use is provided on the same subject, in place of the
former provisions keyed to intervals of 13 and 12 months, respectively.
An exception was made, by the amendment of rule 413 under the
Securities Act, to the requirement that additional securities must be
registered by a separate registration statement. This exception
conforms to section 24 (e) (1) of the Investment Company Act, as
amended, which permits investment companies which engage in
continuous offerings of their shares to increase the number of their
registered shares by post-effective amendments. Corresponding
amendments were made in rules 457 and 470. This simpler procedure
was used by investment companies in 81 instances during the 9
months of the 1955 fiscal year after it became available.
Rule N-24E-1.-Section
24 (e) (3) of the Investment Company
Act, added by Public Law No. 577, 83d Congress, requires that a
prospectus relating to a security issued by a face-amount certificate
company or a redeemable security issued by an open-end management
company or unit investment trust "which varies for the purposes of
subsection (a) (3) of section 10 of the Securities Act of 1933 from the
latest prospectus filed as a part of the registration statement" must
be filed as a post-effective amendment in order to meet the requirements of section 10 of the Act, except to the extent the Commission
otherwise provides by rules and regulations.

TVfE~-FIRST

~AL

REPORT

3

The quoted language in section 24 (e) (3) refers to a prospectus
which is prepared for the purpose of providing more current information, in compliance with section 10 (a) (3), after the previous prospectus ceases to comply with that section because the information
therein is no longer sufficiently current to meet the statutory requirements. In practice, investment companies engaged in a continuous
offering of securities had customarily prepared such a revised prospectus at approximately annual intervals, and it was the purpose of
section 24 (e) (3) to require the filing of such a revision as a post-effective
amendment. Some apprehension was expressed, however, that the
quoted language of section 24 (e) (3) might be interpreted as including
any prospectus used more than nine months after the original effective
date which differs in any respect from the latest prospectus included
in the registration statement and, therefore, that it would be prudent
to file all such prospectuses as post-effective amendments. Reports
of congressional committees with respect to Public Law No. 577
indicate that section 24 (e) (3) was not intended to require the filing
of every changed prospectus as a post-effective amendment." The
Commission accordingly adopted rule N-24E-14o to make explicit
that section 24 (e) (3) applies only to prospectuses prepared for the
purpose of complying with section 10 (a) (3).
Rule 461.-This rule governs requests for acceleration of the effective date of a registration statement under the Securities Act. It
requires each such request to be made in writing by the registrant, the
managing underwriters, and the selling security holders, if any. It
provides further that the request should state the date upon which it
is desired that the registration statement shall be ordered effective.
Rule 133.-This rule makes clear through certain definitions that
the registration and prospectus requirements of the Securities Act
are inapplicable to certain mergers, consolidations, reclassifications
of securities, and transfers of assets between two corporations. It
was broadened by the adoption of an amendment which also excludes
from these requirements certain cases involving a parent company,
a controlled company, and a third corporation, where the assets of
the third corporation are transferred to the controlled company in
consideration of the issuance of securities of the parent corporation.
The occasion for this amendment arose from the somewhat similar
amendment that had been made in section 368 (a) (1) (c) of the Internal Revenue Code, which defines tax-free "reorganizations"."

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Rules 134 and 135.-Rule 134, adopted shortly after the fiscal year,
is expected to facilitate greatly the dissemination of information about
a security before the sale thereof. It specifies the information required
and permitted to be included in a notice, advertisement, letter or
other communication with respect to a security which identifies the
security and states from whom a prospectus may be obtained. Such
a communication may be used prior to or after the effectiveness of
the registration statement and is not deemed to constitute a "prospectus" as defined in section 2 (10) of the Securities Act. It is designed to permit an adequate announcement identifying the existence
of a public offering and the availability of a prospectus. At the same
time the Commission adopted rule 135 which provides that a notice
or other eommunieation sent by an issuer to security holders to inform
them of the proposed issuance of rights to subscribe to additional
securities shall not be deemed to offer any security for sale if the
communication is transmitted within 60 days prior to the record date,
states that the offering will be made only by the prospectus and in
addition contains only certain specified information necessary to inform the security holders of the forthcoming offering. The rule is
in the nature of an interpretative rule and in substance gives specific
authority for a practice which had theretofore been followed without
objection by the Commission."
Rules 423, 428, and 404.-Amendments
were made to these
rules so that certain issuers of securities to be offered at competitive
bidding would be permitted to invite competitive bids prior to the
effective date of a registration statement which has been filed under
the Securities Act with respect to the securities. 7
Regulation A.-Rules 216 and 217 were amended to make Regulation A available for a rights offering by a domestic or foreign
majority-owned subsidiary of any resident of the United States having
its principal business in the United States and its securities registered
for trading on a national securities exchange; and to exclude from the
computation of the $300,000 limitation of Regulation A that portion
of a warrant or rights offering pro rata to security holders made
outside of the United States."
Form. 9-K and Related Rules.-After
considerable study of the
adequacy of its periodic reporting requirements, the Commission
adopted a new Form 9-K and related Rules X-13A-13 and X-15D-13
to provide for semi-annual reports under the Securities Exchange Act.
These reports will supply investors with important additional information about their securities. A report on the new form is to be filed

only once a year, 45 days after the end of the first half of the registrant's fiscal year. Each report is to contain specified items of information with respect to sales and gross revenues, net income before and
after taxes, extraordinary and special items, and charges and credits
to earned surplus. The form does not require formal statements of
profit and loss or earned surplus and is not required to be certified.
Provision is made for any necessary or appropriate qualification or
explanation of the information given. Where registrants otherwise
issue semi-annual statements containing the information called for
by the form, copies of such statements may be filed and incorporated
by reference in the form in lieu of setting forth the information in the

Form. lo-K.-Instruction
8 of the instructions as to financial statements in Form 10-K, the principal form for annual reports filed by
listed companies under the Securities Exchange Act, was amended to
provide that financial statements need not be certified if the registrant
is not in production and meets other conditions."
Regulation BW.-This
regulation, adopted January 9, 1950, pursuant to section 15 (a) of the Bretton Woods Agreements Act, specifies
the periodic and other reports required to be filed with the Commission
by the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.
In
the light of its experience, the Commission during the 1955 fiscal year
amended this regulation to change certain reports from a monthly to a
quarterly basis, and to eliminate certain information which duplicated
data otherwise available or which, in view of the special character of
the Bank, was no longer necessary for the protection of investors."
Revisions Under Consideration.-The
Commission devoted much
study during the 1955 fiscal year to other important changes in its
rules and regulations, the determination of action upon which is in
general awaiting the receipt and study of public comment that has
been invited. Two of the pzincipal proposals under consideration are
revisions of the regulations governing the offering of small issues and
of the proxy rules;
The Commission on July 18, 1955, announced a proposal for revision
and consolidation of Regulation A, relating to domestic offerings, and
Regulation D, covering Canadian offerings, pursuant to which issues
not in excess of $300,000 are exempted from registration, and invited
public comment upon the changes contemplated thereby."
A principal fealture of the suggested revision is the imposition of
special requirements which would apply only to promotional companies .

The proposal to amend the proxy rules relates chiefly to the application of such rules to proxy contests. The proposed changes are designed to make the proxy rules more specific than the existing rules by
incorporating in the regulation certain policies of the Commission
regarding proxy contests previously dependent upon administrative
interpretation and practice.

PART II
ADMINISTRATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933
The Securities Act of. 1933 is designed to provide disclosure to
investors of material facts concerning securities publicly offered for
sale by use of the mails or instrumentalities of interstate commerce,
and to prevent misrepresentation, deceit or other fraudulent practices
in the sale of securities. Disclosure is obtained by requiring the
issuer of such securities to file with the Commission a registration
statement, and related prospectus, containing significant information
about the issuer and the offering. These documents are available for
public inspection as soon as they are filed. In addition the prospectus
must be furnished to the purchaser at or before the sale or delivery
of the security. The contents of the registration statement are the
primary responsibility of the registrant and the underwriter. The
Commission has no authority to control the nature or quality of a
security to be offered for public sale or to approve or disapprove its
merits or the terms of its distribution.
DESCRIPTION
Registration

Statement

OF THE REGISTRATION

PROCESS

and Prospectus

Registration of any security proposed to be publicly offered may
be secured by filing with the Commission a registration statement on
the applicable form containing prescribed disclosures. The Commission has adopted several such forms designed to disclose appropriately
for the type of issue involved the classes of information specified in
Schedule A of the Act. In general the registration statement must
describe such items as the names of persons who participate in the
direction, manangement, or control of the issuer's business; their
security holdings and remuneration and options or bonus and profitsharing privileges allotted to them; the character and size of the business enterprise; its capital structure and past history and earnings;
its financial statements, certified by independent accountants; underwriters' commissions; pending or threatened legal proceedings; and
the purpose to which the proceeds of the offering are to be applied.
The prospectus constitutes a part of the registration statement and
presents in summary the more important of the required disclosures.
Examination

Procedure

The Commission is charged with the responsibility of preventing
the sale of securities to the public on the basis of statements which
contain inaccurate or incomplete information. The staff of the Division of Corporation Finance examines each registration statement
7

8

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

for compliance with the standards of disclosure and usually notifies
the registrant by an informal letter of comment of any material
respects in which the statement on its face apparently fails to conform
to these requirements. The registrant is thus afforded an opportunity to file an amendment before the statement becomes effective.
In addition, the Commission has power, after notice and opportunity
for hearing, to issue an order suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement. Information about the use of this power during the
1955 fiscal year appears below.
TiJne Required to Complete Registration

Because prompt examination of a registration statement is important to industry, the Commission completes its analysis in the shortest
possible time. Congress provided for a lapse of 20 days in the ordinary
case between the filing date of a registration statement or of an amendment thereto and the time it may become effective. This waiting
period is designed to provide investors with an opportunity to become
familiar with the proposed offering. Widespread publicity is given to
information disclosed in the registration statement immediately on its
filing. The Commission is empowered to accelerate the effective date
so as to shorten the 20-day waiting period where the facts justify such
action. In exercising this power, the Commission is required by
statute to take into account the adequacy of the information already
available to the public, the complexity of the particular financing,
and the public interest and protection of investors.
The median time which elapsed between the filing and the effective
date with respect to 7041 registration statements that became effective during the 1955 fiscal year was 22 days, the same as the corresponding figure in the preceding year. This time was divided among
the three principal stages of the registration process approximately
as follows: (a) from date of filing registration statement to date of
letter of comment, 12 days, 2 days more than in the preceding year;
(b) from date of letter of comment to date of filing first material
amendment, 6 days, 1 day less than in the preceding year; and (c) from
date of filing first amendment to date of filing final amendment and
effective date of registration, 4 days, 1 day less than the year before.
VOLUME OF SECURITIES REGISTERED

Securities effectively registered under the Securities Act of 1933
during the fiscal year 1955 totalled almost $11 billion, the highest
volume in the 21-year history of the Commission. The previous
record amount of securities registered was $9.5 billion for the fiscal
year 1952. These figures cover all registrations including new issues
sold for cash by the issuer, secondary distributions, and securities

registered for other than cash sale, such as exchange transactions and
issues reserved for conversion of other securities.
The most important category of registrations, new issues to be sold
for cash for account of the issuer, amounted to $8.3 billion in the 1955
fiscal year as compared with an average of somewhat over $6 billion
for the five previous years. For the current fiscal year, the volume
of debt securities and the volume of common stock were almost equal,
48 percent and 47 percent, respectively, of the total of new cash issues.
Preferred stock amounted to less than 6 percent. For the fiscal year
1955 more than half of the volume of common stock represented
securities of investment companies.
Figures showing the number of statements, total amounts registered,
and a classification by type of security for new issues to be sold for
cash for account of the issuing company for each of the fiscal years
1935 through 1955 appear in appendix table 1. More detailed information on registrations for the 1955 fiscal year is given in appendix
table 2.
Of the dollar amount of securities registered in the 1955 fiscal year,
75.5 percent was for account of issuers for cash sale, 21.1 percent for
account of issuers for other than cash sale and 3.4 percent was for
account of others, as shown below. Most of the registrations involving issues not to be sold for cash cover securities offered in exchange for
other securities and securities reserved for conversion of other registered securities.

dollars the previous high mark reached in 1952 when 665 statements
were filed covering offerings of $9,045,035,056.
The number of statements filed by companies which had not
previously registered any securities under the Securities Act was 297,

aggregate amount of $1,245,656,263 of additional securities of investment companies which make continuous offerings of their shares.
EXEMPTION

FROM REGISTRATION

UNDER THE ACT

The Commission is authorized under section 3 (b) of the Act to
adopt rules providing exemption from the registration requirements
for public offerings of securities not exceeding a maximum of $300,000.
Among the six types of exemption provided by the Commission under
this authority, the three most commonly used are: Regulation A, the
general exemption for issues not exceeding $300,000 for issuers;
Regulation B, the exemption for fractional undivided interests in oil
or gas rights not exceeding $100,000; and Regulation D, the exemption for Canadian securities with the same dollar limitations as
Regulation A.
Exemption from registration under section 3 (b) of the Act does not
carry exemption from the civil liabilities for material misstatements or
omissions imposed by section 12 (2) or from the criminal liabilities
for' fraud imposed by section 17.
Exempt Offerings under Regulations A and D.

During the 1955 fiscal year 1,628 notifications were filed under
Regulation A, covering proposed offerings of $296,267,000, compared
with 1,175 notifications covering proposed offerings of $187,153,226
in the 1954 fiscal year. Included in the substantially greater 1955
total were 162 notifications covering stock offerings of $32,335,668
with respect to companies engaged in the oil and gas business, and
509 filings covering offerings of $107,585,913 with respect to mining
companies. These 509 filings by mining companies included 436
by uranium companies with proposed offerings aggregating
$95,804,119.2 In addition to initial offering circulars, 5,326 items of
supplemental sales literature were filed under Regulation A.

Reports of sales.-As an aid in determining whether violations of

to rules 320 (e) and 322 (c) of that regulation. During the 1955
fiscal year, 1,076 such reports covering aggregate sales of $549,951
were filed.
FORMAL

ACTION UNDER

SECTION

8

During the 1955 fiscal year three proceedings were instituted under
section S (d) to determine whether to issue a stop order suspending
the effectiveness of a registration statement.
In addition, the record
in one private examination under section 8 (e) was made public at
the request of counsel for the registrant.
Multi-Minerals
Corporation.-This
corporation, of Salt Lake
City, was organized on April 11, 1955, for the purpose of acquiring,
exploring, and developing uranium properties in Colorado, New
Mexico, and Utah. The registration statement proposed the public
offering of 2,250,000 shares of 1 cent par value common stock of which
1,500,000 shares were to be presently offered by the registrant at $1
per share and 750,000 shares were to be offered by certain selling
stockholders at times and prices to be determined. According to the

TWENTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

15

prospectus, the offering was to have been made through the underwriter, M. Raymond & Co., Inc., of New York, on a "best efforts"
basis for which it would receive a selling commission of 25 cents per
share. In addition, the company agreed to reimburse the underwriter
for expenses in an amount not to exceed $75,000 to be withheld from
the gross proceeds of the sale of stock and to pay $25,000 as compensation and out-of-pocket disbursements to counsel for the underwriter
and the company, Crisona Brothers, of New York.
Stanley J. Lake, promoter of the company who received 1,500,000
shares, sold 300,000 shares to the underwriter at $0.001 per share,
and 200,000 shares to counsel at the same price. The 1,500,000
shares were issued to Lake in exchange for mining claims which had
cost him $15,000 and on which he had contracted to pay an additional
$62,000. The $62,000 was to be paid to Lake out of the proceeds of
the stock sale.
The Commission's order for proceedings challenged the adequacy
and accuracy of various statements with respect to such matters as
(1) an estimate pertaining to ore at one property in the amount of
1,250,000 tons, averaging about $20 per ton in uranium oxide, (2) the
use of assays from a loose piece of rock weighing "over 5 pounds"
relating to another property aggregating almost $12,000 per ton of
ore in uranium, titanium, rare earths and other ore constituents and
(3) the selling stockholders and the number of shares being offered
for sale by each, the manner in which counsel proposed to dispose of
his shares and whether they would be sold in competition with the
offering by the issuer, and the full compensation to be paid in connection with distribution of the shares offered.
Following the institution of these proceedings, the registration
statement was withdrawn and the proceedings were thereupon discontinued."
Horton Aircraft Corporation.-The
Commission instituted proceedings under section 8 (d) with respect to the registration statement
filed by Horton Aircraft Corporation, of Las Vegas, Nev., which
related to a proposed public offering of 500,000 shares of Horton
Aircraft common stock at an initial public offering price of $1 per
share. Of these shares, 400,000 Were to be offered by the issuing
company and 100,000 by William E. Horton, its president. Proceeds
of the sale of company stock were to be used for the purpose of securing a factory or assembly structure in Santa Ana, Calif., and constructing a production model of the "Horton Wingless Aircraft."
The Commission announced that particular consideration would be
given at the hearing to questions as to the adequacy and accuracy of
statements concerning (1) the history and development of registrant's
business, particularly statements concerning the "Horton Wingless

(2) the nature of the "wingless" airplane produced and experimentation to be conducted; (3) the amount of securities outstanding, those
held by William E. Horton, and securities previously issued without
registration and the effect of having failed to register such shares, as
well as the plan for distribution of the securities being registered, the
prices at which they were proposed to be offered and the distribution
spread, particularly concerning the extent to which agents of the issuer, officers, directors and promoters would participate in underwriting commissions; (4) the proposed use of proceeds of the stock
sale, and the use to be made of any such proceeds should the entire
issue not be sold; and (5) transactions with promoters of the
registrant.
These proceedings were still pending at the close of the year.'
International
Spa, Inc.-This company :fileda registration statement by which it proposed to make a public offering of 12,000 shares
of common stock at $500 per share, and with respect to which the
Commission authorized proceedings to determine whether a stop
order should issue.
International Spa proposed to construct and operate a luxury hotel
together with a shopping center, theater, swimming pool, and other
facilities near Las Vegas, Nev., emphasizing the interracial aspects
of its proposed development. It proposed not only to offer publicly
12,000 common shares at $500 per share, but to issue an equal number
to the promoters "in payment for services rendered and to be rendered
during the sale and distribution of the registered stock."
Among other matters considered at the hearing were questions as
to the adequacy and accuracy of statements concerning (1) the general history and development of the registrant's business including
registrant's relationship to International Village, Inc., another corporation formed for similar purposes; (2) the option to purchase certain
acreage and the price to be paid by the registrant for such acreage,
the cost of such acreage to the seller, the value of such property, and
any commission to be paid in connection with its purchase; (3) the
plan of distribution of the shares, particularly the failure to disclose
any agreements or claimed agreement relating to the issuance of
stock to or for the account of the First National Company of Nevada;
(4) options to purchase securities of the registrant; and (5) the issuance of stock to the promoters, the failure to file financial statements
prepared in accordance with the Commission's requirements, and the
failure to disclose a contingent liability with respect to notes sold by
First National Company of Nevada with stock of International Spa .

These proceedings had not been terminated by the end of the
year,"
Cherokee Industries, Inc.-The
Commission announced that a
formal examination in progress with respect to the registration statement under the Securities Act filed by Cherokee Industries, Inc.,
Oklahoma City, had been made public at the request of counsel for
the registrant.
The registration statement proposed a public offering of 5 million
shares of Class B Non-voting Common Stock (1 cent par) at $1 per
share. To develop the facts with respect to the question whether
the registration statement and prospectus were complete and accurate and otherwise complied with the applicable disclosure requirements, the Commission instituted a private examination pursuant to
section 8 (e) of the Act. Counsel for the registrant moved that the
examination be converted into a proceeding under section 8 (d) to
determine whether a stop order should issue suspending the effectiveness of the registration statement and that the proceedings be
made public.
The Commission concluded that the section 8 (e) examination may
appropriately be made public, except to the extent that any witness
at the hearing should desire his testimony to remain confidential, but
that it was not appropriate in advance of the development of the
facts to direct the institution of stop-order proceedings. 6
RESULTS

OBTAINED BY THE REGISTRATION

PROCESS

Results secured by the staff's examination of registration statements during the 1955 fiscal year are illustrated by the following
examples.
Exploratory stage of mining venture clarified.-A
company engaged in exploration for iron, which had previously registered securities under the Act, filed during the 1955 fiscal year an additional
registration statement in connection with a proposed offering of common stock. Its stated purpose was principally to finance further
surveys and engineering activity.
Examination showed that, despite previous expenditures of over
$2 million, the existence of commercial bodies of iron ore had not been
established. Nevertheless, for several years promoters and other
persons identified with management had realized substantial trading
profits in a market seemingly influenced by misleading and deceptive
reports emanating from the company. For example, the company's
1954 annual report to stockholders had clearly implied the existence
of known iron-bearing deposits ready for commercial exploitation in
statements such as: "With the necessary exploration and metallurgical
s Securities ~ct release No. 3537(March 18, 19M).

research completed, negotiations with governmental authorities and
potential markets being pursued, your Directors are concentrating
their efforts toward the final objective of achieving production as
quickly as possible, and on the most favoring terms available."
As a result of the staff's comments in this situation, the current
prospectus was amended to include such disclosures as: (1) "The
properties of the Company are in the exploratory stage and no representation is intended that any commercial ore reserves have been
established;" (2) "The iron bearing material encountered is not direct
shipping ore and if any production is eventually had, it will involve
concentration;" and (3) "The iron ore deposits found to date have
been too low in iron and too high in impurities to produce a marketable product without milling or beneficiation." The registrant also
amended the prospectus to disclose that the company had departed
from its program of exploration of its own properties by making an
investment of $700,000 in another company with which two of its
directors were affiliated, and that this investment had resulted ill a
loss to the registrant in the amount of $345,802.
Statement withdrawn to avoid full disclosure of promoter's
business history.-A prospectus covering a proposed offering of common stock filed by a recently organized corporation engaged in the
merchandising of a proprietary vitamin and mineral tonic stated that
the promoter had previously had 5 years of experience with an earlier
corporation in developing and merchandising a similar proprietary
tonic under a different trade name; and that during this period the
company's sales of the product totaled in excess of $22 million and its
net profits totaled approximately $4 million. The prospectus failed
to disclose that almost immediately after the promoter relinquished
control of the earlier corporation, it went into bankruptcy, Federal
income tax liens were filed against it, and proceedings were instituted
by the Federal Trade Commission asserting that the corporation during the period it was under the control of the promoter had violated
the Federal Trade Commission Act by the dissemination of false advertisements of its product. After the staff's letter of comment pointed out these omissions, as well as other material omissions and misstatements, the registration statement was withdrawn.
Significant events after balance sheet date.-Appropriate
disclosure of significant events occurring after the date of financial statements required to be included in a registration statement is a recurring
problem. A statement filed during the 1955 fiscal year affords an interesting example in which the significant event was the payment of
cash to officers of the registrant.
In a note to the financial statements it was stated that payments
on certain obligations to affiliated persons, reported as noncurrent
liabilities in the balance sheet, had been accelerated subsequent to

TWENTY-FIRST

19

ANl\TUAL REPORT

the balance sheet date. Since the acceleration resulted in a substantial reduction in the working capital indicated in the balance
sheet, the registrant was requested to include in the captions, Total
Current Assets, and Total Current Liabilities, a cross-reference to the
note which was expanded to disclose the source of the funds used in
the acceleration. The disclosure indicated a reduction in working
capital of more than $500,000 in the two months after the balance
sheet date when working capital amounted to approximately $750,000.
In addition, the discussion in the forepart of the prospectus of the
transaction giving rise to the obligation was similarly clarified.
Effect of amortization of intangibles on the determination
of
income.-The
proper classification of and accounting for intangible
assets presents substantial problems in many cases. An example
from a registration statement for an issue of common stock follows:
The consolidated balance sheets included an item "contracts and
goodwill" in the amount of $7,332,389 which was represented as consisting principally of the excess of cost of acquisition over the cost of
inventories and allocated cost of assets acquired at the inception of
the corporation.
The footnotes to the financial statements disclosed that during the
year 1953 the corporation reached a settlement with the Internal
Revenue Service with respect to the 1946 to 1948 Federal income tax
returns, in which deductions were claimed for amortization of contracts. Under the terms of this settlement, the amount at which
"contracts and goodwill" was stated ($7,332,389) was construed for
Federal income tax purposes to be made up of $2,931,729 subject to
amortization on an agreed basis, and $4,400,660 was considered to be
goodwill and not subject to amortization.
The registrant was advised that the basis of settlement with the
Internal Revenue Service in this case was likewise appropriate in the
accounting for financial statement purposes and that segregation of
the item covering both contracts and goodwill should be made and
retroactive effect should be given to amortization of the contract
portion.
The financial statements were amended to show in the balance
sheet at June 30, 1954, the item of contracts and goodwill (segregated
in a note), after amortization of $1,881,490, at a net amount of
$5,450,899, which resulted in a reduction of earnings reinvested in
the business from $3,959,623 to $2,078,133 at the balance sheet date.

Typical of the illegal oil and gas and mining promotions requiring
Commission attention was that involved in S. E. O. v. Jess Hickey
Oil Oorporation, Jess Hickey and Loui M. White. 7 The Commission's
complaint charged that individual defendants falsely represented that
they believed they found the greatest undrilled oil field in the United
States, maybe in the whole world, so big that a half dozen oil fields
the size of the famed East Texas Field could be put in it with room
left over; and that all the leases they were offering for sale were on a
wonderful prospective oil structure."
In the case of S. E. O. v . Murma» Drilling 00., Inc., Dean Oook,
and Charles F. Jensen 9 the complaint alleged that the defendant was
selling its capital stock by misrepresentations to the effect that the
company had a "finding device" which had revealed commercial oil
pools under acreage held under lease by the company, that based on
the results of this device the enterprise was a sure thing and that
they could not miss finding commercial quantities of oil. A final
judgment by consent was obtained.
In S. E. C. v. Billings Holding Oorporation,t° a temporary restraining
order and preliminary injunction were obtained following institution
of injunctive action based upon alleged misrepresentations in the
sale of preferred stock concerning the financial status of the corporation, its ability to pay dividends 'On the preferred stock, the riskless
nature of the investment, and the uses to which the proceeds from the
sale of preferred stock would be put.
The Commission also obtained final judgments and decrees permanently enjoining Morris Luster, individually and doing business as
Luster Securities &: 00., and Stanley M. Posner J' from violating the
anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act. It was alleged in the
complaint that the defendants were effecting sales of stock at prices
bearing no reasonable relationship to the market prices thereof without
disclosing the prevailing market price and were falsely representing
that the issuer of the stock which they were selling would merge with a
nationally known corporation and that still another corporation was
interested in the issuer and buying up its outstanding stock.
Injunctions were also obtained in many other cases to prevent
further violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act.
Included in such actions were S. E. O. v. Warren Oil and Uranium

untrue statements in violation of the fraud provisions by representing,
among other things, that the Horton Wingless Airplane can carry

that travelers' checks were "securities" within the meaning of that
Act. The Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia granted the
Commission's motion to dismiss the petition for review for lack of
jurisdiction under either the Securities Act or the Administrative
Procedure Act.30 The Court held that in light of the complete discretion vested in the Commission by the statute respecting the institution of enforcement proceedings in particular cases, the letter in
question, even were it considered an "order", was not an "order"
such as could be reviewed by the courts. A petition for a writ of
certiorari was denied by the Supreme Court after the close of the
fiscal year.
Enforcement of Commission Subpoenas

Litigation also arose in connection with the Commission's investigation of Stardust, Inc., and Anthony C. Stralla. Mter the Commission
had applied to the United States District Court for the Southern
District of California for an order requiring obedience to its subpoena,
the defendants filed a petition with the Court of Appeals for the
Ninth Circuit to set aside the Oommission's order of investigation
and obtained a temporary stay of proceedings. 'They claimed that
the investigation would do them irreparable harm and prevent their
obtaining funds necessary to carryon their building enterprise. The
Commission moved for summary dismissal of the petition and for
dissolution of the stay order. The Commission's motion was granted
in a written opinion entered on July 29, 1955.31 Following this
decision the district court entered an order granting the Commission's
application.
Several questions were litigated in connection with the Commission's investigation to determine whether Edgar Robert Errion, Mt.
Hood Hardboard & Plywood Cooperative, and several other cooperatives may have violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities
Act. An attempt was made on the part of the Mt. Hood cooperative
to enjoin the Commission from continuing with its investigation and
it also sought a judgment declaring that the activities of the cooperative had been lawful. The Commission filed a motion to dismiss the
complaint, which was granted."
In the meantime, the Commission
had brought subpoena enforcement proceedings against two individuals
associated with the Mt. Hood cooperative. They had refused to be
sworn, basing their refusal upon the contention that the Commission's
investigation was not being conducted in conformity with the requirements for hearing set forth in sections 7 and 8 of the Administrative
Procedure Act. They urged that a subpoena should have been issued

that the sections of the Administrative Procedure Act respecting

action for enforcement of its subpoenas were S. E. O. v. John F.

Participation as Amicus Curiae

The Commission filed a memorandum of law as amicus curiae in
Kinsey v. Knapp.37 It was charged inter alia in that action that the
defendants had violated the Securities Act in failing to register an issue
of voting trust certificates. There were also counter charges of violations of Rule X-10B-5 by the plaintiffs in their acquisition of stock
of the company involved. The Commission's memorandum, submitted at the suggestion of the Court, contained a legal discussion of
the private offering exemption from registration provided by section
4 (1) of the Securities Act, the scope of the general anti-fraud provisions of the Federal securities laws and the effect of a violation of
such laws upon the validity of a transaction, and the availability of
the private remedies afforded to the parties in the particular lawsuit.

These questions arose in a private lawsuit in a federal district court
in Detroit to which the Commission was at no time a party." Plaintiffs' allegations of corporate mismanagement included, inter alia, a
charge that the defendant management had violated the Securities.
Act in failing to register an issue of voting trust certificates designed
to prevent the plaintiffs from obtaining control of the company.
Early in the litigation consummation of the voting trust was barred
by stipulation of the parties and by injunctive orders.
After the institution of the lawsuit, the Commission commenced
its own private investigation of the alleged violation. During the
trial the plaintiffs' attorney, at the suggestion of the District Judge,
served a subpoena upon the attorney in charge of the Commission's
Detroit branch office calling for the production of the Commission's
investigation file and for testimony on matters covered by the investigation. In an effort to cooperate and on the representation of
plaintiffs' counsel that this would fully satisfy his needs, the Commission released its correspondence with the parties to the litigation
and authorized the subpoenaed Commission employee to testify on
interviews and conversations which he may have had with the parties
or their representatives. Thereafter, upon the further request of
plaintiffs' counsel, the Commission voluntarily sent to Detroit two
staff officials from its Washington office for the limited purpose of
testifying on other conferences held in Washington with defendants'
attorneys. The questioning of Commission employees in Detroit,
however, went far beyond these conferences. Information was
sought on intra-agency communications, reports, recommendations
and internal administrative determinations with respect to the investigation and the action to be taken as a result thereof. Also sought
were the identities of, and information obtained from confidential
informants other than the parties to the litigation. The staff witnesses, obeying the Commission's rules and specific Commission
instructions, declined to divulge the information. The District
Judge having indicated that he might hold the staff witnesses in
contempt, the Commission's General Counsel, William H. Timbers,
went to Detroit to represent them. After several days of examination of Commission employees, the District Judge summarily
ordered Timbers himself, over his protest, to take the witness
stand. When Timbers refused to produce unconditionally a preliminary report of investigation in the Commission's file, he was
summarily held in contempt, committed to the custody of the
United States Marshal, and sentenced to 60 days imprisonment

unless he sooner purged himself of the alleged contempt. An appeal
was filed immediately and a stay of execution obtained from the
Court of Appeals.
In reversing and setting aside the contempt order and in directing
that Timbers be "completely absolved" from any "alleged contempt,"
the Court of Appeals also held that the District Judge had "overstepped appropriate judicial bounds" in seeking to conduct "a
searching inquisition" into the way in which the Commission was
carrying out its statutory responsibilities in the particular matter.
The appellate court also ruled that the District Judge had abused
"all justifiable discretion" in his conduct of the case and in his
treatment of the Commission's General Counsel.
The Department of Justice supported the position of the Commission and presented the matter to the appellate court.

PART III
ADMINISTRATION

OF mE
SECURITIES
OF 1934

EXCHANGE ACT

The Securities Exchange Act of 1934 is designed to insure the
maintenance of fair and honest markets in securities transactions on
the organized exchanges and in the over-the-counter markets. Accordingly, the Act provides for the regulation of such transactions
and of matters related thereto. It requires that information as to
the condition of corporations whose securities are listed on a national
securities exchange shall be made available to the public and provides
for the registration of such securities, exchanges, brokers and dealers
in securities, and associations of brokers and dealers. It also regulates the use of credit in securities trading. While the authority to
issue rules regarding such credit is lodged in the Board of Governors
of the Federal Reserve System, the enforcement of these rules and
the administration of the other provisions of the Act is vested in
the Commission.
REGULATION

OF EXCHANGES

AND EXCHANGE

TRADING

Registration and Exemption of Exchanges

At the close of the 1955 fiscal year the following 15 exchanges
were registered as national securities exchanges:
American Stock Exchange
Boston Stock Exchange
Chicago Board of Trade
Cincinnati Stock Exchange
Detroit Stock Exchange
Los Angeles Stock Exchange
Midwest Stock Exchange
New Orleans Stock Exchange

New York Stock Exchange
Philadelphia-Baltimore Stock
Exchange
Pittsburgh Stock Exchange
Salt Lake City Stock Exchange
San Francisco Mining Exchange
San Francisco Stock Exchange
Spokane Stock Exchange

Four exchanges were exempted from registration at the close of
the fiscal year:
Colorado Springs Stock Exchange
Honolulu Stock Exchange

Richmond Stock Exchange
Wheeling Stock Exchange

Disciplinary Action by Exchanges

Each national securities exchange reports to the Commission any
action of a disciplinary nature taken by it against any of its members,
or against any partner or employee of a member, for violation of the
Securities Exchange Act or any rule thereunder or of any exchange
rule. During the year, 7 exchanges reported 34 cases of disciplinary
action against members, member firms and partners of member firms.
The actions included fines ranging from $25 to $3,000 in 19 cases,
with total fines aggregating $13,400; expulsion of one individual and
26

one firm from exchange membership; suspension of two individuals
from exchange membership; and censure of individuals and firms for
infractions of exchange rules. The rules violated included those pertaining to conduct inconsistent with just and equitable principles of
trade, commission rates, capital requirements, floor trading and specialists, and the handling of orders.
REGISTRATION OF SECURITIES ON EXCHANGES

Unless a security is registered under the Act (or is exempt therefrom), it is unlawful to effect any transaction in the security on any
national securities exchange. Pursuant to section 12 an issuer may
register a class of securities on an exchange by filing with the Commission and the exchange an application which discloses pertinent
information concerning the issuer and its affairs. Each such issuer
is required by section 13 to file periodic reports keeping that information current. These applications and reports furnish details about
the issuer's capital structure, the terms of its securities, information
about the persons who direct, manage, or control its affairs, remuneration paid its officers and directors, allotment of options and bonus and
profit-sharing arrangements, and financial statements certified by independent accountants.
Applications for registration of securities and periodic reports filed
under this Act are examined by the staff of the Division of Corporation
Finance to determine whether the fair and adequate disclosure
required by the statute has been made.
Statistics of Securities Registered on Exchanges

At the close of the 1955 fiscal year, 2,219 issuers had 2,645 stock
issues and 1,013 bond issues registered on national securities exchanges.
During the year, securities of 90 new issuers became registered on
exchanges while the registration of all securities of 75 issuers was
terminated.
The following table shows for the fiscal year the number of applications filed under section 12 and of reports filed under section 13 and,
pursuant to undertakings contained in registration statements filed
under the Securities Act to supply information equivalent to that
supplied with respect to securities registered on an exchange, under
section 15 (d) of the Securities Exchange Act:

28

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Exchange Act often presents problems of disclosure analogous to
those arising under the Securities Act.
A registrant acquired during its fiscal year over 5'0 percent of the
stock of another company. According to a periodic report filed with
the Commission the acquisition was for investment and not for resale.
During the same year the acquired company paid a dividend exceeding
its entire earnings for that year. In its annual report for that year
the registrant reported its investment as a current asset and the entire
dividend received as income. When the staff objected to these procedures, the registrant sought to justify the accounting on the basis
that, between the time its fiscal year ended and its annual report to
shareholders was completed, the registrant had abandoned its original
plan to acquire additional shares of the company and eventually to
merge it. On this basis, it was urged that the shares held, being listed
securities, could properly be classified as a current asset and that
dividends received on the shares should be treated as income from
marketable securities without regard to the fact that those dividends
exceeded registrant's proportionate share in the earnings since the
date of acquisition. The staff noted, however, that the abandonment
of the original plan was only temporary, and that the plan was carried
out substantially in its original form. The financial statements were
amended to exclude the investment from current assets in the balance
-sheet, and to reduce that investment and the registrant's previously
reported income by the amount of dividends paid out of earnings
accumulated prior to the date of acquisition by the registrant. The
effect of the exclusion of the investment from current assets was to
reduce current assets from $5,900,000 to $2,800,000. Exclusion of
dividends paid from earnings prior to acquisition reduced net income
as reported from $352,000 to $189,000.
MARKET VALUE OF SECURITIES TRADED ON EXCHANGES

The unduplicated total market value on December 31, 1954, of all
stocks and bonds admitted to trading on one or more of the 19 stock
exchanges in the United States was $302,466,207,000.

The N ew York Stock Exchange and American Stock Exchange
figures are as reported by those exchanges. There is no duplication of
issues between them. The figures for all other exchanges are for the
net number of issues appearing only on such exchanges, excluding the
many issues on them which are also traded on one or the other New
York exchange. The number of issues as shown includes a few which
are not quoted by reason of suspension or otherwise.
The bonds on the New York Stock Exchange include United States
Government and New York State and City issues with an aggregate
market value of $83,353,859,000.

available for the other exchanges.
Comparison With Market Value of Securities Traded Over the Counter

Comparable figures for securities traded over the counter and not on
any exchange are not available since the Commission has limited
jurisdiction over such securities. However, the following estimates
concerning stocks traded over the counter in various categories have
been developed by the Commission. At the close of 1952, it was
estimated that some 3,500 domestic issuers whose stocks 'were traded
over the counter and who reported that they had or appeared to have
more than 300 stockholders had over-the-counter stocks with an aggregate market value of approximately $28 billion.' The Commission's
estimate for the close of 1954 is around $38 billion for approximately
the same number of domestic issuers. The $28 billion at the close of
1952 compared with $140.5 billion on the stock exchanges, while the
$38 billion at the close of 1954 compares with $194.9 billion on the
stock exchanges. There thus appears to be little change in the ratio
of these over-the-counter stocks to exchange stocks during the period,
despite the considerable number and amount of values transferred from
the over-the-counter to the exchange markets by new listings and by
mergers and absorptions into listed companies.

COMMISSION

UNUSTED TRADING PRIVILEGES ON EXCHANGES
Volume of Unlisted Trading in Stocks on Exchanges

Upon application to the Commission, exchanges may admit issues to
trading even though the issuer has not listed them on the particular
exchange, if one of the three conditions specified in section 12 (f) of
the Act is satisfied. Securities so admitted consist primarily of issues
listed on other exchanges and issues which were admitted to unlisted
trading when the statute was enacted.
The reported volume of shares traded on an unlisted basis on the
stock exchanges during the calendar year 1954 included approximately
32.5 million shares in stocks admitted to unlisted trading only and
30 million shares in stocks listed and registered on exchanges other
than those where the unlisted trading occurred. These amounts were
respectively about 3.25 percent and 3 percent of the total share
volume reported on all exchanges. The volumes in individual issues
as reported by the stock exchanges or other reporting agencies are
less than complete in some cases, particularly with respect to American
Stock Exchange figures, which exclude odd lots and other items not
reported on the stock tickers. Volumes of trading in short- term
rights are not included. Appendix table 8 shows the distribution of
share volumes among the various categories of unlisted trading
privileges on exchanges.
Applications for Unlisted Trading Privileges

Pursuant to applications filed by the exchanges with respect to
stocks listed on other exchanges, unlisted trading privileges were
extended during the fiscal year as follows:

During the fiscal year there were three applications by the American

securities previously admitted to unlisted trading privileges within
the meaning of paragraph (b) of rule X-12F-2. All of such applications were granted by the Commission.

DELI STING OF SECURITIES

FROM EXCHANGES

During the fiscal year ending June 301 1955, the Commission
granted 23 applications filed by exchanges or issuers to remove securities from exchange listing and registration pursuant to section
12 (d) and rule X-12D2-1. The applications included 7 by exchanges,
covering 1 bond issue and 6 stocks, and 16 by issuers, covering 16
stocks, 2 of which were removed from 2 exchanges. The applications
by exchanges were based on the reduction of public holdings to
amounts insufficient for further exchange trading. The applications
by issuers included 7 for delisting from some exchanges of stocks
which remained listed on other exchanges, 6 based on insufficient
amounts available for exchange trading, 2 where the proposition to
delist was made the subject of proxy statements and put to a vote of
shareholders, and 1 where the applicant. at the direction of the Commission, notified all of its stockholders by sending them a copy of its
application.
BLOCK DISTRIBUTIONS

REPORTED

BY EXCHANGES

Rule X-10B-2, in substance, prohibits any person engaged in distributing a security from paying any other person for soliciting or
inducing a third person to buy a security 011 a national securities
exchange. An exemption from the prohibition of the rule is provided
for those cases where compensation is paid pursuant to the terms of
a plan, filed by a national securities exchange and declared effective
by the Commission, authorizing the payment of such compensation
in connection with a distribution of securities.
At the present time two types of plans are in effect to permit a
block of securities to be distributed through the facilities of a national
securities exchange when it has been determined that the regular
market on the floor of the exchange cannot absorb the particular
block within a reasonable time and at a reasonable price or prices.
These plans have been designated the "Special Offering Plan" and
the "Exchange Distribution Plan."
In addition to these two methods of distributing large blocks of
securities on national securities exchanges, a third method is commonly employed to distribute blocks of securities listed on exchanges
to the public over the counter. This method is commonly referred
to as a "Secondary Distribution" and such a distribution generally
takes place after the close of exchange trading. It is generally the
practice of exchanges to require members to obtain the approval of the
exchange before participating in such secondary distributions.

AND STABILIZATION

Manipulation

The Securities Exchange Act prohibits manipulative practices in
the securities markets. The Commission's analysts watch for unusual or unexplained market activity. They observe the tickers of
the leading exchanges and examine the quotation sheets of all exchanges. The financial news-ticker, leading newspapers and various
financial publications and services are also closely followed. Over-..
the-counter surveillance is maintained by the examination of the bid~"
and offers appearing in the sheets of the national quotation services.
When unusual or unexplained market activity is observed, all
known information regarding the security is evaluated and a decision
made as to the necessity for an investigation. These investigations,
which are generally conducted by the Commission's regional offices,
take two forms. The "quiz" or "preliminary" investigation is
designed to discover rapidly evidence \ of unlawful activity. If B:
quiz discloses no evidence of violations it is closed. If the quiz indicates that more intensive investigation is necessary, a formal order
may be issued by the Commission. Virtually all of the Commission's
investigations are privately conducted so that no unfair reflection will
be cast on any persons or securities and the trading markets will not
be upset. If violations are discovered, the appropriate action is

taken by the Commission. In some cases the information obtained
may be referred to other Federal or state authorities.

When securities are to be offered to the public their markets are
watched very closely to make sure that the price is not artificially
raised prior to or during the distribution. All registered offerings and
all offerings made under Regulations A and D (in all some 2,372
offerings having a value exceeding $11,264,000,000) were so observed
during the fiscal year. Hundreds of other smaller offerings, such as
secondary distributions and distributions of securities under special
plans filed by the exchanges, were also checked and many were kept
under special observation for considerable lengths of time.
Stabilization

Stabilization involves open market purchases of securities to prevent
or retard a decline in the market price in order to facilitate a distribution, It'- is permitted subject to restrictions designed to confinestabilizing activity to that necessary for purposes of the distribution
and to require proper disclosures.
All stabilizing operations are very carefully observed. During the
fiscal year, stabilizing was effected in connection with stock offerings
aggregating 23,774,940 shares having an aggregate public offering
price of $542,972,719. Bond issues having a total offering price of
$39,575,000 were also stabilized. To accomplish this stabilization,
428,057 shares of stock were purchased by the offerors at a cost of
$8,055,188. 'Bonds costing $345,475 were also bought by stabilizers.
In connection with these operations more than 6,000 stabilizing
reports which show purchases and sales of securities effected hy persons
conducting the distribution were received and examined during thefiscal year.

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

During the fiscal year further progress was made in the formulation
of rules relating to the stabilization of securities under the Securities
Exchange Act. Following a public hearing on the proposed rules in
July 1954, frequent conferences were held by the staff with a committee
formed by persons represented at the hearing, and further study was
given to the suggestions and proposals submitted by interested persons.
A revised draft of the proposed rules was released for public comment
in April 1955, setting forth three comprehensive rules, one restricting
trading activity by persons participating or expecting to participate in
a distribution, a second setting forth principles governing stabilizing,
and the third dealing with the peculiar problems arising in offerings of
securities through rights. By the end of the fiscal year the final recommendations of the staff had been submitted to the Commission, and
shortly thereafter the proposed rules were formally adopted."
INSIDERS'

SECURITY TRANSACTIONS

AND HOLDINGS

Every person who is an owner of more than 10 percent of any class
of equity security which is registered on a national securities exchange
or an officer or a director of the issuer of any such security is required
by section 16 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act to file with the Commission and the exchange a report disclosing his direct and indirect
ownership of each class of the issuer's equity securities and additional
reports showing subsequent changes in such ownership. The Public
Utility Holding Company Act and the Investment Company Act
contain similar requirements.
These reports are available for public inspection at the Commission's office and at the exchanges, but in order to make the information contained therein more readily available to interested persons it is
condensed and published in the Commission's monthly "Official
Summary of Security Transactions and Holdings," which is distributed
on a subscription basis by the Government Printing Office. A-pproximately 3,000 copies of this summary are circulated each month.
There was a sharp increase in the number of insiders' reports filed
with the Commission during the 1955 fiscal year, 28,975 as compared
with 23,199 during the 1954 fiscal year and 22,333 during the 1953
fiscal year. The following tabulation shows details concerning the
reports filed during the 1955 fiscal year.

Recovery of Insiders' Profits hy Company

For the purpose of preventing the unfair use of information which
may have been obtained by an insider by reason of his relationship
to his company, sections 16 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act, 17 (b)
of the Public Utility Holding Company Act, and 30 (f) of the Investment Company Act provide for the recovery by or on behalf of the
issuer of any profit realized by the insider from certain purchases and
sales, or sales and purchases, of securities of the company within any
period of less than 6 months. The Commission is not charged with
the enforcement of the civil remedies created by these provisions,
which are matters for determination by the courts in actions brought
by the proper parties.
REGULATION OF PROXIES
Scope of Proxy Regulation

Under sections 14 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act, 12 (e) of the
Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and 20 (a) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 the Commission has adopted Regulation
X-14 requiring the disclosure of pertinent information in connection
with the solicitation of proxies, consents and authorizations in respect
of securities of companies subject to those statutes. The regulation
also provides means whereby any security holders so desiring may

36

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

communicate with other security holders when management is soliciting proxies, either by arranging for the independent distribution of
their own proxy statements or by including their proposals in the
proxy statements sent out by management.
Copies of proposed proxy material must be filed with the Commission in preliminarv form prior to the date of the proposed solicitation.
Where preliminary material fails to meet the prescribed disclosurestandards, the management or other group responsible for its preparation is notified informally and given an opportunity to avoid such
defects in the preparation of the proxy material in the definitive form
in which it may be furnished to stockholders.
Statistics Relating to Proxy Statements

During the calendar year 1954 1,887 solicitations were made pursuant to Regulation X-14, of which 1,846 were conducted by management and 41 by non-management groups. The 1,846 solicitations by
management related to 1,695 companies, more than one solicitation
having been made with respect to some of the companies.
The purpose for which proxies are most often sought is the voting
for nominees for directors. In 1954 this was an item of business in
1,705 stockholders' meetings, while at 161 meetings it was not involved.
The remaining 21 solicitations, which did not involve any meeting of
stockholders, sought consents or authorizations from stockholders with
respect to certain proposals other than the election of directors.
During the 1954 calendar year 22 companies were subject to proxy
contests for control or for representation on the board of directors
compared to 14 such contests during the 1953 calendar year. Apart
from those filed by management, 28 proxy statements were filed in
1954 by interested non-management groups, compared with 17 in
1953, in connection with these contests.

ANNUAL REPORT

Among the proceedings disposed of during the year were the
following:
In the case of Charles M. Weber, doing business as Weber-Millican
and Company,3 involved findings that the respondent in connection
with the sale of the common stock of Inland Oil Company, made
false and misleading statements and omitted to state material facts
concerning the expenses of distribution of the stock, the extent and
results of oil-well drilling operations, and the purposes for which the
proceeds from the sale of the stock would be used, and that the
respondent in connection with selling of common stock of Magma
King Manganese Mining Co. made false representations concerning
the current market price of the stock and the availability of the stock
in the market and effected sales at prices averaging 38.9 percent in
excess of the prevailing market prices without disclosing to the
purchasers such market prices. The Commission found that Weber
willfully violated the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Acts, and
revoked his registration and expelled him from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
In the Shaver and Company 4 case, the Commission revoked the
respondent's registration and expelled it from the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. upon the findings that the respondent
and Stanley C. Shaver, who dominated and controlled the respondent,
made false and misleading statements of material facts in connection
with the sale of securities and employed a scheme to defraud customers of their funds and securities. Shaver, a director of the Florida
Telephone Corporation, induced the respondent's customers to
purchase that corporation's stock upon the false representation that
the corporation would merge with another telephone company and
that the stock would appreciably increase in value. On the pretext
of having the stock available when the merger took effect, Shaver
induced-the customers to turn over to him 2,883 shares in negotiable
form. More than half of these shares were subsequently converted
by Shaver and Company to the use and benefit of Shaver and the
respondent, without the knowledge or consent of the customers.
In proceedings instituted against Pioneer Enterprises, Inc.6 the case
was based in part upon the fact that the respondent in selling its own
stock sent a telegram which referred to "the many favorable developments in corporations in which Pioneer is interested and which are
reflected in a greatly improved financial structure of Pioneer," when
in fact such a representation was not justified. The three companies
in which Pioneer owned sizable amounts of stock had paid no dividends or any other form of income to the respondent, and the activities

COMMISSION

of the companies in the period preceding were not of a kind justifying
a description of "favorable developments."
Also the telegram failed
to reveal certain material facts detrimental to Pioneer's financial
structure.
On these facts the Commission found Pioneer had violated
the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, and revoked
Pioneer's registration and expelled it from membership in the NASD,
Inc.
Proceedings against Aim and Company 6 involved the obtaining
of secret profits by respondent and by Henry O. AIm, president,
director and controlling stockholder, in securities transactions with an
estate and trust of which AIm was executor and trustee. AIm, as
executor, sold through another broker-dealer 15 of the 27 securities in
the estate to respondent, which used some of the securities to cover
short sales and resold the remainder to customers at a profit. Another
security of the estate was purchased directly by AIm, who within a
short time sold it to respondent at an appreciably higher price. Respondent then resold the security realizing additional profit. The
Commission found that the respondent and AIm had willfully violated
the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and
suspended AIm from membership in the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. for 9 months. Registration was not revoked
under the circumstances, including the fact that AIm had made
restitution to the estate and had never been charged with other
securities violations.
The extensive series of administrative and court proceedings discussed in the prior Annual Reports of the Commission were finally
terminated by the Commission's dismissal of the broker-dealer proceedings against Otis &1 Co. and, as mentioned elsewhere in this report,
its dismissal at the request of the NASD of the review petition filed in
connection with the disciplinary action by the Association against
Otis & Co., Cyrus S. Eaton and William R. Daley." Following the
Commission's successful defense of the action brought by certain
witnesses who sought to have the United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania quash the Commission's subpoenas
which had been served upon them, resumption of the broker-dealer
proceedings was delayed pending completion of the Commission's
further public investigation into the offering of Kaiser-Frazer stock.
Thereafter, a stipulation incorporating into the record of the brokerdealer proceeding certain testimony taken in prior proceedings was
entered into and, based upon that testimony and the remainder of the
record, Otis & Co. filed a motion to dismiss the broker-dealer proceeding. In granting the motion to dismiss, the Commission, among

its other conclusions, found that in view of the fact that no harm came
to public investors to whom the Kaiser-Frazer stock was offered, it
would not be in the public interest to take any action with respect to
the registration of Otis & Co. as a broker-dealer and its membership in
the N ASD because of the alleged acts charged against it in this
proceeding." The public investigation of the offering of KaiserFrazer stock was later terminated.
Broker-Dealer Inspections

The program of the Commission includes periodic and other examinations of the books and records of registered brokers and dealers,
conducted pursuant to section 17 (a) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934. The inspectors ascertain the financial condition of the firm
and review its practices as to pricing, treatment of customers' funds
and securities, and the making of proper disclosures to customers.
Compliance with other Commission rules, including those relating to
the maintenance of proper records, is also examined.
, During the fiscal year the Commission's Regional Offices reported
on 822 such inspections. As in former years these inspections uncovered many violations of the statutes, rules and regulations, including
non-compliance with the Commission's capital and hypothecation
rules, and with the margin and other requirements of Regulation T
prescribed by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System.
The following summary table shows the various types of violations
disclosed in broker-dealer inspection reports during the last fiscal
year.

The Commission does not necessarily take formal action against a
broker-dealer who appears from these inspections to have violated
the acts or the rules thereunder. The character of improper activity
and the public interest are considered in determining which, if any, of
the. Available types of action is appropriate. Where it appears that
the violations are inadvertent or the result of misunderstanding, and

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

where wilfulness is not established, the Commission affords the brokerdealer an opportunity to correct his practices or to offer satisfactory
assurances that they will not continue.
Where the facts indicate activity inconsistent with the Rules of
Fair Practice of the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
but not necessarily violative of the anti-fraud provisions of the Commission's statutes, the Commission at times refers such cases to the
Association for consideration and whatever action it deems appropriate. During the fiscal year nine such cases were referred to the
Association.
Certain of the brokers and dealers registered with the Commission
are inspected by other agencies such as certain stock exchanges, the
National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc., and certain State
authorities having inspection programs. The Commission and these
agencies cooperate in a program designed to obtain the broadest coverage in routine inspection of brokers and dealers by interchanging
information as to the dates of inspection of particular firms by each of
the various parties. Information that a particular firm had recently
been inspected by one agency permits others to concentrate their
activity on other firms. The program is flexible to a degree sufficient
to permit immediate action by any agency for a good cause regardless
of inspections by others. The results of inspections are not interchanged due primarily to variations in inspection programs and in the
jurisdiction of the inspecting agencies.
During the year the Philadelphia-Baltimore
Stock Exchange
substantially expanded the scope of its examinations and became a
participant in the coordination program. Other cooperating agencies,
each of which is in some way subject to the Commission's jurisdiction,
include the American Stock Exchange, the New York Stock Exchange,
the Midwest Stock Exchange, the San Francisco Stock Exchange and
the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. These parties
reported having made nearly 1,700 inspections of firms, and the availability of this information permitted the Commission, as well as each
of the other parties, to avoid duplication of routine inspections and
to increase the number of different firms inspected by some inspecting
organization. In addition, many States also participate to the extent
of their jurisdiction and inspection facilities, including particularly,
California, Connecticut, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Oklahoma,
Oregon, Washington and Wisconsin.
Financial Statements

One of the Commission's rules, X-17A-5, requires brokers and
dealers to file financial reports each calendar year. During the fiscal
year 1955, 3,945 such reports were filed. By examining these reports
the staff is afforded an opportunity to determine whether, as of the

TWENTY-FIRST

ANNUAL REPORT

43

date of the report, a broker-dealer is in compliance with the capital
requirements prescribed by rule X-15C3-1.
If it is found that he is
not in compliance, he is given a reasonable opportunity, if consistent
with the public interest, to .bring his financial condition into compliance. If he does not promptly comply, the Commission takes appropriate action.
Net Capital Rule

During the year the Commission adopted an amendment designed
to increase the safeguards to customers afforded by its rule X-15C3-1
relating to capital requirements for brokers and dealers. Under this
rule, no broker or dealer may permit his aggregate indebtedness to
exceed 20 times his net capital.
"Net capital," "aggregate indebtedness," and other terms are defined in the rule. These definitions
were revised, effective May 20, 1955/ to increase from 10 percent
to 30 percent the deduction from market value of common stock forming a part of the capital of a broker or dealer, which is required to be
made in computing his net capital and otherwise to clarify and improve the principles under which net capital and aggregate indebtedness are determined for purposes of the rule. These revisions included
modified deductions from market values of bonds and preferred stocks
in computing net capital, revised treatment of certain secured obligations in calculating aggregate indebtedness and provision for the
inclusion in capital of borrowings under "satisfactory subordination
payments. "
The rule was also amended in June 19558 to add the PhiladelphiaBaltimore Stock Exchange to the list of exchanges whose members
are exempt from the Commission's net capital rule because the rules
and settled practices of these exchanges have been found to impose
capital requirements more comprehensive than those of the Commission's rule.
SUPERVISION OF ACTIVITIES OF NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF
SECURITIES DEALERS, INC.

Section 15A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the "Maloney
Act") provides for the registration with the Commission of national
securities associations whose rules are designed to promote just and
equitable principles of trade and who otherwise meet the requirements
of the statute.
The National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.
(NASD) is the only association which has registered under the Act.

engaged in underwriting or trading with other brokers and dealers

the association preclude members from dealing with non-members
except upon the same terms as are accorded to the general public.
Its membership stood at 3,350 at June 30, 1955. This represented
an increase of 259 during the year as a result of 442 admissions to,
and 183 terminations of, membership. At the same date there were
registered with the NASD, as registered representatives, 41,066
individuals, including generally all partners, officers, salesmen, traders
and other persons employed by or associated with member firms in
capacities which involved their doing business directly with the public.
The number of registered representatives increased by 5,387 during
the fiscal year as a result of 8,761 initial registrations, 2,333 re-registrations and 5,707 terminations of registration.
Disciplinary Actions

The Commission received from the NASD, during the fiscal year,
reports of final action in 28 disciplinary proceedings in which formal
complaints had been filed against members alleging violations of
specified provisions of the Association's Rules of Fair Practice.
Eighteen of these complaints were directed solely against members,
while ten other complaints contained allegations against members
and also against registered representatives of the members.
In three of these proceedings members were expelled, in six members
were fined and in six members were censured. One complaint was
withdrawn prior to consideration of the merits and after such consideration four others were dismissed on findings that no violations had
occurred. One member involved in three related complaints was
suspended for 2 years.
Five complaints aimed at both members and their representatives
resulted in the revocation of the registration of the registered representatives on findings that they had misappropriated, or otherwise
misused, customers' or firms securities or funds. In each of these
cases the firms were found not to have acted improperly and the complaints were dismissed as to them. There were no losses to investors
in these cases. In other cases involving registered representatives
there were two revocations, suspensions of 30 and 90 days, respectively,
and two fines. In some of the cases mentioned above more than one
type of sanction was imposed on the disciplined member of representative. In several cases the penalty imposed included an assessment to cover, in whole or in part, the cost of the proceeding. The
fines imposed by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc.,
ranged from $50 to $2,000 and aggregated $3,800.
Commission Review of the NASD Disciplinary Action

As provided in section 15A (g) of the Act, disciplinary actions by
the NASD are subject to review by the Commission on its own motion

or on application of any aggrieved person. Four such petitions,
described in earlier Annual Reports, were pending at the close of the
last fiscal year. In addition, two other petitions were filed during
the year. Five of these cases were disposed of during the year and
one was pending at the year end."
The Commission affirmed findings by the NASD that Earl L.
Combest, president and chief executive officer of Prugh, Combest and
Land, Inc., had, among other things, violated specified provisions of
the Association's Rules of Fair Practice, particularly section 27, by
failure to exercise proper supervision over officer-salesmen who overcharged customers and held that this failure to supervise was conduct
inconsistent with just and equitable principles of trade within the
meaning of the Act and the Association's rules. Combest had been
fined $2,500 and his registration as registered representative had been
suspended for 2 years by the Association.
The Commission found,
in the light of all surrounding circumstances, including the sanctions
imposed on other persons connected with the activities in question,
that this penalty imposed on Combest was excessive or oppressive
and affirmed the fine but canceled the suspension."
As described in earlier Annual Reports, Otis & Co. and its registered
representatives, Cyrus S. Eaton and William R. Daley, had appealed
to the Commission an NASD decision finding them in violation of
particular Association rules for refusing to supply certain information
concerning the activity of Otis & Co. in a common stock offering of
Kaiser-Frazer Corporation in 1948. This decision imposed a 2-year
suspension of Otis & Co. from Association membership.
In view of
the Commission's action in granting the motion of Otis & Co. to
dismiss the broker-dealer revocation proceedings and the outcome of
Federal Court proceedings in which the NASD was involved with
Otis & Co., the Association revoked its order of suspension and dismissed the underlying complaint against Otis & Co. and its representatives.
The Association thereafter requested the Commission to
dismiss the review petition as moot and the Commission granted the
request. 11
The Commission also dismissed a review petition filed by Thomas
G. Wylie Co. who had been expelled by and from the Association on
findings that he had violated applicable Rules of Fair Practice by
selling non-producing oil royalties to customers at 212 percent over
the current market as indicated by contemporaneous cost. Prior to

prietor had automatically terminated by death and the Commission
dismissed the proceedings as moot."
R. V. Klein Company brought before the Commission, on appeal, a
decision in which the NASD held that his sales of producing oil
royalties to customers at a uniform mark-up of 50 percent over the
firm's cost involved doing business at unfair prices under the rules
and in the circumstances of the case. The penalty of expulsion had
been applied. On consideration, the Commission concluded that the
firm's pricing practices were unfair and inconsistent with just and
equitable principles of trade. In considering the severity of the
penalty, the Commission held that it was not oppressive or excessive
and on this basis dismissed the review proceeding thus confirming the
action of the NASD. 13 This decision by the Commission was subsequently reversed by the Court of Appeals as described later in this
report.
A review petition filed by Royal Securities Corporation and its
president and sole stockholder, John B. Milliken, raised a novel
question. The NASD through its District Business Conduct Committee, which has initial jurisdiction, had expelled the firm and revoked
Milliken's registration on findings that they had violated specified
rules by misrepresenting to customers that they were purchasing
securities for them as agent without any commission being charged
when, in fact, they were selling their own securities to such customers
at mark-ups ranging from 20 percent to 75 percent over their contemporaneous costs, and in making false and fictitious entries on the
books of the corporation. The NASD rules provide that a disciplinary
action by a District Business Conduct Committee is subject to review
by the Board of Governors on application by an aggrieved party
filed within 15 days after the date of notice of the decision, or upon
the Board's own motion within 30 days after such notice. The rules
also provide for review by the Commission, in accordance with the
statute, upon application of a party aggrieved by disciplinary action
taken or approved by the Board of Governors. In this case, review
by the Board of Governors was not sought within the specified period
and the Board of Governors refused to review the decision on its
own motion. Thereupon applicant applied directly to the Commission
to review the decision of the District Business Conduct Committee
and the refusal of the Board of Governors to review that decision or
to hear the untimely appeal. The NASD moved to dismiss the
petition on the assertion that the Commission had no jurisdiction
because applicant had failed to comply with the rules relating to
review within the NASD. The Commission concluded that applicants'
failure to exhaust their remedies of review within the NASD, pursuant

statute.
On this basis the Commission dismissed the review proceedings."
Commission

Review of Action

on Meruberahtp

During the fiscal year the Commission had no occasion to exercise
its jurisdiction under section 15A (b)(4) of the Act by which it may,
with due regard to the public interest, approve or direct the admission
to or continuance in membership of a member subject to any of the
disabilities specified in that section of the statute.
There was no
change in the status of two such cases pending at the beginning of the
fiscal year and no new cases were brought before the Commission
during the year."
LITIGATION

UNDER THE SECURITIES

EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934

In order to afford immediate protection to public investors, it is
necessary at times for the Commission to apply to the courts for
injunctive relief against continuing violations of the Securities
Exchange Act.
In S. E. C. v. Kelleher Securities Corporation and William H.
Eynon 16 the defendant corporation, a registered broker-dealer, and
its controlling stockholder, consented to entry of a final judgment
permanently enjoining them from further violations of the registration
and anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Act of 1933 and the antifraud provisions of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The defendants were charged, among other things, with selling securities by
making false statements to the effect that the price of such securities
would double, that dividends would soon be paid and that the securities were no longer a speculation. In addition, it was alleged that the
defendants concealed the fact that they were selling personally owned
stock while falsely representing that the issuing corporation would
receive the proceeds of such sales.
Injunctive proceedings were also instituted against Carl J. Bliedung,17 a registered broker-dealer.
By consent, the court issued a
permanent injunction enjoining further violations of the Securities
Exchange Act resulting from the defendant's failure to maintain and
keep current the books and records required under the Commission's
rules and regulations.

In S. E. O. v. Shaver &: 00., Stanley O. Shaver, Sr. and Stanley O.
Shaver, Jr.,18 the complaint alleged that the defendants permitted the
firm's aggregate indebtedness to exceed 2,000 percent of its net capital
in violation of the Commission's rules. The defendants filed an
answer admitting the allegations of the complaint and consented to
the entry of a permanent decree of injunction.
A permanent injunction was also issued against George lJlcKaig/9
a registered broker-dealer, doing business as George McKaig &: Company, as a result of a complaint filed during the previous fiscal year
which, as discussed in the Twentieth Annual Report.f charged the
defendant with violating the Commission's net capital rule, failure
to keep required books and records, and failure to file a certified
report of his financial condition.
In S. E. O. v. Gordon Keith Proctor." the Commission obtained a
final judgment by consent enjoining the defendant from further
violations of the broker-dealer registration provisions. The complaint charged that he was engaged in a broker-dealer business
without being registered with the Commission in accordance with
section 15 (b) of the Securities Exchange Act.
In addition to its actions against broker-dealers the Oommission
had occasion to file a complaint against Donald Graham Hamilton 22
for violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Securities Exchange
Act. It was alleged that the defendant placed orders with various
brokers for the purchase of certain securities and the short sale of
other securities, for execution on the New York Stock Exchange,
knowing that he could not provide margin to cover short sales effected
for his account on the due dates. It was also charged that the
defendant issued checks on non-existent bank accounts and bank
accounts having insufficient funds to pay brokers for transactions
effected for his account. The defendant consented to the entry of
judgment and a permanent injunction was issued by the court.
In S. E. O. v. LaVere Redfield,23the Commission's complaint sought
to enjoin the defendant from further violations of the anti-fraud
provisions of the Securities Exchange Act. It was alleged that the
defendant, a director of a certain corporation, in offering to purchase
from stockholders of that company their stock at $12.50 per share,
had failed to disclose to them that the corporation was then considering s cash purchase offer of $14.50 per share from another company
and a proposal of merger with still another corporation. Following

proceedings against a member for conduct violative of the NASD
Rules of Fair Practice and inconsistent with just and equitable
principles of trade. It was alleged, among other things, that the
member had sold oil royalties at prices which were unfair and not
reasonably related to the current market price, in violation of sections
1 and 4 of Article III of the Association's Rules of Fair Practice,
namely at a mark-up of 50 percent over cost. The Association
rejected his contentions that 50 percent was the customary mark-up
in the sale of producing oil royalties, that therefore the KASD was
under a duty to notify its members that it considered such a charge
violative of its rules, which notice had not been given, and that, in
any event, the propriety of his prices should have been determined
on the basis of the intrinsic value of the royalties rather than on
mark-up over cost and circumstances pertinent to the mark-up.
After expulsion by the Association, he applied to the Commission
for review of the expulsion order. The Commission affirmed."
A petition for review of the Commission's order was filed in the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. In its opinion, the Court,
noting that there is no established market price for oil royalties, accepted the Commission's ruling that the cost to the dealer of an oil
royalty was the equivalent of a market price. In addition, the Court
adopted the Commission's position that the NASD could properly
determine what conduct was in violation of its rules on a case-to-case
basis. However, in the present instance, the NASD a year before
the instant transactions occurred had examined an account of the
member in which there were two transactions in oil royalties with
50 percent mark-ups over cost. Since no action was taken or warning
given by the NASD with respect to those transactions, the Court
held that, although the inaction did not constitute an estoppel, the
failure to discipline or to warn the member for the previous transactions justified his belief that a 50 percent mark-up was permissible
under the Association's rules and constituted an interpretation of the
rules on which the member reasonably relied. The case was therefore
reversed and remanded to the Commission."
In Weber v, Securities and Exchange Commiseion." the Court of
Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed an order of the Commission
revoking a broker-dealer's registration and expelling bim from membership in the National Association of Securities Dealers. The action

In Beury v. Beury, the United States District Court for the Southern

the defendants the extra-territorial service of process pursuant to section 27 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 was unavailable."
On appeal the Commission filed a brief, amicus curiae, urging that
the concept of fraud under section 10 (b) of the Act and rule X-10B-5
thereunder includes causes of action cognizable at common law. In

ADMINISTRATION
OF THE PUBLIC UTILITY
COMPANY ACT OF 1935

HOLDING

The Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935 provides for
three separate areas of regulation of holding company systems which
control electric utility companies and companies engaged in the retail
distribution of natural or manufactured gas. The first embraces
those provisions of the Act, principally those in section 11 (b) (1),
which require physical integration of the public utility and related
properties of holding company systems, and those, principally contained in section 11 (b) (2), which require the simplification of intercorporate relationships and financial structures of the systems. The
second area of regulation covers financing operations of registered
holding companies and their subsidiaries, acquisitions and dispositions
of securities and properties, their accounting practices and servicing
arrangements and other intercompany transactions.
The third area
includes the provisions of the Act providing exemptions for intrastate
and foreign holding company systems and those provisions of the Act
regulating the right of a person who is affiliated with a public utility
company to acquire securities resulting in a second such affiliation.
COMPOSITION

OF REGISTERED
HOLDING COMPANY SYSTEMSSUMMARY OF CHANGES

On June 30, 1955, there were 25 public utility holding company
systems which were subject to the regulatory provisions of the Act
as registered holding company systems. In these systems there were
23 registered holding companies which function solely as holding
companies, 7 registered holding companies which were also operating
companies, 171 electric and gas utility subsidiaries and 137 IlOIlutility subsidiaries, a total of 338 companies. In each of 3 systems
there were 2 registered holding companies, and in a third system there
were 3 registered holding companies. For convenience of discussion
these systems are referred to as active systems, and a table showing
their composition as of June 30, 1955, appears in appendix table 10.
The aggregate assets of these 25 active registered systems totalled
approximately $9,972 million, less valuation reserves, as at December
31, 1954. Included in these totals are 63 non-utility companies in
the Cities Service system with total assets of approximately $1,039
million. Also included are 62 subsidiaries of American & Foreign
Power, Inc. with total assets of approximately $630 million, most of
which operate properties in foreign countries, which have not been

included as components of active registered systems in previous
annual reports since American & Foreign Power and its subsidiaries
have been exempted from the Act by orders of the Commission under
Sections 3 (a) (5) and 3 (b). In addition there were 7 other registered
holding companies which no longer hold any electric or gas utility
subsidiaries
On June 30, 1954, there were 29 active registered holding company
systems aggregating 386 companies with total assets of approximately
$10,151 million, less valuation reserves, as at December 31, 1953.
Four systems acquired exempt status under the Act during the
fiscal year 1955, namely, Eastern Gas and Fuel Associates, Northern
States Power Co. (Minn.), 'Wisconsin Electric Power Co., and
New England Gas and Electric Association. The first three of
these are operating-holding companies and the last is solely a holding company. These four systems contained a total of 15 electric
and gas utility subsidiaries and 28 non-utility subsidiaries. In
addition, The North American Company, w-hichwas the top registered
holding compauy in the North American system, was dissolved
during the year and its subsidiary, Union Electric Company of
Missouri, a registered operating-holding company, continued as
the top company in au active registered system.
One new holding company registered under the Act during the year
as a result of its purchase of another utility company, which was
merged into the parent shortly thereafter. Active registered systems
added three public utility subsidiaries during the fiscal year.'
During the fiscal year 1955, 5 public utility subsidiaries with net
assets aggregating more than $372 million and 5 non-utility subsidiaries with assets of $513 million 2 were divested by their respective
holding company parents and as a result were no longer subject to
the Act as components of registered systems." In addition one
company was absorbed by a merger, 5 were eliminated by dissolution,
and 37 ceased to be associated with the active systems as a consequence
of exemptions and other changes in status. The following table
shows the changes which occurred during the year in the composition
of active registered holding company systems.

Gas and Electric Company

American Gas and Electric Company is a holding company controlling the largest electric utility system subject to the Act. As at
December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of the system, less valuation
reserves, aggregated $1,035 million. During the fiscal year the Commission approved a proposal filed pursuant to section 11 (e) of the
Act providing for the merger of two system operating companies,
The Ohio Power Company and The Central Ohio Light & Power
Company. 4 The plan provided that Central Ohio's public stockholders would receive $50 per share in cash upon surrender of their
stock at any time not later than December 31, 1959. The surviving
company, The Ohio Power Company, assumed all of Central Ohio's
indebtedness, including $4,998,000 principal amount of first mortgage
bonds and $2,900,000 principal amount of notes payable to banks.
Two other system transactions approved by the Commission during"the fiscal year were sales of certain electric facilities to nonaffiliates for an aggregate of $1,336,836.5

Gas Company

.American Natural Gas Company controls one of the four registered
gas utility holding company systems subject to the Act. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of the system, less valuation reserves,
aggregated $416 million.
During the fiscal year the Commission approved the transfer of
35,000 shares of common stock of Milwaukee Solvay Coke Company,
a non-utility subsidiary of Milwaukee Gas Light Company, from the
latter company to the parent company, American Natural Gas
Company." It was proposed to effectuate the transfer by means
of not more than six quarterly dividends on Milwaukee Gas Light
Company's common stock in shares of Solvay common stock.
At the close of the fiscal year the Commission had pending a joint
financing proposal 7 by .American Natural and .American Louisiana
Pipe Line Company, a non-utility subsidiary, involving, among other
things, the issuance and sale by .American Louisiana of $97,500,000
principal amount of First Mortgage Pipe Line Bonds and the issuance
and sale by American Louisiana to American Natural of 200,000 additional shares of $100 par value common stock. The purpose of the
proposed financing was to provide a major portion of the funds required
to construct a natural gas pipe-line system extending from southern
Louisiana to Detroit, Michigan, to supplement the gas supply of
Michigan Consolidated Gas Company and Michigan-Wisconsin Pipe
Line Company, subsidiaries of American Natural. After public hearings on the proposed transactions, the Commission issued an order
of approval, including an exemption from the competitive bidding
requirements of rule U-50 so as to permit the sale of the bonds to
two insurance companies which entered into commitments to take
the bonds down over the period of construction.
Subsequently, the Commission issued a detailed findings and
opinion." Therein it was pointed out that the pipeline bonds proposed to be issued and sold were redeemable for purposes of refunding
at a lower interest rate at redemption prices beginning at 115 for the
period to and including January 1, 1962, and at declining premiums
thereafter.
This high redemption premium in the event of a refunding
presented the Commission with a problem in the light of its established
policies under which it has almost uniformly required that senior
securities be fully redeemable at the option of the issuing company
upon the payment of a reasonable premium.

ANNUAL

REPORT

55

In approving the terms of the bond financing the Commission
determined that, under the circumstances of the case, it would not
regard the bond redemption premiums, which make refunding unlikely
for a period of years, as a basis for the imposition of a condition
requiring renegotiation of such premiums with institutional investors.
The Commission accorded appropriate weight in this regard to the
position of the Federal Power Commission, which had approved the
.terms of the financing, and to the views of the affected State and
municipal regulatory authorities. The city of Detroit and the
Michigan Public Service Commission urged the Commission to
approve the financing as proposed and not to jeopardize the future
gas supply in their territory by requiring a further renegotiation of the
redemption premiums. They took the position that any action which
might imperil the prompt construction of the pipe line would have an
adverse effect on a great number of consumers in urgent need of natural
gas. The Public Service Commission of Wisconsin opposed the high
redemption premiums on the bonds but took the position that the
proposed issuance should be approved if the redemption premiums
could not be reduced without undue delay or without serious impairment of progress of construction of the pipeline. However, the
Commission reaffirmed its policy against nonredeemable features in
senior securities, pointing out, as it has in previous cases, that such
features violate the policy of the Act as set forth in section 1 proscribing "lack of economies in the raising of capital."
Central and South West Corporation

Central and South West Corporation and its four domestic electric
utility subsidiaries were divested by the Middle West Corporation in
1947 and have operated since that time as a separate holding-company system. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of the
system, less valuation reserves, amounted to $455 million. At the
time it was divorced from the Middle West system, the Central and
South West system was subject to an outstanding order pursuant to
section 11 (b) (1) which required the divestment from Central and
South West of certain ice and water properties. This was done by
th:e latter part of 1950. In the past year the system took steps to
dispose of its remaining ice properties although the Commission had
previously found them retainable under section 11 (b) (1). In part
'payment for these ice properties, Central Power and Light Company,
a subsidiary of Central and South West, requested authority to acquire
certain debt securities from the purchaser, Southern Texas Ice &
Service Inc., a non-affiliated non-utility company. The Commission
approved Central Power's request on June 28, 1955.9

Corporatiou

Central Public Utility Corporation ("Cenpuc") is solely a holding
company whose only public utility investments are in subsidiaries
with electric and gas utility properties located exclusively in foreign
countries. Cenpuc also has indirect interests in domestic non-utility
properties. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of the
system, less valuation reserves, amounted to $24 million.
On June 1, 1955, Cenpuc filed with the Commission an application
requesting modification of an outstanding section 11 (b) (2) order so
that it would no longer require the dissolution of The Islands Gas and
Electric Company, an intermediate holding company in the Cenpuc
system. Cenpuc also requested an exemption pursuant to section
3 (a) (5), pursuant to which a holding company may be entitled to
an exemption if it is not, and derives no material part of its income
from any subsidiary company which is, a domestic public utility
company. In an amendment to this application filed after the end
of the fiscal year, Cenpuc disclosed that The Equity Corporation, a
registered investment company, had acquired indirectly approximately
28 percent of the outstanding common stock of Cenpuc. This acquisition poses possible problems under section 11 which may have to be
resolved before the requested exemption can be granted.
Cities

Service Cornparry

Cities Service Company, although primarily engaged in the oil and
gas business, is a registered holding company, and is under a section
11 (b) order directing it to dispose of all of its utility interests. Pursuant to this order, Cities requested approval during the fiscal year of
a sale of its holdings of 51.5 percent of the common stock of Arkansas
Louisiana Gas Company to W. R. Stephens Investment Company,
Inc. ("Stephens").
Problems presented by the proposal included
whether it was appropriate to grant Cities an exemption from the
competitive bidding requirements of rule V-50; whether the acquisition by Stephens, which was subject to section 9 (a) (2), met the
standards of section 10; and whether Stephens should be given an
exemption as a holding company under section 3 (a) (4) on the basis
of its contention that it was acquiring the stock temporarily with a
view to distribution. The Commission approved the sale, acquisition
and exemption in consolidated proceedings after public hearings."
Appearances were made by various consumer interests, including
Reynolds Metals Company. Reynolds Metals opposed the transaction, principally because Stephens proposed to "spin off" the production-extraction properties of Arkansas Louisiana Gas prior to distribution of the Arkansas Louisiana Gas stock, and Reynolds Metals
considered that this would adversely affect the public interest and the

consummated on December 27, 1954. On January 6, 1955, Reynolds
Metals :fileda petition for review pursuant to section 24 (a) of the Act
in the Court of Appeals, District of Columbia Circuit. The case has
been briefed and argued and was awaiting decision at the end of the
fiscal year.
Following the sale of the Arkansas Louisiana Gas stock, Cities Service :filed an application for exemption under section 3 (a) (5) of the
Act. The Commission ordered that proceedings on this application
be consolidated with section 11 proceedings pertaining to Arkansas
Fuel Oil Corporation, formerly Arkansas Natural Gas Corporation,
and ordered hearings thereon." The questions presented are whether
the granting of the exemption is detrimental to the public interest
or the interest of investers or consumers prior to the resolution of any
problems presented by the existence of a 48.5 percent publicly held
minority interest in Arkansas Fuel Oil Corporation and whether the
continued existence of such minority interest complies with the provisions of section 11 (b) (2) of the Act and is fair and equitable to the
persons affected thereby. Public hearings have been completed in
this proceeding but oral argument of the issues before the Commission had not been held prior to the end of the fiscal year.
During the fiscal year, the Commission gave the approvals required
for the liquidation and dissolution of Gas Advisers Inc., a former
mutual service company in the Cities Service system."
As of December 31, 1954, the Cities Service Company system reported total consolidated assets of $1,054 million, less valuation
reserves. However, all of these assets were devoted to petroleum
and other non-utility operations with the exception of Cities' Canadian
gas utility subsidiary, Dominion Natural Gas Company, Ltd., which
had assets of $15 million as at December 31, 1954.
The Columbia Gas System, Inc.

The Columbia Gas System, Inc., is a holding company controlling
14 operating subsidiaries and a subsidiary service company, which
conduct natural gas transmission, distribution and production operations. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of this system,
less valuation reserves, amounted to $674 million. During the fiscal
year the Commission approved a joint proposal by Columbia and its
subsidiary, Central Kentucky Natural Gas Company, authorizing
Central to acquire all the assets of Frankfort Kentucky Natural Gas

No action had been taken on the motion at the close of the :fiscalyear.
Consolidated Natural Gas Company

Consolidated Natural Gas Company is a holding company controlling four gas utility subsidiaries, and a gas transmission subsidiary. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of this system,
less valuation reserves, amounted to $459 million. During the year
a subsidiary, The East Ohio Gas Company, was given authorization
to acquire the assets of a non-affiliate, Lake County Gas Company;
in consideration for shares of capital stock of Consolidated and the
assumption by East Ohio of the liabilities of Lake County; 14 and The
Peoples Natural Gas Company, another subsidiary, was given authorization to transfer the Jeannette Compressor Station and appurtenant

which is less than 1 percent of the shares outstanding. In the :fiscal
year 1954 Koppers obtained a section 5 (d) order terminating its
registration as a holding company.
Eastern is also a holding company, since, in addition to various
subsidiaries engaged principally in the production, transportation,
sale and conversion of coal, it owns all of the outstanding voting
shares of Boston Consolidated Gas Company, a gas utility company
operating in the City of Boston. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of this system, less valuation reserves, amounted to $170

pursuant to which a holding company may be entitled to an exemption from the Act if the holding company and every subsidiary thereof
which is a public-utility company are predominantly intrastate in
character and carryon their business substantially in a single State
in which the holding company and the subsidiary are organized.
The proceedings pursuant to sections 11 (b) and 11 (e) involving
Koppers and Eastern are described in the 17th Annual Report, p. 83,
and Koppers' section 5 (d) order is described in the 20th Annual
Report, p. 58.
Eastern's application under section 3 (a) (1) was pending before
the Commission at the beginning of the fiscal year 1955. During the
year Eastern filed an amendment to its application, and on February
28, 1955, after public notice, the Commission issued an order granting
the requested exemption."
During the past fiscal year the Dumaine case 18 was concluded.
This involved two questions, first, whether Dumaine, a stockholder
who acted as a committee member in the section 11 proceedings pertaining to Eastern, was barred from the receipt of any fee by reason
of a sale by his wife during the reorganization of shares of the class
of securities which Dumaine represented; and, second, whether
Koppers was entitled to a fee from the estate of Eastern for its participation in Eastern's reorganization. The Commission denied any
fee to Dumaine but permitted reimbursement of his expenses and
denied the claim of Koppers. In enforcement proceedings the
District Court reversed the Commission as to Dumaine, but affirmed
as to Koppers. The Court of Appeals reversed the District Court
as to Dumaine and sustained the Commission's decision as to both
Dumaine and Koppers. A petition for certiorari was denied by the
Supreme Court on May 16, 1955.
Electric Bond and Share Company

Electric Bond and Share Company ("Bond and Share") no longer

Investment Company Act of 1940; and the prosecution of an application for a section 3 (a) (5) exemption from the Act upon completion
of the required reduction of its holdings of United Gas stock. Under
section 3 (a) (5) a holding company may be entitled to an exemption
from the Act if it is not, and derives no material part of its income
from any subsidiary company which is, a domestic public-utility
company.
During the past year the Commission authorized Bond and Share
to make distributions of United Gas common stock in accordance
with the Plan." Bond and Share also notified the Commission, as
required by the Plan, that it intended to sell 75,000 shares of American
& Foreign Power common stock, which is slightly in excess of 1 percent
of the shares outstanding. The sales of American & Foreign Power
common stock were for the purpose of realizing tax losses, and Bond
and Share stated tha.t it expected to purchase shares of American &
Foreign Power common stock on the market before the end of calendar
year 1955 in amounts sufficient to replace the shares sold. These
sales and purchases of American & Foreign Power common stock were
contemplated by the Plan.
On June 6, 1955, Bond and Share filed with the Commission an application for exemption as a holding company pursuant to section
3 (a) (5). This application, which was pending at the end of the
fiscal year, presents the Commission with several problems, among
which is the possible necessity of imposing terms and conditions to
ensure that Bond and Share, directly or indirectly through Ebasco
or otherwise, does not exercise a controlling influence over any publicutility or holding company in the United States or stand in such
relationship to such a company that there is liable to be an absence
of arm's-length bargaining between Bond and Share or Ebasco and
such company. Hearings on this application commenced on September 14, 1955.20

registered holding company in the Electric Bond and Share system,
referred to in the 20th Annual Report, p. 57, was terminated in the past
year. The Supreme Court of the United States reversed the Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit and on April 18, 1955 denied a
petition for rehearing." Modification and remand orders were requested and were entered by the Court of Appeals and by the District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Subsequently, pursuant to a stipulation of settlement entered into between the Commission and Drexel and Company, the fee applicant, the Commission
issued an order approving the payment by Bond and Share to Drexel
of $80,000, which was $30,000 more than the amount which the Commission had previously approved but $20,000 less than the amount
which has been requested by Drexel and which Bond and Share was
willing to pay."
The Supreme Court's decision affirmed the Commission's position
that its jurisdiction to pass upon fees and expenses in the section 11 (e)
reorganization of a subsidiary extends to any fees to be paid by the
parent registered holding company for services performed for it in
connection with such reorganization.
Engineers Public Service Company

The appeal pending at the close of fiscal year 1954 in connection
with the allowance and denial of fees and expenses claimed by participants in the proceedings for the reorganization of Engineers Public
Service Company," referred to in the 20th Annual Report, p. 57, was
decided on April 5, 1955.24 The Court of Appeals affirmed the decision of the United States District Court of Delaware which refused
to approve the order of the Commission denying the full amounts
requested for fees and expenses to counsel for certain dissenting common stockholders of Engineers and granted such counsel amounts
larger than had been allowed by the Commission. In upholding the
District Court's determination to grant these allowances, the Court
of Appeals held that although a District Court, acting pursuant to
section 11 (e), could not rewrite a plan approved by the Commission,
it did have power, by analogy to the appeal provisions of section 24
(a) of the Act, to modify Commission determinations with respect to
fees. Pursuant to this decision of the Court of Appeals, the Commission on June 14, 1955 issued an order amending its Findings and
Opinion and Order dated March 26, 1952, approving, among other
things, the payment by Engineers to the claimants of $85,892 for
fees and $8,252 for expenses."

General Public Utilities Corporation

General Public Utilities Corporation ("GPU") is a holding company
with seven domestic and two foreign public utility subsidiaries. One
of the domestic subsidiaries and the two foreign subsidiaries are
owned through a wholly owned subholding company. GPU's integrated public utility system lies in New Jersey and Pennsylvania.
As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of the system, less
valuation reserves, amounted to $653 million.
GPU has not yet complied with that part of a section 11 (b) order
entered against it on December 28, 1951 directing GPU to divest
itself of its foreign public utility subsidiaries, which are located in the
Philippines, and of Northern Pennsylvania Power Company, and
the latter's subsidiary, The Waverly Electric Light & Power Company,
which are located in northern Pennsylvania and Waverly, New York.
The 20th Annual Report, p. 57 describes the hearings held on a request
by GPU that the Commission modify the outstanding section 11 (b)
order so as to permit GPU to retain Northern Pennsylvania
Power Company and Waverly Electric as part of its integrated public
utility system. This matter remained undecided at the end of the
fiscal year 1955. During the fiscal year legislation was introduced
(H. R. 4370, 84th Cong.) designed to permit the retention by GPU of
its Philippine subsidiaries. No committee hearings were held before
the close of the fiscal year on this bill. In comments submitted to
Congress the Commission set forth its views on the bill but took no
position either in support of or in opposition to the measure.
International

Hydro-Electric System

International Hydro-Electric System ("IHES"), a Massachusetts
business trust, is a registered holding company, which at the close of
fiscal year 1955 had no domestic public-utility subsidiaries. Its
assets at that time consisted of 18.8 percent of the outstanding common stock of Gatineau Power Company, a Canadian public utility,
4.6 percent of the outstanding common stock of New England Electric
System, a registered holding company, 100 percent of the outstanding
stock of Eastern N ew York Power Company, an inactive company
and approximately $9,250,000 in liquid assets. As at December 31,
1954, the total assets of IHES amounted to $56 million and the
consolidated assets of Gatineau Power and its subsidiaries, less valuation reserves, aggregated $115 million. For several years IHES has
been operated by a Trustee appointed by the District Court for
•
Massachusetts pursuant to section 11 (d) of the Act. The reorganization of IHES has involved several steps taken pursuant to section
11 (d) plans filed by the Trustee which have been described in previous Annual Reports, see 15th Annual Report, page 106, 16th

Report, page 95, 19th Annual Report, page 60, 20th Annual Report,
page 58. The plan before the Commission since June 1953 has contemplated a modification of the dissolution order entered in 1942
by the Commission against IRES, the exemption of IRES as a
holding company pursuant to section 3 (a) (5), and the registration
of IRES as a closed-end, non-diversified investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940.
In the spring of 1954, pursuant to the section 11 (d) plan, there was
an election of directors of IRES, whose function, according to the
section 11 (d) plan, was to represent the Olass A stockholders in all
proceedings before the Commission and the Court, and pending the
reorganization of IRES as an investment company, to have such other
powers as the Commission and the Court might approve. This
election was the occasion for a proxy contest between two groups
seeking control of IRES. The election developed a controversy over
the legality of certain of the proxies and certain of the votes cast,
which was presented to the District Court for Massachusetts. The
Court provisionally resolved the controversy by entering an order on
December 8, 1954, approving nine specified persons as interim directors for the purpose of representing the stockholders in all proceedings
before the Oommission and the Court involving proposals for the
consummation of the final part of the Trustee's section 11 (d) plan.
The nine interim directors included five members of the Todd-Jacobs
slate of candidates in the 1954 election, and four members of the
opposing Johnson-Romney slate, these being the individuals who, on
the face of the returns, received the highest number of votes cast at
that election.
On December 30, 1954, the Commission issued a notice and order
reconvening the section 11 hearings for the purpose of considering the
last part of the Trustee's section 11 (d) plan and any other plans
which might be :filed by persons having a bona fide interest in the
reorganization."
Pursuant to this notice three plans were filed, as
follows: (1) Interim Board Plan which undertook to implement with
definitive details the outline proposed in the Trustee's section 11 (d)
plan, and which was accompanied by an application for an order modifying the 1942 dissolution order and granting IRES an exemption
under section 3 (a) (5); (2) the Johnson-Romney Plan, sponsored by
Central-Illinois Securities Corporation, Christian A. Johnson, and
Alfred Romney, Class A stockholders, which proposed the continuation
of the enterprise through two independent investment companies, one
to be controlled by the Todd-Jacobs group and the other by the
Johnson-Romney group, with division of the assets in accordance with
the number of shares owned by or electing to go along with each group;

tee, which provided for the conversion of IRES into a corporation and
its continuance as an investment company. Both the JohnsonRomney Plan and the Protective Committee Plan provided that
stockholders should vote on the plan, and that if it should fail to receive the approval of at least two-thirds of the outstanding shares,
IRES should be liquidated and dissolved; and that in any event dissenting stockholders should be allowed to retire from the enterprise
with their ratable share of the assets. The Interim Board Plan did
not provide for a vote by the stockholders, or for the withdrawal of
dissenters." These several plans and modifications thereof and an
additional proposal made by The Equity Corporation, another lager
stockholder of IRES, were considered in nine days of public hearings.
After the hearings, the various participants filed recommended findings and opinions, and thereafter exceptions, and briefs in support
thereof, to the recommended findings and opinions of the other parties.
On July 6, 1955, the Commission heard oral argument of the issues.
During the past year the Commission disposed of various applications for fees and expenses in connection with the IRES proceedings.
In connection with the plan relating to the retirement of IRES' debentures the Commission approved and released jurisdiction over fees
and expenses aggregating $102,750 and $6,341, respectively."
These
payments were subsequently approved by the reorganization court.t"
Early in fiscalyear 1955 the various participants in the reorganization
of IRES (other than representatives of debenture holders, the Trustee
and his counsel) were advised to file with the Commission any claims
for fees not later than September 30, 1954. Fee applications aggregating approximately $1,700,000 were received and on January 13, 1955,
the Commission directed the Trustee to negotiate with the several
applicants and to report what payments he had agreed upon or was
prepared to recommend with respect to them." The Trustee's report
was filed late in the fiscal year. Thereafter the Commission directed
its staff to conduct further negotiations with the applicants, and these'
negotiations were continuing at the end of the fiscal year.
On June 17, 1955, the Commission issued an order pursuant to rule.
U-63 authorizing the Interim Board of Directors of IRES to make.
certain interim disbursements to defray the reasonable and necessary
costs and expenses in performing its duties; and on June 24, 1955, the'
Commission denied a request for reconsideration of its order." Subsequently, the Court approved the payment by the Trustee of the fees.
and expenses of the Interim Board in the aggregate amount of
$19,468.13 with respect to services already rendered, but refused to
authorize in advance periodic payments for services yet to be rendered

Middle South Utilities, Inc.

Middle South Utilities, Inc., is solely a holding company. Its
operating subsidiary companies are Arkansas Power & Light Company,
Louisiana Power & Light Company, Mississippi Power & Light Company, and New Orleans Public Service, Inc. Middle South also owns
10 percent stock interest in Electric Energy, Inc., which supplies power
to the Atomic Energy Commission, and its subsidiary, Arkansas.
Power & Light owns a 34 percent interest in Arklahoma Corporation,
a jointly owned transmission facility. As at December 31, 1954, the
consolidated assets of this system, including Middle South's investment in Electric Energy, Inc. and Arkansas Power & Light's investment in Arklahoma Corporation, less valuation reserves, aggregated
$570 million. The electric properties of the four operating companies.
have been found by the Commission to constitute an integrated
electric utility system, but certain gas and other non-utility properties.
owned by two subsidiary companies are subject to a divestment order
issued under section 11 (b).
Steps taken during the past year to dispose of the non-retain able'
properties included the organization by Louisiana Power of a subsidiary company, Louisiana Gas Service Corporation, for the purpose
of transferring to that company all of Louisiana Power's non-electric
properties." As part of the proposal, Louisiana Power requested au
order of this Commission declaring, pursuant to section 3 (a) (4) ,.
that Louisiana Power was only temporarily a holding company, the'
filing indicating that, while no definitive program to dispose of thecommon stock of Louisiana Gas had been developed, it was the intent
to effect divestment within 18 months of the acquisition. The Louisiana Public Service Commission requested a public hearing on the
proposal and also filed a petition to reopen the record in the proceedings leading to the related divestment order of March 20, 1953.
The Public Service Commission urged that the gas properties be
permanently retained. It contended that all consumers of Louisiana
Power would best be served by the continued operation by that company of the gas and electric properties. On May 16, 1955, the Commission published a notice of the petition filed by the Public ServiceCommission and its offer of proof and brief in support thereof.t':

Connecticut. As at December 31, 1954, the consolidated assets of
this system, less valuation reserves, amounted to $474 million.
There are minority stock interests in several of these subsidiaries
and the Commission and its staff over the years have urged NEES
to reduce the number of its subsidiaries and to reduce or eliminate the
minority interests. Steps have been made in this direction through
a series of mergers and offers of cash for the minority stock. Discussions are continuing between the staff and representatives of NEES
with a view to further reduction in the number of subsidiaries and
reduction or elimination of the minority interests.
During the past fiscal year the Commission approved a joint proposal by three system companies authorizing, among other things, the
sale and transfer by Connecticut River Power Company of its properties to New England Power Company, the principal system generating company, for an aggregate consideration of $38,646,924.37 This
and related transactions, including the liquidation of Connecticut
River Power Company, were consummated on January 26, 1955.
During the year a new company, Yankee Atomic Electric Company,
was formed by 12 sponsoring New England utility companies, the

North American Company, The
Union Electric Company of Missouri

During the past fiscal year the final steps were taken by The North
.American Company to liquidate and dissolve pursuant to its section
11 (e) plan. This plan and the interim steps taken pursuant to it are
described in the 18th .Annual Report, page 122, 19th Annual Report,
page 66, and 20th Annual Report, page 62.
Union Electric Company of Missouri is the surviving holding company in North American's integrated electric system, located in
Missouri, illinois, and Iowa. Union is both an operating company and
-a holding company, and in addition to its electric properties owns
directly and indirectly some gas utility properties and some nonutility assets. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of Union
Electric and its subsidiaries, less valuation reserves, amounted to $448
million. Upon the completion of the merger of Union Electric
Power Company, an illinois subsidiary, into Union, which was approved by the Commission after the end of the fiscal year 1955,38
Union continued to have three public utility subsidiaries, including a
40 percent interest in Electric Energy Inc., an electric generating company whose output is under contract to the Atomic Energy Commission. This merger was made possible by a recent amendment of the
illinois corporation laws which permits a foreign corporation under
certain circumstances to own and operate utility properties in Illinois.
On January 20, 1955, North American made the final liquidating
distribution to its stockholders of the common stock of Union. Subsequently a request was made to the Commission for the release of
jurisdiction previously reserved over a contract between North
American and Union providing for the transfer by North American to
Union of all of North American's remaining assets, including the
30,256 shares of Union common stock not needed for the final Iiquidating distribution, and for the assumption by Union of all of North
.American's remaining liabilities. The Commission entered an order
on February 10, 1955, granting the requested release of jurisdiction
and the contract was consummated that same date." Union received
from North American under this contract all of the outstanding
capital stock of North American Light and Power Company, which was
then an inactive company whose assets consisted solely of a small
amount of cash and a claim for tax refunds. In June 1955, Union,
with the Commission's approval, took steps to liquidate and dissolve North American Light and Power." Union is subject to a

with the Commission a notice of intention pursuant to rule U-44 (c)
to sell its holdings of Westpan stock (52.88 percent of the shares outstanding) to Jalco, Inc., which is not affiliated with either Westpan
or Sinclair, pursuant to a contract between the parties dated March
31, 1955, at a base price of $4,618,330. Under the terms of the contract minority stockholders in Westpan are to have the opportunity
to receive for their shares an amount per share not less than the
amount per share to be received by Sinclair. After a study of the
material in the notice and after requesting and receiving additional
information about the proposed transactions the Commission advised
Sinclair that it need not file a declaration with respect to the proposal,
since the proposed sale price and other terms and conditions of the
proposed sale were deemed to be fair and reasonable and the sale
would enable Sinclair to consummate the divestment of the stock in
accordance with the terms of the Southwestern section 11 (e) plan.
The sale of Westpan stock to Jalco has not yet been consummated.
Standard Power and Light Corporation
Standard Gas and Electric Company
Philadelphia Company

These three companies are solely holding companies. They are
subject to outstanding section 11 (b) orders which require their liquidation and dissolution. In order to satisfy these orders the companies
have filed various plans under section 11 (e), and pursuant to these
plans have disposed of sufficient shares of all but one of their former
public utility subsidiaries so as to reduce their present holdings in such'
companies to less than 5 percent of the outstanding voting securities,
and eliminated all of their previously outstanding senior securities and
except for short-term bank loans, and intra-system debt, have reduced
their respective capitalizations to a single class of stock. Standard
Power presently owns approximately 45.6 percent of the outstanding
stock of Standard Gas; Standard Gas owns 100 percent of the outstanding stock of Philadelphia; and Standard Power, Standard Gas
and Philadelphia together own approximately 15 percent of the common stock of Duquesne Light Company, which is the only remaining
public utility subsidiary in the system. In addition Philadelphia owns
approximately 51 percent of Pittsburgh Railways Company, a nonutility company. As at December 31, 1954, the corporate assets of
Standard Power were stated at $134 million, after deducting valuation
reserves. A restatement of the company's investments at the market
values thereof would reduce the total asset figure to $32 million. The
consolidated assets of Standard Gas and its wholly owned subsidiaries,
less valuation reserves, were stated at $393 thousand as at December

31, 1954. However, the combined market values of Standard Gas'
investments exceeded the stated values thereof by more than $35
million.
Unresolved tax questions and substantial fee claims have in the
past held up compliance by Standard Power, Standard Gas and
Philadelphia with the Commission's section 11 (b) orders. The tax
questions remain unresolved but, as indicated below, substantially all
of the fee claims were disposed of during fiscal year 1955. It is the
present desire of the management of Standard Power to have the
Commission modify the dissolution order directed against Standard
Power and to keep Standard Power in existence as a closed-end,
non-diversified investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. This program envisages the reduction of
Standard Power's holdings in Duquesne to less than 5 percent of the
common stock before such time as Standard Power would seek a section 5 (d) order declaring that it had ceased to be a holding company,
whereupon registration would be effected under the Investment Company Act. In the interim, a restricted investment program would be
embarked upon for the purpose of profitably investing the liquid
assets of Standard Power. In March 1955 Standard Power filed a
section l1(e) plan and a petition for modification of the section 11(b)
dissolution order outstanding against it. These filings are designed to
carry out the present desires of the management as described above,
except that they do not include any application for a section 5 (d)
order. In May 1955 a public hearing was held on these filings, and the
Commission took the matter under advisement.
During the past fiscal year a settlement was made of the claims and
cross-claims existing between Standard Power and H. M. Byllesby
and Company. Byllesby formerly held 18.75 percent of Standard
Power's common stock, and in 1940 surrendered this stock to Standard
Power for cancellation pursuant to a contract which gave Byllesby the
right to share proportionately upon liquidation of Standard Power
in the latter's assets. Standard Power's cross-claims were based on
alleged wrongful profits received by Byllesby in connection with the
acquisition by Standard Power of control of Philadelphia in the
1924-26 period, and on alleged wrongful profits and fees received by
Byllesby in connection with subsequent transfers of securities, underwriting contracts, and service and management contracts. Under
the settlement Byllesby gave up approximately 20 percent of its claim,
and full releases were exchanged by the parties. A section 11 (e) plan
embodying the settlement was filed and was approved by the Commission on October 29, 1954.48 The Commission's order of approval was
enforced by the District Court in December 1954.49 The settlement

was consummated on January 31,1955 by Standard Power's delivering
to Byllesby $209,800 in cash, 174,000 shares of Standard Gas common
stock, 18,500 shares of Duquesne common stock, and 18,000 shares of
Oklahoma Gas and Electric Company common stock. As a result of
these transactions, Standard Power's holdings of Standard Gas common stock was reduced from 54 percent to 45.6 percent. The cash
equivalent of the settlement was approximately $4,750,000.
As stated in the 20th Annual Report the Commission approved
payment of approximately $2 million of fees and expenses during the
fiscal year 1954 for services rendered by various fee applicants in the
reorganization of Standard Gas. There remained for determination at
the commencement of fiscal year 1955the application of Guggenheimer
& Untermyer and associated counsel for a fee of $3,500,000 for services
rendered in the reorganization of Standard Gas, and in addition another
small claim for expenses. An allowance of $6,000 in satisfaction of the
small claim was approved by the Commission on February 14, 1955.50
Public hearings on the Guggenheimer & Untermyer claim were completed in December 1954, after preliminary litigation in the District
Court for the District of Delaware over the question of whether the
Court or the Commission had primary jurisdiction to approve a fee
for these claimants. Although the Court permitted the claimants to
file their claims with the Court, it stayed proceedings thereon until
the Commission had had an opportunity to hear and determine a
similar claim filed with the Commission. 51 During the Commission's
hearings, a settlement was reached under which the company would
pay an aggregate fee to Guggenheimer & Untermyer and associated
counsel of $861,000 plus expenses of $9,327.52. This settlement was
approved by the Commission on May 13,1955/2 and the Commission's
order of approval was enforced by the District Court on June 10, 195Q.53
As noted above, the complete liquidation and dissolution of Standard
Gas continues to be subject to delay as a result of unresolved tax
questions. The tax situation, however, did not prevent a partial
liquidating distribution of one-tenth of a share of Duquesne common
stock for each share of Standard Gas, which was made in December
1954, pursuant to a section 11 (e) plan which was approved by the
Commission, and enforced by the District Court for the District of
Delaware." The section 11 (e) plan covering the distribution provided also for the amendment of Standard Gas' certificate of incorporation so as to change its no par common stock (with a stated value
on the books of $10 per share) into an equal number of shares of
common stock of the par value of $1 per share .

The guarantees by Philadelphia of Duquesne's contractual obligation to pay to Monongahela Light and Power Company, a non-affiliate,
certain lease-rental payments on properties leased by Monongahela to
Duquesne for a term of 900 years were eliminated on March 18, 1955,
after approval by the Commission and enforcement by the District
Court of a section 11 (e) plan providing for such elimination." Philadelphia also guaranteed the performance of Duquesne's obligation
under the contract of lease to keep the leased premises insured and to
surrender them at the end of the lease "in the same good order and
condition in which they now are". These guarantees were a complexity in the system and their elimination was a necessary step toward
ultimate liquidation and dissolution of Philadelphia. The lease-rental
was $85,300 per annum, plus such amounts as were necessary to cover
the interest on Monongahela's outstanding bonds in the principal
amount of $1,698,000, all of which were owned by Duquesne, and all
taxes imposed on Monongahela.
The United

Corporation

The United Corporation is a registered holding company but no
longer has any public-utility subsidiaries. During the fiscal year it
filed an application for a section 5 (d) order declaring that it has ceased
to be a holding company. If this order is granted, it proposes to
register as a non-diversified, closed-end investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940.
In the fiscal year 1955 two orders of the Commission involving
United were upheld in the courts. In one proceeding, which was
pending during the previous fiscal year, the Court of Appeals affirmed
a decision of the District Court enforcing the Commission's order
denying recovery by United of fees and expenses from its former
subsidiary, Niagara Hudson Power Corporation, in connection with
the latter's plan of reorganization."
In the other proceeding the
District Court approved the Commission's application for enforcement
of its order regarding certain provisions of United's Final Comprehensive Plan under section 11 (e) relating to charter and by-law provisions
and for the cancellation of United's outstanding option warrants
without any compensation. 57 Appeals taken from this decision were
pending at the close of the fiscal year.
Proceedings before the Commission were in progress during the past
fiscal year with respect to applications for fees and expenses aggregating approximately $848,800 for services rendered in connection with
United's 1944 Exchange Plan and its 1951 Amended Investment Company Plan. After public hearings on these applications, the Commission issued an order fixing the post-hearing procedure and disposed

4, 1955, and the Commission took the matter under advisement.
On February 14, 1955, the Commission issued an order approving
an additional allowance for fees incurred by counsel for a Pr-eference
Stockholders' Committee." The additional allowance was made in
compliance with a District Court order which considered that the
Commission's original allowance of $2,000 was too low, and which
directed the Commission to approve a fee of $5,000.60
After United's section 5 (d) application was filed, a stockholder
requested that a hearing be held on it. The Commission treated the
request as an offer of proof insofar as it contained factual allegations,
and after giving United and the staff an opportunity to file answers
to it, held oral argument after the end of the fiscal year.
Western Kentucky Gas Company

Western Kentucky Gas Company filed a notification of registration
under the Act on July 9, 1954. It was then a holding company by
reason of its acquisition 2 days earlier of all the outstanding common
stock of Shelbyville Gas Company. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of Western Kentucky and its subsidiary, less valuation reserves, amounted to $10 million. A merger of these companies
was approved by the Commission on March 7, 1955.61 The merger
has been consummated except for the filing of a certificate of dissolution of Shelbyville Gas Company. Western Kentucky has advised the Commission that as soon as this filing is made, it will apply
pursuant to section 5 (d) for an order declaring that it has ceased to
be a holding company.
Wisconsin Electric Power Company

Wisconsin Electric Power Company is a holding company and an
operating public-utility company. It has two public-utility subsidiaries, Wisconsin Michigan Power Company and Wisconsin Natural
Gas Company, and one non-utility subsidiary, The Milwaukee Electric
Railway & Transport Company, which in turn owns Badger Auto
Service Company, also a non-utility. All companies in the system
are incorporated in the State of Wisconsin. The Wisconsin Electric
system generates and distributes electricity in Wisconsin and Michigan
and distributes gas in Wisconsin. As at December 31, 1954, consolidated assets of the system, less valuation reserves, amounted to $302
million.
On February 15, 1955 Wisconsin Electric filed an application for

pany may be entitled to an exemption from the Act if it is predominantly a public-utility company whose operations as such do not
extend beyond the State in which it is organized and States contiguous thereto. At the time this application was filed there was
pending a proceeding instituted by the Commission in 1950 under
section 11 (b) (1) of the Act for the purpose of determining whether
it was consistent with the standards of the Act for Wisconsin Electric
to own and operate an electric utility sy,atem and at the same time
to carry on gas utility operations and own non-utility properties.
By an order dated June 3, 1955, the Commission granted the requested
exemption and dismissed the pending section l1(b) (1) proceeding."
Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, Inc.

Wisconsin Southern Gas Company, Inc. (formerly Wisconsin
Southern Gas and Appliance Corporation) filed a Notification of
Registration under the Act on May 28, 1952, at which time it had
one public utility subsidiary, Wisconsin Southern Gas Company.
Both companies are "\Visconsincorporations supplying propane and
natural gas to customers in the State of Wisconsin. As of December
31, 1954, consolidated assets of the system, less valuation reserves,
amounted to $3 million.
Since Wisconsin Southern registered in 1952 it has made substantial
improvement in its capital structure, which at that time was unbalanced. During the past fiscal year Wisconsin Southern proposed a
statutory merger with its subsidiary pursuant to Wisconsin law. In
connection with the proposal, and to permit its effectuation under
State law, Wisconsin Southern requested an exemption pursuant to
section 3 (a) (1) of the Act, under which a holding company may be
entitled to an exemption from the Act if it is predominantly a public
utility company whose operations as such do not extend beyond the
State in which it is organized and States contiguous thereto. The
Commission granted the exemption shortly after the close of the fiscal
year." Upon consummation of the merger Wisconsin Southern will
cease to be a holding company.
REVISIONS OF RULES

The results of a program initiated by the Commission early in fiscal
1954 to reexamine the rules and forms adopted pursuant to the Act
were reported in the 20th Annual Report, p. 70. In the past fiscal
year the Commission adopted three amendments to existing rules
under the Act.
On December 10, 1954, the Commission adopted an amendment to
rule U-48. The amendment provides an exemption from sections 9 (a)

and 6 (a) of the Act with respect to loans to officers and employees
made pursuant to a personnel policy of general application by registered public utility holding companies or their subsidiaries." Previously, the rule provided exemptions for these companies in connection with appliance sales only. The amendment was proposed in a
petition filed by Columbia Gas System, Inc., a registered holding
company. Columbia was interested in adopting as part of its personnel
policy provisions for personal loans to employees so as to assist them in
purchasing new homes whenever they were relocated within the
system.
On January 12, 1955 the Commission adopted an amendment to
rule U-45 (b) (6) under section 12 of the Act.65 This rule regulates the
allocation of consolidated income taxes among the several members of
a registered holding company system. The amendment provides an
alternate method of tax allocation. Holding companies may now
choose between the methods prescribed in sections 1552 (a) (1)
("source of income" method) and 1552 (a) (2) ("separate return tax"
relationship) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954. The amendment
also provides that the tax allocated to a subsidiary shall not exceed
the amount of tax that would have been payable by such subsidiary
on a separate return basis and that any such "excess" shall be apportioned among the other members of the consolidated group, including
the parent company, in proportion to their tax savings by reason of the
consolidation. Previously, the rule required that the top company
allocate the tax on a separate return tax relationship basis among all
members of the consolidated group in amounts not exceeding, as to
any company, that percentage of the consolidated tax liability which
the income tax liability of such company if paid on a separate return
basis would be of the aggregate income tax liability of the individual
companies based upon separate returns.
An amendment to rule U-70, subparagraph (b) (2), was adopted on
March 21, 1955.66 Subparagraph (b) (2) limits financial transactions
between registered holding companies and their subsidiaries, on the
one hand, and financial institutions having common directors with
such holding companies or subsidiaries, on the other. The amendment
clarifies the authority of holding companies and their subsidiaries to
borrow from certain local commercial banks which have common
directors with the holding company or subsidiaries.
After the close of the fiscal year the Commission adopted minor
amendments of rules U-104 and U-105 promulgated under the Act

rules consistent with Executive Order No. 10501, 18 F. R. 7049,

FINANCING

Security sales reported by the entire electric and gas utility
industries for the fiscal year 1955 amounted to approximately $2,750
million as compared with approximately $3,450 million for the fiscal
year 1954, a decrease of nearly 21 percent. Among the factors which
appeared to affect the 1955 totals were the sharp increase in the rate
of utility financing in the last half of the fiscal year 1954, which
provided in advance a considerable portion of the funds required for
1955 needs, and a moderate decline of industry construction expendiHITes beginning early in the fiscal year 1955.
The seasonally adjusted annual rate 0'£ expenditures for plant
and equipment by privately owned electric, gas and water utilities
declined from about $4.35 billion in the last half of the fiscal year
1954 to $4.01 billion in the second and third quarters of the fiscal year
1955. The adjusted annual rate of expenditures for plant and equipment increased to $4.09 billion in the last quarter of 1955 and estimates for the first and second quarters of the fiscal year 1956 place
the rates at $4.64 billion and $4.68 billion, respectively." The
level of such expenditures estimated for fiscal 1956 indicates a significant reversal of the downward trend of such expenditures predicted
by the industry in 1954,69and if these expectations are borne out the
volume of utility financing may also register an important increase
in coming months.
The volume of external financing by registered systems, which
includes both public offerings and private placements of securities
with institutions, declined 26 percent to $667.8 million in the fiscal
year 1955 from the $902.9 million reported for 1954. The volume for
the fiscal year 1953 totaled $712.3 million. The 1955 decline is
attributable in part to the general contraction in security sales by
the entire electric and gas utility industries in the fiscal year 1955 and
in part to divestments of utility subsidiaries by registered holding
company systems over the past several years and exemptions of certain
systems from the provisions of the Act. In addition to passing upon
the external financings of registered holding company systems, the
Commission also passes upon sales of securities by subsidiaries in
registered systems to their parents.

External financing of registered holding company systems accounted for 23 percent of the total volume of financing by the entire
electric and gas utility industries in the fiscal year 1955 as compared
with 26 percent in 1954. This decline was due in part to divestments
of non-retainable utility subsidiaries by registered holding company
systems over the past several years and exemptions of certain systems
from the provisions of the Act.
Common and preferred equity financings by registered systems was
at a higher level in the year 1955 than in 1954. External sales of
common stocks by registered systems in 1955 amounted to 14 percent
of their total outside financing and preferred stock offerings amounted

to an additional 17 percent, the comparable 1955 percentages for the
entire electric and gas utilities industry being 14 percent and 11
percent, respectively. In 1954 external sales of common stocks by
registered systems amounted to 12 percent of their total outside
:financing and preferred stock offerings amounted to an additional 9
percent; the comparable 1954 percentages for the entire electric and
gas utilities industry were 18 percent and 12 percent, respectively.
Rights offering to stockholders have continued during 1955 to be the
most popular method of effecting sales of common stocks not only
among registered holding company systems but throughout the
electric and gas utility industries. Of the seven common-stock issues
totaling $95 million sold externally by registered systems in 1955, five
issues with sales value of $59 million, amounting to 62 percent of the
total dollar volume, were offered to stockholders by means of rights.
Sixty-four percent of the dollar volume of common stocks sold in 1955
by all other electric and gas utilities were offered through rights.

The trend in the direction of non-underwritten rights offerings for
common stock financing in the electric and gas utility industries, which
was in evidence in the fiscal years 1953 and 1954, was reversed in 1955,
although registered holding companies continued to show a preference
for this method of fund raising. There was also a pronounced
tendency in 1955for electric and gas utilities to omit the over-subscription privilege from their underwritten rights offering. The sole
underwritten rights offering by a registered holding company during
the year was set up in this manner. N on-underwritten rights offerings
by companies not subject to the Act were about equally divided between those with an oversubscription privilege and those without.
Registered holding companies showed greater preference for use of the
privilege.

Offerings of securities by issuing companies pursuant to sections
6 (b) and 7 of the Act and portfolio sales by registered holding companies under section 12 (d) are required to be made in accordance
with the provisions of rule U-50, which requires competitive bidding
unless an exemption is available. Automatic exemptions from
competitive bidding requirements for certain types of sales, including
nonunderwritten sales made to stockholders pursuant to preemptive
rights, are provided by clauses (1) through (4) of paragraph (a) of
the rule. Under paragraph (a) (5) the Commission may by order
exempt an offering from competitive bidding if it appears unnecessary
or inappropriate to carry out the provisions of the Act. In any
application for exemption pursuant to paragraph (a) (5) of rule U-50,
the seller must show that competitive conditions have been maintained by discussing the proposed sale of securities with a reasonable
number of possible purchasers or underwriters.
The following table shows the volume of securities sold at competitive bidding pursuant to rule U-50 in the fiscal year 1955 by

The number of issues sold at competitive bidding is lower than in
prior years due to the reduction in the volume of financing by companies in registered holding company systems referred to above.
Only two issues of securities were exempted from competitive
bidding requirements pursuant to paragraph (a) (5) of rule U-50,
as a consequence of orders entered by the Commission in the fiscal
year 1955. Neither of these issues were sold for the purpose of
raising new money. Cities Service Company was granted an exemption in connection with its proposal to dispose of its holdings of 51.5
percent of the outstanding common stock of its subsidiary, Arkansas
Louisiana Gas Company, pursuant to the plan of reorganization
approved by the Commission under section 11 (b) (1) of the Act.
This involved the sale of 1,958,189 common shares of Arkansas
Louisiana for a total of $24,479,363 to W. R. Stephens Investment
Company, Inc., for purposes of subsequent reorganization and disposal to the public.
Georgia Power Company, a subsidiary of The Southern Company,
was granted an exemption for a proposal to make an offering of $43
million to $4.60 preferred stock in exchange for outstanding $6
preferred stock." The company based its application for exemption
on the exceptionally large size of the offering and the fact that it
desired to have as much as possible of the stock held ,in its operating
territory.
While these two issues were the only issues sold under exemption
orders entered in the fiscal year 1955, bonds and notes totalling
$198 million were sold by Ohio Valley Electric Corporation and
Electric Energy, Inc., during the year pursuant to orders of exemption
'entered by the Commission in 1951 and 1953 as described in the 20th
Annual Report, pages 84 and 85.
Shortly after the close of the fiscal year American Louisiana Pipeline was ~anted an exemption from the competitive bidding requirements of Rule U-50 pursuant to paragraph (a) (5) thereof in connection with the proposed sale of its construction bonds. In this
case the Commission considered the effect upon the consumer and
public interests as well as the prevailing state of the money market
and the possibility th rt there would be an increase rather than a
decrease in the cost of money to the issuer if a renegotiation of the
sale of the bonds was required. Although granting the exemption,
the Commission expressed concern over the extent to which competitive conditions had been maintained in negotiations for the sale of
the bonds, since the pipeline company had entered into the bond
purchase agreement with the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company
and the Mutual Life Insurance Company of New York without
discussing the proposed sale with any other possible purchasers. The

Commission's opinion stated that it recognized the activity of Metropolitan in the field of pipeline construction bond financing, but it
felt that more than one source of funds for a sound pipe line enterprise might be found and pointed out that: " ...
in the future we
shall expect, as a condition to obtaining an exception from Rule U-50,
that an issuer give evidence that it has discussed its issue with a
reasonable number of prospective purchasers." 71
In comparison with the 657 issues of securities totalling $9,073
million sold by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries
at competitive bidding from the effective date of rule U-50, May 7,
1941, to the close of the fiscal year 1955, 217 issues with dollar volume
of $2,095 million were sold through other channels in accordance
with orders of the Commission granting exemptions from competitive
bidding requirements pursuant to paragraph (a) (5) of the rule. The
following table sets forth the cumulative totals of issues and dollar
volume of each type of security sold pursuant to these exemptions.

The entire amounts or these commitments were exempted from coIUpetitlve biddmg requirements

pursuant
to rule U-50 (a) (5). The total authorizations

The granting of exemptions from the competitive bidding requirements of rule U-50 in respect of all of the security sales included in
the above table were based upon unusual circumstances which did not
favor public offerings through competitive underwriting channels.
To illustrate, it will be noted from the above table that only 52 of the
exempted issues with an aggregate dollar value of $498 million were
sold through underwriters. Of the $989 million of bonds sold in nonunderwritten transactions exempt from competitive bidding, $954
million represented private placement of bonds and the remainder of
$35 million were miscellaneous other types of nonunderwritten sales.

Included in the private placements were $420million of bonds sold pursuant to the construction loan commitments made by Ohio Valley Electric Corp. and Electric Energy, Inc., described in footnote 2 of the preceding table. Two subsidiary natural gas pipe line companies sold
$94 million of bonds during the period under similar agreements.
Also included among the private placements were $100 million of
collateral trust bonds issued as part of a reorganization settlement
under section 11 of the Act. All of the $83 million of notes sold pursuant to exemption orders during the period and more than half of the
$37 million of debentures sold without underwritings were also in the
nature of private placements. Of the 37 issues of preferred stock
issues totaling $374 million, 17 issues aggregating $286 million exempted from competitive bidding were refunding exchange offerings,
14 of which, with total volume of $227 million, were initiated prior to
the announcement by the Commission of its general policy requiring
competitive bidding in such cases." Of the 84 issues of common
stock amounting to $502 million which were exempted from competitive bidding, 16 issues, totaling $83 million, represented sales of
equity investments in subsidiaries by registered holding companies
to other public utility or holding companies. Seventeen other issues,
aggregating $43 million, were in the nature of sales of common stock
investments in small non-retainable subsidiaries directly to private
individuals or small groups of individuals.
Another financing development occurring during the year was the
refunding of several high dividend-bearing callable preferred stocks.P"
This development was the continuation of a financial trend which
started with a preferred stock refunding of this nature in the latter
part of fiscal 1954.73 Northern States Power Company (Minn.) refunded $20 million par value of $4.80 preferred stock by means of the
sale of 200,000 shares of new $4.11 preferred stock of $100 par value

FINANCING OF ELECTRIC GENERATING COMPANIES WHICH SUPPLY
ELECTRICITY TO FACILITIES OF THE ATOMIC ENERGY COMl\US-

SION

Three large generating companies, Electric Energy, Inc., and Ohio
Valley Electric Corporation and its subsidiary Indiana-Kentucky Electric Corporation, were organized to furnish power to facilities of the
Atomic Energy Commission. They are subject to the Act because
they are subsidiaries of registered holding companies. The organization and financing arrangements of these companies are described
in the 17th, 18th, and 20th Annual Reports of the Commission. In
the fiscal year 1955 Electric Energy completed its financing by selling
the remaining $30 million of its total authorization of $195million
mortgage bonds. Ohio Valley Electric sold an additional $144 million
of mortgage bonds out of its total authorization of $360 million,
leaving $135 million remaining to be taken down. The company also
issued and sold $24 million of notes in 1955 under previous authorizations. On May 10, 1955 the sponsors of Ohio Valley were authorized
by the Commission to postpone the purchase of $10 million of the $20
million of common shares of the company which they were obligated
. to purchase, and Ohio Valley was authorized to sell in lieu thereof $10
million of interim notes-due 90 days after demand." Six million
dollars of these notes were issued and sold on June 17,1955.
On November 9, 1954, Middle South Utilities, Inc., and The
Southern Company, both registered holding companies, jointly filed
an application-declaration for approval of the issuance and sale of
common stock of a new generating company, Mississippi Valley
Generating Company, and for the acquisition thereof by Middle
South and Southern. Mississippi Valley was organized under the
laws of Arkansas for the purpose of constructing and operating a
generating station to furnish power pursuant to a power contract
dated November 11, 1954, between Mississippi Valley and the United
States of America acting by and through the Atomic Energy Commission. The power would have been delivered to the Tennessee
Valley Authority for or on account of the Atomic Energy Commission.

were held before the Commission sitting en bane, and the State of
Tennessee and various municipalities and electric power cooperatives
located in the Tennessee Valley area appeared in opposition to the
application. The Commission approved the issuance and acquisition
of the securities on February 9, 1955.80 On March 14, 1955, the State'
of Tennessee, et al., filed a petition for review in the United States
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia requesting that the
case be remanded to the Commission 'with directions to disapprove
the companies' joint application.
On April 22, 1955, while the appeal was pending, Middle South,
Southern, and Mississippi Valley filed a joint application-declaration
for approval of the issuance and sale by Mississippi Valley of
$77,362,000 principal amount of first mortgage bonds and $22,553,000
principal amount of notes for the purpose of financing the construction
of its proposed generating plant. After notice," public hearings were
held commencing May 16, 1955, before a trial examiner and the
State of Tennessee and others again appeared in opposition.
On July 11, 1955, the Government announced that the Power
Contract would be cancelled since the city of Memphis had indicated
that it would construct a municipal power plant to take care of its
needs after expiration in 1958 of its existing power arrangements
with the Tennessee Valley Authority. As a result of this announcement, the Commission on July 14, 1955, suspended post-hearing
procedures on the bond and note financing. On August 11, 1955, the
applicants filed amendments to their application-declaration in the
two proceedings, which stated, among other things, that on July 30,
1955, the President of the United States had directed the Atomic
Energy Commission to take the necessary steps to bring to an end the
relationship between Mississippi Valley and the United States.
Thereafter, upon motion by the Commission, the Court of Appeals on
September 12, 1955, remanded the case before it to the Commission
with directions to take such action as appeared appropriate in view
of the changed circumstances."

COM:MISSION

during the fiscal year 1955 where State public authorities took part
in proceedings under the Act before the Commission.
An underlying objective of the Act is to supplement and strengthen
local regulation of public utilities. Notices of proceedings and of
•
proposals to amend or adopt rules, forms and regulations under the
Act, which are considered likely to be of interest to State and local
authorities, are sent to those agencies. All matters of general interest
are circulated in this manner among the members of the National
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners.
Some examples of cooperation with State and local authorities
are described below.
On January 12, 1955, the Commission adopted an amendment of
rule U-45 (b) (6) under the Act which regulates the allocation of consolidated income taxes among the several members of a holding company system. sa This amendment was preceded by nearly 2 years of
study of the operation of the rule and its possible inequities. The
Commission, after invitation for comments on a proposed amendment
of the rule, received comments from the various companies affected,
from various State and local regulatory authorities, and from the
National Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners. After
considering these comments, the Commission issued an announcement
on December 30, 1953, that the proposed revision previously promulgated would not be adopted but that further studies of tax allocations
in registered holding company systems would be carried out." During
the last fiscal year the Commission invited comments on a further
revision based in part upon the provisions of the Internal Revenue
Code of 1954.85 Comments were received from various persons, including one municipal regulatory authority, and these comments as
well as those received on the revision proposed in the previous fiscal
year were taken into consideration by the Commission in finally
amending the rule in January 1955.
During the fiscal year 1955 applications for exemptions of various
registered holding company systems from the Act pursuant to section
3 thereof were passed upon by the Commission. In a proceeding
granting an exemption to Northern States Power Company (Minn.r"
the Public Service Commissions of Wisconsin and North Dakota and
the city of St. Paul, Minn., appeared and made statements in support
of the exemption. On June 3,1955, the Commission entered an order
exempting Wisconsin Electric Power Company from the Act,87and in

Michigan and the city of Milwaukee each wrote letters to the Commission supporting the exemption.
Immediately after the close of fiscal year 1955 the Commission had
occasion in three other instances to consider the positions of state or
regulatory authorities. One of these involved Wisconsin Southern
Gas Company, Inc., a holding company over a single operating company whose operations were confined to the State of Wisconsin. The
Commission first granted Wisconsin Southern an exemption from the
Act in the light of a proposed merger between the company and its
subsidiary," and then, after the merger, issued an order pursuant to
section 5 (d) declaring that Wisconsin Southern had ceased to be a
holding company." These steps were taken in consultation with the
Public Service Commission of Wisconsin. The second instance involved Louisiana Power & Light Company, a subsidiary of Middle
South Utilities, Inc. Pursuant to a prior section 11 (b) (1) order of the
Commission, Louisiana Power proposed to create a new subsidiary and
transfer to it gas and water properties which Louisiana Power had
been ordered by the Commission to dispose of. The Louisiana Public
Service Commission filed a petition with the Commission seeking a
reopening of the proceeding which had led to the issuance of the outstanding section 11 (b) (1) order. Jefferson Parish in Louisiana, on
the other hand, opposed the petition of the Louisiana Commission.
After careful consideration of an offer of proof made by the Louisiana
Commission, the Commission denied the petition on September 13,
1955.90 The proposal by Louisiana Power to form a new subsidiary
and transfer its gas and water properties to it was pending at the
close of the fiscal year.
On June 9, 1955, the Georgia Public Service Commission filed a
petition for the reopening of the section 11 (b) proceedings pursuant
to which Florida Power Corporation, an exempt holding company,
became the parent of Georgia Power & Light Company, an electric
utility company operating in Georgia. The Georgia Commission was
of the view that the retail rates being charged by Georgia Power &
Light were too high and that this was due to excessive wholesale rates
charged to Georgia Power & Light by its parent, Florida Power. In
August 1955 the Commission decided that since the electric properties
of Florida Power and its subsidiary constituted an integrated publicutility system, and since there was no substantial change in the facts
in this regard between January 25, 1945, the date of the Commission's
previous order, and August 1955, there was no basis for reopening
the section 11 (b) proceedings.

PART V
PARTICIPATION OF mE
COMMISSION IN CORPORATE
REORGANIZATIONS UNDER CHAPTER X OF THE BANKRUPTCY ACT, AS AMENDED
Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the federal courts. The Commission's duties
under Chapter X are, at the request or with the approval of the court,
to provide the court and investors with independent expert assistance
on the various legal and financial questions that arise in the proceeding and to prepare advisory reports on plans of reorganization. The
Commission has no right of appeal in a Chapter X proceeding, but it
may participate in appeals taken by others.
The Commission acts in a purely advisory capacity. It has no
authority either to veto or to require the adoption of a plan of reorganization or to render a decision on any other issue in the proceeding. Its recommendations are made for the benefit of the judge and
the security holders, affording them its disinterested views in a highly
complex area of corporate law and finance. Generally, the Commission participates only in proceedings in which there is a substantial
public investor interest.
In connection with a reappraisal of its functions under Chapter X,
the Commission, with the approval of the Judicial Conference and
with the assistance of the Administrative Office of the United States
Courts, sought the comments of the federal judiciary. Comments
have been received which reflect a wide variety of views. Particularly
significant was a comment from Chief Judge Charles E. Clark written
on behalf of all of the active judges (as of March 21, 1955) of the
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, which court sits in a review
capacity over a large proportion of all Chapter X proceedings. Judge
Clark stated:
We regard the service being rendered by the Commission to the Courts in
connection with the reorganization of corporations to be most valuable, if not
indispensable, for the proper disposition of this vital segment of court business
according to the Congressional intent. The Commission affords the necessary
expert knowledge, the skill, and the uniform approach which individual judges
cannot have; and to the district judges in particular, the assistance is unique in
its usefulness, and not otherwise to be obtained. The judge is not bound to observe all suggestions of the Commission, but the very fact that he has them
before him is assurance of his complete preparation for adjudication, with the
public interest adequately protected. We regard it as peculiarly unfortunate if
considerations of economy (which must be of small and petty character as compared to the value of the interests protected) are allowed to curtail such worthwhile activities.

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

SUl\fMARY OF ACTIVITIES

The Commission participated during the 1955 fiscal year in 38 proceedings involving the reorganization of 61 companies with aggregate
stated assets of $671,596,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of
$478,050,000. During the year the Commission, with court approval,
filed notices of appearance in two new proceedings under Chapter X
involving six companies with aggregate stated assets of $112,769,000
and aggregate stated indebtedness of $113,230,000. Proceedings involving 11 principal debtor corporations and 4 subsidiary debtors
were closed during the year. At the end of the year the Commission
was actively participating in 27 reorganization proceedings involving
46 companies with aggregate stated assets of $494,783,000 and aggregate stated indebtedness of $433,089,000.
Problems in the Administration of the Debtor's Estate

A fundamental aim of Chapter X is to make available to the court,
the parties and the security holders full and accurate information
regarding the debtor's affairs. The independent trustee customarily
transmits to security holders a report on the history and financial
condition of the debtor, the operation of its business, and the desirability of its continuance. Such reports enable security holders to
consider suggestions for a plan of reorganization or proposed plans
of others and aid the court in considering problems before it. The
Commission has consulted through its staff with trustees in connection
with their investigations and the preparation of their reports and
generally renders assistance in connection with the varied problems
that arise in the administration of the estate.
Examinations and Reports on Plans of Reorganization

Section 172 of Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act provides that the
judge may, if the scheduled indebtedness of the debtor does not
exceed $3 million, and shall, if such indebtedness exceeds $3 million,
submit to the Commission for examination and report a plan or
plans of reorganization which the judge regards as worthy of consideration.
During the fiscal year 1955 a plan of reorganization proposed by
the trustees of Muntz TV Inc., and its subsidiaries, Tele- Vogue, Inc.,
and J.Vuntz Industries, Inc., was submitted to the Commission for
examination and report. The Commission concluded that the plan
was fair to all classes of creditors and security holders. However, it
found that the plan was not feasible since the total amount of the
proposed debt estimated to be assumed by the reorganized company
was too high in relation to the indicated value of the company's assets.
The Commission, therefore, recommended that consideration be given
to amending the plan to provide for the issuance of common stock to

TWENTY-FIRST

A1\'NUAL REPORT

91

the creditors for some portion of their claim, and to provide for an
appropriate extension of the period within which the remaining debt
could be paid without imposing a handicap on management in its
operation of the business.
Amendments to the plan submitted by the trustees provided in
substance for the issuance to the unsecured general creditors of
promissory notes for 75 percent of the allowed amounts of their
claims, with full payment thereof to be made within 8 years after
confirmation of the plan, and for the issuance at par to the unsecured
general creditors of a new class of preferred stock, of the par value of
$1 per share, for the remaining 25 percent of the allowed amounts of
their claims. Although the amendments to the plan provided for the
issuance of a new class of preferred stock to the unsecured general
creditors for some portion of their claim, instead of common stock as
suggested by the Commission in its advisory report, and although
the terms and provisions of the preferred stock did not conform in
all respects to those which the Commission would normally recommend
for a preferred stock, the Commission concluded in a supplemental
advisory report that the amendments substantially met the objections
which it had raised as to the feasibility of the plan, particularly since
the unsecured creditors were merchandise or trade creditors with a
special interest in the reorganized debtor.
During the fiscal year 1955 the Commission issued two supplemental
advisory reports in the consolidated reorganization proceedings involving Inland Gas Corporation, Kentucky Fuel Gas Corporation, and
American Fuel and Power Company. These supplemental reports
were required as a result of the submission to the Commission by the
Court of various alternative amended or revised plans for the reorganization of these debtors. The various plans were predicated upon
a sale procedure with an upset price for the physical properties of the
debtors. A novel aspect- of two of the plans was an arrangement
whereby a bid could be made on behalf of the reorganized company
and, if it were the successful bid, security holders would then have
the election to take stock in the reorganized company or a cash
distribution upon the basis of the amount of the successful bid. None
of the plans, however, was approved by the court because they were
conditioned upon a favorable tax ruling which was not obtained.
Proceedings are still pending.
Fairness

of Treatment

of Security Holders

During the fiscal year an important issue involving the treatment
of security holders was decided in the Third Avenue Transit Corporation case 1 in which the Commission participated.
I

In r« Third Aoenue Tranrit Corporation, 222 F. 2<1. 466 (C. A. 2, May 5, 1955).

92

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

An involuntary petition under Chapter X was filed in 1948 against
Third Avenue. Prior thereto, the debtor had acquired, and there
were delivered to the trustee, approximately $5,600,000 of First
Refunding Mortgage Bonds out of a total of about $20,500,000 of
outstanding bonds. In the course of the administration of the estate
of the debtor, the reorganization trustee petitioned the District
Court for an order determining that the bonds held by him were
enforceable against the mortgaged property on a parity with the
bonds which were publicly held. The effect of granting the trustee's
petition would have been to free certain of the debtor's mortgaged
property for the benefit of general creditors.
The Commission joined with the indenture trustee under the mortgage and a bondholders committee in opposing the granting of the
reorganization trustee's petition on the grounds that it would violate
the rule of "absolute priority" which had been upheld in Oonsolidated
Rock Products 00. v, DuBois, 312 U. S. 510 (1941), and other cases.
The district judge felt bound by two equity receivership precedents
and entered an order declaring that the bonds held by the reorganization trustee were enforceable against the debtor's property and constituted "free" assets for the benefit of general creditors. On appeal
the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the Commission's position and reversed the decision of the District Court.
During the past fiscal year, the Commission actively participated
in negotiations leading to a settlement approved by the District
Court of the complex and lengthy litigation involved in the Pittsburgh Terminal Ooal Oorporation case." Under the settlement, public
stockholders of the reorganized company received $40 per share as a
final distribution for their stock out of a cash fund created by respondents in the litigation. The amount paid to stockholders, including prior distributions during the reorganization and thereafter, aggregated $130.50 per share of old preferred stock of the debtor. The
issues existing prior to the settlement included the accountability of
members of a reorganization committee, their near relatives and
friends, for profits made on the purchase of preferred stock of the
debtor prior to and during the reorganization and of stock of the
reorganized debtor directly after the reorganization plan was consummated, the accountability of the management of the reorganized
debtor for profits allegedly made in contravention of the terms of the
plan limiting salaries and other remuneration, and the liability of
the reorganization trustee for allegedly failing to collect rents and to

Consummation of Reorganization Plan

The Commission examines the corporate charters, by-laws, trust
indentures, and other instruments which are to govern the internal
structure of the reorganized debtor, and in general strives to assure
investors the inclusion of protective features and safeguards which
its experience has shown to be desirable. Another matter with which
the Commission has been concerned in connection with the consummation of plans of reorganization is the problem of unexchanged
securities. Chapter X provides that a period of not less than 5 years
following the final decree may be fixed by the judge within which
security holders may make the exchange called for by the plan, after
which they are barred from any participation. The Commission has
been anxious that all security holders obtain the new securities or
cash distributable to them under the plan of reorganization. Accordingly, it has endeavored to see that adequate notice and publicity
is given of the bar date, that a professional search is made where
possible, and that the bar date is extended when appropriate.
Commission's Activities Under Chapter XI

A problem that has come up with increasing frequency in recent
years involves the question of whether Chapter X or Chapter XI is
the appropriate statutory procedure for the financial rehabilitation of
a corporation under the Bankruptcy Act in a particular case. It
has been the Commission's position that the provisions of Chapter
XI were intended for the relief of debtors desiring to enter into an
arrangement with their unsecured creditors where there are no public
investor interests concerned which require the protective measures
and safeguards afforded under Chapter X. The Commission has
argued that Chapter X alone provides the necessary investigative
and analytical procedure which can deal effectively with the financial
and rehabilitation problems of a corporation having securities widely
held by the public. Section 328 of Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy
Act, as amended in 1952, confirmed the Commission's status, as determined by the Supreme Court in S. E. C. v. United States Realty
and Improvement Company, 310 U. S. 434 (1940), as a proper party
to apply to the court for dismissal of a Chapter XI proceeding where
it believed the case properly belonged under Chapter X.
In the Transoieion. case 3 the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit disagreed with the Commission's contention and refused to dismiss a Chapter XI proceeding although some 425 public investors
held a portion of the common stock of the company acquired through
a public offering and representing an investment of about $350,000.
The court in that case indicated that the nature of the plan which
was relatively simple, and the absence of evidence of irregularities by

the management made Chapter XI appropriate, and within the discretion of the District Court. A petition for certiorari filed by the
Commission, which believed this decision inconsistent with the
United States Realty case, was denied.
During the pendency of the Transvision appeal, the Commission
moved to dismiss a proceeding instituted by General Stores Corporation under Chapter XI of the Bankruptcy Act, joining a stockholder who had made a similar motion. The Commission contended
that Chapter X was the appropriate statutory remedy for this corporation which had outstanding $2,232,422 par value of common
stock in the hands of over 7,000 widely scattered stockholders.
The District Court entered an order dismissing the Chapter XI
petition 4 and the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed
the District Court's order." Both Courts distinguished the Transvision case, holding that the debtor was the kind of company, referred to in the United States Realty case, as belonging under Chapter
X because of the large and widespread public investor interest. After
the close of the fiscal year the United States Supreme Court granted
a petition for a writ of certiorari filed by the corporation.
Two other cases are pending involving generally the same question.
In Wilcox-Gay Oorporation." the Commission's motion to dismiss the
Chapter XI proceedings involving this corporation and its subsidiary
was denied by the District Oourt. The Oourt, relying upon the
Trameoision. case, determined in the exercise of its discretion that the
Chapter XI procedure was justified and advisable under the particular circumstances of the case. An appeal is pending from this
decision. In another case, Liberty Baking Corporation, the question
is pending before the District Court."

PART VI
ADMINISTRATION

OF THE TRUST INDENTURE ACT OF 1939

The Trust Indenture Act of 1939 requires that bonds, notes, debentures, and similar securities publicly offered for sale, except as specifically exempted by the Act, be issued under an indenture which meets
the requirements of the Act and has been duly qualified with the Commission. The Act requires that indentures to be qualified include
specified provisions which provide means by which the rights of
holders of securities issued under such indentures may be protected
and enforced. These provisions relate primarily to designated standards of eligibility and qualification of the corporate trustee, to provide
reasonable financial responsibility and to minimize conflicting interests.
The Act outlaws exculpatory provisions formerly used to eliminate all
liability of the indenture trustee, and imposes on the trustee, after
default, the duty to use the same degree of care and skill as a prudent
man would use in the conduct of his own affairs.
The provisions of the Trust Indenture Act are closely integrated
with the requirements of the Securities Act. Registration pursuant
to the Securities Act of securities to be issued under a trust indenture
subject to the Trust Indenture Act is not permitted to become effective
unless the indenture conforms to the requirements of the latter Act,
and necessary information as to the trustee and the indenture must be
contained in the registration statement. In the case of securities
issued in exchange for other securities of the same issuer and securities
issued under a plan approved by a court or other proper authority
which, although exempted from the registration requirements of the
Securities Act, are not exempted from the requirements of the Trust
Indenture Act, the obligor must file an application for the qualification
of the indenture, including a statement of the required information
concerning the eligibility and qualification of the trustee.

ADMINISTRATION

OF THE INVESTMENT
1940

COMPANY ACT OF

The Investment Company Act of 1940 provides for the registration
and regulation of companies engaged primarily in the business of
investing, reinvesting, holding and trading in securities. The Act
requires, among other things, disclosure of the finances and investment
policies of these companies, prohibits such companies from changing
the nature of their business or their investment policies without the
approval of their stockholders, regulates the means of custody of the
companies' assets, prohibits underwriters, investment bankers, and
brokers from constituting more than a minority of the directors of
such companies, requires management contracts to be submitted to
security holders for their approval, prohibits transactions between
such companies and their officers, directors and affiliates except with
the approval of the Commission, and regulates the issuance of senior
securities. The Act requires face-amount certificate companies to
maintain reserves adequate to meet maturity payments upon their
certificates.
COMPANIES REGISTERED UNDER THE ACT

As of June 30, 1955,387 investment companies were registered underthe Act, and it is estimated that on that date the aggregate value of
their assets was approximately $12 billion. This represents an increase
of approximately $3.3 billion over the corresponding total at the
beginning of the 1955 fiscal year.
Since the Commission's rules no longer require investment companies to report sales data to the Commission, statistics regarding public
sales of shares issued by investment companies comparable to those
which have appeared in the previous annual reports are not available.
However, substantially similar information is reported to the National
Association of Investment Companies by its members and published
by that association. It appears therefore that during the entire 1955
fiscal year about 116 open-end management investment companies
sold to the public $1,089,769,000 of their shares, redeemed $455,980,000
of such securities, and thus realized net sales of $633,789,000. For the
last 6 months of the fiscal year additional information published by
the association shows that 29 closed-end management investment
companies had corresponding sales of $29,136,000, acquisitions of
$25,704,000, and net sales of $3,432,000.

During the 1955 fiscal year 37 new investment companies were
registered under the Act, of which 22 were open-end management
companies (which redeem their shares on presentation by the shareholder) and 13 were of the closed-end management type (in which the
shareholder does not have a redemption privilege). Two companies of
the unit type were also registered. During the year registration was
terminated with respect to 21 management companies of which 15.
were open-end and 6 were closed-end, and with respect to 11 unit and
2 face-amount companies.
The new management investment companies registered under the
Act during the year subscribed to a wide variety of investment objectives. Several among them were organized for the purpose of emphasizing investments in securities of industrial corporations engaged
in some phase of the development of atomic energy or electronics and
five which were incorporated in Canada secured authority under section 7 (d) of the Act to make public offerings of their shares in the
United States. Rule N-7D-l, which was adopted to provide especially for the registration of Canadian investment companies, is
discussed in the 20th Annual Report, at pages 94-96. Each of the
two unit investment companies registered during the year were organized to operate periodic payment plans for the purchase of the common stock of a single specified industrial corporation.

filed under various provisions of the Act meet the statutory standards.
Under section 6 (c) of the Act, the Commission is empowered, either
upon its own motion or by order upon application, to exempt any
person, security or transaction from any provision of the Act if and to
the extent such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public
interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the Act. Various
other sections, such as 6 (d), 9 (b), 10 (f), 11 (a), 17 (b) and 23 (c)
contain specific provisions and standards pursuant to which the Commission may grant exemptions from particular sections of the Act or
may approve certain types of transactions.
During the fiscal year 1955 a total of 177 applications of various
types were pending before the Commission, of which 133 were disposed
of, leaving 44 pending on June 30, 1955. Thirty-one of the 141 applications filed during the fiscal year were for general exemptions, 36 for
orders terminating registrations, 23 for orders under section 17 of the
Act permitting transactions between investment companies and
affiliates, and 51 for other relief. The various sections of the Act
under which these applications were filed, and their disposition during
the fiscal year, are shown in the following table:

an informal basis, by discussion and correspondence rather than by
formal hearing procedure. In the past fiscal year only four applications were set down for a formal hearing, namely, Northeast Capital
Oorporation.» Newmont j\lining Corporation,2 Government Employees
]JI[utual Fund, Inc.,a and Atomic-Electronics Fund, Inc.4 The first
two of these cases involved requests for orders pursuant to section
.3 (b) (2) of the Act declaring applicants not be investment companies.
Newmont was granted the requested order,' but the questions raised
by Northeast's application remained undecided at the close of the
fiscal year. The latter two of these cases each involved the question
whether, in view of the substantial identity in name of two corporations registered under the Act, the Commission should find, under the
provisions of section 35 (d), that the name of one of such corporations
was "deceptive or misleading." In each case, before the hearing was
completed, the matter was settled by the deregistration of one or both
'companies voluntarily.
Of the matters considered by the Commission pursuant to formal
applications filed under a particular section of the Act, those requiring
a determination of the fairness of transactions between affiliates are
generally the most difficult and complex. Examples of these include
a loan to an affiliated company by an investment company," the
optional receipt of portfolio securities of an investment company by an
affiliated person in exchange for his stock of the company,' the sale of
securities by an affiliated person to an investment company," the
.acquisition of cash and other assets of one controlled company for a
-portion of its stock held by another controlled company," and a
merger."
Some transactions involving investment companies, while important
and complicated, do not require a filing under the statute by the investment company or any affiliated person. Nevertheless, these
matters are examined carefully by reason of the Commission's respon.sibilities under sections 25 and 36 of the Act to bring court proceedings
if it believes that proposed reorganizations are grossly unfair or that
management has committed a gross abuse of trust. An example is
the case of Home and Foreign Securities Oorporation and Oils &:
Industries, Inc., two registered investment companies. This matter

ing brought by the Commission in December 1952 under section 36
alleging gross abuse of trust by certain officers and directors of theinvestment companies. The plan of reorganization was regarded by
the Commission as a satisfactory basis for settlement.
It involved
three steps: (1) acquisition by Chesapeake Industries, Inc., of the
publicly held preferred and common stocks of Home and Foreign,
Oils & Industries, and certain subsidiaries in exchange for common and
preferred stocks of Chesapeake, through invitation for tenders; (2) themerger of Home and Foreign, Oils & Industries, and an oil company
subsidiary into a wholly owned subsidiary of Chesapeake, subject to.
appraisal rights of dissenters; and (3) the dissolution of a subsidiary
of Home & Foreign and distribution of its cash assets. Certain
protective provisions for the preferred stockholders in the event of
default in payment of six quarterly dividends were included in theplan.
Changes in the ownership of stock of a corporation acting as under-writer or investment adviser often present questions under sections
15 and 36 of the Act. Under sections 2 and 15 the assignment of an,
investment advisory or underwriting contract necessarily results in itsautomatic cancellation; and the transfer of a controlling block of stock
of a corporation having such a contract is deemed to constitute such,
an assignment. In a 1942 opinion 11 the Commission's General
Counsel stated that in general the purported transfer of an investment
advisory contract for a consideration would constitute a gross abuse
of trust and be the subject of Commission action under section 36 of
the Act. A serious question is raised where there is a proposal to sell'
a controlling block of stock in a corporation rendering underwritingor investment advisory services to an investment company and the
sale is to be made at a figure above book value or at book value with.
other collateral promises on the part of the purchaser, and where.
consummation of the transfer is conditional upon the effectiveness.
of a new underwriting or investment advisory contract with the same'
investment company. Such questions arose with increasing frequency
during the fiscal year.
Another important segment of activity under the Investment Company Act relates to questions and proceedings arising under sections3 and 6 which pertain to the status of a company under the Act, i. e.,
whether it is required to register under the Act, or, whether- it is en~
titled to an exemption from any or all the provisions of the Act.
Much of this work is accomplished by correspondence and by conference. An example of a case where a complete exemption was
granted is United Steel Works Oorporation 12 where the Commission
considered that a fund created by the deposit of certain mortgage'

bonds of German companies, formerly part of the United Steel Works
Corporation, Germany, and the issuance of Participation Certificates
(representing an interest in such bonds) to American holders of the
-old bonds of United Steel were entitled to a complete exemption under
the Act. The application pointed out that few if any of the substantive provisions of the Act could sensibly be applied to the situation.
Status of The Alleghany Corporation Under the Act

The Alleghany Corporation registered under the Investment Company Act on November 1, 1940. The Commission, on the basis of
.an ?rder of the Interstate Commerce Commission dated June 5, 1945,
ordered Alleghany's registration terminated on October 4, 1945 (20
S. E. C. 731). The ICC order had approved Alleghany's then existing
'Control of the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway Company and subjected
.Alleghany to certain regulatory provisions of the Interstate Commerce
Act involving, primarily, reporting requirements and supervision of
security issues. A company subject to regulation under the Interstate
Commerce Act is excepted from the definition of an "investment
'Company" by section 3 (c) (9) of the Investment Company Act. At
that time, about 86 percent of Alleghany's assets were invested in
:railroad securities including 38 percent in the Chesapeake & Ohio.
On January 19, 1954, Alleghany disposed of its control of the
Chesapeake & Ohio. Thereafter the ICC instituted a proceeding to
determine whether its 1945 order should be terminated. This proceeding was joined with a subsequent proceeding by Alleghany seeking
a new order declaring Alleghany to be a "carrier" subject to the
above-mentioned provisions of the Interstate Commerce Act. The
latter proceeding was predicated upon the asserted control by Alleghany of the New York Central Railroad Company. Alleghany,
under a separate application, also sought approval by the ICC of the
issuance of new preferred stock under a voluntary exchange offer to
its existing preferred stockholders.
This Commission intervened in the proceedings before the ICC to
determine the status of Alleghany and suggested (1) that Alleghany's
investment picture had almost reversed itself so that on September
14, 1954, only 16 percent of its assets were invested in railroad securities and the balance almost entirely in investment securities; (2)
that it would be in the public interest under both the Interstate
Commerce Act and the Investment Company Act for Alleghany to
be regulated under the Investment Company Act in view of the investment activities of Alleghany and that such regulation would be
consistent with the purposes of the Interstate Commerce Act; and
(3) that the ICC should exercise the discretionary powers granted it
under section 5 (3) of the Interstate Commerce Act to permit such
regulation under the Investment Company Act by this Commission.

102

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

On March 2, 1955, Division 4 of the ICC entered an order declaring
Alleghany to be a carrier subject to the Interstate Commerce Act
and stated among other things that it had "no discretionary power
to yield [its] jurisdiction to any other statutory agency". In view of
the importance of the issue raised, this Commission filed a petition
for reconsideration by the entire ICC of the Division 4 order. The
entire ICC affirmed the action of Division 4 on May 24, 1955, stating
"that unless Congress amends either or both of the statutes involved
herein, the results the SEC desires to achieve are not within our
powers under the Interstate Commerce Act." This Commission
sought no review of this determination. By separate order the ICC
approved Alleghany's voluntary exchange offer.
.
On July 26, 1955, a three-judge court of the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New York, upon complaint of
certain stockholders of Alleghany, entered a preliminary injunction,
which, so far as here relevant, enjoined, pending final judgment, any
action pursuant to the foregoing ICC orders. The Court also noted
that the ICC's denial of any discretionary powers under the Interstate
Commerce Act "was without foundation" but stated that it was
premature for it to determine whether the ICC action in this connection was "reviewable as an abuse of discretion."
In its opinion of November 18, 1955, issued after a full hearing on
the merits, the three-judge court determined that the ICC was without jurisdiction over Alleghany at the time it issued the new preferred
stock, or that if such jurisdiction existed, the necessary findings in
support thereof were not made. The court also held in the absence
of proper jurisdiction over Alleghany by the ICC, Alleghany was an
investment company subject to regulation under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 and the issuance of the new preferred stock was
unlawful because of section 7 of that statute. A final decree was
issued by the Court in December 23, 19.55,13
As amicus curiae, the Commission filed a memorandum and
participated in the oral argument before Justice Harlan of the United
States Supreme Court on Alleghany's application for a stay pending
appeal from the preliminary injunction.

ACT

The Investment Advisers Act of 1940 requires the registration as
investment advisers of persons engaged for compensation in the business of advising others with respect to securities. The Commission
is empowered to deny registration to or revoke the registration of any
investment adviser who, after notice and opportunity for hearing, is
found by the Commission to have been convicted or enjoined because
of misconduct in connection with securities transactions or to have
made false statements in his application for registration. The Act
makes it unlawful for investment advisers to engage in practices
which constitute fraud or deceit, requires investment advisers to disclose the nature of their interest in transactions executed for their
clients, prohibits profit-sharing arrangements, and prevents assignment of investment advisory contracts without the client's consent.

OF FORMS AND RULES

Effective July 1, 1954, the Commission substantially revised forms
and rules pertaining to the registration of investment advisers.' This
action was taken in connection with a comprehensive review of rules,
regulations, forms and procedures to eliminate duplication and to
simplify the requirements, wherever practicable, without prejudice to
the public interest or the protection of investors.
In adopting the new forms for registration as an investment adviser
and in revising applicable rules the Commission acted on the view
that, wherever possible, an application for registration should be

limited generally to information necessary to determine whether a
registrant, or an applicant for registration, or any controlling person
is subject to a statutory disqualification.
Form ADV adopted during the year, applicable to investment
advisers, is an all purpose form to be used as the form of application
for registration; as the form to amend such an application and as the
form of supplemental report to he Hed by a registered person. The
new six-page Form ADV contains only 16 items or questions wherew
Form 1-R previously used as an application for registration consisted
of twenty pages and required information under 38 items. Adoption
of Form ADV made it possible to rescind the single purpose Forms
1-R, 2-R and 3-R formerly used by investment advisers. The
Commission also rescinded the rule providing that registered investment advisers file semi-annual reports and amended applicable rules.
The current rules require that information contained in the application
for registration of investment advisers be kept current by amendments
to the original application. By providing that the new form may be
used as a ~upplementto the old forms, persons registered before
adoption of the new form are now required to furnish only current
information with respect to the information in the abbreviated and
simplified new form.
/

REGISTRATION OF FOREIGN INVESTMENT ADVISERS

~ h problem
k
of registration of investment advisers with principal
offices outside the United States raises important questions with
respect to the enforcement of civil liabilities arising out of violations of
the Act and with reference to the enforcement of sanctions which the
Commission may invoke against such violations. Rights arising
because of violations may be unenforceable against non-resident
investment advisers and non-resident' individual partners in such firms
where i t is impossible to obtain service upon such persons. I n order
to afford to the Commission and others the same opportunity to enforce
rights or duties against such persons as they have in the case of resident
investment advisers and resident partners in such firms, the Commission promulgated rule R-2 under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940.2 This rude which became effective on August 2, 1054, requires
each non-resident iuvestment adviser, general partner, and managing
agent to file with the Commission n written irrerocable consent and
power of att'orney, designating the Commission as an agent upon

Investment Advisers Aot of laM release No. 74 (June 30, 1964).

TWENTY-FIRST ANNUAL

105

REPORT

LITIGATION UNDER THE INVESTMENT ADVISERS ACT OF 1940

The Commission filed a complaint in the United States Dist,rict
Court in San Francisco against J. Henry Helser & Co., an Oregon
corporation, and J. Henry Helser, its president, to enjoin them from
violations of the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act
of 1940. J. Henry Helser 8: Co., doing business as a registered investment adviser had some 6,000 clients whose accounts with carrying
brokers contained approximately $62 million in cash and securities.
The complaint described the Helser Plan of Investment Management as one whereby Helser clients were induced to give the Helser
Company unlimited power of attorney authorizing it to purchase, sell
and trade in securities on a cash and margin basis for the accounts of
such customers. The defendant corporation charged a fee of $1 per
share for each purchase and sale of stoclr.
The commission alleged, among other things, that in soliciting and
maintaining clients' accounts defendants falsely represented safety of
principal, 100 percent capital appreciation in from 7 to 10
and
net earnings from 9 percent to 15 percent pe.r annum. The Commission also alleged that the defendants induced their clients to deposit
all available cash, securities and other resources under defendant's'
management, to mortgage homes and other real estate and to borrod on
or surrender life insurance and annuity policies in order to make such
deposits; that clients were not informed that "Credit Arrangements"
were in fact margin agreements, and that defendants customarily
made immediate use of such margin agreements t,o margin clients'
accounts almost fully; and that clients were not informed that it was
necessary for the Hclser corporation to t,rade more than 1 million
shares of stock in clients' accounts each year to meet defendants'
annual h e d operating expenses, which equaled or exceeded $1 million.
After a 3 week trial, the court issued an int,erlocutory order which
stated in part:
After consideration of the entire matter, it is the Court's uien- and opinion t h a t
the evidence and facts support the allegations of the Complaint, and are sufficient
t o warrant the issuance of a n injunction for violation of the Investment Advisers
Act of 1940. However, t,he Court hdieves t h a t the issuance of a n injunction at
this time n w l d he a harsh remedy under the circumstances of this case, and t h a t
the defendants should be given a n opportunity t o bring themselves into compliance
with the statute. The dofondants hnvc submitted a written document undertaking t o refrain from certain practices, and to make ohanges in their practices a n d
procedures t o bring themselves into compliance with the statute. The Court
approves the Undertaking and orders that it he filed in this action.

The undertaking which becamc a part of the court's order provided
that the company will make no representations that it has a special
individual investment program for each client; that it will accuintcly
describe operations of the company and thc trading done with clients'

.

accounts; that it will not encourage the borrowing of money on insurance policies or homes; that it will amend its reports to clients
so that they will accurately describe the performance, the status
and the liquidating value of each client's account and be easily
understood; that it will eliminate fees based upon the number of shares
of stock purchased or sold and will substitute a fee system based on
the percentage of clients' net equity; that it will describe the possible
hazards of accounts which are opened as margin accounts; and that it
will not represent that safety of principal is assured or that accounts
will appreciate or produce income in any particular amounts.

PART IX
RELATED ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION
LEGISLATIVE

MATTERS

The Commission devoted a substantial amount of time to matters
pertaining to proposed legislation and Congressional inquiries. Ten
legislative proposals were analyzed and reports submitted on them
to the appropriate Congressional committees, at their request. Apart
from specific legislative proposals, the Commission compiled much
background material for the Senate Committee on Banking and
Currency in connection with its "Stock Market Study", and testified
in its hearings. Senate Report No. 376, 84th Congress (May 26,
1955). Additional information and testimony was furnished to that
Committee ill connection with its hearings on corporate proxies.
Information was made available to the Anti-Monopoly Subcommittee
of the Senate Committee on the Judiciary in connection with its
investigation concerning Middle South Utilities, Inc. and Mississippi
Power and Light Company. The Commission provided skilled
personnel to assist the Committees in some of these matters.
An extensive study relating to amendments of various statutes
administered by the Commission culminated in the approval on
August 10, 1954 of Public Law 577, 83d Congress, amending the
Securities Act of 1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the Trust
Indenture Act of 1939 and the Investment Company Act of 1940.
Towards the end of the fiscal year work was commenced, and testimony given on a bill to extend those provisions of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 which now apply to securities listed and registered on national securities exchanges, to unlisted companies in
which there is a substantial public interest.
In addition, numerous Congressional inquiries were received and
answered relating to matters other than specific legislative proposals.
COURT PROCEEDINGS
Civil Proceedings

At the beginning of the 1955 fiscal year there were pending in the
courts 16 injunctive and related enforcement proceedings instituted
by the Commission to prevent fraudulent and other illegal practices
in the sale or purchase of securities. During the year 31 additional
proceedings were instituted and 33 cases were disposed of, leaving 14
of such proceedings pending at the end of the year. In addition the
Commission participated in a number of reorganization cases under
107

108

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, in 9 proceedings in the district
courts under section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding Company
Act; and in 11 miscellaneous actions, usually as amicus curiae, to
advise the court of its views regarding the construction of provisions
of statutes administered by the Commission which were involved in
private lawsuits. The Commission also participated in 29 civil
appeals. Of these, 6 came before the courts on petition for review
of an administrative order, 9 arose out of corporate reorganizations
in which the Commission had taken an active part, 3 were appeals in
actions brought by or against the Commission, 8 were appeals from
orders entered pursuant to section 11 (e) of the Public Utility Holding
Company Act, and 3 were appeals in cases in which the Commission
appeared as amicus curiae.
Complete lists of all cases in which the Commission appeared before
a Federal or State court, either as a party or as amicus curiae, during
the fiscal year, and the status of such cases at the close of the year,
are contained in the appendix tables.
Certain significant aspects of the Commission's litigation during
the year are discussed in the sections of this report relating to the
statutes under which the litigation arose.
Criminal Proceedings

Indictments were returned against 2,259 defendants in 533 cases
developed by the Commission prior to June 30, 1955.1 These figures
include 14 defendants in 8 cases in which indictments were returned
during the past fiscal year. At the close of the year, convictions of a
total of 1,223 defendants had been obtained in 433,2or 86 percent, of
the 501 cases disposed of as to one or more defendants. Convictions
of 27 defendants in 15 cases were obtained during the fiscal year." In
addition, two defendants in two cases were convicted of criminal
contempt for violation of injunctive decrees previously entered
against them." An appeal is pending in one of these cases.
In the six appellate cases decided during the fiscal year 5 judgments
of conviction were affirmed in five cases as to all six defendants who
appealed." The remaining case, in which the conviction of a single
defendant was reversed for trial errors, was remanded for a new trial.
At the close of the fiscal year one case involving two defendants was.
pending on appeal.

TWENTY-FIRST

ANNUAL

REPORT

109

As in past years, the criminal cases developed and prosecuted during
the year, covered a wide variety of fraudulent practices. They
included fraudulent activities on the part of securities broker-dealers
and their representatives, frauds in the sale of securities relating to
oil and gas and mining ventures, and fraudulent securities promotions
with respect to alleged inventions and a variety of business enterprises. In addition to fraud charges, the defendants in a number of
cases also were charged with violating the registration provisions of
the Securities Act.
The first criminal prosecution and convictions for the "churning"
of customers' securities brokerage accounts were obtained during the
past year in U. S. v. J. Arthur Warner, et al. (D. Mass.),? "Churning"
is the term commonly used in the securities field to describe the
fraudulent practice of inducing customers to engage in excessive
securities trading for the purpose of obtaining commissions, fees, and
profits. In this case it was charged, among other things, that the
defendants, for the purpose of facilitating and increasing the excessive
trading, arranged collateral bank loans for the accounts of their
customers and concealed from them the risks inherent in these loans,
purchased for the accounts of customers securities on which dividends
were about to be declared, and falsely represented that the dividends
were additional income and part of the increased yield to customers
who traded through the defendants, and charged substantial overriding commissions and markups, in addition to the usual stock
exchange commissions, on listed securities purchased for the accounts
of customers, without sufficiently disclosing to customers the nature
or amount of these overriding commissions and markups,"
In U. S. v. Albert J. Rich (S. D. Fla.), the defendant plead guilty
and was sentenced to a 3-year prison term for having defrauded his
customers by inducing them to sell securities held by them and to
purchase other securities from him at prices greatly in excess of their
current market prices and for operating as a securities broker-dealer
without having registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Other fraudulent practices on the part of broker-dealers are charged
in U. S. v. James J. MacKnight, et al. (D. Mass.), and in U. S. v.
Stanley C. Shaver, Sr. (S. D. Fla.), in which indictments are pending.
In the AlacKnight case the defendants are charged with employing
a scheme to defraud investors in the operation of a so-called "Collective Trading Fund", an investment trust solely created and controlled
7 Varying sentences ranging from 2 year; probation
and a $5,000 fine to 1 year's probation and a $1,000 fine
were imposed on the defendants who were eonvieted in this case upon pleas of guilty entered after commencement ot the trial.
, A final injunctive decree enjoining similar practices was entered against the Warner firm and certain of
it~ representatives during the year. For additional details concerning the injunctive case, see 18th Annual
Report. page is.

by the defendants." In the Shaver case the defendant is charged,
among other things, with having converted customers funds and
securities.
Oil and gas promotions were involved in convictions obtained during
the fiscal year in U. S. v. Homer J. Cox (D. N. M.); U. S. v. D. W.,
Crawford et al (D. S. D.) and U. S. v. Thomas H. Carney (D. Utah).
In the Cox case the' defendant was found guilty and sentenced to 5
years imprisonment for fraud and registration violations in selling
interests in carbon dioxide gas wells by false representations concerning the number of wells on the property in question, the purported
returns to be received on the investment and similar matters. In
the Crawford case, defendants were convicted for fraudulent conduct
in procuring fractional mineral deeds from landowners in North and
South Dakota. A probationary sentence of 2 years and a $750 fine
was imposed on each of the defendants. In the third case, Carney
received a 2-year prison sentence upon his plea of guilty to an indictment charging fraudulent representations in the sale of oil and gas
interests and misappropriation of funds solicited to operate the properties involved.
An indictment has been returned in the Eastern District of Wisconsin against William F. Horsting, Sr., and his son, charging fraud
in the sale of fractional undivided oil, gas, and mineral rights by means
of false representations concerning the alleged investments made by
the defendants in the properties, their success as oilmen, and similar
matters. After the close of the fiscal year, an indictment was returned
against Ben E. Young at Spokane, Wash.,. charging fraud violations
in the solicitation of funds to be paid to the United States as rental
and filing fees for its Oregon oil leases, which funds it is charged the
defendant appropriated to his own use, while informing investors that
the applications had been filed.
Fraud violations resulted in a conviction in U. S. v. Oliver O.
Kendall (W. D. Tex.) and registration violations in convictions in
U. S. v. Charles A. Howe et al. (S. D. Ohio), both cases involving
mining promotions. Kendall plead guilty to an indictment charging
him with making false representations concerning a Mexican lead
mine, purported investment returns and the like, and was sentenced
to a 3-year term.'? In the Howe case, registration violation charges
were sustained in the sale by the defendants of investment contracts
covering alleged gold properties and a purported process for extracting gold from fine deposits. Howe received a prison term of a year
and a day and the corporate defendants were fined $1,000 each." In
• Upon facts simIlar to those charged in the indictmcnt, a permanent injunction was previously entered
against the defendants m this case, see 20th Annual Report 46-47
10 Kendall also was sentenced to a concurrent 3-year term upon a plea of guIlty to a previous perjury
indictment returned as a result of his testuuony in an mvestigation in 1943.
11 The defendants were acquitted on the fraud charges included ill this case.

another mining venture, an indictment was returned in the Southern
District of N ew York against Standard Tungsten Corporation, its
president and its secretary, charging fraud in the sale of the company's
stock by means of alleged false representations including offering
circulars and press releases relating to the purported value and prior
development of the mining claims involved, the identity of investors,
funds available for operations and other matters.
Cases involving corporate and other miscellaneous business promotional enterprises include U. S. v. Pierre P. Pattyn (E. D. Mich.),
U. S. v. Giles H. Florence et al. (E. D. Wash.), U. S. v. James Robert
Palmer et al. (D. Colo.), U. S. v. George L. White (N. D. Ill.), all of

insurance policies by a company alleged to be non-existent. Two
Chicago architects, Henry K. and William T. Holsman have been
indicted in the Northern District of Illinois for allegedly making
fraudulent representations in the sale of trust certificates relating to
$ large scale cooperative apartment
house project. Mter the fiscal
year, an indictment was returned at Spokane, Wash., charging
Richard W. Bo,vler with fraud violations involving alleged misrepresentations in the sale of his personally owned stock in a warehouse
company, whose precarious financial condition was allegedly concealed
by him.
Violations of Injunctive decrees previously obtained by the Commission led to the convictions for criminal contempt in the William
E. Horton (S. D. Cal.) and Homer O. Mills (D. Nev.) cases. Horton
was found guilty of criminal contempt of court for selling unregistered
securities of the Horton Aircraft Corporation in violation of court
orders previously entered against him restraining him from violating
the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933. He was
fined $1,000 and placed on probation for a 5-year period. Similarly
Mills, who was also placed on probation for 3 years, was convicted
of criminal contempt for selling unregistered securities to residents of
southern California in violation of the terms of preliminary and final
injunctive decrees previously entered against him in the District of
Nevada. He has appealed his conviction.
In the criminal appellate cases decided during the year, judgments of
conviction were affirmed in U. S. v. Vasen, 222 F. 2d 3 (C. A. 7, 1955),
cert. denied, 350 U. S. 834 (1955); Henderson v. U. S., 218 F. 2d 14
(C. A. 6, 1955), cert. denied 349 U. S. 920; Estep v. U. S., 223 F. 2d 19

v. U. S., 227 F. 2d 667 (C. A. 9,1955)18;and reversed in Frank v. U. S.,
220 F. 2d 559 (C. A. 10, 1955). The latter case, which involved an
oil and gas lease promotion", was remanded for a new trial because of
certain trial errors. The Vasen conviction, which also arose out of
an oil promotion, involved the sale of fractional undivided interests
in a well that reached a depth of 20,450 feet, said to be the second
deepest well in existence." In the Henderson case, in which a prior
conviction on the same charge of mail fraud violation previously had
been reversed upon appeal and a new trial granted," the conviction
also resulted from the sale of fractional interests in oil and gas rights.
The defendant in the Estep case, who has variously held himself out
as an atomic scientist, an inventor, a doctor of medicine, and a spiritualistic healer, was convicted of fraud and registration violations
in connection with the sale of stock of Atomotor Manufacturing

Company, Inc., which was fraudulently represented as being about
to market a fuelless self-energizing motor or, in effect, a claimed
perpetual motion machine." The convictions of the defendants in
the Owens case, resulted from a scheme which included, among other
things, an alleged romance with an investor, the setting up of dummy
corporations and the obtaining of money by means of a variety of
representations and promises calculated to deceive investors into
believing that the defendant "Owens was a powerful and clever
magnate".
The Thomas case involved the sale, by means of misrepresentations and concealment of material facts, of stock of Thomascolor Incorporated, a company organized for the purpose of exploiting
an allegedly new color photography process and a company for which
a registration statement covering the sale of its stock had previously
been the subject of stop order proceedings under section 8 (d) of the
Securities Act.23
Extradition Proceedings

In an effort to meet the important and recurrent enforcement problem arising out of the fraudulent sale of securities by mail and telephone to United States residents by promoters operating out of
Canada, a Supplementary Extradition Convention between Canada
and the United States was ratified on July 11, 1952, which was
designed to broaden the existing extradition arrangements so as to
permit the extradition of persons engaging in such activities."
In
the fall of 1954 in the first case, U. S. v. Link and Green,253 D. L. R.
386 (1955), brought under the new extradition arrangements, extradition was denied. After an extensive five weeks hearing, the Extradition Judge announced that he was satisfied that a prima facie case
of fraud had been made out against the defendants involved, but
nevertheless denied the extradition request because he did not approve
of the extent of the evidence which might be admissible in the prosecution of these defendants in the United States. Because of the adverse
effect this judgment would have upon future extradition cases,
application was made to the Supreme Court of Canada for leave to
appeal the decision. However, the application was denied by the Court
for lack of jurisdiction, U. S. v. Link and Green [1955] S. C. R. 183.
It is possible that an advisory opinion in this important area may
still be obtained from the Supreme Court of Canada. The Canadian
Government, should it deem it appropriate, may refer the questions
involved to the Court under special jurisdictional provisions contained
in the Canadian Supreme Court Act .

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

COMPLAINTS AND INVESTIGATIONS

Specific authority for the Commission to conduct its own investigations to determine whether violations of law have occurred is contained
in each of the Acts administered by the Commission. These investigations are conducted primarily by the regional offices under the
general administrative supervision of the principal office.
Most Commission investigations originate from direct complaints
by members of the investing public and, with respect to registered
broker-dealers, from the Commission's broker-dealer inspection
program. The number of such complaints and inquiries amounts
to many thousands every year. Each complaint and broker-dealer
inspection report is examined and considered to determine whether
possible violations of the Acts are involved. If it then appears that
a violation may have been committed, a preliminary investigation
is made.
Preliminary investigations may take the form of an examination
of the Commission's files, correspondence with persons who have
information on the subject and telephone inquiries or, when believed
advisable, may extend to personal interviews with a limited number
of persons. In many instances this preliminary investigation will
be sufficient to disclose that no violation has been committed or that
an inadvertent violation has taken place because the offender has
either misunderstood or been unaware of the law. Under the latter
circumstance, the violator is appropriately advised of the requirements of the law and the preliminary investigation serves to bring
about compliance with the law before serious damage or loss befalls
the investing public,
If a matter cannot be 'disposed of satisfactorily after a preliminary
investigation, a case is docketed and a full and detailed investigation
is made. In connection with such investigation, the Commission
may utilize its power, through officers it may appoint for such purpose
from its staff, to issue subpoenas requiring the appearance of witnesses
to testify under oath and the production of documents. This power
is used only when the necessary evidence cannot otherwise be obtained
and the exercise thereof is limited to the persons specifically designated
by order of the Commission and to the subject matter of a particular
investigation.
During the fiscal year 35 such orders were issued.
When an investigation has been completed, a report is submitted
by the investigators to the Regional Administrator who, after review,
makes a recommendation that the Commission institute appropriate
action or close the investigation.
In each instance, these reports
are analyzed by the staff in the Commission's principal office and
presented to the Commission for disposition.
Action of the Commission may take the form of a reference of
evidence to the Attorney General in cases that appear to call for crimi-

nal prosecution, a civil proceeding for injunctive relief, or administrative proceedings against broker-dealers and investment advisers.
In addition, the Commission also refers evidence of violations of other
Federal statutes and State laws to appropriate federal or state
authorities.

Commission during the fiscal year:

Restitution

One of the most important results of the investigative activities
of the Commission is the restitution to investors and others of amounts
obtained from them by practices which violate the securities laws.
Although it is impossible to compute the total so restored through the
rescission of purchases and sales and otherwise it is estimated that the
aggregate amounts to several million dollars annually.
In one case investigated during the year it appeared that an
insurance company had sold 57 percent of its stock to promoters and
other insiders for $265,000 and the remaining 43 percent to the public
for $3,913,000. The insiders then resold part of their stock, realizing
a profit of $496,000. Investigation showed that the public sales had
been effected on the basis of incomplete disclosure regarding, among
other things, the issuance of the promoters' stock. Acting on advice
of their counsel, the insiders turned over their profits to the company
and transferred large amounts of their personally owned stock to other
stockholders. The cash and the estimated value of the stock so
restored amounted to over $1 million.
In another case it was found that the president of a company
had purchased stock direct from stockholders at $28 a share when the
stock was being quoted at a much higher figure by dealers in the overthe-eounter market. During the course of the investigation the president sold the stock in the over-the-counter market for $108 a share
and remitted the excess over $28 received to the stockholders who had
sold him the stock.
The amounts actually returned to investors in cases of this nature,
large as they are, are only a small part of the amounts that are saved
by the prevention of fraudulent transactions before they can be
consummated.

COMMISSION

SECTION OF SECURITIES VIOLATIONS

The Commission maintains a Section of Securities Violations for
assistance in the enforcement of the various statutes which it administers and to provide a further means of preventing fraud in the purchase and sale of securities. This Section has developed files which
provide a clearing house of information concerning persons who have
been charged with violations of various Federal and State securities
statutes.
The specialized information in these files has been kept current through the cooperation of the United States Post Office Department, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, parole and probation
officials, state securities commissions, Federal and State prosecuting
attorneys, police officers, Better Business Bureaus, and the United
States Chamber of Commerce. By the end of the 1955 fiscal year
these records contained data concerning 58,187 persons against whom
Federal or State action had been taken in connection with securities
violations.
During the past year items of information relating to
3,867 persons were added to the records of this Section, including information concerning 1,585 persons not previously identified therein.
Extensive use is made of this clearing house of information.
During
the past year in connection with the maintenance and preventive use
of these records, the Commission received 2,995 "securities violations"
letters or reports and dispatched 1,601 communications to cooperating agencies.
ACTIVITIES OF THE COMMISSION IN ACCOUNTING AND AUDITING

Recognizing the importance to investors of dependable financial
statements which disclose the financial status and earnings history
and potentialities of a corporation or other commercial entity, the
various Acts administered by the Commission deal extensively with
financial statement presentation and the accounting concepts and
principles upon which they are based. These Acts grant the Commission broad authority to prescribe, among other matters, the form and
content of financial statements required to be filed by registrants
subject to the Securities Act of 1933 and the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934, to prescribe uniform systems of accounts for companies subject to the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935, and to provide for a reasonable degree of uniformity in accounting principles and
policies to be followed by registered investment companies in maintaining their accounting records and in preparing financial statements
required by the Investment Company Act of 1940.
The principal accounting requirements prescribed by the Commission under these Acts are contained in Regulation S-X, which
governs the form and content of most financial statements required to
be filed with the Commission. Implementing this regulation are 77

since 1937 for the purpose of contributing to the development of uniform standards and practice in major accounting questions. In addition, uniform systems of accounts have been prescribed for certain
public utility holding companies and for public utility mutual and
subsidiary service companies, and, under the Securities Exchange Act,
rules have been adopted governing record keeping, financial reporting,
and the auditing of the books and records of exchange members,
brokers and dealers.
These requirements, except for the uniform systems of accounts,
pertain to the accounting to be followed only in certain basic respects,
and in those areas not covered reliance for the protection of investors
is placed upon the determination and application of accounting principles and standards which are recognized as sound and which have
attained general acceptance.
The various Acts also give recognition to the desirability of obtaining independent review of financial statements made available to
investors or prospective investors through filing with the Commission,
and the Commission requires that such statements be certified by
independent public accountants.
The Commission's standards of
independence are stated in rules 2-01 (b) and (c) of Regulation S-X
which provide among other things that an accountant will not be
considered independent with respect to any person, or any affiliate
thereof, in whom he has any financial interest, direct or indirect, or
with whom he is connected as a promoter, underwriter, voting trustee,
director, officer, or employee. In determining whether an accountant
is in fact independent with respect to a particular registrant, the
Commission will give appropriate consideration to all relevant circumstances, including evidence bearing on all relationships between
the accountant and that registrant or any affiliate thereof.
In order that the Commission may be kept informed as to whether
financial statements filed with the Commission are based upon sound
and generally accepted accounting principles the Commission's accounting staff engages in continuing study and research. These activities, primary responsibility for which rests with the Chief Accountant of the Commission, require close contact and cooperation
between the staff and accountants both individually and through such
representative groups as, among others, the American Accounting
Association, the American Institute of Accountants, the Controllers
Institute of America, the American Petroleum Institute, the National
Association of Railroad and Utilities Commissioners, and the National
Federation of Financial Analysts Societies, as well as with other governmental agencies. During the year matters which required consideration and discussion with one or more of these groups included
the appropriate accounting for corporate mergers and acquisitions;

the effect accounting-wise of the repeal of section 452 of the Internal
Revenue Act of 1954 which permits the deferment, until earned, of
income collected in advance, and section 462 which provides for deductions for certain reserve provisions (e. g., cash and quantity discounts, vacation pay, product guarantees) in lieu of actual expenditures therefor; and the requirement of filing of semi-annual income
and surplus statements."
OPINIONS OF THE COMMISSION

Findings and opinions are issued by the Commission in all cases
where the matter to be decided, whether substantive or procedural,
is of sufficient importance to warrant a formal expression of views.
The Office of Opinion Writing, a staff office which is directly responsible to the Commission, aids the Commission in the preparation of
findings and opinions in contested and other cases arising under
statutes administered by it. In accordance with the principle embodied in the Administrative Procedure Act requiring a separation
between quasi-prosecutory functions and quasi-judicial functions, the
personnel of the Office of Opinion Writing is entirely independent of
the divisions engaged in the investigation and prosecution of cases.
In some cases, the interested operating division, with the consent of
all parties, participates in "the drafting of opinions. During the fiscal
year the Commission issued findings, opinions and orders in 77 matters.
With minor exceptions, all findings, opinions and orders are publicly
released and constitute a source of information for the bar and other
interested persons.
CONFIDENTIAL TREATMENT OF APPLICATIONS, REPORTS, AND
DOCUMENTS FILED WITH THE COMMISSION

The Commission is empowered under various of the Acts administered by it to grant upon application confidential treatment with
respect to certain types of information which would otherwise be
disclosed to the public in applications, reports, or other documents
filed pursuant to these statutes.
In the exercise of such authority,
under the Securities Act, it has adopted rule 485 providing that information as to material contracts, or portions thereof, filed as a part of
a registration statement will be given confidential treatment where it
determines that disclosure would impair the value of the contracts
and is not necessary for the protection of investors. Circumstances
under which other rules provide for holding non-public information
contained in filings with the Commission include cases where the
information may require classification in the interests of national
defense, and in such cases the Commission may protect such informal! Bee

The total of 45 applications filed during the year compares with 93
in the 1954 fiscal year and 121 in the 1953 fiscal year. The revision
of Form N-30A-1 which became effective May 6, 1954, eliminated
the requirement for open-end investment companies to file a list of
its dealers under rule N-45A-1 as an exhibit to its annual report.
This revision accounts almost entirely for the sharp drop in the total
number of applications filed during the 1955 fiscal year.
STATISTICS

AND SPECIAL STUDIES

The Commission prepares and publishes regularly a number of
statistical series relating to the capital markets, saving and investment, which are briefly described below. There are also prepared
from time to time special studies for the Commission's own use in
formulating its rules and regulations, data for use by the Congress,
and special surveys for improving the regular statistical series of the
Commission. The Commission's activities in these respects are
coordinated with the overall government statistical program.
During the fiscal year 1955, several studies concerned with stock
market activity and practices were prepared for internal use, and
data in this connection were also furnished the Senate Committee on
Banking and Currency for its study of the stock market. Some of
the data prepared for this Committee regarding institutional purchases
of stock in recent years were published in Chapter V of the Committee's staff report entitled "Factors Affecting the Stock Market."
One new survey relating to corporate pension funds was undertaken
during the latter part of fiscal year 1955, and is expected to be conducted annually. This report, which covers the assets and income
items of all corporate pension funds, is based on sample data obtained
from companies registered with the Commission.

120

SECURITms

AND - EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

..All of the statistical series described below are published regularly
in the Commission's Statistical Bulletin. In addition, press releases
presenting current figures and analyses of the data are published
quarterly (and may be obtained upon request) for the following series:
securities offerings, working capital of U. S. corporations, individuals'
saving, plant and equipment expenditures and financial report for
manufacturing companies. The stock price index is released weekly,
together with data on round-lot and odd-lot trading.
The various statistical series are as follows:
Issues Registered Under the Securities Act of 1933.-Monthly
and quarterly statistics are compiled on the number and volume of
registered securities, classified by industry of issuer, type of security,
and use of proceeds. Data for the 1955 fiscal year appear at page 8
and in appendix tables 1 and 2.
New Securities Offerings.-This is a monthly and quarterly series
covering all new corporate and non-corporate issues offered for cash
sale in the United States. The series includes not only issues publicly
offered but also issues privately placed, as well as other issues exempt
from registration under the Securities .Act such as intrastate offerings
and railroad securities. The offerings series includes only securities
actually offered for cash sale, and only issues offered for account of
issuers. .Annual statistics on new offerings since 1950, as well as
monthly figures from January 1954 through June 1955, are given in
appendix tables 3 and 4. A summary of the data is shown annually
from 1934 through June 1955 in appendix table 5.
Corporate Securities Outstanding.-Estimates
of the net cash
flow through securities transactions are prepared quarterly and are
derived by deducting from the amount of estimated gross proceeds
received by corporations through the sale of securities the amount of
estimated gross payments by corporations to investors for securities
retired. Data on gross issues, retirements and net change in securities outstanding are presented for all corporations and for the principal
industry groups.
Stock Market Data.-8tatistics
are regularly compiled on the
market value and volume of sales on registered and exempted securities exchanges, round-lot stock transactions on the New York exchanges for accounts of members and non-members, odd-lot stock
transactions on the New York exchanges, special offerings and secondary distributions. Indexes of stock market prices are compiled,
based upon the weekly closing market prices of 265 common stocks
listed on the New York Stock Exchange. The indexes are composed
of 7 major industry groups, 29 subordinate groups, and a composite
group.
Saving Study.-The
Commission compiles quarterly estimates of
the volume and composition of individuals' saving in the United

TWENTY-FIRST

ANNUAL

121

REPORT

States. The series represents net increases in individuals' financial
assets less net increases in mortgage and consumer debt. The
study shows the aggregate value of saving and the form in which
the saving occurred, such as investment in securities, expansion
of bank deposits, increase in insurance and pension reserves, etc.
A reconciliation of the Commission's estimates with the personal
saving estimates of the Department of Commerce (derived in connection with its national income series) is published annually in the
National Income Supplement of the Survey of Current Business.
Financial Position of Corporations.-The
series on working capital position of all United States corporations, excluding banks and
insurance companies, shows the principal components of current
assets and liabilities, and also contains an abbreviated analysis of the
sources and uses of corporate funds.
The Commission, jointly with the Federal Trade Commission,
compiles a quarterly financial report for all United States manufacturing concerns. This report, an outgrowth of the working capital
series, gives complete balance sheet data and an abbreviated income
account, data being classified by industry and size of company.
Plant and Equipment Expenditures.-The
Commission, together
with the Department of Commerce, conducts quarterly and annual
surveys of actual and anticipated plant and equipment expenditures
of all United States businesses, exclusive of agriculture. Shortly
after the close of each quarter, data are released on actual capital
expenditures of that quarter and anticipated expenditures for the
next two quarters. In addition, a survey is made at the beginning of
each year of the plans for business expansion during that year.
PERSONNEL

the following:

Although the Commission's appropriation for fiscal 1955 permitted an
average employment of 699 persons, it was necessary to reduce the
staff to 666 by the year's end in order to stay within the appropriation.
This was accomplished principally by not filling vacancies and by
lending employees to other agencies on a reimbursable basis.

122

SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION

In comparison to the Commission's peak employment of 1,723 in
fiscal 1941, employment in fiscal 1955 represented a reduction of 61%.
Even when compared to fiscal 1951 employment of 1,040, it represents
a reduction of over 32%. In contrast to these severe reductions in
personnel, the statutory duties of the Commission remained unchanged, and during the fiscal year 1955 practically all of the Commission's responsibilities were increased in view of the great activity
in the securities markets.
The Commission's appropriations and employment for fiscal years
1951 through 1955 are shown in the following table.

"Includes

$93,180 for salary increases authorized

under Public Law 114-84th Congress.

The amount of public financing undertaken in fiscal 1955 exceeded
that of any year in the Commission's history, and as indicated elsewhere in this report, there is every indication that economic activity
will continue at a high level. Although funds appropriated by the
Congress for fiscal 1956 will permit an average employment of 717,
a further increase in staff is essential if the Commission is to continue
to protect the public in the manner and to the extent directed by
statute.
Fees.-The
following fees were collected in fiscal 1955:
Registration of securities issued
Qualification of trust indentures
From registered exchanges
Sale of copies of documents or portions thereofMiscellaneous collections
