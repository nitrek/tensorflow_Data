The Honorable Thomas P. O'Neill, Jr.

Gentlemen'
I am pleased to transmit the Annual Report of the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission for the fiscal year ended
September 30, 1979. As I have in connection with the Cornrmssion's
last
two Annual Reports, I would like to summarize in this letter some of the
significant challenges which the Commission has faced, and
achievements which it has realized, during the past year. I want also to
describe several of the areas to which the Commission will be devoting
its efforts in the coming year.
After 45 years of successful administration of the Federal securities
laws-a period during which the Cornrnission earned recoqrutron as a
hiqhly effective Federal regulatory agency-It is taking a close look at
whether its rules, procedures, and internal operations remain adequate
and appropriate to the capital markets of the 1980s. This examination
comes at a time when the Commission is already facing the challenge of
stretching limited resource levels to meet its steadily Increasing
responsibilities.
Since 1975, during a period In which the Commission actually 1051 a
significant number of staff positions, the Commission has experienced
an explosion in the number and complexity of ItS regulatory
responsibilities-in
large part, for two specific reasons. First. SIgnificant
changes have occurred in the financial markets and cornrnuruty-iincluding greatly expanded market activity. increasing complexity of
financial transactions, the development of a new mix of financial
products being offered to the public, and the increasinqly hiqh financial
leverage of the broker-dealer industry. As illustrations, during the period
from 1975, the number of shares annually traded in the NASDAQ
system increased over 150 percent, the number of contracts for
exchange-traded options increased over 250 percent, the number of
registered investment advisers increased by approximately one-half,
there were approximately $100 billion worth of successful tender offers,
and in the last year alone the assets of money market funds increased

securities industry, meanwhile, stengthened the two principal
experiments In technology which may become, or help determine, a
foundation of a national market system-the Intermarket Trading System
and the Cincinnati multiple-dealer trading facility. Both of these projects
also received authority from the Commission to continue operating until
January 31, 1983. Two additional private sector Initiatives in this area
were the commitment by the participating exchanges in the Intermarket
Trading System to a joint limit order protection plan, and the agreement
by the New York and American Stock Exchanges to make generally
available their common message switch.
Trading in exchange-listed options also received a great deal of
attention from the Commission during the fiscal year. In December
1978, the Special Study of the Options Markets submitted to the
Commission the l,OOO-pagereport of its comprehensive 14-month
study. The Commission released the staff's report publicly in February
1979, and announced the conditions under which it would permit an
expansion in options trading. During the balance of the fiscal year and
into fiscal 1980, the staff worked closely with the securities industry's
self-regulators toward implementing many of the recommendations of
the Study. Although the task was complex and difficult, the cooperation
between the Commission's staff and the industry's representatives has
been excellent. I anticipate that in the coming fiscal year the
Commission will authorize an expansion of trading in this segment of
the securities market.
The Full Disclosure System
The Commission's statutory mandate to require corporations to
disclose all material information to the investing public is at the heart of
the capital forrnation process. In accordance with the 1977
recommendations of its Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure,
the Commission is pursuing an on-going program designed to enhance
the effectiveness of its disclosure requirements, while reducing attendant
burdens to the extent practicable. During the fiscal year, the
Cornrnissron took a number of important steps towards this goal
As part of this program, the Commission has begun a thorough review
of filings under the separate disclosure systems prescribed by its two
most fundamental disclosure statutes-the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934-to reduce reporting burdens and
paperwork by more precisely tailoring the reportmg requirements to the
characteristics of particular registrants and to the needs of their
investors. This program also has been substantially advanced by the
Commission's efforts, which culminated in proposals, published
subsequent to the close of the fiscal year, to amend Form 10-K to serve
as the cornerstone of a new "integrated" disclosure system and to
centralize the instructions for financial statements in various reporting
forms. In addition, during the last fiscal year, the Commission continued
its efforts to encourage issuers to provide investors with forward-looking
and other forms of "soft" information, such as performance projections.
iii

Other actions by the Commission during fiscal 1979 designed to make
the full disclosure system more effective include the adoption of
significant rules governing public tender offers and "going private"
transactions. In addition, important progress was made in the
Commission's comprehensive examination of shareholder participation
in the process of corporate accountability. That study, which began in
1977, has resulted in slqnifrcant amendments to the Commission's proxy
rules in both fiscal 1978 and 1979. The study's final report is expected
during 1980.
One of the Commission's major initiatives during fiscal 1979 has been
its efforts to facilitate capital formation by small businesses WIthout
materially diminishing the protections afforded public investors. The
Office of Small Business Policy, established in June 1979, serves as
liaison with the small business community and generates proposals to
eliminate unnecessary impediments to the ability of small businesses to
raise capital in the securities markets. As a result ofthat Office's
recommendations, the Commission has liberalized the rule regarding
resale of restricted securities, adopted a new "short form" registration
statement for certain smaller issues of securities, and created a new
exemption from registration for other types of relatively small issues of
securities. In coordination with the Department of Commerce, the
Commission also developed a monitoring program to asessthe impact of
our regulations on small businesses, and in conjunction with the Small
Business Administration, is studying the role which regional brokerdealers play in the capital formation process.
In order to make the Commission's review of corporate disclosure
documents more meaningful, the staff unit with primary responsibility in
this area, the Division of Corporation Finance, has been reorganized
with its operational branches restructured according to industry groups.
The Division's new operational plan recognizes that the staff cannot
adequately review every document filed, and relies, instead, on an "audit
mode" and quality control techniques to enable the staff to give prompt
and thorough scrutiny to key filings while devoting less resources to
reviewing more routine documents.

Investment Compances and AdVIsers
Staff task forces are conducting a comprehensive review of the
Commission's regulation of investment companies and investment
advisers. With regard to investment companies, the Commission has
adopted a number of rules to lessen the costs and burdens associated
with their regulation-which
historically has been based, to a large
extent, on the Commission's prior-clearance of transactions-by
enhancing the role of directors in managing investment companies. The
goal of diminishing the Comrrussion's presence in routine investment
company business decisions also is reflected in the Cornrnisston's
withdrawal, in March, of its "Statement of Policy" on investment
company advertising and in its adoption, in August, of Rule 434d to
permit investment companies much more flexibility in mass media
iv

advertising. The effect of these actions place responsibility for fair
presentation of investment company advertising material on boards of
directors rather than on arbitrary rules and staff clearances. The
Commission also has requested public comment on a proposal to relax
the prohibition against an investment company's using its assets to
merchandise the sale of its shares. These efforts by the Commission to
de-emphasize governmental prior-clearance of investment companies'
business practices, while resulting in substantial private sector benefits,
will place even greater emphasis on its increasingly stretched inspection
capabilities to determine that such practices comply with the Federal
securities laws.
As to investment advisers, the Commission has identified anomalies
in the pattern of investor protection which It is striving to resolve with
the least possible burden to that industry. For example, in response to a
long-standing concern as to the adequacy of information provided to
clients of investment advisers, the Commission adopted a new rule to
require that certain investment advisers disclose to clients and
prospective clients their background and business practices.

Ensuring Informed Regulation
The Commission recognizes that no regulatory agency can
successfully fulfill its legislative mandate unless it understands the
industry it regulates and the economic consequences of its actions.
Accordingly, the Commission is placing increasing emphasis on
gathering and analyzing empirically-based information.
As part of its efforts to better assess the consequence of its
regulations, the Commission has strengthened its capability for
economic analysis. The revised format of the Commission's annual
report on the securities industry and the recent report on the impact of
the Commission's implementation of the Conqressronally-rnandated
separation of money-management and floor brokerage illustrate this
capability. Such analyses of economic conditions in the industry
contribute importantly to the Commission's decision-makmg processes.
To further improve its oversight of the operations of the securitres
markets dunng the fiscal year, the Commission Implemented a pilot
project phase of its Market Oversight and Surveillance System, which
will provide the Commission a much enhanced capability to surveil the
marketplace. In view of the increased volume and complexity of the
securities markets, the Commission's existing approaches are no longer
adequate. This system will supplement, not supplant, the market
surveillance performed by self-regulatory organizations, in accordance
with the Commission's strong commitment to the traditional framework
of the securities industry's self-regulation.

Inspection and Enforcement
An essential medium for assuring compliance with the securities
laws-and for assessing the impact of the Commission's regulation-is
v

Its inspection program, a responsibility which is receiving an enhanced
emphasis although remaining understaffed. The Commission's
Inspection program of regulated entities-including
self-regulatory
organizations, broker-dealers, investment companies and investment
advisers-provides a vital discipline and the opportunity to examine the
practical effects of regulation on such entities and on the investing
public.
Moreover, in appropriate circumstances, the Commission in
implementing its regulatory responsibilities, will initiate enforcement
actions. The Annual Report relates some of the more significant
enforcement actions concluded during the year. The Commission
continues its longstanding commitment to such a vigorous enforcement
program, which is necessary to the credibility of the Commission's
programs to protect public investors and the integrity of the securities
markets. This commitment has become even more compelling in recent
years as court decisions have severely hampered the private rights of
action by which Investors themselves might otherwise have proceeded
against perpetrators of illegal practices.

Accountmq Mallers
In response to its 1977 undertaking to a Senate Subcommittee to
report periodically on the accounting profession's response in meeting
its challenges, as well as the Commission's own initiatives in this area,
the Commission, in July 1979, submitted its second Report on the
Accounting Profession and the Commission's Oversight Role. The
Report concluded that sufficient progress has been made to merit
continued opportunity for the profession to pursue efforts at selfregulation.
In accordance with such efforts, the Commission continued its close
liaison in support of the work of the Financial Accounting Standards
Board to address emerging accounting problems, such as the effects of
inflation on financial reporting. It strongly endorses the Board's program
to develop an overall conceptual framework in which to consider such
problems.
As part of its on-going responsibilities to oversee the accounting
profession, in June 1979, the Commission issued a release concerning
certain factors which may affect the independence of accountants in
performing nonaudit services for publicly-held audit clients, and certain
factors which should be considered in determining to engage a
corporation's independent accountants to perform nonaudit services. It
also proposed during the year a rule requiring that management
statements on internal accounting controls be included in corporations'
annual reports on Form 10-K. Further, during the fiscal year, the
Commission adopted amendments to certain forms and regulations to
improve disclosure requirements relating to oil and gas reserves and
operations, and proposed actions to encourage review by auditors of
interim financia I information.

This summary provides only a very brief synopsis of the significant
activities in which the Commission is engaged throughout ItS operations.
Among the many others are: the important role we play in assisting
Federal courts with regard to shareholder interests in reorganizations of
publicly-held companies; the installation of micrographic and computer
systems which have brought to the Commission's information-handling
procedures the benefits of current technology, and unprecedented
efforts to employ effective evaluation, management and development
capabilities to further enhance the quality of our most valuable
resource-our staff. All of these efforts, and others, are covered in the
pages of this Annual Report-whose format, incidentally. has been
revised durinq the past two years Into a slimmer, more readable and
more timely document.
I believe that this is one of the most Important periods in the
Commission's nearly half-century of existence. The American corporate
community, the securities Industry, and the markets. themselves, are
changing rapidly to meet the challenges of the 1980s. The Commission,
working closely with the Congress which oversees our operations, WIth
those in the private sector whom we regulate, and in the interests of
Investors, is also changing to meet these challenges. I have every
confidence that the Commission will strive to perform ItS responsibilities
with the professionalism and dedication which Congress and the
Investing public have come to expect.

Harold M. Williams

Regulation of the Securities Markets

Securities Markets,
and Trading

Facilities

National Market System-The
past
fiscal year saw marked acceleration in
progress toward the development of a
national market system.
On October 20, 1978, the Commission published for comment two proposals designed to refine the operation
of the consolidated transaction reportIng and quotation systems. The first of
these proposals, Rule 11Acl-2 under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934
(Exchange Act), would, if adopted, impose comprehensive
mirurnurn reo
quirements regulating the manner in
which securities information vendors
display transaction and quotation information.' The second proposal, the
amendment of existing Rule 17a.15,
would, if adopted, (a) redesignate Rule
17a-15as Rule 11Aa3-1 under the Act;
(b) eliminate, subject to certain conditions, the existing prohibition on retransmission of last sale data for purposes of creating a moving ticker
display; and (c) set forth procedures for
amending transactions reporting plans
filed pursuant to the rules? The
Commission received many valuable
comments from self-regulatory organizations and vendors of market information and at year end both proposals
were awaiting further action.
On March 22, 1979, the Commission
issued a Status Report which, among
other things, set forth the Commission's views as to the next steps to be
taken toward development of a national market system.! These steps included: achievement of nationwide

price protection for all public limit or.
ders; refinement of pilot market linkage facilities: improvement of the
timeliness and reliability of quotation
information; development of broker to
market center order-routing facilities;
consideration of a rulemaking proceeding to preclude the application of
remaining off-board trading restrictions to securities not previously subject to those restrictions; and initiation
of a rulemaking proceeding to con.
sider procedures by which securities
would be designated as qualified for
trading in a national market system.
In the Status Report, the Commission indicated that its first priority
would be the achievement of nation.
wide protection for public limit orders
against executions at inferior prices.
The Commission expressed its belief
that nationwide
price protection,
whereby any appropriately displayed
public limit order for a qualified security would be assured of receiving an
execution prior to any execution by a
broker or dealer at an inferior price,
should be a basic characteristic of a
national market system. Furthermore,
the Commission stated that, in addition to price protection for public limit
orders, it may ultimately be desirable
to afford price protection to all displayed orders at the market, whether
public or professional, so that any dis.
played quotation would be entitled to
price protection up to the quotation
size indicated. As an initial step in this
direction, the Commission indicated
that the proponents of the Intermarket
Trading System (ITS) should be af-

forded the opportunity to experiment
with and further enhance that system
as a means of providing intermarket
price protection for public limit orders.
The Commission indicated that two
types of initiatives would be necessary
to achieve nationwide price protection
for displayed public limit orders by
means of the ITS. The first would require the self-regulatory organizations
and the securities industry to resolve
collectively the various practical and
technical problems associated with (a)
disseminating and displaying public
limit order information from each market center and (b) promptly enhancing
the ITS so that it may serve as a means
by which price protection for public
limit orders can be afforded on an intermarket basis. To this end, the Commission requested that the affected
self-regulatory organizations commit
themselves to develop in concert and
to submit to the Commission a plan by
which the mechanisms to provide price
protection for all public limit orders
would be developed and implemented,
at least on a pilot basis, not later than
the end of calendar year 1980. The second initiative would involve the proposal by the Commission of a rule requiring price protection for displayed
public limit orders.
On April 26, 1979, the Commission
proposed for comment Rule lIAc1-3
under the Exchange Act which, if
adopted, would prohibit any broker or
dealer from executing any order to buy
or sell a qualified security at a price inferior to the price of any public limit
order displayed at the time of execution unless the broker or dealer assures
that those limit orders are satisfled.s
The following month, the Commission
received a commitment from each reporting self-regulatory organization to
develop a joint plan for protection of
public limit orders. In September
1979, the ITS participants submitted a
preliminary plan for the protection of

2

public limit orders and a commitment
to submit a definitive plan before the
end of calendar year 1979. At the end
of the fiscal year, the Commission was
analyzing the preliminary plan and
comments received in response to proposed Rule lIAc1-3.
In furtherance of development of
comprehensive market linkage systems, the Commission, on September
21, 1979, issued an order extending
approval for operation of the ITS until
January 31, 1983.\ At the end of the
fiscal year, all reporting self-regulatory
organizations other than the Cincinnati
Stock Exchange (CSE) and the National Association of Securities Dealers (NASD) were participating in the
ITS. The Commission expects the CSE
and NASD will commence participation in the ITS in the near future.
During the fiscal year, the number of
securities traded in the ITS increased
from approximately 100 to 600. That
number is expected to continue to expand at the rate of approximately 40
securities per month. With expansion
in the number of securities traded in
the system, there has been a substantial increase in ITS volume. Furthermore, average response times with respect to ITS commitments to trade
received by participating market centers have been reduced, and as a result
of continuing technical enhancements
to the system, the Commission expects
that response times will be further reduced during fiscal year 1980.
On December 15, 1978, the Commission approved a rule change of the
CSE extending the operation of the
Cincinnati multiple-dealer trading facility (CSE System) for one year, and
on September 21, 1979, the Commission further extended its approval until
January 31, 1983.6 While CSE System
volume has thus far been limited, several additional broker-dealers commenced participation in the CSE System during the past fiscal year. The

three-year extension and increased
broker-dealer participation should facilitate the Commission's ability to
evaluate the effects of trading in this
type of system.
In the Status Report, the Commission indicated its belief that, both for
purposes of enhancing brokers' ability
to seek out the best execution of their
customers' orders and for purposes of
assuring fair competition among markets, some type of neutral order-routing system is a necessary element of a
national market system. To assure
progress toward this objective, the
Commission requested the New York
Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (Amex) to make
available their jointly-owned common
message switch to other market centers; other self-regulatory organizations were asked to inform the Commission of their interest in obtaining
such a linkage.
Since the Status Report, the NYSE
has engaged in continuing discussions
with several self-regulatory organizations with respect to use of the NYSEAmex message switch. In addition, the
NASD has proposed enhancements to
its NASDAQ inter-dealer quotation
system which would, among other
things, create an order-routing switch
in NASDAQ that could be linked to the
NYSE-Amex message switch and to
the ITS. The Commission will continue
to monitor and to encourage progress
in these areas.
On April 26, 1979, the Commission
announced commencement of a proceeding to consider proposed Rule
19c-3 under the Exchange Act, which,
if adopted, would limit extension of offboard trading restrictions to additional
securities. The rule would preclude application of such restrictions to certain
securities that were not traded on an
exchange on April 26, 1979, or that
were traded on an exchange on April
26, 1979, but failed to remain so there-

after." In its release proposing Rule
19c-3, the Commission mdicated its
concern that, as companies continue
to list their securities on exchanges
that have rules precluding their members from making over-the-counter
markets in securities listed on those
exchanges, competition between the
over-the-counter market and the exchanges will be effectively foreclosed
in an increasing number of securities.
In addition, the Commission indicated
that the rule could provide it and the
securities industry with an opportunity
to gain valuable experience as to the
dynamics of competition between exchange-oriented trading and dealeroriented trading. The Commission
stated that the rule would also allow
evaluation of whether existing and
developing national market system facilities are sufficient to ensure an appropriate integration of trading in disparate locations.
During June and July 1979, the
Commission held hearings with respect to proposed Rule 19c-3 and received extensive comments and testimony both supporting and opposing
adoption of the rule. At the end of the
fiscal year, the Commission was considering further regulatory action with
respect to the rule.
Finally, on June 15,1979, the Commission proposed for comment Rule
l1Aa2-1 under the Exchange Act
which, if adopted, would provide pro.
cedures whereby securities would be
designated for trading in a national
market system." The proposed rule
sets forth two quantitatively different
sets of standards to be employed in
determining whether any equity security should be designated a national
market system security. The proposed
rule would require that any equity security meeting certain minimum standards contained in the rule (tier 1
securities) be automatically designated
a national market system security. If an

3

equity security did not meet the standards applicable to tier 1 securities,
but substantially met certain broader
standards (tier 2 securities), it would
remain eligible for designation as a national market security pursuant to the
procedures set forth in a designation
plan required to be filed with the Commission by the various self-regulatory
organizations.
The standards applicable to tier 1
and tier 2 securities would cover both
securities traded on an exchange and
securities traded exclusively in the
over-the-counter market. However,
while the proposal provides that the
rule will become operational upon
adoption with respect to all tier 1 securities and those tier 2 securities
which are traded on an exchange, the
rule will not become applicable to tier
2 over-the-counter securities until the
Commission engages in further rulemaking.

National System for Clearance and
Settlement of Securities TransactionsDuring the fiscal year, substantial
progress was made in the Commission's effort to foster development of
a national system for clearance and
settlement of securities transactions.
On September 19, 1978, the United
States Court of Appeals for the District
of Columbia Circuit affirmed the
Commission's January 13, 1977 order
granting the appllcatron of National
Securities
Clearing
Corporation
(NSCC) for registration as a clearing
agency.? The Commission views the
registration of NSCC as a key step in
achieving the national clearance and
settlement system envisioned by the
Congress in Section 17A of the Exchange Act. Although the court did not
disturb NSCC's registration, it did remand two issues to the Commission
for further consideration: (a) NSCC's
selection of Securities Industry Automation Corporation as the facilities
manager of its consolidated system

4

without competitive bidding; and (b)
NSCC's use of geographic price mutualization (GPM). GPM is the practice
of charging all participants the same
fees regardless of whether the participants deal with the clearing agency at
its main facility or through a branch
office.
The Commission subsequently requested that NSCC submit reports on
the two issues remanded by the court
and that interested persons comment
on NSCC's reports and on the GPM
and competitive bidding issues generally. 10 By the end of the fiscal year, the
Commission to date had received 11
letters in response to its request for
comments, including letters from all
but three of the registered clearing
agencies. In preparation for responding to the court's remand, the Commission was reviewing those comment
letters and the testimony and statements given at the Commission's
March and April 1979 hearings into the
development of a national clearance
and settlement system.
On March 14, 1979, the Commission
removed its restriction on NSCC's
processing of transactions in securities
listed on exchanges through its branch
offlces.» The removal of that restriction permitted NSCC's participants to
process through NSCC's branch offices
for the first time both transactions in
securities listed on exchanges and
transactions in securities traded in the
over-the-counter market. The Cornmission indicated, however, that until it
had responded to the remand of the
GPM issue, NSCC could not use GPM
for services relating to the processing
of transactions in securities listed on
exchanges.
The Commission continued its review of the transaction completion
rules of the securities exchanges and
of the NASD pursuant to Section 31(b)
of the Securities Acts Amendments of
1975 (the 1975 Amendments). Some

of those rules unnecessarily restricted
competition among clearing agencies.
Others failed to comply with the Exchange Act for other reasons. As a result of this review, over 120 exchange
and NASD rules now have been
amended or deleted. This step removed many impediments to the development of a national clearance and
settlement system. The Commission is
continuing to discuss the amendment
or deletion of other transaction completion rules with the exchanges and
the NASD.
Progress toward a national system
also was evident in other areas.
The continued expansion of interfaces
among depositories has further immobilized securities certificates and
allowed depository participants to use
book entry transfers to make deliveries
throughout the country. This reduces
the need to physically move stock certificates to settle securities trensactrons among depository participants.
In addition, The Depository Trust Com.
pany included certain types of rnunicrpal securities in its book entry system,
thus bringing municipal securities into
a book entry environment for the first
time. These developments have reo
duced costs and accelerated the settlement process.
Options Trading-As previously reported,» since July 1977, there has existed, at the Commission's request, a
voluntary moratorium on expansion of
the standardized options markets,
pending (a) the completion of the Com.
mission's Special Study of the Options
Market (Options Study); (b) the evaluation of its findings; and (c) the resolution of the Commission's concerns
regarding the adequacy of the regulatory framework within which standardized options trading occurs.n
The Report of the Options Study was
released by the Commission in February 1979.'4 In general, the Study found
that, to those who understand them,

options may offer an alternative to
short-term stock trading having lower
commission costs and a smaller commitment of capital. They also may provide a means of shifting the risks of
unfavorable short-term stock price
movements from owners of stock who
do not wish to bear those risks to those
who are willing to assume such risks in
anticipation of possible rewards from
favorable price movements. IS The Options Study stated, however, that the
purchase and sale of standardized options involves a high degree of financial risk and that only investors who
understand those risks and who are
able to sustain the costs and financial
losses associated with options trading
should participate in the standardized
options markets.
The Study found that, too often,
public investors have been encouraged
to use standardized options Without regard to the suitability of options for
their investment needs.» It also found
regulatory inadequacies in the options
markets and, accordingly,
recommended certam steps that the broker.
age community, the self-regulatory or.
ganizations and the Commission
should take to Improve the self-regulatory framework within which listed
options trading occurs and to increase
protection of investors.
On February 22, 1979, the Commission issued a release that set forth Its
plan for implementing the Options
Study recommendations and for terminating the options rnoratorturn.»
The Commission stated that, before it
would permit any further expansion of
the options markets, certain recommendations of the Study must be implemented
by the se lf-r equlatory
organizations and the brokerage community. Implementation of these recommendations generally would require the adoption of self-regulatory
organization rules, and modifications
and improvements in the self-regula.

5

tory organizations' surveillance and
compliance systems and procedures,
as well as improved regulatory controls by brokerage firms. At the end of
the fiscal year, the Commission had received rule proposals from the five exchanges trading options to implement
some of the Options Study recommendatlons.«
On April 24, 1979, the Commission
approved the combination of the Midwest Stock Exchange (MSE) options
market with that of the Chicago Board
Options Exchange (CBOE), to be effective upon termination of the options
moratorium. Upon consummation of
the combination, the MSE will no
longer provide a market for listed options, and the CBOE will provide a
market for those options then listed on
the MSE. Upon listing the MSE options
classes, the CBOE will assume full responsibility for floor operations, surveillance and enforcement regarding
trading in those options classes.»
As reported previously.w on October
18, 1978, the Commission approved a
four-month experiment by the options
exchanges to extend trading hours until 4: 10 p.m. New York time and to suspend dally closing rotations." On April
27, 1979, the Commission approved
uniform rule proposals by the options
exchanges to permit, on a permanent
basis, options transactions to be effected on the exchanges until 4: 10
p.m. New York time and to provide
that one trading rotation in any class
of options may be completed where
trading in the underlying security
opens or reopens after 3:45 p.m. New
York time, even though completion of
the rotation may occur after 4:10 p.m.
New York tlrne.s On July II, 1979, the
Commission approved a second exception to the 4: 10 p.m. closing time
which provides that, if a trading rotation is commenced near the close of
trading because of unusual market
conditions, such as a heavy influx of

6

orders, an options exchange can permit the rotation to be completed after
4:10 p.m. New York time if notice of
the rotation is publicly disseminated
no later than the commencement of
the rotation or 4:00 p.m. New York
time, whichever is earlier.» The Com.
mission has deferred further consideration of certain related rule proposals
until additional experience is gained
respecting the 4:10 p.m. closing hour
and the exceptions described above.
Market Inventory Funds-In October
1978, the Chairman submitted to Senator Harrison A. Williams, Jr. a staff
report on market inventory funds,
which are part of master trusts established by companies to fund and administer employee benefit plans. Market inventory funds have been used
solely in connection with plans of individual companies rather than in connection with pooled benefit plans of
separate companies. The staff found
no clear indication that these funds, as
they had been operated up to that
time, had had an adverse impact upon
the securities markets. The report concluded, however, that such funds could
develop a broad appeal in the future
and that it would be appropriate for the
Commission and its staff to continue
to evaluate the operation of market inventory funds and their impact on the
securities markets.
Trading by Exchange Members-Section 11(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, as
amended in 1975, prohibits, with specified exceptions, any member of ana.
tional securities exchange from effecting any transaction on that exchange
for its own account, the account of an
associated person, or an account with
respect to which it or any of its associated persons exercises investment
discretion. Under this section, the
Commission has authority to fashion
either more flexible or more restrictive
standards in light of changing circumstances. Section II(a) became effec-

tive as to all exchange members on
February 1, 1979.
In January 1979, the Commission
announced the adoption of (a) a temporary rule permitting exchange members to effect certain bona fide hedge
transactions for their own accounts or
the accounts of their associated persons; (b) interpretations concerning
the application of the section to transactions effected through the use of several automated tacilities operated by
national securities exchanges; and (c)
interpretations concerning certain exemptions for specified types of proprietary transactions effected by exchange rnernbers.» Also in January
1979, in connection with its continuing
review of its regulatory program under
Section 11(a), the Commission commenced two surveys designed to elicit
data concerning (a) the effect of the
section on exchange members that
provide money management and brokerage services to discretionary institutional accounts, and (b) market making activities by certain exchange
members.
In July 1979, the Commission also
approved a nine-month extension, until April 30, 1980, of programs designed by the NYSE and the Amex to
supplement the market making capacity of specialists by establishing
classes of registered market makers
whose transactions are exempted from
the prohibitions of the section.» Dur109 the nine-month period, the Comrrussion will continue its review of the
activities of those registered market
makers to determine whether their
transactions should continue to qualify
for an exemption.

Effects of the Absence of Fixed Commission Rates-In May 1975, the Commission prohibited the national securities exchanges from prescribing fixed
minimum commission
rates to be
charged by their members. Later that
year, the Congress enacted a similar

prohibition as part of the 1975 Amendments. Pursuant to that legislation, the
Commission submitted to the Congress five reports covering the first 20
months of commission price competition (through December 31, 1976), describing the effects of the unfixing of
commission rates on the maintenance
of fair and orderly markets and on the
development of a national market system for securities.
Analysis of commission rates is now
integrated into the Commission's ongoing monitoring of the financial condition of the industry. In that connection, the Commission's Directorate of
Economic and Policy Research released to the public on July 26, 1979,
a "Staff Report on the Securities Industry in 1978" (Staff Report), which detailed the results of its commission
rate survey in the context of a wideranging analysis of the basic economic
dynamics of the securities industry.
This Staff Report is the second in a
continuing series of annual reports designed to provide the Commission with
an economic basis for anticipating the
impact of regulatory changes upon the
securities industry, investors and the
broader economy. Beginning with the
1978 Staff Report, the Directorate
greatly expanded the scope of its study
of the securities industry to examine
fundamental industry trends and relationships in addition to the impact of
negotiable commission
rates. The
1978 Staff Report analyzed, for example, the profitability of New York Stock
Exchange member firms, the sources
of and trends in revenues of these
firms, firm expenses and balance sheet
data, the trend toward and causes of
increased concentration in the securities industry, the increasing diversification among the larger broker-dealers, the notable growth of discount
broker-dealers, the financial experience of exchange specialists, the economic performance of self-regulatory

7

organizations, and, of course, the economic effects of unfixed brokerage
commission rates.
In general, the reports to the Congress and the two Staff Reports concluded that competitively determined
commission rates do not appear to
have adversely affected the maintenance of fair and orderly markets.
Some of the more specific findings in
regard to commission rates are as follows.
From May 1, 1975 to the end of June
1979, individual investors' effective
commission rates, when measured as
a percent of principal value, declined
19.7 percent. Institutional customers,
because of their larger average order
size and greater bargaining power,
have negotiated discounts averaging
53.6 percent from the pre-May 1975
exchange-prescribed minimum rates.
When commission rates are measured
in cents per share, the declines were
eight percent for individuals and 53.8
percent for institutions. Individuals
paid an average of 27.6 cents per share
on their June 1979 orders, which averaged 400 shares in size. Institutional
orders averaged 2,034 shares in size
and commissions on these orders averaged 12.0 cents per share. Individual
orders of 1,000 shares or more showed
commission rate discounts comparable to similarly sized institutional orders
Broker-dealers were affected by the
elimination of fixed minimum commission rates largely depending upon
the extent to which they served institutional investors. Some firms which
did a large portion of their total business with Institutions have merged
with more diversified firms or have
gone out of business, and a new group
of discount broker-dealers have en.
tered the industry. On the whole, these
changes now offer investors a broader
spectrum of services with a correspondingly broader range of cornrnlssion rates.

Regulation of Tender and Exchange
Offers by Issuers-On
August 16,
1979, the Commission announced the
adoption of a new Rule 13e-4 and related Schedule 13E-4 under the Exchange Act, effective September 21,
1979, to regulate the increasing number of cash tender and exchange offers
by certain issuers for their own securities.26 Rule 13e-4 and Schedule 13E4 had been proposed for public comment on December 4, 1977.27
Rule 13e-4 requires that (a) issuers
with a class of equity securities registered under Section 12 of the Exchange Act; (b) issuers required to file
periodic reports pursuant to Section
15(d) of the Exchange Act; and (c)
closed-end investment companies registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 comply with certain disclosure requirements and other provisions governing the manner in which
cash tender and exchange offers may
be made. The requirements of the rule
are patterned substantially on the regulatory scheme established by Section
14(d) of the Exchange Act and existing
rules thereunder which are applicable
in the context of third party tender offers. The information required to be
disclosed in Schedule 13E-4 is substantially the same type of information
which is required by Schedule 14D-1.
The Commission adopted Rule 13e-4
and Schedule 13E-4 to insure that issuer tender offers are conducted in a
manner free of deception, manipulation or fraud

Resale of Restricted Securities-On
August 2, 1979, the Commission authorized the issuance of a release» setting forth the staffs views concerning
certain issues raised by the resale of
restricted and other securities In compliance with Rule 144 under the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act). The
release responded to interpretive questions raised by the amendments to that
rule adopted by the Commission in
September
1978,29 which, among

other matters, permit sales under the
rule to be made directly to a market
maker and liberalize restrictions on the
amount of securities which may be resold under the rule.

Regulation of Brokers, Dealers
and Municipal Securities Dealers
Regulatory Burdens on Small Brokers
and Dealers-The
Commission
is
aware of the need to evaluate the costs
and competitive impact of its regulations on brokers and dealers. Accordingly, in adopting regulatory requirements, the Commission weighs the
benefits to investor protection and
other statutory goals against possible
compliance and competitive burdens.
In addition, the Commission endeavors
to tailor regulatory requirements to
particular business practices so as to
avoid imposing unnecessary regulatory burdens. This effort can particularly benefit smaller, more specialized
brokerage firms.
Lost and Stolen Securities-During
fiscal 1979, several significant developments occurred in the Commission's
Lost and Stolen Securities Program.
On November I, 1978, the Commission announced the redesignation of
Securities Information Center, Inc.
(SIC) as the Commission's designee to
maintain and operate the data base of
missing, lost, counterfeit and stolen
securities for a two-year term commencing January 1, 1979.30 In addition, the Commission, on March 29,
1979, published for public comment
various proposed amendments to the
Commission rule governing the program."
In response to comments received,
the Commission, on May 23, 1979,
adopted amendments to the rule32
which, among other things: (a) established registration requirements for all
institutions
subject
to the rule
(reporting institution) with certain exceptions; (b) required that losses and

thefts of securities of the United States
Government and its agencies be reported to SIC, instead of the Federal
ReserveBanks, in an identical manner
as lost, stolen or counterfeit corporate
and municipal securities; (c) incorporated into the rule the temporary pilot
period exemptions from reporting and
inquiry; (d) established a new exemption from required inquiry for bearer
securities received by a reporting institution directly from a known customer to whom it had previously sold
the securities; and (e) required reporting institutions to report suspect counterfeit securities to a transfer agent for
the issue.
The rule also incorporated two staff
interpretations which exempt from required inquiry (a) securities received
by a reporting mstitution directly from
a "drop" that is affiliated with another
reporting institution for the purposes
of receiving and delivering certifrcates
on behalf of such institution; and (b)
securities received from a Federal Reserve Bank or Branch. At the end of
August 1979, approximately 395,000
reports of missing, lost, counterfeit or
stolen securities, with an aggregate
market value of nearly $2.1 billion,
had been received by SIC since the inception of the program on October 3,

1977.
Securities Confirmations-On

December 18, 1978, the Commission's
new rule prescribing delivery and disclosure requirements for securities
transaction confirmations sent by brokers and dealers to customers became
generally effective." The confirmation
is an important disclosure document
that provides an investor with information pertinent to each securities
transaction. For example, the disclosures required in the confirmation provide investors with a basis for comparing transaction
costs offered by
competing broker-dealers and for measuring those costs against the quality
of brokerage services provided.
9

315-805

0 - 80 - 3

In October 1978, before the effective
date of the rule, the Commission
adopted amendrnentss- requiring disclosures relating to odd-lot differentials, remuneration received in "riskless" principal transactions in equity
securities, and market making activities. Also, in October 1978, the Commission announced proposals to
amend the confirmation rule further
and to adopt a new rule extending to
transactions in debt securities the required disclosures of remuneration received in riskless principal transactlons.» At the end of fiscal year, the
Commission was evaluating the public
comments received in response to
those proposals to determine whether
the additional disclosure requirements
are appropriate.

Uniform Dispute Resolution Procedures for Investors-A
program to implement uniform, fair and efficient dispute resolution
procedures
for
investors was undertaken by the Commission in May 1976, in connection
with its establishment of an Office of
Consumer Affairs. The Securities Industry Conference on Arbitration
(SICA), a voluntary group of securities
industry and public representatives,
submitted proposals for a uniform dispute resolution system contemplating
utilization of existing arbitration facilities. Self-regulatory
organizations
adopted a series of rules based on
SICA proposals providing procedures
for small claims arbitration which were
approved by the Commission during
the fiscal year 1978. The Commission
reviews the operation of arbitration facilities as part of its general oversight
responsibilities with respect to self-regulatory organizations.
On December 28, 1978, SICA submitted further proposals for a uniform
arbitration code for investor-broker
disputes. The uniform code includes
provisions that are intended to improve the efficiency and fairness of
10

arbitration procedures provided by
self-regulatory organizations. For example, a record of the proceedings
would be kept upon request, the majority of arbitrators on each panel
would not be associated with the securities industry and peremptory challenge of arbitrators by either party
would be allowed. In addition, parties
would be directed to cooperate in the
voluntary exchange of documentary
evidences and would be permitted to
forward documents to the arbitrators
prior to the hearing in order to expedite the proceedings.

Arbitration Clauses in Broker-Dealer
Customer Agreements-Despite
its
support for arbitration, the Commission became concerned during the flscal year about the fact that many customer agreement
forms used by
broker-dealers contain clauses pur.
porting to require arbitration of all future disputes that might arise between
the securities professional and the customer. In general, broker-dealers did
not inform customers that a number of
court decisions have held such advance agreements to be unenforceable
with respect to causes of action arising
under the Federal securities laws.
Without such information, customers
might be led to believe that they had
prospectively waived any right to a judicial forum for the resolution of disputes related to securities transactions.
In July 1979, the Commission published a release» giving notice to broker-dealers that the use of pre-dispute
arbitration clauses in customer agreement forms, without specifying the
meaning, effect and enforceability
thereof, is inconsistent with just and
equitable principles of trade and may
raise serious questions of compliance
with the antifraud provisions of the
Federal securities laws. The Commission emphasized its support for arbitration as a means of resolving dis-

putes between investors and securities
professionals, but stated that prior
agreements to arbitrate must reflect
current applicable judicial decisions.

Municipal

Securities Dealers-On

July 11, 1979, the Commission published for comment proposed amendments to Rule 15bl0-12 under the Exchange Act, allowing an exemption for
certain municipal securities brokers
and municipal securities dealers from
the requirements of the Commission's
SECO (Securities and Exchange Commission Only) proqrarn.» The proposed amendments are designed to
eliminate the current dual regulation
of municipal securities transactions effected by SECO brokers and dealers
which conduct business in both municipal and corporate securities.
During the fiscal year, the Commission, pursuant to Section 17(b) of the
Exchange Act, conducted one Joint examination of a bank municipal securities dealer.

Broker-Dealer Financial Responsibility Requirements-Many
broker-dealers subject to the Commission's uniform net capital
rule are also
registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) as
futures
commission
merchants
(FCMs).An FCM is, generally, a person
who engages in soliciting or in accepting orders for the purchase or sale of
any commodity for future delivery on
or subject to the rules of any contract
rnarket.» The CFTC has jurisdiction to
impose minimum financial requirements on FCMs. On September 1,
1978, the CFTC substantially revised
its minimum financial and related reporting requirements imposed upon
registered FCMs, which became effective on December 20, 1978.39 Although
the CFTC's amendments apply only to
FCMs, about half of all commodity
customer business in the futures industry is done by FCMs that are also

registered with the Commission as securities broker-dealers and are therefore subject to the Commission's uniform net capital rule.
In the interest of minimizing duplicative regulation, the CFTC generally
incorporated into Its minimum financial responsibility
rules provisions
comparable to the Commission's net
capital requirements applicable to the
securities business of an FCM The
CFTC agreed to accept Part II of the
Financial and Operational Combined
Uniform Single (FOCUS) Report, a
quarterly report filed by broker-dealers
with the Commission, provided it was
amended to incorporate the CFTC's
Schedule of Seqr eqa tion Requirements and Funds on Deposit in Segregation.
On June 5, 1979, the Commission
generally incorporated into its net capital rule the CFTC's minimum financial
requirements applicable to the commodities business of an FCM.40It also
incorporated the CFTC's segregation
schedule into its FOCUS Report.v The
joint efforts of the two agencies have
generally provided uniform net capital
requirements for entities involved in
both the securities and commodities
businesses and will eliminate duplicative reporting requirements.

Securities Investor Protection Corporation- The Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (SIPA)42provides certain protection to customers of brokers
and dealers that fail to meet their obligations to their customers SIPA IS
administered principally by the Securities Investor Protection Corporation
(SIPC), a nonprofit membership corporation, the members of which are all
registered brokers and dealers with
limited exceptions. SIPC is funded
through assessments on its members,
although it may borrow up to $1 billion
from the United States Treasury under
certain emergency conditions. Section
11

3(e) of SIPA requires that SIPC file proposed rule and bylaw changes with the
Commission. Proposed rule changes
must be approved by the Commission
before they become effective, while
proposed bylaw changes take effect
after a prescribed period unless the
Commission disapproves the bylaw
changes.
On September 20, 1978, SIPC submitted proposed bylaw changes regarding the indemnification of SIPC
directors, and requiring SIPC members
to display the SIPC symbol at their offices and to make reference to their
SIPC membership in certain advertisements. The Commission considered
these proposals on November 8, 1978
and did not disapprove them.
In June 1978, SIPC adopted and submitted to the Commission three sets of
rules under SIPA. The Series 100 rules
and the Series 200 rules establish various capacities in which a customer
may have separate securities accounts
with a single broker-dealer and be protected by SIPC on each account. The
Series 300 rules set forth requirements
for the closeout and completion of
open contractual commitments between a SIPC member undergoing liquidation and other broker-dealers. In
October 1978, the Commission approved the Series 100 and 200 rules.v
Subsequently, in March 1979, the
Commission approved the Series 300
rules.w The Series 300 rules replaced
similar Commission rules that were
promulgated before the passage of
the Securities Investor Protection Act
Amendments of 1978 which gave
SIPC, rather than the Commission, the
authority to adopt such rules.
Because SIPC rules approved by the
Commission have the same force and
effect as Commission rules, the Commission has published those rules in a

Oversight of Self-Regulatory
Organizations
Securities Exchanges-As
of September 30, 1979, ten exchanges were
registered with the Commission as national securities exchanges pursuant
to Section 6 of the Exchange Act:
American Stock Exchange (Amex);
Boston Stock Exchange (BSE); Chicago
Board
Options
Exchange
(CBOE); Cincinnati Stock Exchange
(CSE); Intermountain Stock Exchange
(ISE); Midwest Stock Exchange (MSE);
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE); Pacific Stock Exchange (PSE); Philadelphia Stock Exchange (Phlx); and
Spokane Stock Exchange (SSE). No
exchange is currently operating under
an exemption from registration as a
national securities exchange.
In connection with the Cornmission's oversight of the delisting of securities traded on national securities
exchanges, the Commission, during
the fiscal year, granted applications by
exchanges to strike 96 equity issues
and 56 debt issues from listing and
registration.
The Commission also
granted applications, submitted by issuers, requesting withdrawal from listing and registration for 24 equity issues and four debt issues.
During the fiscal year, the Commission neared completion of its review of
its policies with respect to granting applications for unlisted trading privileges. The Commission's review is designed to develop standards which it
will apply in considering whether an
extension of unlisted trading privileges
is consistent with the maintenance of
fair and orderly markets and the protection of investors under Section
12(f)(2) of the Exchange Act. While
that review continues, the Commission generally has not granted applications for unlisted trading privileges.
In .Junew and again in Auqust-? of the

fiscal year, however, the Commission
approved applications by the MSE for
unlisted odd lot trading privileges in
certain securities which had become
listed on the NYSE subsequent to the
date of a previous Commission order
extending unlisted odd lot trading privileges to the MSE in 865 NYSE-listed

securitles.w
During the fiscal year, the national
securities exchanges reported to the
Commission,
pursuant to Section
19(dXl) of the Exchange Act, approximately 200 disciplinary actions imposing a variety of sanctions upon
member firms and their employees. In
addition, the Commission received
from the national securities exchanges
154 filings pursuant to Rule 19b-4 under the Exchange Act, including 98
proposed rule changes and 56 notices
of a stated policy, practice or interpretation not constituting a rule change.
Among the significant rule filings approved by the Commission during the
fiscal year were: (a) a proposal by the
NYSE to establish, on a two-year pilot
basis, a non-disciplinary procedure for
the reallocation of securities among
specialist units who fail to meet certain minimum performance standards
based upon the results of a performance evaluation questionnairess; (b) a
complete revision of the rules of the
CSElO; (c) amendments to the Amex
lIsting standards, expanding the universe of foreign and domestic issuers
whose securities may qualify for listing
on the Amex»: (d) a nine-month extension of the respective NYSE and Amex
rules regarding supplemental market
makers in equity securities"; and (e) a
pricing formula amendment to the
PSE's automated execution system
(COMEX), to provide that orders executed at the best bid or best offer as
determined by quotes received from
all participants
in the Intermarket
Trading Systern.v

National Association

of Securities

Dealers-The

NASD is the only securities association registered with the
Commission. At the close of the fiscal
year, 2800 brokers and dealers were
NASD members.
During the past fiscal year, the
NASD reported to the Commission the
final disposition of 289 disciplinary
complaints. In those disciplinary actions, 143 member firms and 332 individuals were named as respondents.
At the beginning of fiscal 1979, three
proceedings for review of NASD dis.
ciplinary decisions were pending before the Commission, and during the
year 27 additional cases were brought
reup for review. The Cornrrussion
viewed 14 of these cases and reduced
the sanctions to be imposed in some
cases.
The Commission also reviewed 39
NASD applications to admit a broker
or dealer to membership or to permit
a person to become associated WIth a
member where the broker or dealer or
person is subject to a statutory disqualification.
The Commission has
taken no adverse action WIth respect to
15 notices. Five notices were withdrawn, and at the end of the fiscal year,
19 notices were pending before the
Commission.
During the year, the Commission
continued to review an NASD proposed rule submitted in fiscal 1978 to
prohibit its members from giving discounts to customers in distributions of
securities offered at a fixed price. The
proposal was written in response to a
1976 judicial decision, Papilsky u
Berndt,» which held that such discounts were unlawful in some CIrcumstances, absent a contrary Commission or NASD ruling. In September
1979, the Commission commenced
public hearings to consider the issues
presented by the proposed rule.
During the fiscal year, the Commission also worked with self-regulatory
organizations to simplify and eliminate
13

duplication in the self. regulatory system for brokers and dealers. The Commission extended until January I,
1980, its provisional approval of four
plans proposed by self-regulatory organizations for allocating their responsibilities to perform various regulatory
functions
for brokers and dealers
which belong to more than one self.
regulatory organization. The plans represent agreements reached between
the NASD and four exchanges: the
BSE, CSE, MSE and PSE. The plans
assign to the NASD much of the responsibility for conducting onsite examination of dual members and for
processing various applications.

Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board- As in the case of national securities exchanges and the NASD, the
Commission reviews proposed rule
changes of the Municipal Securities
Rulemaking Board (MSRB). During the
fiscal year, the MSRB filed 14 rule pro.
posals. The Commission considered a
number of those proposals and others
which were pending from the previous
fiscal year.
The Commission approved a comprehensive arbitration code for the municipal securities industry." The code
is designed to provide a means for reo
solving disputes on an expedited and
relatively inexpensive basis. It includes
both special procedures for settling
disputes relating to customer small
claims and more general procedures
which can be used for claims of any
size.
The Commission also approved a
rule relating to the advertising of municipal securltles.» The rule prohibits
a municipal securities professional
from publishing or causing to be pub.
lished an advertisement concerning
municipal securities that such professional knows or has reason to know is
false and misleading. It also requires
all advertisements concerning municipal securities to be approved in writing

14

by appropriate supervisory personnel.
In addition to consideration of MSRB
rule proposals, the Commission proposed a rule to provide the MSRB with
information for use in its rulemaking
activities. On May 30, 1979, the Commission published for comment pro.
posed Rule 15Bc7 -1 under the Exchange Act to make available to the
MSRB information concerning cornpliance examinations of municipal securities brokers and municipal securities
dealers." The proposed rule is designed to establish a mechanism for
furnishing to the MSRB reports of compliance examinations, or information
from such examinations, made by or
furnished to the Commission,
the
NASD and the three Federal bank regulatory agencies. (In October 1979,
this rule was adopted by the Commission.»)
Clearing Agencies-The
Commission has granted temporary registration to 12 clearing agencies pending
the development of standards for full
registration of clearing agencies. The
Commission also received applications
for temporary registration as a clearing
agency from the Philadelphia Depository Trust Company (Philadep) and the
Fixed Income Clearing Corporatlon.»
The Commission, at year end, was
considering the numerous comment
letters which were received on the reo
vised proposed standards for clearing
agency registration which were published in the previous fiscal year.w The
Commission expects to announce the
standards for full registration within
the next fiscal year.
The Commission has established a
Branch of Securities Processing Inspections whose primary responsibility
is to inspect registered clearing agencies. The branch has embarked on a
program of inspecting each clearing
agency and is developing formal procedures for the inspection of clearing
agencies. On July 10-13, 1979, the

branch conducted an extensive inspection of the Philadep as part of the Commission's consideration of whether to
grant temporary registration as a clearing agency to that applicant. At the
end of the fiscal year, the Commission's staff was continuing to analyze
data gathered in the course of this inspection. After completion of this
work, the findings of this inspection
will be discussed with Philadep. (Subsequent to the close of the fiscal year,
on October 24, 1979, the Commission
announced its order granting temporary registration to Philadep.»)
Arbitrsuon Facilities of Self-Regulatory Organizations-During
fiscal
year 1978, the Commission's staff inspected arbitration facilities of the
NASD, Amex, and CBOE. The staff
also completed its analysis of information obtained during an inspection
of the NYSE on September 27-28,
1978. The purpose of these inspections was to determine the efficiency
and fairness of the procedures of these
organizations for the resolution of disputes between investors and brokerdealers. The inspections focused on
the organizational structure of the arbitration departments, the composition of arbitration panels, the time necessary to resolve disputes, the volume
of cases and the range of awards.
As a result of these inspections, the
staff recommended that the self-regulatory organizations prepare materials
to inform investors about the enforceability of agreements to arbitrate future disputes with broker-dealers and
about those issues for which a judicial
forum might be available. The staff
also made certain comments and recommendations regarding the operation of the arbitration programs.
The staff suggested that the NYSE
permit arbitrators, through the arbitration department staff, to refer to disciplinary authorities any apparent violations of applicable rules or laws

discovered in the course of arbitration
proceedings. The staff also suggested
that the NASD attempt to reduce the
time between filing and resolution of
claims and to select public arbitrators
with a greater diversity of experience.
Procedures for Filing Proposed Rule
Changes-Section
19(b) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the 1975
Amendments, requires self-regulatory
organizations to file all proposed rule
changes with the Commission. Shortly
after Section 19(b) became effective,
the Commission adopted Section 19b.
4 and related Form 19b.4A establishing procedures for self-regulatory
organizations to file proposed rule
changes and designating the types of
proposed rule changes that may become effective upon filing.
In May 1979, the Commission pro.
posed for public comment amendments to Rule 19b.4 and related Form
19b-4A.62 Developed in light of the
Commission's experience in adrnimstering Section 19(b), the proposed
amendments are intended to improve
and simplify the procedures for filing
proposed rule changes, thereby expediting the rule review process. The
Commission's proposals include (a) an
amendment to Rule 19b-4 to designate
a new category of rules that may become effective upon filing and (b)
amendments to Form 19b-4A to specify, in greater detail the information required by that form.
Inspections of Self-Regulatory Organizations-During
the fiscal year, the
Commission reorganized its program
for oversight inspections of the activities of self-regulatory organizations.
This new program has entailed more
frequent and more intensive onsite inquiries into the market surveillance
and compliance systems of the various
national securities exchanges and the
NASD.
In February 1979, the Commission
staff conducted an inspection of the

15

stock market surveillance program of
the Phlx. This inspection disclosed significant inadequacies in the market
surveillance systems of the Phlx.
In April 1979, the Commission staff,
in response to a recommendation of
the Options Study, conducted an inspection of the operations and listed
options market surveillance program
of the MSE. This inspection disclosed
that the MSE program was inadequate
for the detection of certain common
options trading violations.
In June 1979, the Commission staff,
in connection with a pending pilot
trading program, conducted an inspection of the NYSE program for surveillance of the activities of Registered
Competitive Market Makers (RCMMs)
and Registered Competitive Traders
(RCTs). This inspection also included
a review of the exchange's enforcement program for RCMM members.
This inspection disclosed deficiencies
in certain of the techniques employed
by NYSE staff to detect rule violations
by RCMMs and RCTs and other weaknessesin case file documentation practices. Also discovered was a failure to
take the formal disciplinary action neeessary to enforce RCMM rules effectively.
In April 1979, the Commission staff
inspected the options operations and
market surveillance programs of the
PSE. This inspection disclosed certain inadequacies in some of the exchange's systems which monitor compliance by market professionals with
trading rules and with credit regulations.
In June 1979, the Commission staff
conducted an inspection of the options
operations and market surveillance
systems of the Phlx. This inspection
disclosed significant deficiencies in the
Phlx system to detect options trading
violations and deficiencies in the enforcement of certain Phlx rules.

16

In June 1979, the Commission staff
conducted an inspection of the Securities Qualification
Section in the
NASD's NASDAQ Operations Department. The major findings of this inspection were that the NASD had
made marked improvements in the
manner in which it monitors periodic
filings of issuers for compliance with
securities qualification criteria, that
there were shortcomings in the section's administration of the listing exception process and that there were
ambiguities in the NASD rules governing this process.
Between February and July 1979,
the Commission staff conducted inspections of the operations of NASD
district offices located in Philadelphia,
Washington, D.C., New Orleans, Kansas City and Chicago, as well as the
operations of the unit at NASD headquarters assigned to manage and coordinate NASD district office activities. These inspections focused on the
administration of the NASD's program
of examinations and monitoring of
member firms. These Inspections disclosed a number of strengths and
weaknessesin the.requlatory programs
of individual offices as well as several significant weaknesses which appeared to be national in scope. This latter class of weaknesses included (a)
shortcomings in the work paper requirements and document maintenance practices of NASD examiners,
especially with regard to sales practices; (b) the failure of some examiners
to follow procedures prescribed by the
NASD to detect sales practice violations during routine examinations of
member firms; and (c) inadequate
staffing of the district offices of both
examiners and supervisory personnel.
During July 1979, the Commission
staff inspected the operations and market surveillance and enforcement program of the CBOE. The inspection
team found inadequacies in the man-

ner in which the CBOE seeks to detect
certain trading violations.
During August 1979, the Commission staff inspected the options operations and market surveillance and enforcement program of the Amex. This
inspection disclosed certain deficiencies in the market surveillance systems
of the exchange and a failure to enforce certain exchange rules. In addition, the inspection team found a pattern of failure to prosecute certain
cases of apparent rule violations by
floor members.
During February 1979, the Cornrnission staff conducted an examination of
the complaint processing unit of the
Amex. Complaint processing is a function of the Department of Rulings and
Inquiries, Legal and Regulatory Policy
Division, which is also responsible for
issuing interpretations of Amex rules.
The purpose of the inspection was to
determine the responsiveness, efficiency and timeliness of the Amex
complaint handling system. The staff
will continue to monitor that system
and to recommend changes where necessary.
In May 1979, the Commission staff
examined the complaint processing
function of the CBOE. The CBOE
Trading Regulation Department responds to complaints and inquiries
which are floor-related, and the Office
of Inquiries and Complaints handles
matters related to broker-dealer sales

practices. The staff will continue to
monitor the responsiveness of the
CBOE to Investor concerns.
After each of the foregoing inspections, the Commission notified the appropriate self-regulatory organization
of its findings and asked that remedial
action be taken. The Commission is
planning a series of follow-up inspections to ensure that appropriate remedial action has been taken.

Revenues and Expenses of Self-Regregulatory
ulatory Organizations-The
functions of the various exchanges and
the NASD with regard to their brokerdealer members are financed through
various fees and dues, such as listing
fees and transaction charges. The nature of some of these revenue sources
makes the financial condition of selfregulatory organizations dependent
upon price fluctuations and trading
volume.
Furthermore, the various self-regulatory organizations are quite different
In the extent of their dependence on
particular sources of revenue. Some
sources of revenue, such as transaction, clearing and depository fees,
change directly with changes in share
volume. Others are relatively fixed,
such as listing fees and membership
dues. Additional analysis and statistical detail on share volume, revenues
and expenses of each self-regulatory
organization are presented In the Appendix of this report.

The Disclosure System

New Developments
Policy

in Disclosure

The "full disclosure" system administered by the Commission is designed
to assure that the securities markets
operate in an environment in which full
and accurate material information
about publicly traded companies IS
available to all interested investors.
During the fiscal year, the Commission
pursued a program designed to enhance the effectiveness of required information, while reducing attendant
burdens to the extent possible. Five
major objectives have been stressed to
attain that goal: (1) Integration of disclosures required by the Securities Act
of 1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange
Act); (2) narrowing of the differences
between information supplied by registrants to the Commission in formal
filings and to various segments of the
public through informal means; (3) improvement of disclosure requirements;
(4) development of guidance for special situations outside the normal system of continual disclosure; (5) refocusing of the staff review process; and
(6) implementation of a program review of existing rules to delete or
amend unnecessary or outmoded provisions.

Projections of Future Economic Performance-In
furtherance of its new
policy of encouraging the disclosure of
earnings forecasts and other forwardlooking information by registrants, the
Commission issued a release on June
25, 1979, which announced the adoption of Rule 175 providing "safe har-

bor" from the liability provisions of the
Federal securities laws for enumerated
forward-Iookinq information that is
reasonably based and made in good
faith.63 The Commission's initiatives in
voluntary projection disclosure are experimental in nature and a task force
has been set up to assure that the new
policies embodied in the rule do not
yield results inconsistent with investor
protection.
Disclosure Revisions-The
Commission has taken a number of steps to improve the format of disclosure, delete
unnecessary requirements, add new requirements, and, generally, make disclosure more effective and flexible. In
one such action, the Commission
adopted amendments to provide relief
from certain portions of the reporting
requirements of the annual and quarterly reports filed with it by registrants
whose equity securities are owned
either directly or indirectly by a single
person which itself is a reporting entity under the Exchange Act.64 The
Amendments are part of the Commission's continuing effort to reduce reporting burdens and paperwork by
more precisely tailoring the reporting
requirements to the characteristics of
particular registrants and to the needs
of their investors.
On September 6, 1979, the Commission proposed the amendment of
Rule 12b-25 and its related form which
would result in the elimination of extensions of time to file reports under
the Exchange Act and, in lieu thereof,
proposed the institution of a system
requiring notification of a registrant's
or reporting person's inability to timely
19

file reports or portions thereof.» By
eliminating the review requirement for
extension of time requests, the Commission hopes to be able to place increased emphasis on the review of all
Exchange Act filings. In this manner,
the Commission will attempt to implement a recommendation of the Advisory Committee on Corporate Disclosure which noted that a substantive
review of periodic reports, consistent
with the quality of information sought
in registration statements, is essential
to the end product of a high quality
disclosure docurnent.w
The Commission also concurrently
proposed for comment a new Rule 12b26 which would require registrants to
prominently disclose, on the cover
pages of periodic reports filed pursuant to Sections 13 or 15(d), any required portion omitted from those
It is believed

requirement will assist the investing
public and the Commission in the review of Exchange Act reports.

Corporate Accountabiltty; Management Background and RemunerationResponding to numerous events that
raised questions about the adequacy of
corporate accountability mechanisms,
the Commission established a task
force in 1977 to undertake a broad
reexamination of its rules related to
shareholders communications, shareholder participation in the corporate
electoral process and corporate gov.
ernance generally.67The Commission
determined to address in stages, the
complex issues raised during the en.
suing public hearings. In December
1978, the Commission adopted final
rule, form and schedule amendments
designed to provide shareholders with
additional information about the matters on which their vote is solicited.w
Generally, these amendments require
disclosure of: (1) The existence and
functioning of audit, nominatmq and
compensation committees; (2) attend-

20

ance of directors at board and committee meetings; (3) certain economic
and personal relationships between directors or nominees and an issuer or its
management; and (4) resignations of
directors.
On August 13, 1979, the Commission proposed a second set of rules related to corporate accountablltty.w The
proposals would require that shareholders be provided with a proxy card
which: (1) Indicates whether the proxy is
solicited by the board of directors; (2)
provides a means to vote for director
nominees individually;
and (3) removes discretionary authority to vote
unmarked proxies. The proposed
amendments also would require disclosure of prior year election results in
certain circumstances and would expand the types of communications ex.
empt from the proxy rules. (On November 20, 1979, the Commission
adopted a version of these rules modified to reflect certain comments received.)»
The Task Force on Corporate Accountability was, at the close of the fiscal year, engaged in preparing a com.
prehensive report on the corporate
governance proceeding. The staff monitored governance disclosure appear.
ing in the proxy statements of 1,200
representative issuers during the 1979
proxy season. In addition to analyzing
the results of the disclosure survey, the
report is expected to address such issues as the functions of the board of
directors and its committees; sollcitations of beneficial owners of stock held
in street and nominee name; disclosure of corporate activities having both
economic and social impacts; and the
respective roles of private sector, institutional shareholders, self-regulatory
organizations, the states, the Commission and Congress in corporate accountability. After review of the staff
report, the Commission will consider
what further action, if any, is appropri-

ate and will determine whether to publish additional rulemaking proposals
or to recommend or support new legislation affecting corporate accountability.
In a release dated December 4,
1978, the Commission amended certain disclosure forms and regulations
to standardize and improve the disclosure requirements relating to management remuneratton.»
The Amendments revised the management remuneration disclosure
provisions
in
certain registration statements, periodic reports and proxy and information
statements filed with the Commission
to require tabular and other forms of
disclosures as to all remuneration received from the corporation and its subsidiaries for services during the latest
fiscal year by certain specified directors, executive officers and officers.
Subsequent to the adoption of these
requirements, the Commission authorized the Division of Corporation Finance (the Division) to issue its interpretive views regarding- certain
aspects of the amendments in order to
give guidance to reqlstrants."MOnitoring of EXisting Guidelines-As
a means of accomplishing its stated
disclosure program goals, the staff of
the Division has undertaken a comprehensive revisitation and review of the
disclosure requirements of the Securities Act and Exchange Act. On June
25, 1979, the Commission issued, for
public comment, comprehensive proposed staff guidelines for the disclosure in registration statements and
reports by electric and gas utility
companies.n
It is anticipated that
these guidelines will improve the usefulness to investors of the various documents involved by specifying the
types of data which such documents
should disclose. It is also believed that
the guidelines will benefit companies
by increasing the uniformity of disclosure within the industry and eliminat-

ing disclosure requirements which are
not meaningful to that industry. The
comment period closed on September
24, 1979, and the staff began analyzing the comments received.
In August of 1979, the Commmission issued a release requesting comments on the quality and desirability of
the disclosure made under the existing
guidelines for "Statistical DIsclosure
by Bank Holding Companies."> These
particular guidelines have been in operation since 1976. The request is part
of the Commission's effort to monitor
the effect and value of its disclosure
rules and guides with a view to amending or rescinding those rules or guides
which do not yield the expected benefits.
On September 6, 1979, the Commission requested comments on the
operation and efficacy of certain of its
recently adopted proxy statement disclosure requirements as well as certain
other disclosure requirements relating
to the structure, functioning, and composition of boards of directors.»
On September 27, 1979, the Commission published an interpretive release76 focusing attention on existing
requirements under the Securines Act
and the Exchange Act concerning environmental disclosure to assist registrants in complying with those requirements and to alert them that the
Commission will continue, in appropriate cases, to take enforcement action in instances of non-compliance.
The release, in particular, addressed
these issues: (1) the need to disclose
total estimated expenditures for environmental compliance beyond two
years in the future; (2) the obligation to
disclose particular types of environmental proceedings; and (3) the circumstances under which companies
must disclose their policies or approaches concerning environmental
compliance. The Commission reviewed
its policies with respect to environ men-

21

tal disclosure in an administrative pro.
ceedinq'" (which is discussed in the "Enforcement" section of this report).

Small Business
While it should be recognized that
many of the problems which face small
business today result from factors
rooted in the broad economic environment rather than the Federal securities
laws, the Commission is aware that the
rather costly and complicated process
of distributing securities in compliance
with these laws is felt by some to
impede unnecessarily capital formation by small businesses. The Commission has vigorously addressed itself to
these problems by focusing primarily
on its existing rules and regulations
and on the general problem areas under those rules which have been of the
greatest interest to small businesses.
During April and May of 1978, the
Commission held public hearings concerning the effects of its rules and regulations on the ability of small businessesto raise capital and the impact on
small businesses of the disclosure requirements under the Securities Act.
The
Commission
subsequently
adopted revisions to its rules during fiscal 1978 and has continued to implement the policy of easing the regulatory
burden on small businesses, consistent
with the protection of investors, during
fiscal 1979.
In June 1979, the Office of Small
Business Policy was established within
the Division. The Office: (a) serves as
the focal point of the Commission's
small business rulemaking initiatives;
(b) reviews and comments upon the impact of rule proposals on small businesses; and (c) acts as liaison with
Congressional committees, govern.
ment agencies and other groups concerned with small business. The Office
is responsible for monitoring the quality of disclosure included in offerings

22

registered on Form S-18, which is described below. Since the Form was
adopted on an experimental basis, the
Office will make recommendations as
to the continued use of or appropriate
amendments to the Form.
The Commission has also adopted
certain revisions to Rule 144 and Regulation A. On March 5, 1979, Rule 144
was amended to allow non-affiliates to
disregard the Rule's volume restrictions under certain ctrcumstences.>
To qualify, the seller must have been
a non-affiliate for three months and
must have held the securities: (a) for
three years if they are listed on ana.
tional securities exchange or quoted
on the NASDAQ, or (b) for four years
if the securities are not so listed or
quoted and the issuer files reports
pursuant to the Exchange Act. On
June 1, 1979, the Commission
adopted amendments which permit
the use of a pre-effective selling document in Regulation A offerings, pro.
vided that the securities are sold by underwriter(s) who are broker-dealers
registered under the Exchange Act,79
On March 29, 1979, the Commission
adopted Form S-18 and related amend.
ments concerning simplified reqlstration and reporting requirements for
small issuers. 80 The Form is available to
certain domestic or Canadian corporate
issuers for offerings of up to $5 million,
of which up to $1.5 million may be
sales by existing security holders. The
Form calls for narrative disclosure
somewhat less extensive than that
presently required by Form S-l and
audited financial statements prepared
in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles rather than in accordance with Regulation S.X. A corresponding amendment was also adopted
which allows issuers to include the narrative and financial disclosure format of
the Form S-18 in its initial Form 10-K
report.» Issuers also have the option of
filing the registration statement at the

appropriate regional office or at the
Headquarters Office.
On September 11, 1979, the Commission proposed Rule 242 which expands the availability of Section 3(b) of
the Securities Act to allow issuers to
sell up to $2 million worth of securities, subject to provisions of integration delineated in the Rule, without
registration or compliance with the
more burdensome requirements found
in other exemptions from registration.82 The two major conceptual
changes embodied in the Rule are,
first, the unregistered sale of securities
to an unlimited number of institutional
investors with no mandated information requirements (relying on the ability of such persons to obtain material
information from the issuer) and, second, the unregistered sale of securities
to a limited number of individuals (35)
with no sophistication test which must
be met, but with an information requirement similar to that found in
Form S-18. (On January 10, 1980, the
Commission adopted Rule 242.)
(On October 10, 1979, the Commission authorized the issuance of a release indicating that it will not take
enforcement action against issuers
utilizing Form S-18 to offer $1,500,000
or less of debt securities for public sale
pursuant to the Securities Act without
filing and qualifying the trust indenture
under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.
The proposed no-action position would
be taken when it appears that such
compliance would be inconsistent with
both the Commission's ongoing effort
to facilitate small businesses in the
capital formation
process and the
Commission's view that qualification is
not required for Regulation A offerings
of debt securitles.)»
Long Range Studies-Policy research
by the Commission's Directorate of
Economic and Policy Research regarding the ability of small firms to raise
capital increased substantially in 1979.

Phase I of the Experimental Technology Incentive Program (ETIP) was
completed in conjunction with the U.S.
Department of Commerce. In this initial effort several policy questions regarding the capital markets confronting small, high technology corporations were addressed. Phase II, now in
progress, implements this system and
expands the scope beyond the capital
raising process to include accountmg
disclosure, tender offers and other
policy concerns relevant to small, innovative enterprises. This effort will be
supplemented in fiscal year 1980 with
an exarmnatron also conducted by the
Directorate of Economic and Policy
Research, of the role regional brokerage firms play in raising capital for issuers through initial public offerings.

Tender Offer Proposal
In February 1979, the Commission
withdrew certain proposed rules with
respect to tender offers which had
been published in 1976, and published
for comment a new proposal and a related schedule.« This action was part
of the Commission's ongoing program
to establish a comprehensive regulatory framework with respect to tender
offers.
The proposal would require Tender
Offer Statements on Schedule 140-1
to be filed by the bidder with the Commission, and sent to certain interested
persons, predicated on the date of
commencement of a tender offer. An
initial filing with the Commission prior
to the date the tender offer is first published, sent or given to security holders
would not be required. Rather than establish a specific time for such filings,
the proposal generally would permit a
filing to be made as soon as practiceble on the date of commencement or,
with respect to amendments, on the
date the material change or additional
tender offer material is first published,
sent or given to security holders. This

23

filing standard is designed to create an
efficient system in conformity with the
Williams Act which will not unduly burden bidders. In addition, the proposal,
which would provide the prompt communication of information regarding
tender offers to trading markets, is intended to assist national securities exchanges and the National Association
of Securities Dealers, in carrying out
their self-regulatory resonsibilities under the Federal securities laws.
In addition to establishing comprehensive disclosure requirements applicable to any tender offer subject to
Section 14(d) of the Exchange Act, the
proposal would also provide a framework for disseminating cash tender offers, and amendments, to security
holders. The proposed rules would add
content and clarity to the term "published, sent or given" to security holders and are intended to afford a greater
number of shareholders the opportunity to receive, consider and evaluate
tender offer materials. Three non-mandatory methods of disseminating cash
tender offers would be provided: longform publication; summary publication; and the use of stockholder lists
and security position listings. To ensure the efficient operation of the latter
method, a procedure would be established under which the bidder's tender
offer materials would be sent to security holders either by the bidder who is
furnished with stockholder lists, or by
the subject company. The choice as to
the method used would be the option
of the subject company.
To further ensure that investors have
an adequate opportunity to consider
communications from the bidder, as
well as the subject company, in deciding whether to tender to the bidder,
sell into the market, or hold part or all
of their securities, the Commission
also proposed rules that would require
all tender offers to remain open for at
least 30 business days and for at least

24

ten business days after any increases
by the bidder in the offered consideration; provide withdrawal rights for
shares deposited by investors during
the first 15 business days of an offer
and an additional ten business days in
the event of a competing offer; and
permit bidders to extend pro rata acceptance rights for periods in excess of
those required by Section 14(d)(6).
Other proposed rules would require
prompt status reports whenever the
length of a tender offer is extended and
payment for or return of deposited securities as soon as reasonably practicable after the tender offer's termination.
The proposal would also revise the
present disclosure requirements relating to subject companies and other
persons making a solicitation or recommendation in connection with a
tender offer subject to Section 14(d).
Thus, proposed Rule 14d-10 and proposed Schedule 14D-10 would replace
current Rule 14d-4 and Schedule 14D,
respectively. While the proposed rule
would require broader disclosure, a
narrower class of persons would be
subject to its requirements than is currently the case. The limitation on the
types of persons who must file a proposed Schedule 14D-1O represents an
effort by the Commission to avoid unnecessary regulation in the context of
tender offers.
While not applying to a bidder, proposed Rule 14e-2(a) would affirm a
duty of disclosure on any other person
who trades on non-public material information obtained directly from a bidder or indirectly from a bidder, such as
from persons involved or consulted by
the bidder in the precommencement
planning and preparation stages of a
tender offer. The Commission believes
that an affirmative duty of disclosure
is necessary for the protection of investors because of past abuses, the vital
importance of such market informa-

tion and the extraordinary nature of
tender offers.
(On November 20, 1979, the Commission adopted a modified version of
these tender offer proposals.)»

Going Private and Sale of Asset
Transactions
On August 2, 1979, the Commission
adopted a new rule and schedule relating to going private transactions by
public companies or their affiliates.86
This was in response to the continued
occurrence of going private transactions, the variety of methods employed
in such transactions, and the need for
disclosure to investors confronted with
these transactions. The rule and schedule are intended to augment and implement the present statutory provisions
by prohibiting fraudulent, deceptive
and manipulative acts or practices in
connection with going private transactions and by prescribing new filing, disclosure and dissemination
requirements as a means reasonably designed
to prevent such acts and practices.
During the year, several proxy statements involving novel, multi-step sale
of asset transactions were filed with the
Commission. Typically, the subject
transaction involved a cash sale of substantially all of the assets of a public
company to another company, often a
private company not otherwise engaged in a trade or business. The purchasing company expects to continue
the business of the public selling
company under the public company's
name and hires substantially all of the
seller's managers under long-term employment arrangements to manage the
business. A significant percentage of
the purchase price may be borrowed
by the purchaser and, if so, the assets
purchased are usually directly or indirectly pledged to secure repayment of
the loan. In some cases, the sale of assets, if approved, will be followed by an

issuer tender offer by the public company to repurchase its shares for cash
out of the proceeds received from the
sale. In addition, the public company
proposes, as part of the transaction, to
amend its certificate of incorporation
to change its business to that of an
investment company. In view of concerns that were expressed by interested shareholders
regarding
the
adequacy of disclosure; difficulties en.
countered in the administrative review
process; and enforcement
actions
which had been taken as a result of failure to comply with the disclosure requirements of the Exchange Act, the
Commission authorized the Division of
Corporation Finance to provide information to the public about current
practices and guidance to issuers in
fulfilling their disclosure obligations.&7

Oversight of the Accounting
Profession
Report on the Accountmg Profession
and the Commission 5 Oversight RoleIn July 1979, the Commission submitted to Congress its second Report on
the Accounting Profession and the
Commission's Oversight Role. This
was in accordance with the Coirnmission's undertaking, during the June
1977 hearings held on the accounting
profession by the Subcommittee on
Reports, Accounting and Management
of the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs, to report periodically
on the accounting profession's reo
sponse to the challenges which Congress and others have placed before it
and on related Commission initiatives.
The questions raised concerning the
accounting profession and its future
have centered principally on the profession's capability, absent direct government regulation, to regulate and discipline its members, to assure their
independence, and to set auditing and
accounting standards. The Report contained the views of the Commission and

25
315-80~O

- 80 - 4

the staff on the major issues confronting the accounting profession, and analyzed in detail the recent progress
made by the profession and the Commission, in dealing with them.
In its July 1979 Report, the Commission concluded that progress has
been sufficient to merit continued opportunity for the accounting profession to pursue its efforts at self-regulation. Consequently, the Commission
did not recommend, at the time, legislation to supersede or control the
regulation of accountants. Further, the
Commission continues to believe that
it is too early to reach any definite conclusions with respect to possible future
regulatory action or legislation. If, for
example, the profession's initiatives
are not successful, a legislative alternative might well be required. Additionally, the Commission remains unconvinced that comprehensive direct
governmental regulation of accounting or accountants would afford the
public either increased protection or a
more meaningful basis for confidence
in the work of public accountants.
During the past year, the Commission has worked with the accounting
profession to define the objectives of
the self-regulatory program, to assure
that the profession's proposed implementation is consistent with those objectives, and to suggest ways in which
to achieve the objectives without imposing specific methods. In addition,
the Commission has been active during the past year in overseeing the
profession's initiatives concerning the
independence of auditors and the accounting and auditing standard-setting
processes. In this respect, the Commission has given specific attention to
maintaining the momentum for progress in such areas as reporting on internal accounting control, scope of
services performed by auditors, and
the work of the Financial Accounting
Standards Board (FASB) and of the

26

AICPA. The Commission has criticized
the profession where necessary, complimented it, when deserved, and in
general, has offered its views and in.
sights concerning the self-regulation
effort on which the profession has embarked.
With respect to the accounting standard-setting process, the Commission
believes that the initiative for establishing and improving accounting standards should remain in the private sec.
tor, subject to Commission oversight.
However, to retain that prerogative, the
FASB must continue its efforts to provide leadership and take necessary action in controversial areas. Also, the
members of the accounting profession
and the corporate community must encourage the FASB to provide that lead.
ership, support the FASB's decisions
and join more actively in the standard.
setting process. This next year will be
a critical period in assessing the ability
of the private sector to demonstrate its
ability to move responsibly in addressing the complex, yet essential, issues
with which it is confronted.
The process of demonstrating that
accountants themselves, rather than
government, should (1) retain primary
authority to regulate the profession; (2)
ensure and instill confidence in professionalism and objectivity; (3) maintain
control over the quality of the work of
the profession's members and discipline those who fail to adhere to its
standards; and (4) formulate appropriate accounting and auditing standards,
is one which will demand the profession's and the Commission's continued
commitment. The need for leadership
regarding these essential issues is
greater than ever. Whether it will be
effectively provided by the private sector and, if so, by whom, is not yet certain. The Commission stands ready to
consider any reasonable alternatives to
achieve the essential objectives.
Management
Advisory
Services

(MAS)- The issue of the appropriate
scope of services to be provided by
independent public accountants to
their audit clients and the effect of such
services on their independence has
been the subject of much discussion.
The problem has been addressed in
various fora-by
the accounting
profession, scholars, the Commission,
the Congress, and most recently by the
Public Oversight Board (POB) of the
SEC Practice Section of the Division of
CPA Firms of the AICPA."
In June 1978, the Commission, in
Accounting Series Release No. 250
(ASR No. 250), adopted a rule requiring disclosure in proxy statements of
services provided by the registrant's
principal independent accountants and
disclosure of whether the board of directors or its audit or similar committee had approved each service and
considered its possible effect on independence. In ASR No. 250, the Commission also indicated that it had not
yet determined whether it should propose rules to prohibit public accountants from rendering certain types of
services to their publicly-held audit
clients. The Commission noted that
the SEC Practice Section had asked
the POB to consider the matter and
stated that the POB should be given an
opportunity to present its conclusions
before the Commission acted.
On March 9, 1979, the POB submitted its report, "Scope of Services by
CPA Firms," to the Executive Committee of the Section. In its report, the
POB concluded that proscriptive solutions to the scope of services issue are
not necessary at this time.
The Commission reviewed the report of the POB and concluded that it
did not adequately sensitize the profession and its clients to the potential
effects on the independence of accountants of performance of nonaudit
services for audit clients. Accordingly,
in June 1979, the Commission issued

Accounting Series Release No. 264
(ASR No. 264)89 in which it stated its
views concerning certain factors which
accountants should consider in assessing the possible effects upon their independence of the performance of
nonaudit services for publicly-held audit clients. In addition, because of the
impact which any impairment of the
auditor's independence, either in fact
or in appearance, could have on the
credibility and usefulness of the audit
report, the Commission also set forth
certain factors which audit committees, boards of directors, and managements should consider in determining
whether to engage their independent
accountants to perform nonaudit services.
The possible effect upon audit independence of performing nonaudit
services for audit clients is a complex
issue. The Commission, in identifying
the factors set forth in ASR No. 264,
was neither proposing to proscribe particular nonaudit services regardless of
the surrounding circumstances, nor
seeking to deprecate the very real benefits which may accrue from certain
auditor MAS engagements. Rather, the
Commission's objective was to re-enforce the sensitivity of interested parties to the considerations involved in
judging whether particular nonaudit
services should be rendered by a particular registrant's auditor. In each
case, the ultimate issue is one of informed professional judgment; no set
of factors or criteria can substitute for
the careful, case-by-case evaluation
which the exercise of that judgment
entails.
ASR No. 264 did not end examination of the scope of services issue. The
Commission has the responsibility under the securities laws to assure that
accountants who practice before it are
independent. and will continue its oversight of this area.
The Commission recognizes that the

27

question of indep.endent auditor MAS
activity is both difficult and controversial. If future events indicate that further action is necessary. the Commission stands ready to reconsider this
issue in order to assure the confidence
of investors in the financial reporting
of publicly-held companies.

Accounting Standards for Oil and Gas
Producers-During the fiscal year the
Commission, aided by an Advisory
Committee on Oil and Gas Accounting. continued its efforts to implement
its August 1978 decision to consider a
new method of accounting-reserve
recognition accounting (RRA)-for oil
and gas producers. The Commission's
decision resulted from an extensive
public proceeding conducted pursuant
to both the Federal securities laws and
the Energy Policy and Conservation
Act of 1975. which requires that the
Commission assure the development
and observance of uniform accounting
practices for the oil and gas industry.
Because the feasibility of such an
accounting method was not assured,
the Commission outlined a series of
steps for the development and implementation of RRA. As an initial step.
the Commission required that registrants disclose certain oil and gas reserve information beginning in fiscal
years ending after December 25, 1978.
Specifically, on December 19, 1978.
the Commission adopted amendments
to certain forms and regulations to
standardize and improve its disclosure
requirements relating to oil and gas reserves and operetions.w The amendments incorporated into Regulation SK requirements for disclosure of: (1)
The present value of future net revenues from estimated production of
proved oil and gas reserves; (2) any favorable or adverse event since the end
of the most recent fiscal year which is
believed to have caused a significant
change in the proved reserves; (3) the
average sale price and average produc-

28

tion cost per unit of oil and gas pro.
duced; and (4) historical information
concerning the number of productive
and dry wells drilled. The amendments
expanded the disclosure of the net
quantities of proved reserves from "as
of a reasonably current date" to ape.
riod of five years, and expanded the
types of companies which are required
to disclose information concerning the
estimated availability of oil and gas
from principal sources. An exemption
from these disclosure requirements
was provided for registrants whose oil
and gas activities do not exceed specified criteria.
In September 1979. the Commission
adopted a requirement for oil and gas
producers to include in their financial
statements for fiscal years ending after
December 25, 1979. a supplemental
summary of oil and gas producing activities prepared on the basis of RRA.
The information generated and the experience gained from the presentation
of this supplemental summary will provide much of the basis for an eventual
decision by the Commission as to
whether RRA should be required as the
accounting method for the primary financial statements of oil and gas producers.

FASB Conceptual Framework Project- The FASB project to develop a
conceptual framework as a basis for addressing emerging accounting problems is the most important financial
reporting matter confronting the profession. The Commission continues to
support the efforts of the FASB in this
area.
The conceptual framework project
continues to be given a high priority by
the FASB. The most notable actions
during the last year were the issuance
of: (1) Statement of Financial Accounting Concepts No.1 (FAC No.1), "Objectives of Financial Reporting by Business Enterprises" (November 1978).
which establishes the objectives of

general purpose external financial reporting by business enterprises; and (2)
Statement of Financial Accounting
Standards No. 33 (FAS-33), "Financial
Reporting and Changing Prices" (September 1979), which requires certain
large, publicly-held enterprises to disclose supplementary information about
how inflation and changing prices affect
their businesses.
The FASS has made important
strides in dealing with some of the fundamental issues inherent in the standard-setting process. FAC No. I,for example, does not limit the scope of
financial reporting objectives to financial statements, but rather sets forth
those objectives in terms of financial
reporting in general. In addition, its focus on users of financial information
and their interest in evaluating future
performance, including earnings, is a
significant and worthwhile step. The
Commission is optimistic that a consequence of that focus will be more
thought, experimentation, and timely
action in achieving improvements in
financial reporting.
A major element of the conceptual
framework should be to rethink the objectives of the primary financial statements-and, therefore, to rethink what
type of information should be included
and what information should be presented outside the financial statements. Ideally, the most relevant information would be a projection of cash
flows for future periods. However, such
information may be highly uncertain
and surrogates may have to be used.
The decision as to what that relevant
information is and whether it should be
included in the primary financial statements will be influenced by its measurability. The August 9,1979 exposure
draft of the FASS on qualitative characteristics, "Qualitative Characteristics: Criteria for Selecting and EvaluatIng Financial
Accounting
and
Reporting Policies," addresses this is-

sue. The factors involved in the tradeoff between reliability and relevance are
the key to developing guidelines for the
type of information that should be included in financial statements. Further
clarification of this issue is necessary
before display issues, such as the reporting of earnings, can finally be resolved. Additionally, the development
of the recognition criteria phase of the
conceptual framework project will be
critical to the FASS in its search for a
definition of "earnings." It is expected
that the FASS will give appropriate attention and priority to these important
issues.
The current status of financial reporting of oil and gas producing companies reflects the nature of these issues. The Commission's efforts to
develop a more useful method of accounting would benefit from the existence of a conceptual framework. It
should be recognized that in developing the concept of reserve recognition
accounting, the Commission, will, of
necessity, have to deal with issues relating to the conceptual framework if
they have not, by then, been resolved.
Accounting For the Effects of ChangCommission believes
that the FASS's requirement
that
large, publicly-held enterprises disclose certain effects of general inflation and of price changes in specific
goods and services is a positive development in providing useful information. Accounting for the effects of inflation and changing prices is one of
the most important issues facing the
FASS, the profession, the business
community and the general public.
Conflicting reports of record profits on
the one hand and inadequate earnings
to maintain and expand capacity on
the other, serve only to confuse the issue. Further, they raise questions
about the integrity of financial reporting. The basic question in a period of
inflation and changing prices is how

ing Prices-The

29

best to report the effects of all economic events, and not only the effects
of transactions with outside parties. If
the objective is to measure only the
general impact of inflation on business
entities, then a general purchasing
power or constant dollar approach
might suffice. However, that approach
may not, and often does not, adequately portray the specific effects of
price changes on companies or industries. Therefore, it does not adequately
assist investors in assessing or projecting future cash flows or dividend paying capacity-important
objectives of
financial reporting as set forth in FAC
No.1. The Commission remains fully
committed to ensuring that users receive adequate information about the
impact of changing prices on corporate earnings and assets.
The Commission recognizes that the
effectiveness of the FASB's new standard will depend, in large part, on the
efforts of the accounting profession
and the corporate community in applying the standard, and evaluating and
providing additional disclosures which
may help users assess the impact of
changing prices on particular business
entities and industries. With respect
thereto, the new standard should be
viewed as a requirement for the minimum information to be presented to
investors-an area where the corporate community must make a positive
contribution to the standard setting
process by volunteering additional information necessary to make the reporting more useful and meaningful in
the particular corporate circumstances.
Last year, the Commission determined to delay reexamination and expansion of its replacement cost rule,
adopted In Accounting Series Release
No. 190, so as not to conflict with the
FASB's consideration of these issues.
Based on its evaluation of the FASB
statement, the Commission staff in-

30

tends to recommend that the Commission take action to delete the requirement for reporting replacement cost
information once the disclosure requirements of the FASB statement are
fully effective. (On October 24, 1979,
the Commission adopted the staffs
recommendation and determined to
delete the disclosure required by ASR
190 once the requirements of FAS 33
become fully effective.)

Reporting on Internal Accounting
Control-Since
the disclosure in the
1970's of widespread questionable or
illegal corporate payments and enactment of the Foreign Corrupt Practices
Act of 1977, there has been increasing
attention to, and interest in, the effectiveness of internal accounting controls. The accounting profession, both
institutionally through the AICPA's
Special Advisory Committee on Internal Accounting Control and individually by many accounting firms, has
responded to the need for guidance in
evaluating systems of internal accounting control, and the AICPA's
Auditing Standards Board is developing standards for public reporting on
internal accounting control.
In April 1979, the Commission proposed for comment rules which would
require inclusion of a statement by
management on internal accounting
control in annual reports on Form 10K filed with the Commission under the
Exchange Act, and in annual reports to
security holders furnished pursuant to
the proxy rules. The rules, if adopted,
would also require that such statement
of management be examined and reported on by an independent public
accountant. The Commission believes
that information regarding the effectiveness of an issuer's system of internal accounting control may be necessary to enable investors to better
evaluate management's performance
of its stewardship responsibilities and
the reliability of interim financial state-

ments and other unaudited financial
information generated from the accounting system.
At the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission was reviewing the large
number of comments received on the
proposed rules.
Unaudited Interim Financial Information-Since the issuance of Statement
of Auditing Standards No. 24 (SAS No.
24) by the Auditing Standards Board of
The American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants (AICPA) in March
1979, several reports by independent
accountants on Interim unaudited financial information
have been included in Securities Act filings on
Form S-16 or S-14. Such filings have
raised a question as to whether accountants could be liable under Section 11(a) of the Securities Act (which
imposes liability on every accountant

"who has with his consent been named
as having prepared ... any report") in
such circumstances. On September
20, 1979, the Commission proposed
for comment two alternative rules»
either of which, if adopted, would have
the effect of excluding accountants issuing such reports from Section 11(a)
liability. In encouraging reviews by
auditors of interim financial information, the Commission has noted that
"the involvement of independent accounts will add the expertise of professional accountants with wide experience in reporting problems ....
This
should improve individual company
reporting and direct greater professional attention to the general problems of interim reporting."92 (On December 28, 1979, the Commission
adopted a rule having the effect of excluding accountants issuing SAS No.
24 reports from Section 11(a) liability.)

Investment Companies and Advisors

The Investment
Study

Company Act

The Investment Company Act special study group which was established
at the end of the last fiscal year by the
Division of Investment Management
(the Division), continued its comprehensive review of the Investment Company Act of 1940 and the rules, regulations and administrative practices
under it with the aim of simplifying, to
the extent practicable, the regulation of
investment companies, especially by
eliminating unreasonably burdensome
regulations. The guiding principal of
this effort is that whenever possible,
and subject to safeguards necessary
for the protection of investors, investment companies and their managers
should have responsibility for management decisions. Accordingly, the Investment Company Act Study (the
Study) has sought to lessen the instances in which the staff of the Commission need participate in the decision-making process by (1) replacing
administrative review of proposed investment company activities with rules
establishing general criteria under
which the activities are permissible;
and (2) refining the Investment Company Act's sometimes sweeping statutory prohibitions so as to permit activity not originally contemplated as
being within a provision's technical
scope or underlying purpose.
The linchpin of the program is
enhancement of the authority and responsibility of investment company
directors, particularly disinterested directors, as primary overseers of man-

agement decisions. This greater reliance on directors, in many instances,
permits the withdrawal of the staff as an
active participant in certain management decisions while enabling the Commission to preserve, through its compliance and enforcement program an
active oversight capability.
Consistent with the goal of greater
director responsibility and reduced
staff participation in management decisions, the Commission, during the
fiscal year, adopted several rules which
permit certain transactions between an
investment company and its affiliated
person with regard to: (l) joint purchase of liability insurance pollcles:»
(2) the receipt of cash or securities pursuant to a portfolio company's plan of
reorganization;94 (3) the purchase of securities from an affiliated underwriting
syndlcate:» (4) certain purchase, sale
or lending transactions between affiliated perties.w and (5) the receipt of
stock exchange commissions by affiliated brokers.w During that period, the
Commission also adopted rules (l) providing unit investment trusts with startup exemptions from the Investment
Company Act's requirements regarding minimum net worth, frequency of
capital gains distribution, and forward
pricing; 98 and (2) providing increased
flexibility in determining when an investment company must price an investment company's redeemable securltres.» The Commission also proposed rules to ease problems arising
when certain contracts for investment
advisory or principal
underwriting
services are terminated. 100

33

In addition, for several years the
Commission has been considering
whether mutual funds (open.end man.
agement
investment
companies)
should be permitted to finance distribution of their own shares. The Commission has been reluctant to permit
funds to incur distribution expenses
because of doubts about (1) whether
funds benefit from sales of their shares;
(2) whether funds' investment advisers'
conflicts of interest could be regulated
adequately; and (3) whether it would be
fair to existing shareholders for funds to
undertake such expenses. After reconsidering the matter in light of the objectives of the Study, the Commission on
September 7, 1979, published for comment Rule 12b-1 under the Investment
Company Act and certain related
rules.v» If adopted, Rule 12b.1 would
permit use of fund assets for distribution if approved by shareholders, the
board of directors as a whole, and the
disinterested directors. The proposed
rule contains conditions intended to increase the independence of the disinterested directors and ensure that the
directors permit such a use of fund assets only after considering all pertinent
facts and concluding that financial distribution would be likely to benefit the
fund and its shareholders.

Disclosure Study
In addition to the foregoing review
of the investment company regulatory
system, the Division established another study group to undertake a thorough review of investment company
disclosure requirements under the Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act)
and the Investment Company Act. The
new disclosure study will explore ways
to reduce unnecessary burdens on
both the industry and the staff which
result from present disclosure requirements. Initially, the study group will
undertake two major projects: a review

34

of current procedures for processing
post-effective amendments to registration statements, which form the bulk
of the Division's workload in the disclosure area; and a review of ways to
eliminate duplicative
reporting requirements in documents transmitted
to investment company shareholders.

Investment

Company Advertising

During the fiscal year, the Commission took several actions to reduce restrictions applicable to the promotion
and sale of investment company shares
without diminishing essential investor
protections. On March 8, 1979, the
Commission withdrew its Statement of
Policy on Investment Company Sales
Llterature.w- The Statement of Policy,
which had been in effect since 1950,
was a lengthy document detailing types
of representations which would or
would not be considered misleading in
investment company sales literature.
By its specificity, the Statement of Policy tended to induce conformity to prescribed formats. The result may have
been to limit innovations unduly and,
at the same time, insulate sales literature, which complied mechanically
with the Statement of Policy, but was
used in a misleading way. At the same
time that it withdrew the Statement of
Policy, the Commission proposed for
comment Rule 156 under the Securities Act, an interpretive rule which
briefly and in relatively general terms
highlighted what experience has suggested are problem areas in investment company sales Htereture.ws
(Subsequent to the end of the fiscal
year on October 24, 1979, the Commission
adopted
Rule
156 as
revised.104)
On August 31, 1979, the Commission adopted Rule 434d under the Securities ActIO' which, in effect, permits
investment companies to include far
more information in mass media advertisements. In the past, investment com-

panies, like other issuers, have been restricted to so-called "tombstone ads"
which may contain only relatively limited information about the security and
the issuer. However, Rule 434d permits
advertisements to include any information which is taken from or which
fairly summarizes the full statutory
prospectus. The rule should permit investment companies to more effectively communicate important facts,
such as performance data, to investors.
At the same time, in order to protect
investors from misleading statements,
Rule 434d advertisements would be
subject to some of the liability provisions of the Securities Act applicable
to prospectuses.

Institutional

Disclosure Program

Beginning on February 14, 1979,
more than 650 major institutional investment managers began filing quarterly reports on Form 13F reporting to
the Commission on their significant
equity holdings pursuant to Rule 13f-1
under Section 13(f) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934. These reports
are transferred to the Commission's
Public Reference Room as promptly as
reasonably possible after filing, and
are normally available to the public
within a day to two after they are filed.
The tabulations of the data on Forms
13F, required by Section 13(f)(3), are
done by an independent contractor selected through the competitive bidding
process. The contractor is required to
make a variety of specified tabulations
available to the public at reasonable
prices within 10 days after receipt of
the reports. Since the contractor provides its services without charge to the
Commission, the only material costs to
the Commission of administrating the
program are in staff time. The Commission's various responsibilities are
carried out in several different offices
and Divisions, making it difficult to be
certain how much staff time is devoted

to the program, but it is probably on
the order of two to four man years.
Because the program is in its first
year of operation and the Commission
has only limited resources to devote to
its operation, the staff and the Commission have, so far, been concerned
with resolving technical problems with
Form 13F, interpretive questions, and
collateral issues such as confidential
treatment. No attempt has yet been
made to analyze or otherwise use the
information which has been filed. After
receiving public comment, the Commission decided that it would be unduly burdensome to require reports in
machine readable form since managers use a variety of computer systems and some compile reports manually. The independent contractor

Office of Investment
Regulation

Adviser

The Office was established within
the Division of Investment Management in October 1978. The Office was
created in recognition of the need to
reevaluate the Commission's advisory
regulatory program in light of the dramatic growth in the advisory industry
and the developments in the kinds of
advisory services provided by investment advisers.
The Commission, in January 1979,
adopted new investment adviser requirements concerning disclosure, recordkeeping, applications for registration and annual filings.'06 These requirements include: (1) adoption of a
new disclosure rule (Brochure Rule) under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940
(Investment Advisers Act) (2) amendment of two rules under the Investment
Advisers Act relating to recordkeeping
and amendments to the investment adviser registration form; (3) adoption of
a new annual report form for invest-

35

ment advisers; (4) revision of certain
schedules used by investment advisers
and broker-dealers in connection with
the respective registration forms for
such persons. Concurrently with the
adoption of the above rules and forms,
the Commission amended a rule and
certain forms to require disclosure of
brokerage placement practices.w? A
similar disclosure requirement is imposed on investment advisers as part
of the Brochure Rule. Taken together,
these actions will result in the Commission and the public being apprised
of a great deal of material information
about investment advisers which was
not previously disclosed in any systematic way.
In other significant rulemakings, in
July 1979, the Commission adopted
new requirements under the Investment Advisers Act governing the payment of cash referral fees by investment advisers.ws The adoption of the

36

new rule makes it unlawful, except under specified circumstances and subject to certain conditions, for an investment adviser to make a cash
payment to a person ("solicitor") who
directly or indirectly solicits any client
for, or refers any client to, an investment adviser. In addition, in June
1979, the Commission issued for public
comment a proposed rule under the Investment Advisers Act which would
permit certain registered investment
advisers to business development companies (asdefined in the rule) to be compensated on the basis of a share of net
capital gains upon, or net capital appreciation of, the funds, or any portion of
the funds of the business development
company. 109 Such means of compensation is currently prohibited by the Investment Advisers Act. At the close of
the fiscal year, the staff was reconsidering the proposed rule in light of the
comments received.

Enforcement Program

The Commission's enforcement program is designed to secure as broad a
regulatory impact as possible with the
limited resources available. To this
end, the Commission relies heavily
upon private civil damage actions,
Federal securities laws, and upon self
regulatory and state and local law enforcement agencies. With respect to
those agencies, the Commission devotes substantial efforts towards promoting the effective coordination of
enforcement activities. In this manner,
the Commission seeks to make maximum effective use of available resources in order to obtain an increased
enforcement
presence concerning
matters within its jurisdiction.
The cases described here reflect the
breadth of the Commission's responsibilities
and its enforcement
responses, and the continued vigor and
effectiveness of the enforcement program.

Sanctions and Remedies
The Federal securities laws provide
administrative, civil and criminal remedies for violations of those laws. Sanctions in administrative proceedings for
those subject to the Commission's regulatory jurisdiction may range from
the imposition of a censure to the barring of a securities professional from
the profession. The civil court remedy
usually available to the Commission is
court entry of an injunction barring further violations. The courts often enter
orders providing for appropriate additional relief. Criminal sanctions pro-

vided by the Federal securities laws include fines and imprisonment.
The Federal securities laws are primarily remedial in nature. In recognition of that purpose, in the litigation
and settlement of its proceedings the
Commission makes every attempt to
prevent a recurrence of violative activity and to rectify the result of past violations. The Commission has been
particularly successful in securing appropriate relief in injunctive actions
and during fiscal year 1979 such relief
included, in one case, an order requiring the defendant to return $30 million
alleged to have been wrongfully obtainedllo; the appointment of individuals or committees for the purpose of
conducting further investigations and
reporting publicly the results'»: the appointment to boards of directors of
persons previously unaffiliated with
the corporatlonu-: restrictions on the
future employment of defendants as
officers or directors of publicly-held
cornpaniesus: limitations upon the voting of securitles->: the return to publicly-held corporations of monies improperly obtained by insldersr»: and
the appointment of an independent
master to oversee the operations of a
corporatlon'>.
In the majority of its cases, the Commission is able to settle with respondents or defendants on terms which secure the necessary remedial relief.
Generally, respondents or defendants
who consent to such settlements with
the Commission do so without admitting or denying the factual allegations
contained in the Commission's com-

37

plaint or order for proceedings. Thus,
unless otherwise noted, in the discussion of cases which follows, it should
be assumed that settlements achieved
were upon that basis.

Energy-Related

Cases

Due to the tax consequences of investments in certain energy-related
products, particularly oil and gas, and
the inherent attraction of such investments to investors, the Commission
has long had to devote enforcement
resources to the control of fraudulent
offerings in this field. With the advent
of the nation's energy crisis, fraudulent
offerings (and the Commission's response to them) have intensified.
Investors in these offerings are often
initially contacted as part of a nationwide, long-distance telephone solicitation campaign by salesmen.u? These
campaigns are typified by offerings
which fail to comply with the registration requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933 (Securities Act) and by the
making fraudulent
statements to
investors to induce them to invest in
the offering. Investors are often persuaded to make their investments on
the basis of false statements or omissions concerning, among other things,
the funding of the entity in which the
investment is made and the use of the
investors' funds derived from the offeringliS; the risks associated with the investrnentus: the experience of the issuers' pr incipalsw'; and the use of
special accounts in which investors'
funds would, purportedly, be placed
for protectionw, One of the major inducements to investors is the purported availability of special tax benefits. 122
SEC v. Atlas 011Exploration. Inc. 123_
On July 12, 1979, the Commission filed
a civil injunctive action against Atlas
Oil Exploration, Inc. (Atlas) and a number of other entities and individuals re-

38

lated to it. The Commission's complaint alleged that, in connection with
the offer and sale of approximately $3
million in unregistered fractional undivided working interests in oil and gas
leases, the defendants made a number
of untrue statements of material facts
concerning, among other things: (1)
the use of "special escrow" or "trust"
acounts for the protection of investors;
(2) that investors could recover their
investments in 1-'/2-2 years; (3) the experience of the driller of oil wells; (4)
that state securities commissioners
were receptive to Atlas' "openness and
full disclosure"; and (5) that wells
drilled would produce on the average
of ten barrels of oil a day per well. The
complaint also alleged that the defendants omitted to state material facts
concerning, among other matters: (1)
the entry of cease and desist orders in
seven states prohibiting the sale of Atlas securities; (2) the misuse of at least
$275,000 of the proceeds of the offerings; (3) that wells in the field where
the subject wells were to be drilled
were averaging less than one barrel of
oil per day per well; (4) that, based
upon the experience with production
of initial wells drilled by Atlas, investors could not recover their investment
in less than eight years; and, (5) that,
prior to their involvement with Atlas,
the oil well driller had drilled only 12
wells and the experience of the president and controlling shareholder of
Atlas was as a salesman with a com.
pany that had been enjoined in an action previously brought by the Commission. Additionally, in connection
with one of the offerings involved, the
complaint alleged the failure to disclose (1) contingencies in securities
gas pipeline connections; (2) that the
proceeds of the offering would be commingled; and (3) that 22 percent of the
total proceeds of the offering would be
paid to the president and a vice president of a related corporation.

Several of the issuers named as defendants in the Commission's action
consented to the entry of final judgments of permanent injunction. The defendants were enjoined from further violations
of the registration
and
antifraud provisions of the Securities
Act and the antifraud provisions of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange Act). Individual defendants
consented to the entry of permanent injunctions enjoining them from further
violations of the antifraud provisions
of the Federal securities laws. Additionally, another corporation and its
principal officers and directors were
enjoined from further violations of the
antifraud provisions of the Federal securities laws and the defendant officers and directors were ordered to file
with the court an accounting setting
forth the receipts and disbursements
of five of the corporation's offerings.
SEC v. Advanced Fuel Systems,
Inc.124-On
December 6, 1978, the
Commission filed a complaint against
Advanced Fuel Systems, Inc. (AFSI)
and an individual. The complaint alleged violations of the registration provisions of the Securities Act and certain of the antifraud provisions of the
Federal securities laws based on untrue statements of material fact and
omissions to state material facts to
investors including: (1) that $1 million
had been committed to AFSI for research and development of a fuel system when in fact less than $145,000
was available; (2) information that an
"international financier" was backing
the corporation with "unlimited funds"
when no such backing existed; (3)
omitting to disclose to investors the
dilution effect of previous stock splits
benefiting insiders; (4) failure to follow
generally accepted accounting principles when valuing a licensing agreement in financial statements. resulting
in an over evaluation of the agreement
by about 500 percent; (5) claiming the

availability of special tax benefits when
not available; (6) representations that
the fuel system would yield 100 miles
per gallon for automobiles when it was
known that that was not true; (7) omitting to disclose that claims of 66.8
miles per gallon in certain tests were
based on unsophisticated, nonscientific, nonverifiable and widely varying
test results; (8) representations regarding the cost of the finished product
when no facts were available to support any cost prediction; and, (9) omissions to disclose that funds from the
securities sales would be paid to the
individual.
The defendants consented to the entry of judgments of permanent injunction enjoining them from further violations of the registration and antifrauc
provisions of the Federal securities
laws. The order of the court also requires the defendants to provide a
copy of the ascertainable investors in
AFSI.

Questionable

Payments

The Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of
1977 [Sections 13(b)(2), 30A and 31(c)
of the Exchange Act] (Foreign Corrupt
Practices Act) was signed into law in
December 1977. That Act prohibits issuers from, among other things, corruptly making payments to officials of
foreign governments in order to induce
such officials to use either their authority or influence to obtain business
for the issuer in that country. Among
other things, the Act also requires corporations to maintain systems of internal accounting controls which provide
reasonable assurance that certain objectives are met.
Disclosures of unethical and illegal
corporate activity resulting in part
from the Commission's enforcement
activities contributed to Congress' enactment of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. During the past year, the
Commission's enforcement interests in

39

this area continued and three of the important cases brought are described in
the following summaries.
SEC v. Hospital Corporation of Amer-

ica (HCA)12l- The Commission's complaint in the HCA case alleged violations of the antifraud provisions of the
Securities Act and the antifraud, reo
porting, and proxy provisions of the
Exchange Act in connection with disclosures regarding a contract for the
management of a hospital in Saudi
Arabia. The complaint alleged that,
prior to entering into the contract,
HCA was informed of facts which indicated that payments to persons of
power and influence in Saudi Arabia
would have to be made by HCA in connection with the contract. The complaint further alleged that a Liechtenstein entity which received a total of
$3.393 million from HCA, purportedly
for consulting and other services, was
merely a conduit for the improper payments. The Commission's complaint
also alleged that HCA made false and
misleading statements in registration
statements,
proxy statements,
and
other public documents filed with the
Commission and in connection with
statements made to the staff of the
Commission during an informal inquiry.
HCA consented to the entry of a final
judgment of permanent
injunction
from violations of the antifraud provisions of the Securities Act and the antifraud, reporting, and proxy provisions
of the Exchange Act. In addition to the
injunctive relief the terms of the settlement provide that HCA's audit committee, acting with the assistance of its
counsel and its independent auditors,
will conduct a review of prior investigations by HCA of (1) direct or indirect
payments, if any, to agents, employees, or officials of foreign and domestic governments and of foreign domestic customers during a five year period
and (2) of the accuracy of HCA's books
40

and records as to the foregoing. HCA's
audit committee will prepare a written
report containing its findings and recommendations and any action taken
by HCA in response to the report will
be described in a current report filed
with the Commission.
SEC v. Schenley

Industries,

Inc.

(Schenley)126- This case involved allegations that Schenley had expended
at least $6 million by granting illegal
discounts, in the form of cash, credit,
free merchandise or other things of
value to selected purchasers of Schenley's products in violation of state liquor
regulations. As a result, the complaint
alleged, Schenley had jeopardized its licenses to do business in the 35 states of
the United States in which Schenley operated as a producer, importer and
seller of alcoholic beverages. The Com.
mission's complaint alleged violations
of the antifraud provisions of the securities laws.
The defendants consented to the entry of final judgments of permanent injunction. As part of its consent, Schenley agreed to, among other things, the
appointment of a Special Agent to conduct an investigation of Schenley and
its subsidiaries and render a report to
the Court and to the Commission de.
tailing: (1) illegal political contrlbutions made by Schenley and its subsidiaries; (2) illegal foreign payments
made by Schenley and its subsidiaries
for the purpose of influencing any foreign government or official thereof or
evading the laws of a foreign sovereign; (3) illegal kickbacks, rebates, discounts, refunds, allowances , or other
expenditures made by Schenley and its
subsidiaries to induce the purchase of
Schenley products, and the approximate dollar amount expended to the
extent that these facts have not been
previously disclosed; and (4) pending
investigations by state or Federal governmental authorities regulating the

liquor industry which may result in the
commencement of legal proceedings.
In addition, Rapid-American agreed
to file with the Commission a current
report: (a) within 30 days after the entry of the final judgments, setting forth
all facts, known as of that date, concerning Schenley's practice of granting
illegal discounts to induce and promote the purchase of Schenley products; and (b) upon the filing of the Special Agent's report, setting forth all
material facts contained therein.
SEC v. International Systems and
Controls Corporetionm-s-uv this action,
the Commission filed a complaint
against International
Systems and
Controls Corporation (ISC) and certain
officers and directors seeking injunctive relief, appointment of a receiver
and other equitable relief.
The complaint alleged violations of
the antifraud, reporting and proxy provisions of the Federal securities laws as
well as violations of the accounting
provisions of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act. According to the complaint
the corporation made false and misleading disclosures or failed to disclose its commitments to pay a total of
$33 million, its payment of approximately $23 million in connection with
the securing or solicitation of business
in several foreign countries, its overstatement of its assets, earnings and
shareholders' equity. The complaint
further alleged that the corporation
failed to disclose that certain officers
were the prime beneficiaries of a deferred compensation plan and that corporate funds were used to purchase,
furnish and maintain a summer residence for the Chairman of the Board
of the firm.
The Commission simultaneously
filed with the complaint a motion for
a preliminary injunction against ISC
and for the appointment of a Special
Agent of the Court to take custody and
control of all assets of ISC; to oversee

the business activities of ISC to assure
that they are carried out for legitimate
purposes of ISC and not for the per.
sonal benefit of any control person,
officer, director or employee of ISC; to
determine whether ISC entered into
any transactions involving expenditure
of substantial funds or assetswhich appear not to have been engaged in for
legitimate business or are not adequately explained on ISC's books and
records; to recover any funds or assets
or enforce any liability to ISC; to oversee ISC's filings with the Commission;
and to authorize the agent to report his
findings to the Court within 60 days.

Government and Municipal
Securities
As indicated in last year's annual re-

port.w the trading of government and
municipal securities has increased significantly in recent years. Due to the
continuation of questionable issuing
and trading practices in this area, the
Commission's enforcement interest
has also continued.
In February 1979, the Commission
transmitted to Congress its Final Report In the Matter of Transactions in the
Securities of the City of New York, and
simultaneously announced its conclusion of the investigation in that matter.129 The investigation, one of the
largest of most complex in the Commission's history, dealt with events occurring during the period from October 1974 to April 1975 when the City
faced a fiscal crisis and issued large
amounts of short-term securities. The
Commission had previously issued a
detailed Staff Report which described
the events leading to the City's fiscal
crisis. no
The Final Report issued in February
called for legislative action to solve the
deficiencies in the issuance and mar.
keting of municipal securities and concluded that the Commission should de-

41

vote its efforts to support such legislative solutions. The Final Report
also stated the Commission's conclusion that no enforcement proceedings
should be instituted in the matter.
Among the factors cited in the Final
Report for the Commission's decision
were the issuance of the comprehensive Staff Report-»: the change in the
City's administration since the issuance of the Staff Report; various remedial actions taken by those who
were mentioned in the Staff Report,
most particularly by the City itself;
Congressional and state actions with
respect to New York City's financial
difficulties, including the Federal legislation enacted in August 1978 which
imposes certain financial controls over
the City and requires, among other
things, that the City's financial statements be audited; and, finally, the
Commission's determination that enforcement action would have limited
additional remedial value and would
require the commitment of substantial
additional resources which, in light of
the above, could otherwise be used
more efficiently in discharging the
Commission's responsibilities.
The Final Report focused attention
on the area of municipal accounting
and financial reporting and stated:
"The Commission believes that legislation designed to standardize the
methods used in the preparation of
municipal accounts and the form and
content of municipalities'
financial
statements should be accorded the
highest legislative authority."132
The University of Houston case-The
Commission continues to note instances of questionable practices in
connection with United States Government securities and related securities.
In this connection, of particular importance during fiscal year 1979 was the
Commission's so-called "University of
Houston" case.t» The case involved a
group consisting of an employee of the

42

University who was its government securities trader and various individuals
and securities firms. Securities involved in the case were government
securities (including so-called Ginnie
Mae's) and reverse repurchase agreements (a pledge of securities which
takes the form of a sale and buy-back
obligation).
The Commission alleged in its complaint that the University's employee
channelled securities transactions
through the securities firms and individuals who were defendants in the action,
to their benefit and to the University's
detriment. The complaint also alleged
that one of the securities firms involved
charged excessive fees to the University
and charged commissions to both sides
of transactions while purportedly acting
as a broker for the University. That firm
also allegedly agreed to execute transactions for the University at prices
away from the market and to "park"
government securities with the University. The complaint alleged that in the
event that the market price for securities increased, the securities were to be
sold back to the firm at the original
price. In addition, the complaint alleged that the firm, acting as a broker
or principal in trades with the University, engaged in trades covering approximately $318 million in securities
upon which the firm made profits or
commissions
of
approximately
$590,000.
The complaint also charged that another firm had defrauded the University
by charging excessive fees and by interpositioning with respect to $35 million
in government securities transactions
by the University. Over $130,000 in
commissions were generated by these
transactions.
Finally, the complaint alleged that
another firm was needlessly interpositioned with respect to the University's
trades in government securities to the
financial detriment of the University

and that excessive fees were charged
to the University in connection with reverse repurchase transactions. These
transactions were, allegedly, employed
by the University's employee as part of
an investment strategy whereby government securities were pledged in
connection with cash loans. The loans
were used in turn to purchase additional government securities. The firm
acted as a broker for the University in
trades involving about $1 billion in reverse repurchases and about $73 million in government securities transactions. The case resulted in the issuance
of injunctions against the principal defendants as well as a criminal proceeding in which they were found guilty and
sentenced to four years in prlson.i»

Industrial Development
Revenue
Bonds-A
persistent concern of the
Commission in the area of government
securities has been abuses in the offer
and sale of industrial development revenue bonds. These securities generally
are issued by municipalities to obtain
funds to erect industrial facilities which
are then leased to private corporations
for business use. Principal and interest
on the bonds is paid only with revenues
of the private corporation.
Industrial revenue bonds, though
subject to the antifraud provisions of
the Federal securities laws, are exempt
from the registration requirements of
those laws.
The Commission's Staff Report On
Transactions In the Marine Protein Cor-

poration Industrial Development Revenue Bonds is illustrative of the types of
concerns arising in this area.m The
staff report details an unusually instructive situation involving a corporation which had sold stock to the public in an offering registered with the
Commission and, shortly thereafter,
also participated in an offering of industrial revenue bonds which were issued for the purpose of providing
funds to construct facilities for the cor-

poration. The staff report discussed
disclosures made in the prosepctus for
the registered stock offering and compared them with disclosures in connection with the industrial development
revenue bond offering. The staff report
concluded:
'", " [T]hat risk factors and other
important information relating to the
speculative nature of an investment in
Marine that were included in the common stock prospectus are absent from
the bond 'offering prospectus' and that
document contains considerable bullish promotional information that is inappropriate in a prospectus used to sell
securities."136
Other areas of questionable activities in connection with industrial revenue bonds which were the subject of
Commission action this year included
alleged situations where bonds were
sold prior to issuance, but after collecting the money from purchasers,
the promised bonds were not issued to
customers and, instead, the customers'
funds were converted to the promoter's
user»: nearly worthless bonds were
sold to investors at 94-98 percent of
face value138; principal and interest
payments were made from proceeds of
bond sales to conceal the fact that the
private corporation was not a going
concernus: and misleading quotations
were placed in interdealer quotations

rnedia'w
Options, Corporate Takeovers
and Tender Offers
During the fiscal year, the Commission brought a number of cases in situations where the investing public was
harmed as a result of practices by market professionals and others in connection with trading in options. Additionally, as the Commission noted in last
year's annual reportwr, the recent increase in the number of corporate
takeovers and tender offers has led to
an increasing number of Commission

43

enforcement actions in this area. In
this connection, the Commission has
brought an increasing number of cases
alleging insider trading based upon
material information regarding corporte takeovers and tender offers.
Options- The Commission's option
cases involved allegations that material
misstatements and omissions were
made to customers concerning, among
other things, the risks inherent in option trading strategiesl42; the potential
profits and rates of return involved in
options tradingI4'; and the suitability of
tradings strategies used for lnvestorsw.
In the Matter of Bear Stearns &
Co. 14'_ This case is illustrative of the
types of trading practices which the
Commission uncovered during the
course of its investigations this year. In
this case, the Commission's Order Instituting Proceedings and Imposing
Remedial Sanctions alleged that transactions executed in accounts as to
which discretionary authority existed
were excessive in size and frequency in
light of the financial resources and
character of the accounts and that, in
connection with options trading, mao
terial misstatements were made concerning the existence of margin accounts, the meaning and purpose of
margin call notices sent to customers,
the significance of the large number of
confirmations slips received by customers and the meaning and purpose
of correspondence sent to a customer
with regard to activity in the customer's account. Additionally, the Order alleged that transactions in customer accounts were effected which
were not authorized by the customers
including trading in the options market, trading on a principal basis, and
trading in a margin account. Finally,
the Order alleged that transactions in
customer accounts were effected in
unseasoned and speculative securities
in disregard of or without inquiry regarding the suitability of the securities

44

to individual customer needs, circumstances or objectives.
SEC v. Santangelo & Co., 146_ This
was another significant action by the
Commission in the options area during
this year. The case involved fictitious
reports of options transactions on the
New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and
the American Stock Exchange (Amex).
Specifically, the Commission's com.
plaint alleged that in varying periods
in 1974, 1975, and 1976, hundreds of
transactions in options were printed on
the stock and options tape of the Amex
when in fact no transactions had occurred. Additionally, the complaint alleged that during 1976 transactions in
stocks which should have been reported on the tape of the NYSE as single transactions were reported as several transactions.
The complaint
further alleged that various of the defendants, either as specialists on the
subject exchanges or otherwise, either
caused a substantial number of such
erroneous reports or had reason to
know that those reports were being
printed and failed to take reasonable
and appropriate steps to prevent such
reports from being made.
Tender Offers-The
Commission's
actions in the area of tender offers during the past year involved situations
where the Commission alleged that materially false and misleading statements
were made to investors concerning,
among other matters, the purposes of
the tender offer-v: financing arrangements with respect to the tender
offerl48, and the intentions of the tender
offerorl49•
The defendants, two broker-dealers
registered with the Commission and
partners of each firm, consented to the
entry of judgments of permanent in.
junction enjoining them from violating
the antifraud provision of the Exchange
Act.
SEC v. BOC International Limitedvw-«
This was one of the more significant

Commission actions brought in the
tender offer area during the past year. In
this case, the Commission filed a complaint seeking injunctive relief against
International Limited (SOC) a
United Kingdom corporation and its
wholly-owned subsidiary, SOC Financial Corporation (SOCF), a Delaware
corporation. The complaint alleged
that the defendants violated the tender
offer and reporting provisions of the Exchange Act in connection with SOC's
tender offer for shares of Airco Inc.
(Airco).

aoc

According
to the Commission's
complaint, SOC and Airco entered into
a series of agreements governing potential tender offers by one firm for the
securities of the other. Pursuant to
these agreements, SOC acquired a 34
percent interest in Airco and subsequently increased that interest to 49
percent. The latter tender offer was
oversubscribed. SOC subsequently announced a tender offer for all Airco
shares at the same price as the previous offer. Pursuant to their agreement, Airco disapproved the tender
offer for the remaining outstanding
shares based upon the inadequacy of
the price and sued SOC to rescind the
offer. SOC withdrew the offer for all
outstanding shares but pursuant to a
prior agreement purchased an additional 6 percent of Airco. The latter
purchases were designed to frustrate
any competing offers for Airco and to
avoid entering a bidding contest for
Airco. Subsequently, Airco announced
an agreement in principle for a takeover of Airco by a third company at
$50 per share. Shortly after this announcement,
SOC and Airco announced a settlement of their action,
offered an adpursuant to which
ditional $7 to all those who tendered
their shares in the offer that resulted in
SOC's obtaining the additional 15 percent of Airco, and agreed to make a

aoc

$50 offer for all remaining Airco
shares.
The Commission, in its complaint,
charged that SOC Ltd. violated the
antifraud provisions of the secunties
laws in that the tender offer materials
failed to disclose that in obtaining a
loan for the second tender offer, SOC
sought sufficient funds to acquire additional shares, that SOC's agreement
with its investment banker Included an
additional $1.5 million fee if SOC acquired 100 percent of Airco, and that
Airco's investment banker had formed
an opinion that a fair price for Airco
shares was $50-$55 per share. The
complaint also charged that SOC
failed to amend its statement filed with
the Commission with respect to its
holding of Airco shares on a timely basis and, when it did so, failed to disclose the purpose of its acquisitions
and subsequent action.
SOC consented to the entry of an injunction requiring compliance with the
tender offer and reporting provisions
of the Federal securities laws. SOC
also agreed to pay $2.75 million to certain individuals who tendered Airco
stock and to keep open the $7 offer to
Airco shareholders who tendered their
stock

SEC v. Sun Company, Inc.-In last
year's annual report, the Commission
noted the Sun case as one of its important actions in the tender offer
area.!» That case involved, among
other things, a Commission allegation
that the acquisition of approximately
34 percent of the outstanding common
stock of a publicly-held corporation by
means of an offer to certain institutional investors which was not made
available to the general public nevertheless constituted a tender offer. On
July 9, 1979 the United States District
Court for the Southern District of New
York rendered an opinion which found
that, indeed, that acquisition consti45

tuted a tender offer and was, accordingly, made in violation of the tender
offer provisions of the Exchange
Act.'"
Insider Trading-Among
the Commission's actions in the insider trading
area during the last year, one of the
more important was In the Matter of
Oppenheimer [; Co. 1B The Commission
instituted proceedings in this matter to
determine whether Oppenheimer &
Co., Inc. (Oppenheimer), a registered
broker-dealer, failed to supervise Ira J.
Hechler (Hechler), a person subject to
its supervision with a view to prevent.
ing violations of the antifraud provisions of the Exchange Act.
Accordlnq to the Commission's Order Instituting Proceedings Hechler
was retained by Oppenheimer as a con.
sultant for special acquisitions. Hechler occupied offices at Oppenheimer
and utilized their facilities. Transactions proposed and the companies recommended by Hechler as potential
subjects for special acquisitions were
reviewed by senior principals of Oppenheimer.
In his capacity as a consultant
for special acquisitions, Hechler researched and investigated publiclyheld companies for sale of assets transactions and often engaged in the negotiations involved in such transactions. As result of these activities,
Hechler obtained material non-public
information concerning the companies
involved in such transactions as well as
the likelihood that the sale of assets
transactions would be consummated.
Specifically, Hechler knew that if the
transactions were consummated a
company involved in the transaction
would make a tender offer at substantial premiums above then prevailing
market prices.
The Commission determined that
Oppenheimer failed to reasonably supervise Hechler and thereby prevent
violations of the antifraud provisions.

46

Pursuant to an offer of settlement, Oppenheimer was censured and agreed to
comply with certain undertakings. The
undertakings included among other
things, (1) that Oppenheimer would
obtain a written agreement from Hechler that neither he nor members of his
immediate household will maintain
any accounts with any other brokerdealer, (2) that as long as he is associated with Oppenheimer neither he
nor his immediate family will trade in
the stock of any company he is considering as a potential participant in a sale
of assets transaction without obtaining
prior written approval which Oppenheimer will not give unless the trading
is not based upon non-public information, and (3) that as long as Hechler
is associated with Oppenheimer he will
make all disclosures and reports that
Oppenheimer's
employees are required to make in accordance with Oppenheimer's regular compliance procedures.

Other Significant
Matters

Enforcement

In the Matter of United States Steel
Corporetioniw-« The Commission instituted proceedings in this matter to determine whether certain of the filings
of United States Steel Corporation
(USSC) made with the Commission
were deficient with respect to USSC's
policy concerning environmental regulation, its capital expenditure for
compliance with environmental control and its involvement in legal proceedings arising from its compliance
with environmental regulation.
In 1971, in recognition that environmental laws could have a material economic impact on corporations subject
to such environmental regulation, the
Commission issued a release informing registrants that disclosure of material environmental information i~c1uding environmental litigation and
the capital expenditure, earning pow-

ers, and business charge efforts in
connection with compliance with environmental
laws was required by
Commission rules.i» In 1973, the
Commission adopted specific environmental rules which required disclosure
of material effects that compliance
with environmental regulation might
have upon a Registrant's economic position and disclosure of any administrative or judicial proceedings known
to be contemplated by governmental
authorities concerning violations of
environmental requlatlons.vs
Subsequently, the Commission adopted a
rule requiring registrants to disclose
certain material estimated capital expenditures for environmental control
facilities.m
According to the Commission's Order Instituting Proceedings, USSC was
aware that compliance with environmental regulations would require sub.
stantial expenditures. USSC prepared
its own estimates as to the cost of compliance as regulations were proposed
and adopted. USSC, in its filings, set
forth amounts spent or authorized for
certain periods without disclosing that
it had developed estimates of costs for
additional years, which costs would involve material capital expenditures.
USSC disclosed pending judicial proceedings, but failed to disclose exist.
ing administrative proceedings. Additionally, USSC stated in its filings that
it intended to resolve its environmental
problems. In fact, USSC pursued an
environmental policy of actively resisting environmental requirements
which it maintained were unreasonable. While the Commission's rules do
not require a disclosure of a general
corporate policy with respect to environmental regulation, if such a disclosure is made it must be accurate and
the disclosing corporation must make
any additional disclosures necessaryto
render the voluntary disclosure not
misleading. Also, if a corporation has

a policy toward compliance with environmental regulations which is reasonably likely to result in substantial potential fines or penalties, or other
significant effects on the corporation,
it may be necessary for the registrant
to disclose the magnitude of such
fines, penalties and other material off.
sets in order to prevent from being
misleading with regard to required dis.
closures concerning such matters as
descriptions or disclosures relating to
the corporation's business, financial
statements, capital expenditures for
environmental compliance or legal
proceedings. USSC did not make such
additional, necessary disclosures.
The Commission determined that
USSC's reports filed with the Commission for the years and interim periods
1973 to 1977 failed to comply with the
disclosure requirements of Section 13
of the Act and the applicable rules reo
lating to disclosures of environmental
matters. USSC submitted an Offer of
Settlement which the Commission determined to accept. The Commission's
Order required USSC to comply with
the undertakings set forth in its offer
of settlement which include, among
other things, that USSCwill, by various
means, provide notice to its stockholders of the existence of these proceedings and the Commission's Order, that
USSCwill amend its past filing with the
Commission concerning envlronrnental matters and that USSC will retain a
consultant to conduct a study for the
purpose of estimating potential costs
to USSC of complying with environmental regulations.
SEC v. Rapid American Corporationiw-« The Commission filed a civil
injunctive action against Rapid American Corporation (Rapid), its subsidiary
McCrory Corporation (McCrory), Kenton Corporation (Kenton) and Meshulam Riklis (Riklis), Rapid's Chairman of
the Board, alleging violations of the
reporting provisions of the Federal se-

47

curities laws. The complaint also alleges that Rapid, McCrory and Riklis
violated the proxy provisions and that
Riklis and Kenton violated the beneficial ownership reporting provisions of
the Federal securities laws.
According to the Commission's complaint, Rapid, McCrory and Kenton
failed to disclose that they entered into
agreements with and paid fees to persons who were either personal creditors
of Riklis or persons who had a personal
business relationship with Riklis. The
agreements and transactions in question were allegedly either negotiated
or approved by Riklis at a time when
he was in serious financial difficulty.
The complaint also alleged that Riklis
was in a conflict of interest position in
negotiating and approving transactions with persons with whom he had
personal business dealings and that
these conflicts were not disclosed to
the Boards of Directors of Rapid,
McCrory, Kenton, security holders or
the public.
The defendants consented to the entry of final judgments of permanent injunction enjoining them from violating
the provisions of the Federal securities
laws charged in the complaint. In addition to consenting to the entry of an
injunction, Rapid agreed to appoint
four persons who had no previous affiliation with Rapid to its board of directors, and to form and maintain for
five years a Transaction Review Committee, composed of the four new directors, to review transactions between
Rapid and its officers, directors and
control persons. McCrory agreed to
abide by the undertakings of Rapid,
while Kenton agreed to adopt similar
policies. Riklis agreed to abide by
the undertakings instituted by Rapid,
McCrory and Kenton.
SEC v. The Fundpeck, Inc. u9_ln this
case the Commission sought injunctive relief against a mutual fund complex, the- investment adviser to the

48

funds and its broker-dealer subsidiaries, and certain directors, officers
and employees of these entities. The
Commission's complaint alleged violations of the antifraud, registration,
reporting, proxy and fiduciary obligation provisions of the Federal securities laws.
The complaint alleged that the investment adviser, in disregard of the
interests of the mutual funds and their
shareholders and in order to increase
profits to the adviser, promoted an
investment arrangement known as
switching. The switching program permitted and encouraged the funds'
shareholders to transfer their investments among the funds immediately
upon the placing of a telephone order.
This program resulted in frequent fluctuations in the assets of the funds and,
accordingly, an extremely high portfolio turnover with an attendant increase in brokerage expenses most of
which were rebated to the investment
adviser.
The complaint also alleged that each
of the directors of the Fundpack, Inc.
(Fundpack), in breach of his fiduciary
duty involving personal misconduct,
favored the management of the funds
by acquiescing in this conduct and by
renewing the investment advisory contract. The complaint further alleged
that the directors failed to conduct inquiries and consider information necessary for them to evaluate the switching program and the self-dealing
transactions by the investment adviser.
The mutual funds consented to the
entry of an order directing the appointment of independent directors and
special counsel. This order concludes
the Commission's action against the
funds; the action against other corporate and individual defendants continues.
Pursuant to the Final Order, the
Funds are required to appoint and
thereafter nominate and recommend

for election to their respective boards
of directors four individuals satlsfactory to the Commission, and the funds
must maintain, until at least one year
after the next meeting of their shareholders, boards of directors not less
than 80 percent of whose members are
satisfactory to the Commission. The
newly constituted boards are required
to call meetings of the Funds' shareholders within six months, at which
time they must recommend to shareholders the election of the required
proportion of directors satisfactory to
the Commission and recommend arrangements for the future management and disposition of the funds.
In addition, the Final Order requires
that the Funds retain a Special Counsel
to advise them until after the aforementioned shareholders' meetings.
The Special Counsel must among
other things, (1) supervise the filing and dissemination of registration
statements, prospectuses, annual and
periodic reports and sales literature,
receipts and disbursements by the
Funds, portfolio
transactions
and
proxy solicitations; (2) consult with and
report to the Commission and the
Court; and (3) advise the Funds' boards
in their consideration of arrangements
for the future management and disposition of the Funds. After the perform.
ance of all of his duties, the Special
Counsel must submit a final report to
the Commission and the Court.
The Final Order also requires that
within 20 days, the Funds must report
to shareholders concerning the Commission's Complaint, the history of this
litigation, and the actions taken and to
be taken pursuant to the Final Order
and any other consents, undertakings,
agreements or orders entered in the
action.

SEC v. Starr Broadcasting Group,
Inc.l60-ln
February 1979, the Commission announced the filing of a complaint in the United States District of

Columbia against The Starr Broadcast.
ing Group, Inc. (SSG); William F. Buck.
ley Jr. (Buckley), formerly Chariman of
the Board of SBG; Peter H. Starr (Peter
Starr), formerly President and a director of SBG; Michael F. Starr (Michael
Starr), formerly Vice-President and a
director of SBG; Gordon M. Ryan
(Ryan), formerly General Counsel and
a director of SBG; Glenn E. Burrus
(Burrus), formerly a director of SBG;
Maurice L. McGill (McGill), formerly a
director of SBG; Mack H. Hannah, Jr.
(Hannah), a director of SBG; and Columbia Union National Bank & Trust
Company (Columbia Union), one of
SBG's lenders.
The Commission's
complaint alleged that certain of SBG's officers
directors, and others engaged in a five.
year course of business ultimately resulting in the purchase. by SBG of seventeen theatre properties (the Sitco
transaction) from Sitco, Ltd. (a partnership whose members were Buckley
Peter Starr, Michael Starr and Ryan) for
the purpose of extricating Buckley, Peter Starr, Michael Starr and Ryan from
a financial situation which would have
resulted in their personal bankruptcy;
that various filings of SBG failed to disclose or contained misleading disclosures with respect to the Sitco transaction: that SBG's outside directors,
after acting on behalf of SBG in approving the Sitco transaction, failed to
insure the accuracy of SBG's disclosures relating to this transaction; that
Burrus, as Columbia Union's senior
loan officer responsible for loans to
both SBG and Sitco, Ltd., was acting
in a manner which benefitted Columbia Union, to the detriment of SBG, by
approving the Sitco transaction, and
also failed to insure accurate disclosure of these matters.
Pursuant to the consents of the defendants, the Court enjoined SGB from
further violations of the reporting,
proxy, ownership reporting and margin

49

requirements provisions of the Federal
securities laws. Buckley, Michael Starr,
Peter Starr, Ryan, and Burrus, were en.
joined from violating the antifraud, reo
porting, proxy, ownership reporting,
and margin requirement provisions of
the Federal securities laws. Columbia
Union was enjoined from violations of
the reporting provisions of the Federal
securities laws. Smith, McGill, Francis
and Hannah were enjoined from fur.
ther violations
of the reporting,
ownership reporting and margin reo
quirement provisions of the Federal
securities laws.
In addition to the entry of the in.
junctions, certain other equitable relief
was ordered by the Court or under.
taken by the defendants, including an
order to make disgorgement and an
order compelling Buckley, Michael
Starr, Ryan and Burrus to comply with
their undertakings that none will seek
employment as an officer or director of
a publicly-traded corporation responsible for filings with the Commission
for a period of years.
SEC

v.

American

Financial

Corpora.

tion161- The Commission filed a com.
plaint seeking injunctive relief and
other equitable relief against American
Financial Corporation (AFC), Carl H.
Lindner (Lindner), President, Chairman
of the Board and controlling share.
holder of AFC, Charles H. Keating Jr.
(Keating) former Executive Vice-President and Director of AFC, and Donald
P. Klekamp (Klekamp) a former director of a subsidiary
of AFC. The
complaint alleged that the defendants
violated the antifraud, proxy and reo
porting provisions of the Federal securities laws.
According to the Commission's com.
plaint, Lindner and Keating caused, authorized or permitted a bank subsidiary

50

of AFC to extend substantial loans on
preferential terms to officers and dlrectors of AFC and to other persons associated with AFC, its subsidiaries, Lind.
ner or Keating. The complaint further
alleged that as the financial condition
of the borrowers deteriorated from
1973 through 1976 demands on the
prior loans were not made and new
loans were extended enabling the borrowers to pay interest on the prior
loans and service loans from other.
The complaint also alleged that
Lindner and Keating caused a subsldiary of AFC to advance funds to Klekarnp for the purchase of AFC stock on
the open market. The subsidiary failed
to disclose these loans in a registration
statement filed with the Commission.
While the subsidiary did disclose the
extension of such loans in its annual
report filed with the Commission, it
failed to disclose relevant facts and clrcumstances concerning the loans. AFC
and its subsidiary also made false reo
ports in filings with the Commission
concerning loans to Klekamp. The
complaint alleged numerous other vi.
olations concerning the extension of
loans by AFC subsidiaries.
The defendants consented to the en.
try of final judgments of permanent injunction enjoining them from further
violations of the antifraud, reporting
and proxy violations. Additionally, the
order consented to by the defendants
required AFC to establish and maintain an audit committee of its board of
directors consisting of at least two directors not having any previous business affiliations with AFC or its subsidiaries and to amend and correct its
prior filings with the Commission with
respect to matters alleged in the com.
plaint.

Programmatic Litigation and Legal Work

The Commission, through its Office
of the General Counsel, participates as
a party and as amicus in a substantial
amount of litigation in addition to its
enforcement actions. The results in
these suits often affect existing interpretations of the Federal securities
laws and/or the scope of the Commission's authority. The Office of the General Counsel is also involved in important non-Iitigatory work. The following
is a summary of some of the important
actions which were litigated in the past
year, and the status of other projects
of significance to the Commission and
the public.
Significant Court Actions
Touche Ross & Co., et al v. SECTouche Ross raised questions about
the Commission's power to regulate
the conduct of accountants and other
professionals who practice before it.
Rule 2(e) of the Commission's rules of
practice, first promulgated over 40
years ago, authorizes the Commission
to censure, suspend, or bar from Commission practice, professionals found
to have engaged in various unethical
or unlawful conduct. The rule reflects
the Commission's need to rely heavily
on the integrity of accountants and
other professionals who prepare and
certify the accuracy of corporate filings
vital to investors.
Pursuant to Rule 2(e), the Commission had instituted
proceedings
against Touche Ross and three of its
former partners. The order for proceedings alleged that in examining two
public companies, the accountants had

failed to follow generally accepted accounting standards and had no reasonable basis for their opinions regarding
the financial statements of these com.
panies. The respondents filed a district
court action attempting to halt the proceedings. They alleged that the Commission was without authority to
promulgate Rule 2(e), and had acted
"without authority of law" In instituting
the proceedings. On a motion from the
Commission, the district court dismissed the Touche Ross action, holding that the plantiffs had failed to exhaust their administrative remedies.
On appeal, the United States Court
of Appeals for the Second Circuit upheld the Commission's power to promulgate Rule 2(e). The Court first held
that the traditional exhaustion doctrine
did not apply where plaintiffs had challenged the agency's very authority to
promulgate the rule. In such cases, judicial review would not be enhanced
significantly by allowing the agency to
first develop the facts or apply its expertise. And, although the agency
could theoretically hold its own rule invalid, such a result was unlikely.
Turning to the merits, the Court held
that, the promulgation of Rule 2(e) was
valid as a "legitimate, reasonable and
direct adjunct to the Commission's explicit statutory power." The Court reasoned that a central purpose of the securities laws was the protection of
investors through the requirement that
issuing companies disclose fully to the
public information material to investment decision-making. The Commission, with its small staff, could not pos51

sibly review in detail each company's
financial statements; necessarily, then,
the Commission had to rely heavily on
both legal and accounting professionals to perform their tasks diligently
and responsibly. The Court concluded
that Rule 2(e) represents an attempt by
the Commission to protect the integrity of its most important processes,
and is therefore a valid exercise of
the Commission's general rulemaking
power.

SEC v. Aaron: SEC v. Coven-The
Aaron and Coven cases raised the important issue of whether the Commission must prove scienter in injunctive
actions brought under the antifraud
provisions of the Securities Act of
1933 (Securities Act) and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (Exchange
Act). In both cases, the United States
Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit held that scienter need not be
proved in such an action.
The Court of Appeals' holding in
Coven involved proceedings brought
under Section 17(a) of the Securities
Act. The Court noted that the language
of Section 17(a) does not indicate that
liability must be predicated in an intent
to manipulate, deceive or defraud, and
thus concluded that scienter is not an
element of a violation of that section.
The Court also stated that even negligent conduct is sufficient to impose liability upon an alleged aider and abettor who "should be able to conclude
that his act was likely to be used in issuance of the illegal activity ......
The
Supreme Court thereafter declined to
review the Court's decision in Coven.
In Aaron, the Court's holding involved injunctive proceedings under
both Section 17(a) of the Securities Act
and Section 1O(b)of the Exchange Act,
and Rule 10b.5 thereunder. Based on
its analysis of the language of Section
lO(b), the legislative history of the Exchange Act, the relationship between
Section 1O(b) and the express private

52

remedy provisrons of the securities
laws, and the effect of scienter standards on the overall enforcement
scheme contemplated by those statutes, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit rejected
Mr. Aaron's contention that the Supreme Court's decision in Emst & Emst
v. Hochfelder, 425 U.S. 185 (1976) in
which it was held that scienter is necessary in a private damage action under
Section 100b),compels the same result
in a Commission injunctive action. The
Court also rejected a scienter requirement for Commission injunctive actions brought under Section 17(a),
relying on its prior decision in Coven.
Mr. Aaron subsequently filed a petition
for certiorari in the Supreme Court.
The imposition of a scienter requirement in all Commission proceedings
brought to prevent recurrence of conduct that operates as fraud or deceit on
public investors, and the resulting difficulty in providing a defendant's state
of mind, would erode significantly the
Commission's ability to enforce the
Federal securities laws and deprive
investors of needed protections. Moreover, the question of whether scienter
is required in an injunctive proceeding
of Section 17(a) and Section 19(b) has
been and continues to be the subject
of substantial litigation. With respect
to Section lO(b), there has been great
uncertainty in the courts of appeals
and the district courts as to whether
scienter is an element.
Recognizing these factors, the Commission, in responding to Mr. Aaron's
petition for certiorari, has urged the
Supreme Court to grant the petition in
order to bring certainty to the administration of the Federal securities laws
and to conserve the resources now
being expended by courts and parties,
including the Commission, in litigating these issues. (The petition for certiorari was granted by the Supreme
Court on October 15. 1979.)

Burks v. Lasker-The issue raised in
Burks involved the extent to which
Federal policy, as articulated in the Investment Company Act of 1940 (Investment Company Act), limits the
power of directors of an investment
company to terminate derivative litigation brought by its shareholders.
Shareholders of an investment company registered under the Investment
Company Act sued the company's directors and its registered investment
adviser. The plaintiffs alleged that the
defendants had violated their duties
under the Investment Company Act
and the Investment Advisers Act in
connection with a purchase by the
company of Penn Central commercial
paper. The investment company's dis.
interested directors concluded that the
suit was contrary to the best interests
of the company and its shareholders
and moved the district court to dismiss
the action, which motion was granted.
The United States Court of Appeals
for the Second Circuit held that the Investment Company Act deprives independent directors of an investment
company of authority to terminate
nonfrivolous derivative litigation. The
Commission appeared amicus before
the Supreme Court, contending that
the Investment Company Act does permit investment company directors to
terminate such litigation, but only if
they are independent, fully informed,
and their decision is reasonable. The
Commission's primary purpose in participating was to persuade the Court
that consideration of State and Federal
law must be balanced and that Federal
law imposes a minimum standard on
directors' decisions to terminate derivative litigation, notwithstanding
any
lesser standard of State law.
The Supreme Court held that State
law governing the authority of independent directors to discontinue derivative suits should be applied to the extent State law is consistent with the

policies of the Investment Company
and Investment Advisers Acts. The
Court reasoned:
"Although [a] state statute cannot be
considered 'inconsistent' with federal
law merely because the statute causes
the plaintiff to lose the litigation ... ,
federal courts must be ever vigilant to
insure that application
of state law
poses no significant threat to any identifiable federal policy or interest. ...
"And, of course, this means that unreasonable ... or specific abberant or
hostile state rules ... will not be applied ....
The consistency test guarantees that [n]othing that the state can
do will be allowed to destroy the federal right ... , and yet relieves federal
courts of the necessity to fashion an
entire body of federal corporate law
out of whole cloth."
Accordingly, the Court remanded
the case so that the Court of Appeals
could determine the scope of directors'
authority under State law to terminate
derivative litigation, and determine
whether State law is consistent with the
policies of the Investment Company
Act and the Investment Advisers Act.
With respect to this latter inquiry, the
Supreme Court observed that there
may well be "situations in which the
independent directors could reasonably believe that the best interests of
the shareholders call for a decision not
to sue .... " The implication of this
language is that it would be inconsistent with Federal policies to give effect
to a board of directors' decision which
is unreasonable-a
pnnciple urged by
the Commission.
Ludlow Corporation v. SEC-In Ludlow, the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
Circuit affirmed
the order of the
Commission approving the application
of the Boston Stock Exchange (BSE)
for unlisted trading privileges in the
common stock of Ludlow Corporation
(Ludlow). Ludlow raised the issue of

53

whether an exchange, in applying for
unlisted trading privileges in a stock,
must demonstrate that active trading
in the stock will take place in Its market. In approving the BSE's unlisted
trading application, the Commission
rejected such a requirement, in keeping with the Commission's long-standing policy, endorsed by Congress, of
liberally granting unlisted trading privileges as a means of promoting competition among the nations securities
markets.
In affirming the Commission's order,
the Court of Appeals emphasized the
importance which Congress attached
to the liberal grant of unlisted trading
privileges as a means to foster competition among exchanges, and the
role which unlisted trading must play
in achieving the objectives of a national market system. In specific, the
Court also clarified that the Commission's grant of unlisted trading privileges does not require a determination
that an active market will develop on
the applicant exchange. Rather, an applicant need only show that if an active
trading should develop, it will proceed
in a fair and orderly manner. As a result of Ludlow, the Commission has received renewed support to pursue a liberal approach in granting unlisted
trading privileges, thereby enhancing
the Commission's ability to facilitate
intermarket competition in a national
market system.
Belenke v. SEC-In
Belenke, the
United States Court of Appeals for the
Seventh Circuit affirmed the Commission's order approving a proposed rule
change of the Chicago Board Options
Exchange (CBOE) to improve the
CBOE's system for handling and executing "limit" orders of public customers. "Limit" orders are those which
specify a minimum price at which a
customer is willing to sell, or alternatively, a maximum price at which a
customer is willing to buy a particular

54

security. Prior to the Commission's approval of the CBOE rule, members of
the CBOE were given exclusive appointments as board brokers to accept
limit orders in particular options from
other brokers on the floor, to store
those orders in limit order books, and
to assure timely execution of those orders when, and if, the prevailing market price matched the specified limit
order price. The CBOE rule eliminates
the system of exclusive appointment of
board brokers, and instead permits the
CBOE directly to provide limit order
book services through employees
known as "order book officials."
In its order approving the CBOE rule
pursuant to Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act, the Commission found
that the rule would further several
purposes of the Act-by improving the
efficiency of the CBOE's market, enhancing the floor surveillance capabilities of the CBOE, and fostering competition between the CBOE and other
options exchanges. The Court of Appeals, in affirming the Commission's
order in all respects, stressed that the
Commission's findings were predictive, policy-oriented
decisions, and
hence judicial deference to the Commission's expertise was particularly appropriate. Applying a limited scope of
review, the Court of Appeals found that
the Commission's substantive findings
were not arbitrary or capricious. The
Court also found that the informal notice and comment procedures followed
by the Commission comported with
the requirements of the Exchange Act.
The Court thus rejected petitioners' argument that the more elaborate procedures of Section 6(e) of the Exchange Act were inapplicable, since
the fees fer limit order services under
the CBOE rule were not fees "charged
by members," but rather were fees
charged by the CBOE itself.
The Belenke decision is of importance both to national securities ex-

changes and the Commission as judicial recognition
of an exchange's
ability to improve the operational efficiency of its market, consistent with
the purposes of the Exchange Act. The
Court of Appeals' decision reaffirms
that judicial deference should be accorded to the decisions of the Commission in exercising regulatory or
oversight authority over the operations of the nation's securities markets. Finally, this case gives effect to
Congress' intent that the Commission
have considerable flexibility in fashioning its administrative procedures
where the Commission acts through
informal, legislative-type proceedings.

Other Significant

Projects

Implied Rights of Action-A

number
of cases were decided by the Supreme
Court in the past term concerning implied rights of action, which have a
substantial impact with regard to the
Federal securities laws. In Touche Ross
& Company, Inc. v. Redington, the
Court refused to imply a private cause
of action for violation of the books and
recordkeeping provision of the Exchange Act, because that provision, in
the Court's view, neither conferred special rights on particular parties nor prohibited certain conduct as unlawful.
Because the Court believed that the
provision was intended by Congress to
act as an early warning system-so
that the Commission could pursue its
enforcement obligations after reviewing the filings required to be madeimplied actions have by no means
been denied entirely.
The Court ordered that reargument
be held in Lewis v. Transamenca Mortgage Advisers, Inc., where the sole issue was whether private cause of action was implied for violations of the
antifraud provision of the Investment
Advisers Act. The Court had recognized the existence of private action
under the comparable antifraud provi-

sion of the Exchange Act, in Superintendent of Insurance v. Bankers Casualty & Life. While the Lewis case has
not yet been decided, the Court's opinion in non-securities cases, as well as
Touche Ross, bear on the continued inability of private actions for the violations of some of the statutory provisions of the Federal securities laws.
ALI Code-Over
the past ten years,
the American Law Institute has sponsored the drafting of a Federal Securities Code, under the direction of Professor Louis Loss of the Harvard Law
School. In May 1978, the Institute's
membership approved a 766-page
"Proposed Official Draft" of the Code,
which is designed to replace the six
separate Federal statutes administered
by the Commission with a single comprehensive and unified piece of legislation.
The Commission and its staff spent
a great deal of time and effort during
the fiscal year analyzing and studying
the proposed Code in preparation for
its expected introduction in Congress.
The task of evaluating the benefits the
Code would offer and the possible difficulties it might create, in terms of
maintaining an effective scheme of
investor protection,
is exceedingly
complex. While in many respects the
ALI draft seeks simply to codify exrsting law, it would make significant substantive changes in many other respects.
For example, the Code would replace the current emphasis on registration of individual offerings of securities
with a "continuous disclosure" system
based on issuer registration, and providing for less stringent filing and disclosure requirements in connection
with certain distributions of the securities of "one-year registrants" (i.e., issuers that have been registered for one
year). In addition, certain changes
would be made in tender offer regulation, including a ten-day preacquisi-

55

tion notice and publicity requirement,
along with express preemption of State
tender offer legislation. Also, investment advisers would be subject for the
first time to qualification and financial
responsibility requirements, and the
Commission would be given rulernaking authority over the unethical conduct of securities professionals. In the
area of civil liability, there would be
many new express rights of action created, along with a grant of authority to
the courts to imply private rights of action in certain circumstances. These
are but a few of the literally hundreds
of modifications that the Code would
make as compared with current law.
During the initial review of the proposed Code, members of the Comrnis-

56

sion staff held a series of meetings with
Professor Loss and his group of advisers to discuss concerns about both
substantive positions taken in the
Code and the drafting of various Code
provisions. In response, Professor Loss
has made a substantial number of technical amendments to the Code. In September 1979, the Commission itself
began meeting with Professor Loss, in
sessions open to the public, to discuss
the issues raised by the staff. As the
Code nears the beginning of Congressional consideration, the Commission
will be drawing together the results of
its review to help it determine what formal position to take before Congress
with respect to the Code.

Under the Public Utility Holding
Company Act of 1935 (Holding Company Act), the Commission regulates
interstate public utility holding company systems engaged in the electric
utility business or in the retail distribution of gas. The Commission's jurisdiction also covers natural gas pipeline
companies and nonutility companies
which are subsidiary companies of registered holding companies.
There are presently 14 registered
holding company systems with aggregate assets, as of June 30, 1979, of
$47.5 billion. Total holding company
system assets increased by over $1.1
billion in fiscal 1979, even with the loss
of Ohio Edison Company who was
granted a Section 3(aX2) exemption
from the Holding Company Act in
April 1979. Total operating revenues,
as of June 30, 1979, were $17.9 billion, a $700 million increase over the
previous year. In the 14 systems there
are 60 electric and/or gas utility subsidiaries, 70 nonutility subsidiaries,
and 20 inactive companies, or a total
of 168 system companies, including
the top parent and subholding companies. Table 35 in the Appendix lists
the systems and Table 36 lists their aggregate assets and operating revenues.

Financing
During fiscal year 1979, approximately $2.7 billion of senior securities
and common stock financing of the 14
registered systems was approved by

the Commission. Of this amount, approximately $1.6 billion was long-term
debt financing, and over $1 billion was
for equity financing. These amounts
represent a 24 percent decrease in
long-term debt financing over fiscal
year 1978 and a 19 percent increase in
the sale of common and preferred
stock. In addition, the Commission approved over $3.5 billion of short-term
debt financing and $291 million of pollution control financing for the 14 registered holding company systems. Table 37 in the Appendix presents the
amount and types of securities issued
under the Holding Company Act by
these holding company systems.

Fuel Programs
During fiscal year 1979, the Commission authorized $460.6 million of
fuel exploration and development capital expenditures for the holding company systems. These expenditures
cover annual fuel programs subject to
regulation under the Holding Company
Act defined on geographical and functional terms. Table 38 in the Appendix
lists the authorization by holding company system for each fuel program.
Largely as a result of the energy crisis, holding companies have embarked
on major and expensive new commitments to acquire substantial additional
capital. Generally, the arrangements
involve formation of several new subsidiaries for producing, transporting
and financing fuel supplies or the investment of capital for the exploration
of and development drilling for minerai reserves with a right to production

accruing to such investment. Since
1971, the Commission has authorized
expenditures of over $2.6 billion for
fuel programs of holding companies.

Service Company Operations
At the end of calendar year 1978,
there were 11 subsidiary service companies providing managerial, accounting, administrative and engineering
services to 11 of the 14 holding companies registered under the Holding
Company Att. The billings for services
rendered to the holding company systems amount to $423 million or 2.37
percent of the total revenues generated
by the electric and gas operating utilities of the holding company systems.
All services are rendered at cost to the
operating utilities, with several systems including a return on capital in-

58

vested by the parent holding company.
Because the subsidiary service companies are service oriented, they are
heavily labor intensive having 11,061
employees and assets of over $229
million. During February 1979, the
Commission approved a proposed
amendment to the Uniform System of
Accounts for public utility service
companies. The revised system of accounts will (1) provide for closer coordination with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's Uniform System
of Accounts for electric and gas public
utilities, (2) facilities for conduct of audit and account inspection programs,
and (3) Improve reports filed by service
companies subject to the Act. The revised system of accounts is effective
January 1, 1980, for the 11 subsidiary
service companies.

CORPORATE REORGANIZATIONS

The Commission's role under Chapter X of the Bankruptcy Act, which provides a procedure for reorganizing corporations in the United States district
courts, differs from that under the various other statutes which it administers. The Commission does not intiate
Chapter X proceedings or hold its own
hearings, and it has no authority to de.
termine any of the issues in such proceedings. The Commission participates in proceedings under Chapter X
to provide independent, expert assist.
ance to the courts, participants, and
investors in a highly complex area of
corporate law and finance. It pays special attention to the interests of public
security holders who may not otherwise be represented effectively.
Where the scheduled indebtedness
of a debtor corporation exceeds $3
million, Section 172 of Chapter X requires the court, before approving any
plan of reorganization, to submit it to
the Commission for its examination
and report. If the indebtedness does
not exceed $3 million, the court may,
if it deems it advisable to do so, submit
the plan to the Commission before deciding whether to approve it. When the
Commission files a report, copies or
summaries must be sent to all security
holders and creditors when they are
asked to vote on the plan. The Commission has no authority to veto a plan
of reorganization
or to require its
adoption.
The Commission has not considered
it necessary or appropriate to participate in every Chapter X case. Apart
from the excessive administrative bur-

den, many of the cases involve only
trade or bank creditors and few public
investors. The Commission seeks to
participate principally in those proceedings in which a substantial public
investor interest is involved. However,
the Commission may also participate
because an unfair plan has been or is
about to be proposed, public security
holders are not represented adequately, the reorganization proceedings are being conducted in violation
of important provisions of the Act, the
facts indicate that the Commission can
perform a useful service, or the court
requests the Commission's participation.
The Commission in its Chapter X activities has divided the country into
five geographical areas. The New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles and Seattle reo
gional offices of the Commission each
have responsibility for one of these
areas. Supervision and review of the
regional offices' Chapter X work is the
responsibility of the Division of Cor.
porate Regulation of the Commission
which, through its Branch of Reorganization, also serves as a field office for
the southeastern area of the United
States.
During the fiscal year, the Commission entered three new Chapter X proceedings involving companies with aggregate stated assets of approximately
$69.9 million and aggregate indebtedness of approximately $93.6 million.
Including the new proceedings, the
Commission was a party in a total of
97 reorganization proceedings during
the fiscal year (a list of these proceed-

59

ings appears in Table 39 in the Appendix of this report). The stated assets of
the companies involved in these proceedings totaled approximately $4.9
billion and their indebtedness about

$4.5 billion.

60

During the fiscal year nine proceedings were closed, leaving 88 in which
the Commission was a party at year
end.

ADMINISTRATION AND
MANAGEMENT

During the fiscal year 1979, the
Commission stressed, more than ever
before, its commitment to improving
management information systems and
strengthening internal management
capabilities. This heightened emphasis
on enhanced administrative and managerial support is a direct reflection of
increased recognition of potential benefits that can flow to the public from
better systems, procedures, plans, and
organization structures. It is intended
that the initiatives of 1979 will emerge
in the form of operational economies,
increased effectiveness and greater responsiveness in the 1980's.

General Management and
Program Developments
The Commission undertook several
projects during the fiscal year which
resulted in management improvements and program efficiencies.
A management study conducted by
the Executive Director's Office in fiscal
year 1978 was the catalyst for organizational changes in the Division of Corporation Finance that will be implemented during the next fiscal year.
Major recommendations for the study
concerned development of a review
strategy for disclosure filings and the
need to restructure the division's workload by industry groupings so as to allow Commission staff an opportunity
to develop expertise concerning peculiar industry patterns and trends, and
to allow more informed review of priority filings. During 1979, a Corporation
Finance task force studied these rec-

ommendations to assess their feasibility and to propose a plan for implementation. Based on the findings of
the task force, a plan for such a restructuring was accepted and is intended for
implementation during fiscal 1980. At
the close of the fiscal year, negotiations were underway, with faculty from
the Harvard Business School, to provide expertise and assistance in implementing industry specialization, a new
and cost effective filings review strategy, and a quality control program.
An intensive workload/cost analysis
of the Chicago Regional Office resulted in decisions to close the Cleveland and St. Louis Branch Offices and
to consolidate these operations with
those of the parent office In Chicago.
This decision was based on a changing
dispersion of activities due to the
emergence of options markets in Chicago, a reduction of enforcement activity in the branches and development
of specialized units in Chrcaqo, Apart
from major operational improvements,
it was also concluded that there were
some cost benefits to be derived from
taking advantage of the economies of
scale available through consolidation
of activities at the principal office.
An organizational analysis of the Office of Public Affairs led to a decision
to split the legislative and public information functions. A new Office of Legislative Affairs was created within the
Office of the Chairman and given responsibility for handling matters relating to legislation and legislative liaison. The Office of Public Affairs will
continue to handle general public in-

61

formation and press relations functions.
The Office of the Executive Director
conducted a major management review of the Division of Market Regulation. The study report to the director
and management staff of the division
resulted in significant changes in both
internal procedures and organizational
structure. The study also served as a
basis for an increased focus, within the
division, on such issues as communication, project management, training,
recruitment, and financial recordkeeping and controls.

Information
ment

Systems

Manage-

In fiscal year 1979 the Commission
made vast progress toward improving
its information handling processes.
Detailed specifications regarding computer processing capabilities that will
be required to meet the agency's data
processing needs over the next five to
eight years were completed, and a
formal request for delegated procurement authority was presented to the
General Services Administration
(GSA). In anticipation
of GSA approval, steps were taken to develop solicitation documents that will result in
the installation of a new computer system by the end of fiscal year 1980.
Fectlities Improvement-While
much
was accomplished in fiscal year 1979
toward meeting its long-term information processing needs, the Commission continued to make more efficient
and effective use of the existing IBM
360-65 computer installed in 1978. In
this regard, the memory capacity of
the central processing unit was increased and several components were
added to expand our on-line storage
capability-two
actions that enabled
the Commission to process an immensely increased workload without
any degradation in system perform-

62

ance. Other steps taken to improve
processing activities included conversion to a more efficient operating system control program and utilization of
on-line programming and file maintenance techniques. As a result of these
improvements the Commission has
been able to continue to make significant progress in the development and
implementation of new information
systems while concurrently expanding
the use of the teleprocessing network
to include all of the Commission's regional offices. The network was scheduled to be further extended to include
four of the largest branch offices during the first quarter of fiscal 1980, with
the remaining branches scheduled to
come on line later in the year.

Major System Enhancements-Major
information systems implemented during 1979 included two systems for
which developmental work was initiated in 1978. The first was a comprehensive records management system
which, utilizing microfilm and teleprocessmg techniques, provides the
staff with the capability for directly entering and retrieving information relating to the receipt and disposition of
various reports filed with the Commission. As part of this project, on february 5, 1979, the Commission officially adopted microfilm as a substitute record for many of the paper files
previously maintained. Under this
mode of operation, microfiche copies
of filings can be easily and quickly
reproduced and distributed to all requesters, thus ensuring the highest
possible level of integrity as the official
file is centrally retained at all times.
Expansion of the micrographics program to include additional Commission files was scheduled for the first
and second quarter in fiscal 1980.
The second system involves an expansion of the Commission's Name
and Relationship Search system. The
new process provides the staff with a

facility for immediate terminal access
to an index of name and associated
data on companies and individuals
having a direct or indirect relationship
with the Commission, and replaces a
system of manual requests which very
often required several days to process.
A third system initiated in 1978, for
which extensive development work
was accomplished in 1979, is the Com.
mission's Case Activity Tracking System (CATS). Scheduled for operational
testing early in fiscal year 1980 and lrnplementation in the second quarter,
this system will promote better man.
agement by providing the Commission
with an efficient means of monitoring
current events and status of all active
investigations and litigation.
Other important systems work pursued in 1979 included the initiative of
a prototype correspondence tracking
system to more effectively control the
thousands of pieces of correspondence
flowing through the Office of the
Chairman, refinement and enhancement of various internal personnel,
position management, and cost accounting systems; expansion of the
complaint processing system to allow
for the experimental preparation of let.
ters and notices by means of automated electronic techniques; develop.
ment of a series of statistical programs
for use by the Commission's staff in its
special study of the options market;
expansion of the broker dealer/investment adviser data base to produce various statistics incidental to a corporate
governance study being conducted by
the Division of Corporation Finance;
and development of a system for maintaining and reporting data filed pur.
suant to Section 4(2), Rule 146, of the
Securities Act of 1933 (Securities Act).
Developmental
work on several
other information systems was also in.
itiated during fiscal year 1979, many
of which will be implemented by fiscal
year 1980. These included establish-

ment of a generalized, user-oriented
information retrieval capability that
will operate through teleprocessing
and data base management tech.
niques; expansion of an existing system for analyzing data contained in Investment Company Annual Reports,
Form N-1R; creation of an on-line system for retrieving index information
relating to releases published in the
SEC Docket; and development of a series of computer programs for producing a variety of reports from data filed
by certain institutional investors and
investment managers under Rules 13d,
13f, and 13g.

Systems Administration-In addition
to these enhancements of agency information systems and automated
processing techniques, several other
measures were taken in fiscal year
1979 to enhance the internal management and administration of the Commission's data processing activity. An
important event was the reorgnization
of the Office of Data Processing designed to make it more adaptable and
responsive to the changing nature of
the Commission's automated data
processing (ADP) needs. A second undertaking involved an intensive program to enhance interrelationship between the ADP staff and the users of
ADP services. This was accomplished
through the adoption of a formal pro.
cedure for identifying and requesting
ADP support, the creation of a Com.
mission-wide ADP liaison group, and
the establishment of more effective
communication procedures to insure
that critical information was effectively
relayed to and from ADP personnel.
Another step taken to increase ADP
efficiency was the elimination of inter.
nal cardpunching and transfer of this
function to a commercial concern. In
addition to substantial dollar savings,
this action has provided the Commission with much more flexibility in reo
63

sponding to changing data entry requirements.
One final issue receiving much emphasis dunnq 1979 was ADP security.
Recognizing that an expanded ADP
program would require much tighter
control and protection of ADP reo
sources, the Commission has taken
several actions toward bolstering its
ADP security program. These included
the establishment of a full-time position of ADP security officer, the conduct of an ADP risk assessment (to be
completed early in fiscal year 1980),
formalization of an interagericy agreement for back-up computer processing
time, and establishment of a personnel
screening program for ADP staff, as
mandated by the Office of Personnel
Management (OPM).

Market Oversight Surveillance
System
The Office of the Executive Director,
in cooperation with the DIvisions of
Enforcement and Market Regulation
and utilizing the services of an independent systems consultant, has been
engaged in the study and design of a
market oversiqht and surveillance system during the past year. That project
has resulted in a proposed design,
which is presently being reviewed by
the Commission staff. In addition, the
Commission is undertaking to implement a pilot of the proposed design in
order to test the design and evaluate its
potential for enhancing the Commission's oversight and surveillance functions. Budgetary approval by the Office of Management and Budget (OM B)
and Congress and procurement approval by GSA will be required before
any portion of the larger overall system
can be implemented. By mid spring
1980 the Commission is hopeful that
a determination will have been made
as to the scope and timetable for implementation of a larger system.

64

The proposed system would monitor
all securities markets activities and
seek to identify possible market irregulanties or violations of self-regulatory
organization rules and the Federal securities laws. It would thus enhance existing Commission facilities in areas
such as market surveillance and inspections of self-regulatory organizations and broker-dealers. Such a system will neither diminish nor supplant
the efforts of self-regulatory organizations to regulate their market places
and market professionals; rather it is
intended to provide the Commission
with a greater capability to detect and
follow-up on abberrant tradinq practices, particularly when subjects outside the jurisdiction of the self-regula.
tory organizations are involved. By
providing the Commission with enhanced Information analyzed for particular trading patterns, the system will
place the Commission in a better position to coordinate, with each self-regulatory organization, the Investigation
and follow-up of particular matters.
If the proposed system receives the
approval of the requisite governmental
bodies, implementation is expected to
require at least five years. Implementation will be geared to advancements
in the securities industry and to developments in the evolving national mar.
ket system.

Financial Management
The Commission collects fees for
the registration of securities, securities
transactions on national securities exchanges, and miscellaneous filings, reports and applications. In fiscal year
'1979, the Commission collected a record $33 million dollars in fees, representing approximately 47 percent of
the total funds appropriated by the
Congress for Commission operations.
These figures are up from $26 million,
representing 42 percent of funds appropriated in fiscal year 1978. Nearly

$4 million of the increase in collections was attributed to Securities Act
registration fees resulting from both
higher volumes and larger offerings,
while higher stock exchange volumes
accounted for $2.3 million of the increase.
In 1979, the Office of the Comptroller initiated implementation of an automated integrated financial management system. By the end of the fiscal
year, the system was producing comprehensive accounting and budget ex.
ecution reports which provide timely
information for budgetary review and
policy planning both Commissionwide and by organizational unit.
Fiscal year 1979 also saw partial implementation of"a budget formulation
system. Reports generated by this system present budgetary alternatives at
various levels of staffing and funding,
and are of considerable benefit in analyzing different zero base budget possibilities.
A position tracking system, developed in fiscal year 1979, has been implemented and will be fully operational
in the first quarter of fiscal year 1980.
Other current initiatives intended to
improve financial management or con.
serve resources include completion of
a budget handbook, continued automation of payroll, fee collection and
budget call procedures, and establishment of uniform agency policies on the
use of overtime and the employment
of temporaries. These projects will all
be carried over into fiscal year 1980.

Personnel Management
At the close of the fiscal year, the
Commission's total strength was approximately 2,020. About two-thirds of
these personnel were employed in the
agency headquarters in Washington,
D.C.; the remaining one-third were located in the nine regional and six
branch offices located in major finan-

cial centers throughout the United
States.
Although relatively small by Federal
agency standards, the Commission
recognizes the importance of personnel management as an internal part of
overall management effectiveness. It
has, therefore, initiated innovative programs leading to both more effective
use of personnel resources and the integration of personnel management
into general decision-making. Enactment of the Civil Service Reform Act
of 1978 (CSRA) has encouraged and
accelerated these Commission initiatives. The intent of the CSRA is to
place greater stress on performance, to
give managers the tools needed to
carry out their assignments and to hold
managers accountable for the effectiveness of their units. As a result, a
very substantial investment of staff
time and funds has been devoted to the
implementation of the Act, and an
even greater commitment will be required in fiscal year 1980. Although
the full benefit of this investment will
not be realized for several years, significant accomplishments are already
noticeable durmq the first year of the
CSRA's existence.
Senior. Executive SerUlce- The Commission was alloted 46 senior executive positions in the initial Senior Executive Service (SES) allocation, 44 of
which were filled by incumbents, as
provided by the new law.
Extensive training was given to senior executives regarding the objectives
and policies of the senior executive
service. This training included in-depth
briefings by officials for OPM, working
seminars of senior executives conducted by the Chairman and the Executive Director, and training sessions
presented by personnel consultants.
This training program had as its purpose education of key Commission officials as to the f1exibilities and opportunities offered by the CSRA for

65

increased effectiveness in personnel
management.
Based on a careful review of the literature, interviews and personnel specialists from academia and from the private
sector, and a review of programs in
other agencies, a performance appraisal system has been developed and
implemented for the members of the
SES. This system, which will be used as
a basis for determining assignments
and compensation, will be monitored
closely to identify necessary refinements and to ensure that it continues to
meet all of the objectives prescribed by
the CSRA_ Finally, an Executive Resource Board and a Performance Review Board have been established to
oversee and coordinate manpower
planning, recruiting, performance appraisals and other aspects of executive
personnel management.
Performance Appraisal-A great deal
of research and planning has gone into
the development of performance appraisal systems at the Commission. A
comprehensive promotion appraisal
program being conducted by OPM (and
reported in the 1978 Annual Report) is
continuing. When completed, this program is expected to replace fairly subjective judgments with valid iI1tlicators
of successful performance in attorney
positions. In addition to achieving a
higher degree of equity in awarding promotions, it is hoped that the new system
will enable Commission managers to
predict success in specific positions
with a higher degree of accuracy.
This effort is complemented by a separate study being undertaken by a private consultant and an anticipated con.
tract with other consultants from OPM.
When these studies are completed, it is
expected that they will provide the basis
for a comprehensive, valid and equitable appraisal system for managers, supervisors, professional staff members
and clerical personnel.

Other Accomplishments
66

Under the

CSRA-Procedures
have been developed and implemented for the establishment of a probationary period for
newly appointed managers and supervisors, as provided in Title III of the
CSRA. This program enables division
directors and office heads to promote
qualified technicians and specialists
into supervisory positions, with the understanding that they can revert back
to prior positions after six months if
they do not give evidence of supervisory effectiveness. Planning is currently under way for the merit pay program required by Title V of the CSRA,
under which supervisors and middle
managers would be compensated on
the basis of accomplishments and organizational performance, rather than
on the basis of length of service.
On-going Programs-Title III of the
CSRA authorizes acceptance of volunteer services where they provide educational experiences for students. The
Commission is making extensive use
of this provision of the CSRA through
its student observer program, under
which law students work for the Commission for up to 20 hours a week. The
students receive course credits in lieu
of salary, as well as a first hand acquaintance with Federal employment.
A number of student observers have
already become permanent staff members following graduation from law
school.
Despite the heavy investment of
time devoted to implementation of the
CSRA, the Commission continued to
stress and initiate improvements in
other traditional areas of human resource management.
The Commission has continued to
refine its attorney recruitment system,
with the dual goal of attracting top caliber applicants and ensuring that persons employed represent a cross section of all segments of American
society. One notable achievement in
fiscal year 1979 was the Commission's

special effort to attract minority law
graduates. This was accomplished by
means of an enormously successful
"job fair" to which 129 law students
were invited. The students heard presentations from the Chairman, several
Commissioners, the Executive Director and the heads of all major offices,
resulting in the permanent employment of 11 minority attorneys and
summer job opportunities for four second year students. Another program,
carried out under the sponsorship of
the Office of General Counsel, resulted
in the hiring of four outstanding graduates who had served as law clerks to
district and appellate court judges.
The highly successful upward mobility program instituted in fiscal year
1978 was continued and expanded.
Ten additional upward mobility positions were established, bringing the total number of positions under this program to 22. This number, however,
only partially reflects the Commission's progress in upward mobility. As
a direct result of early successes with
this program, a number of entry-level
positions were established outside the
formal program; this will further assist
the agency in using the capabilities of
its existing staff, while at the same
time providing other bonafide ad.
vancement opportunities
for lower
grade employees.
The Commission continued to em.
phasize staff training in fiscal year
1979. Approximately 850 of the Commission's 2,000 staff members attended formal training or development
programs during the year, an approximate 10 percent increase over 1978.
In particular, more staff time and
funds were allocated to managerial
and executive development than in any
previous year. The Commission was
represented at the Federal Executive
Institute's (FEI) seven week Senior Executive Education Program for the first
time, while five other senior managers

participated in FEl's three week leadership program. In addition, other key
staff members attended the Program
for Senior Managers at Harvard Business School, Managerial Grid, team
building programs and a program
sponsored by the National Institute of
Trial Advocacy at the University of Colorado. This emphasis reflects recognition of the increased attention to executive development that is required by
the CSRA, and will be further expanded in fiscal year 1980.
The employee counseling program
begun in fiscal year 1978 was expanded in an effort to be more responsive to the needs of employees, and to
enhance the role of the Commission
as a responsible and concerned employer. A discrete Employee Relations
unit was established in the Office of
Personnel, and its accomplishments
numbered among them expanded retirement counseling, counseling on financial planning, and more cornprehensive counseling on insurance plans.
The Commission conducted an aggressive Vietnam Veterans Week program, consistent with the spirit of the
Congressional resolution on this subject. The thrust of the program was to
sensitize the staff to the particular
needs of the Vietnam veteran, to promote the hiring and professional development of these veterans, and to
recognize their post-service as well as
service accomplishments.
The Commission also continues to
emphasize its highly successful program for the recruitment of handicapped persons. This effort reflects a
commitment to remove artificial bar.
riers-both
architectural and attitudinal-to
the employment of full utilization of individuals who, despite
handicapping conditions, are able to
make a meaningful contribution to
Commission objectives.

Equal Employment

Opportunity-In

response to Title III of the CSRA, the

67

Commission has undertaken extensive
efforts to identify underrepresentation
of minorities and women on the staff,
both by grade level and by occupation. Strategies are being implemented
to correct the underrepresentation
through enhanced recruiting efforts directed to schools with large minority
and female enrollment, maintenance
of equal opportunity recruitment files,
expansion of the upward mobility program, activation of individual training
and development plans, and cooperation with OPM in eliminating many of
the complex procedures and requirements which have raised barriers to the
recruitment and hiring of minorities
and women. These procedural efforts
will be combined with seminars for
managers and supervisors designed to
stress recognition of EEO responslbilities and provide instructions in the
strategies which may be employed to
eliminate underrepresentation.
In part because of these efforts, the
total number of women attorneys in
the work force at the Commission continues to increase. Since 1977, 63
women attorneys obtained employment at the Commission, bringing
their total representation to 168 as of
the end of fiscal 1979. This increase
represents a 60 percent rise in female
attorney employment during the two
year span.
Correspondent to the rise in the
number of women attorneys, there has
been an overall increase in their total
percent of the Commission's attorney
work force. In 1977, women attorneys
represented 16.4 percent of the total
work force, whereas 22.5 percent of
attorney positions were held by women
in 1979.
Minority attorney employment rose
a healthy 21.4 percent during the period between 1977 and 1979. At the
end of fiscal year 1979, there were 51
minority attorneys employed at the
Commission as compared to 42 in

68

1977, 33 in 1975, and 11 in 1973.
Minorities
generally
registered
across the board gains in key professional and middle management positions (GS-13-15)' between fiscal years
1977 and 1979. At the close of fiscal
year 1977, there were only 37 minorities occupying positions
in these
grades in contrast to 49 at the end of
fiscal year 1979, for a 32.4 percent increase during the two year period. Simi1arly, women also showed an increase
during this period-holding
82 GS-13
through 15 positions, up from 56 in
1977.

Activity Onder The Freedom Of
Information Act
Commission rules implementing the
Freedom of Information Act provide
that the public may inspect or obtain
copies of records maintained by the
Commission, with the exception of certain specified categories of information. During 1979, the Commission reo
ceived 1,318 requests for information;
up 5 percent from 1978.

Space Management
Problems stemming from inadequate and poorly planned space continue to present some of the Com.
mission's most serious operational
difficulties.
Headquarters personnel
are scattered among three locations,
requiring costly, time consuming and
inefficient movement of equipment,
personnel and files. Some $150,000 is
spent on alterations each year in an
attempt to accommodate changing
staff requirements. In fiscal year 1979,
documentation
for a consol ida ted
Headquarters building was again prepared and submitted to GSA.
In the meantime, the Office of Administrative Services and the Division
of Corporation Finance have continued to work with GSA in connection

with the refurnishing and alterations
necessary to allow for the eventual
movement of Commission personnel

from the sixth and seventh floors of the
old Federal Home Loan Bank Board
building to the third and fourth floors.

Income, Expenses and Selected
Balance Sheet Items
Registered broker-dealers recorded
total revenue of $11.2 billion in 1978,
25 percent above the level of 1977.
Securities commissions increased 34
percent in 1978, inflecting the surge in
trading volume, and represented 40
percent of total revenue. Trading profits were 18 percent higher in 1978 and

also represented 18 percent of revenue. Underwriting revenue declined
$42 million in 1978, after a similar $44
million decline in 1977 and represents
8 percent of total revenue.
Pre-tax income increased $46 million, or 8 percent, in 1978 because increased expenses nearly matched the
growth in revenues. Ownership equity
at the end of 1977 was $4,659 billion,
reflecting an increase of $544 million
or 13 percent during the year.

Historical Financial Information
of Broker-Dealers with Securities
Related Revenue of $500,000 or
More
Brokerage firm revenue increased
23 percent in 1978 on share volume
which increased 37 percent over 1977.
Commission revenue and trading profits each increased, while underwriting
revenue declined somewhat from 1977
levels. Investment profits, interest income, commodity and other revenue

80

related to the securities business each
rose from the previous year. Pre-tax income increased 38 percent with this 23
percent rise in revenue.
Firms that reported securities-related revenue of $500,000 or more
held approximately 89 percent of the
industry's assets and reported 90 percent of all revenue in 1978. Balance
sheet data for the most recent two
years are not comparable with earlier
years because of changes made in the
brokerage firm reporting system.

Securities Industry Dollar: 1978
Securities commissions represented
39.1 cents of each dollar of securities
industry revenue. Another 17.5 cents
of each dollar came from trading activities and underwriting revenue contributed 8.3 cents. Together, these three
activities accounted for 64.9 cents of
each revenue dollar.
The largest portion of this revenue

82

dollar-35.9
cents-went to pay registered representatives and support
personnel (clerical and administrative
employees). Another 10.7 cents was
spent on communications, occupancy
and equipment. General partners and
voting stockholder officers' compensation amounted to 5.0 cents of each
dollar, with 9.3 cents remaining for
pre-tax income. This margin was 11
percent above the 1977 figure.

Self-Regulatory Organization
Revenue and Expenses
Self-regulatory
organizations
receive approximately
70 percent of
their revenue from four sources: transaction charges, listing fees, communication fees and depository fees. The
nature of these revenue sources makes
the financial condition of self-regulatory organizations highly dependent
on trading volume.
Total share volume of securities
traded on all national securities exchanges and over-the-counter
increased 37 percent between calendar
year 1977 and 1978, bringing 1978
share volume to 12.6 billion. As a result of this increased trading activity,
combined self-regulatory organization
revenue increased to $261 million, up
$24 million from the 1977 total.
Changes in major revenue components between 1977 and 1978 were as
follows:
• Revenue from transaction fees increased to $52 million, from $37 million;
• Revenue from communication
fees decreased $1 million to $41 mil.
lion;
• Revenue from listing fees increased $800,000 to $43 million; and
• Revenue from depository fees increased $8.7 million, to $47 million.
The expenses of the self-regulatory
organizations are concentrated in two
areas, employee costs and communications and data processing costs.
These costs accounted for 74 percent
of the $232 million in self-regulatory
organization expenditures for 1978.
The individual organizations are
quite different in their dependence on
particular sources of revenue. Some
sources of revenue, such as transaction, clearing and depository fees
change directly with changes in share
volume. Others are relatively fixed,
such as listing fees and membership

90

dues. The substantial growth in trading
volume during 1978 provides an opportunity to examine how changes in
volume affect each organization's financial results. The revenue increase
which accompanied the growth in
share volume was not as dramatic-l0
percent above 1977. Since operating
costs are largely fixed, however, the
growth in revenue yielded dramatically
improved pre-tax income. In 1978 the
net income of self-regulatory organizations was nearly $30 million, more
than the net income of the previous
two years combined.
The New York Stock Exchange
(NYSE) derived 44 percent of its revenue from its volume-related transaction
and depository fees in 1978. Relatively
fixed sources of revenue, such as listing
fees paid by corporations and communications fees and memberships dues
paid by brokers, generated another 42
percent of revenue, and miscellaneous
sources accounted for the remaining 14
percent. Pre-tax income in 1978, at
$18.8 million, was 75 percent higher
than in 1977.
The American
Stock Exchange
(AMEX) generated only 23 percent of its
1978 revenue from volume-related
transaction fees. Its listing and communication fees and memberships
dues, however, each generated revenue
at a higher annual rate in 1978 than
1977. Pre-tax income for 1978 was
more than twice the 1977 figure.
Over-the-counter trading of listed
and unlisted issues in 1978 was 36 percent above the 1977 level. NASD revenue, however, is derived from sources
which do not vary with trading volume.
Registration, corporate finance and
listing fees, together with membership
dues, provided 87 percent of revenue.
Revenue in 1978, consequently, was
only three percent above 1977 annual
revenue, and pre-tax income slipped
55 percent.
The Midwest Stock Exchange's 1978

revenue was substantially reduced as
a result of the discontinuance of the
exchange's broker service bureau.
Nearly 72 percent of revenue, however,
is still volume-related, and the combined effects of the discontinued
losses and the growth in trading volume resulted in pre-tax income of
$720 thousand in 1978. Pre-tax losses
were over $1 million in 1977.
...,The Pacific, Philadelphia and Boston
Exchanges also depend on volume-related fees for most of their revenue.
Sixty-five percent of Pacific's, 81 percent of Philadelphia's and 80 percent
of Boston's revenue comes from such
sources. The record trading volume in
1978 raised Pacific's 1978 pre-tax income to a level nearly 12 times as high
as the 1977 figure. Philadelphia experienced a seven-fold increase, and Boston's pre-tax income figure in 1978 was
10 times higher than in 1977.
The Chicago Board Options Exchange, which is also highly dependent
on volume-related sources of revenue,
had a pre-tax profit of nearly $2.6 million in 1978, compared with a pre-tax
loss of $500 thousand in 1977. The
Cincinnati Exchange, which began an
electronic trading experiment in 1978,
now receives less in floor usage revenue and more in communications fees.
While its 1978 revenues were higher
than the previous year, 1978 operating
losses were $7 thousand, versus $20
thousand in pre-tax income in 1977.
The MSRB income of $590,960 during fiscal year 1979 (See Table 12) was
derived primarily from three fees established by rules adopted under the
Exchange Act. Municipal securities
brokers and municipal securities dealers are assessed (1) an initial fee of
$100, (2) an underwriting assessment
fee equal to .001 percent of the face
value of all municipal securities they
purchase from an issuer as part of a
new issue which has a final stated maturity of not less than two years from

the date of the securities, and (3) an
annual fee of $100 which, for this fiscal
year, it continued to be possible to offset by underwriting fees paid within the
calendar year. The underwriting assessment fee accounted for 70 percent
of the MSRB income during the fiscal
year 1979. The balance of MSRB income was from other fees and interest
income .
During fiscal year 1979, the MSRB
had total expenses of $866,323. The
major expense items were staff salaries
and employee benefits, including
MSRB contribution to an employee retirement plan established in 1978 (41
percent); meetings and travel (26.8
percent); and mailing list, rule manual,
postage and other printing (14.9 percent). Expenses exceeded income by
$275,363, due, in part, to a significant
reduction in assessment fees received.
As of September 3D, 1979, the MSRB
has a surplus of $632,823.
Aggregate clearing agency revenues
increased approximately $16 million
in 1978 to approximately $119 million.
Aggregate clearing agency expenses
increased approximately $12 million
in 1978 to approximately $112 million.
The 1978 increases in aggregate
clearing agency revenues and expenses of 16 percent and 12 percent
respectively represent a significant net
improvement over 1977 when the respective increases were 10 percent and
12 percent. The 37 percent increase in
trading volume for 1978 over 1977
discussed supra is the fundamental
reason for clearing agency revenues increasing at a greater rate than expenses. The 1978 aggregate revenue
increase of 16 percent is net of refunds, discounted
fees or rebates
(collectively, refunds) of unneeded revenue made by some clearing agencies
to their participants. These refunds,
which have the effect of reducing fees
charged, totaled approximately $12

91

million in 1978 as compared to approximately $6 million in 1977.
The 1978 net excess of revenues
over expenses provided some clearing
agencies with an opportunity to replenish their retained earnings which had

92

declined during the previous several
years when expenses increased at a
greater rate than revenues. Expenses
exceeded revenues for only one clearing agency in 1978 compared with five
in 1977.

EXEMPTIONS
Section 12(h) Exemptions
Section 12(h) of the Exchange Act
authorizes the Commission to grant a
complete or partial exemption from
the registration provisions of Section
12(g) or from other disclosure and insider trading provisions of the act
when such granting is not contrary to
the public interest or the protection of
investors.
For the year beginning October 1,
1978, 43 applications were still pending and 176 applications were filed
during the year. Of these 219 applications, 156 were granted, 9 were withdrawn and 2 were denied. Fifty-two applications were pending at the close of
the year, of which 26 had been published for notice.
On September 17, 1979 the Commission adopted Rule 12h-4 which automatically suspends an issuer's duty
to file Section 13(a) reports as to a
class of securities pursuant to Section
15(d) of the Exchange Act for the
balance of the issuer's fiscal year if the
registration of such securities is ter-

minated
under Section
12(d) or
12(g)(4) of the Exchange Act.i At the
start of the next and each succeeding
fiscal year, if the class of securities is
held by less than 300 shareholders of
record, this suspension of the duty to
file would continue under Section
15(d). The resulting reduction in 12(h)
applications from issuers who terminate under Section 12(d) or 12 (g)(4) is
expected to reduce the processing
time for other 12(h) applications.

Exemptions
Issuers

for Foreign Private

Rule 12g3-2 provides various exemptions from the registration provisions of Section 12(g) of the Exchange
Act for the securities of foreign private
issuers. Perhaps the most important of
these is that contained in subparagraph (b) thereof which provides an exemption for certain foreign issuers
which submit on a current basis material specified in the rule. Such ma'Securtties Exchange Act Release No.
16211 (September 17. 1979), 18 SEC
Docket 413.

terial includes that information about
which investors ought reasonably to be
informed and which the issuer: (1) has
made public pursuant to the law of the
country of domicile or in which it is Incorporated or organized; (2) has filed
with a foreign stock exchange on
which its securities are traded and
which was made public by such exchange, and/or (3) has distributed to
Its security holders. Perlodically, the
Commission publishes a list of those
foreign issuers which appear to be current under the exemptive provision.
The most current list is as of August
31, 1979 and contains a total of 161
foreign Issuers?

Other Exemptions
The Commission
received and
granted two requests for exemption
from the broker-dealer registration requirernent of Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. Exemptions were granted
to the the National Association of Investment Clubs In connection with Its
stock purchase program and to Mortex
Inc. In connection with Its automated
mortgage tradinq facility. The Comrnissron determined In each case that
an exemption would be consistent with
the pubhc interest and the protection
of Investors.
Exchange Act Rule 10b.6 imposes
certain prohibitions upon trading in secunties by persons interested in a distribution of such securitres. During the
fiscal year, the Commission granted
approximately 600 exemptions pursuant to paragraph (f) of Rule lOb-6
under circumstances indicating that
proposed purchase transactions did

2Securlties Exchange Act Release No
16212 (September 21, 1979), 18 SEC
Docket 462

not appear to constitute manipulative
or deceptive devices or contrivances
comprehended within the purposes of
the rule. In addition, Rule 1Ob-13 under
the Exchange Act prohibits purchases
of certain securities by persons making
a tender offer or exchange offer from
the time the offer is publicly announced until the termination of the
offer. One exemption from Rule lOb13 was granted to permit an issuer to
effect concurrent tender and exchange
offers inasmuch as the transaction did
not appear to constitute a manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance
comprehended within the purposes of
the rule.
The Commission also granted to one
individual a temporary waiver of the
requirement in MSRB rule G-3 that a
person acting as a financral and operations principal take and pass the
MSRB Financial Operations Principal
Qualification Examination.

STOCKHOLDINGS OF
INSTITUTIONAL INVESTORS
AND OTHERS
At year-end 1978, the eleven institutional groups listed below held
$358.0 billion of total corporate stock
outstanding (both common and preferred). In comparison, they accounted
for $342.2 billion of the stock held a
year earlier. The resulting 4.6 percent
increase in the value of the stockholdings of these institutions was the same

as the 4.6 percent upswing in the aggregate market value of all stock outstanding. Thus, the share of total stock
outstanding that was held by these institutions was 34.4 percent at year-end
1978 the same as it was a year earlier.
During 1978, the shares held by other
domestic investors, which consist of
individuals, broker-dealers and institutions not listed, dropped to 59.4 percent from 60.0 percent. Foreign investors share of stockholdings increased
to 6.2 percent.

Purpose of Registration
Effective registrations for cash sale
for the account of corporate issuers
amounted to $34 billion! in fiscal 1979
as compared to $29 billion in fiscal
1978. With respect to distribution of
these registrations between equity and
debt offerings, equity offerings increased from $10.0 billion in fiscal
1978 to $10.1 billion-a 1 percent increase. Corporate debt offerings increased from $19.0 billion to $24.2 billion-a 27.4 percent increase.
Among the securities registered for
cash sale in fiscal 1979, nearly all debt
issues were for immediate offerings,
whereas 41.2 percent of the equity

!The adoption of Rule 24f-2 (17 CFR
270.24f.2) effective November 3, 1977.
made it impossible to report the dollar
valueof securitiesregistered.

registrations were for immediate offerings. Registrations of extended offerings totaled $14.3 billion with employee plan offerings accounting for
$10.8 billion.
Securities registered for the account
of the issuer for other than cash sale
totaled $23.0 billion, $14.7 billion of
which was common stock. The bulk
of these registrations were common
stock issues relating to exchange offers, mergers and consolidations. In
fiscal 1979 common stock effectively
registered for this purpose totaled $9.8
billion, an increase of 58.1 percent
from fiscal 1978.
Registrations for the purpose of secondary offerings (proceeds going to
selling security holders) typically concern sales of common stock. In fiscal
1979 these registrations amounted to
$1.1 billion, or a 7.7 percent decline
from fiscal 1978.

ENFORCEMENT
Types of Proceedings
As the table below reflects, the securities laws provide for a wide range
of enforcement actions by the Commission. The most common types of
actions are injunctive proceedings instituted in the Federal district courts to
enjoin continued or threatened secu-

rities law VIolators, and administrative
proceedings pertaining to brokerdealer firms and/or individuals associated with such firms which may lead to
various remedial sanctions as required
in the public interest. When an injunction is entered by a court, violation of
the court's decree is a basis for criminal contempt action against the viola-

tor.

Trading Suspensions
During fiscal 1979, the Commission
suspended trading in the securities of
23 companies, a decrease of 73 percent from the 86 securities suspended
in fiscal 1978 and a 79 percent decrease from the 111 securities suspended in fisca I 1977. Of the 23 companies whose securities were the
subject of trading suspensions in fiscal
1979, 10 were suspended because of
delinquency in filing required reports
with the Commission. In most other in.
stances, the trading suspension was
ordered either because of substantial
questions as to the adequacy, accuracy
or availability of public information
concerning the company's financial
condition or business operations, or
because transactions in the company's
securities suggested possible manipulation or other violations.

Foreign Restricted

List

The Commission maintains and publishes a Foreign Restricted List which
is designed to put broker-dealers, financial institutions, investors and others on notice of unlawful distribution
of foreign securities in the United
States. The list consists of names of
foreign companies whose securities
the Commission has reason to believe
have been, or are being, offered for
public sale in the United States in violation of the registration requirements
of Section 5 of the Securities Act. The
offer and sale of unregistered securities deprives investors of all the protections afforded by the Securities Act,
including the right to receive a prospectus containing the information required by the Act for the purpose of
enabling the investor to determine
whether the investment is suitable for
him. While most broker-dealers refuse
to effect transactions in securities is-

sued by companies on the Foreign Restricted List, this does not necessarily
prevent promoters from illegally offering such securities directly to investors
in the United States by mail, by telephone, and sometimes by personal solicitation. During the past fiscal year,
there were no new corporations added
to the Foreign Restricted List. The total
number of corporations on the list is

101.
The complete list of all foreign corporations and other foreign entities on
the Foreign Restricted List on September 30, 1978, is as follows:

SEC OPERA nONS
The Commission collects fees for
the registration of securities, securities
transactions on national securities exchanges, and miscellaneous filings, reports and applications. In fiscal year
1979, the Commission collected a record $33 million dollars in fees, representing approximately 47 percent of
the total funds appropriated by the
Congress for Commission operations.

These figures are up from $26 million,
representing 42 percent of funds appropriated in fiscal year 1978. Nearly
$4 million of the increase in collections was attributed to Securities Act
registration fees resulting from both
higher volumes and larger offerings,
while higher stock exchange volumes
accounted for $2.3 million of the increase.
