Release No. 55431 (Mar. 9, 2007), 72 FR 12862 (Mar. 19, 2007) (“Amendments to
Financial Responsibility Rules”). As part of this release, the Commission also requested
comment on three additional matters: reducing the Rule 17a-11 (17 CFR 240.17a-11)
early warning level for broker-dealers that carry over $10 billion in debits; harmonization
of the net capital deductions required by paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1 for
securities lending and borrowing transactions with the deductions required under
paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(F) for securities repurchase and reverse repurchase agreement
transactions (17 CFR 240 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(B) and (c)(2)(iv)(F), respectively); and
accounting for third-party liens on customer securities held at a broker-dealer. As
discussed below in section III. of this release, the Commission received comments in
response to these requests but has determined to defer consideration of actions with
respect to these specific matters at this time.

all of the comment letters, and as discussed in detail below, modified the amendments in
certain respects in light of the comments received. In addition, the Commission has

proposed amendments.

AMENDMENTS
A.

Amendments to the Customer Protection Rule
1.

Background

The Commission adopted Rule 15c3-3 in 1972 in response to a congressional
directive to strengthen the financial responsibility requirements for broker-dealers that
hold securities and cash for customers. 7 In particular, Rule 15c3-3 is designed “to give
more specific protection to customer funds and securities, in effect forbidding brokers
and dealers from using customer assets to finance any part of their businesses unrelated to
servicing securities customers; e.g., a firm is virtually precluded from using customer
funds to buy securities for its own account.” 8 To meet this objective, Rule 15c3-3
requires a broker-dealer that maintains custody of customer securities and cash (a

this rulemaking are not addressed in this release.

“carrying broker-dealer”) to take two primary steps to safeguard these assets. The steps
are designed to protect customers 9 by segregating their securities and cash from the
broker-dealer’s proprietary business activities. If the broker-dealer fails financially, the
securities and cash should be readily available to be returned to the customers. In
addition, if the failed broker-dealer is liquidated in a formal proceeding under the
Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970 (“SIPA”), the securities and cash would be
isolated and readily identifiable as “customer property” and, consequently, available to be
distributed to customers ahead of other creditors. 10
The first step required by Rule 15c3-3 is that a carrying broker-dealer must
maintain physical possession or control over customers’ fully paid and excess margin

Rule 15c3-3 defines customer as “any person from whom or on whose behalf a broker or
dealer has received or acquired or holds funds or securities for the account of that
person.” The rule excludes certain categories of persons from the definition, including
broker-dealers, municipal securities dealers, and government securities broker-dealers. It
also excludes general partners, directors, and principal officers of the broker-dealer and
any other person to the extent that the person has a claim for property or funds which by
contract, agreement or understanding, or by operation of law, is part of the capital of the
broker-dealer or is subordinated to the claims of creditors of the broker-dealer. 17 CFR

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(b) and (d). The term fully paid securities includes all securities
carried for the account of a customer in a special cash account as defined in Regulation T
promulgated by the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, as well as margin
equity securities within the meaning of Regulation T which are carried for the account of
a customer in a general account or any special account under Regulation T during any
period when section 8 of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.8) specifies that margin equity
securities shall have no loan value in a general account or special convertible debt
security account, and all such margin equity securities in such account if they are fully
paid: provided, however, that the term fully paid securities shall not apply to any
securities which are purchased in transactions for which the customer has not made full
payment. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(3). The term margin securities means those securities
carried for the account of a customer in a general account as defined in Regulation T, as
well as securities carried in any special account other than the securities referred to in
paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 15c3-3. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(4). The term excess margin
securities means those securities referred to in paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 15c3-3 carried for
the account of a customer having a market value in excess of 140 percent of the total of
the debit balances in the customer’s account or accounts encompassed by paragraph

9

securities in one of several locations specified in Rule 15c3-3 and free of liens or any
other interest that could be exercised by a third party to secure an obligation of the
broker-dealer. 12 Permissible locations include a bank, as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the
Exchange Act, and a clearing agency. 13
The second step is that a carrying broker-dealer must maintain a reserve of cash or
qualified securities in an account at a bank that is at least equal in value to the net cash
owed to customers, including cash obtained from the use of customer securities. 14 The
account must be titled “Special Reserve Bank Account for the Exclusive Benefit of
Customers.” 15 The amount of net cash owed to customers is computed pursuant to a
formula set forth in Exhibit A to Rule 15c3-3. 16 Under the customer reserve formula, the
broker-dealer adds up customer credit items (e.g., cash in customer securities accounts
and cash obtained through the use of customer margin securities) and then subtracts from
that amount customer debit items (e.g., margin loans). 17 If credit items exceed debit
items, the net amount must be on deposit in the customer reserve account in the form of
(a)(4) of Rule 15c3-3 which the broker-dealer identifies as not constituting margin
securities. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(5). As discussed in section II.F. of this release, the
Commission is adopting technical amendments to the definitions of the terms fully paid
securities and margin securities under Rule 15c3-3. See paragraphs (a)(3) and (4) of Rule
15c3-3, as adopted.
12

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(c). Customer securities held by the carrying broker-dealer are
not assets of the firm. Rather, the carrying broker-dealer holds them in a custodial
capacity and the possession and control requirement is designed to ensure that the
carrying broker-dealer treats them in a manner that allows for their prompt return.

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e)(1). The purpose of giving the account this title is to alert the

cash and/or qualified securities. 18 A broker-dealer cannot make a withdrawal from the
customer reserve account until the next computation and even then only if the
computation shows that the reserve requirement has decreased. 19 The broker-dealer must
make a deposit into the customer reserve account if the computation shows an increase in
the reserve requirement.
In addition, the customer reserve formula permits the broker-dealer to offset
customer credit items only with customer debit items. 20 This means the broker-dealer
can use customer cash to facilitate customer transactions such as financing customer
margin loans and borrowing securities to make deliveries of securities that customers
have sold short. 21 Broker-dealer margin rules require securities customers to maintain a

18

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e). Customer cash is a balance sheet item of the carrying brokerdealer (i.e., the amount of cash received from a customer increases the amount of the
carrying broker-dealer’s assets and creates a corresponding liability to the customer).
The customer reserve formula is designed to isolate these broker-dealer assets so that an
amount equal to the net liabilities to customers is held as a reserve in the form of cash or
qualified securities. The requirement to establish this reserve is designed to effectively
prevent the carrying broker-dealer from using customer funds for proprietary business
activities such as investing in securities. The goal is to put the carrying broker-dealer in a
position to be able to readily meet its cash obligations to customers by requiring the firm
to make deposits of cash and/or qualified securities into the customer reserve account in
the amount of the net cash owed to customers. Capital, Margin, and Segregation

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e). Under paragraph (e), broker-dealers are generally required to
perform the customer reserve computation as of the close of business on the last business

if it would permit them to make a withdrawal. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(g).

For example, if a broker-dealer holds $100 for customer A, the broker-dealer can use that
$100 to finance a security purchase of customer B. The $100 the broker-dealer owes
customer A is a credit in the formula and the $100 customer B owes the broker-dealer is a
debit in the formula. Therefore, under the customer reserve formula there would be no
requirement to maintain cash and/or U.S. government securities in the customer reserve
account. However, if the broker-dealer did not use the $100 held in customer A’s
account for this purpose, there would be no offsetting debit and, consequently, the
broker-dealer would need to have on deposit in the customer reserve account cash and/or
qualified securities in an amount at least equal to $100.

minimum level of equity in their securities accounts. 22 In addition to protecting the
broker-dealer from the consequences of a customer default, this equity serves to overcollateralize the customers’ obligations to the broker-dealer and thereby protect
customers whose cash was used to facilitate the broker-dealer’s financing of securities
purchases and short sales by other customers. For example, if the broker-dealer fails, the
customer debits, because they generally are over-collateralized, should be attractive
assets for another broker-dealer to purchase or, if not purchased by another broker-dealer,
they should be able to be liquidated to a net positive equity. 23 The proceeds of the debits
sale or liquidation can be used to repay the customer cash used to finance the customer
obligations. This cash plus the funds and/or qualified securities held in the customer
reserve account should equal or exceed the total amount of customer credit items (i.e., the
total amount owed by the broker-dealer to its customers). 24
2.

Proprietary Accounts of Broker-Dealers

A carrying broker-dealer may carry accounts that hold proprietary securities and
cash of other broker-dealers (“PAB accounts”). As noted above, broker-dealers are not
within the definition of customer for purposes of Rule 15c3-3. 25 Accordingly, a carrying
broker-dealer that carries PAB accounts is not required to treat these accounts as
22

Broker-dealers are subject to margin requirements in Regulation T promulgated by the
Federal Reserve (see 12 CFR 220.1, et seq.), in rules promulgated by the self-regulatory
organizations (“SROs”) (see, e.g., FINRA Rules 4210–4240), and with respect to security
futures, in rules jointly promulgated by the Commission and the CFTC (see 17 CFR
242.400–406).

23

The attractiveness of the over-collateralized debits facilitates the bulk transfer of
customer accounts from a failing or failed broker-dealer to another broker-dealer.

24

See Net Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers; Amended Rules, Exchange Act
Release No. 18417 (Jan. 13, 1982), 47 FR 3512, 3513 (Jan. 25, 1982) (“The alternative
method is founded on the concept that if the debit items in the Reserve Formula can be
liquidated at or near their contract values, these assets, along with any cash required to be
on deposit under the [customer protection] rule, will be sufficient to satisfy all customerrelated liabilities (which are represented as credit items in the Reserve Formula”).

25

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(1).

12

customer accounts for the purposes of Rule 15c3-3. This means the carrying brokerdealer is not required to maintain possession or control of the securities of PAB account
holders that are not securing margin loans to the account holders (“non-margin
securities”) or include credit and debit items associated with those accounts in its
customer reserve computation. The definition of customer in SIPA, however, is broader
than the definition in Rule 15c3-3 in that the SIPA definition does not exclude brokerdealers. 26 Customers under SIPA (“SIPA customers”) generally are entitled to a number
of protections, including the right to share pro rata with other SIPA customers in the
customer property held by the broker-dealer and, if the customer property is insufficient
to make each SIPA customer whole, the entitlement to receive an advance from the
Securities Investor Protection Corporation (“SIPC”) of up to $500,000 (of which
$250,000 currently can be used to cover cash claims). 27 Broker-dealers as SIPA
customers have the right to a pro rata share of the customer property, but are not entitled
to receive an advance from the SIPC fund. 28 Consequently, when a carrying brokerdealer is liquidated in a SIPA proceeding, each customer (including a SIPA customer that
is a broker-dealer) has a claim on the customer property. Because the possession and
control and customer reserve account provisions of Rule 15c3-3 do not apply to PAB
account holders by virtue of the definition of customer in the rule, the carrying broker-

See 15 U.S.C. 78lll(2).

27

See 15 U.S.C. 78fff-2(c) and 15 U.S.C. 78fff-3(a), respectively. Under SIPA, customer
property includes “cash and securities (except customer name securities delivered to the
customer) at any time received, acquired, or held by or for the account of the debtor from
or for the securities accounts of a customer, and the proceeds of any such property
transferred by the debtor, including property unlawfully converted.” 15 U.S.C. 78lll(4).
Therefore, customer property includes those securities positions that are held for
customers and the cash that is owed to customers.

See 15 U.S.C. 78fff-2(c); see also 15 U.S.C. 78fff-3(a).

13

dealer is not restricted by Rule 15c3-3 from using the securities and cash in these
accounts for its own business purposes.
The treatment of PAB account holders as SIPA customers but not as customers
for the purposes of Rule 15c3-3 increases the risk that, in the event a carrying brokerdealer is liquidated under SIPA, the claims of SIPA customers (i.e., customers and PAB
account holders) will exceed the amount of customer property available and, thereby,
expose the SIPC fund and potentially SIPA customers to losses. In addition, if the
customer property is insufficient to fully satisfy all SIPA customer claims and losses are
incurred, the PAB account holders could be placed in financial distress causing adverse
impacts to the securities markets beyond those resulting from the failure of the carrying
broker-dealer. 29
To address the disparity in treatment between customers and PAB account
holders, the Commission proposed amendments to Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a that would
have required a broker-dealer that carries PAB accounts to perform a PAB reserve
computation with respect to those accounts, generally as of the close of business on the
last business day of the week. 30 The amendments, as proposed, would have required the
carrying broker-dealer to add up the debits and credits relating to PAB accounts –
including credits arising from the use of securities held in PAB accounts – and maintain
cash or qualified securities in a PAB reserve account in an amount equal to or greater
than the amount that the credits exceed the debits.

29

As noted above, while broker-dealers are customers for the purposes of SIPA, they are
not entitled to the advances from the SIPC fund to make up for shortfalls after the pro
rata distribution of customer property. 15 U.S.C. 78fff-3(a)(5).

30

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12863. A broker-dealer
that does not carry an account of a customer as defined under Rule 15c3-3 or conduct a
proprietary trading business would be permitted to make the computation monthly rather
than weekly. See paragraph (e)(3)(iii) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted.

14

Seven commenters responded to the Commission’s request for comment on the
proposed amendments. 31 As discussed below, the Commission has modified the final
rule in certain respects to address, among other things, issues raised by commenters. As
adopted, the Commission’s amendments to Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a require carrying
broker-dealers to: (1) perform a separate reserve computation for PAB accounts (in
addition to the customer reserve computation currently required for Rule 15c3-3
customer accounts); (2) establish and fund a separate reserve account for the benefit of
PAB account holders; and (3) obtain and maintain physical possession or control of nonmargin securities carried for PAB accounts unless the carrying broker has provided
written notice to the PAB account holders that it will use those securities in the ordinary
course of its securities business, and has provided opportunity for the PAB account
holder to object to such use. 32
These amendments, in part, incorporate many of the provisions of a no-action
letter regarding PAB accounts issued by Commission staff in 1998. 33 The PAIB Letter
stated that the staff would not recommend enforcement action to the Commission if a
broker-dealer did not take a net capital deduction under Rule 15c3-1 for cash held in a
securities account at another broker-dealer, 34 provided the other broker-dealer agrees to:

See infra section II.A.2.ii. of this release for a discussion of the Commission’s rationale
for the change in the final rule to require a carrying broker-dealer provide notice to, rather

used in the ordinary course of the carrying firm’s securities business.

Under Rule 15c3-1, broker-dealers are generally required to deduct unsecured receivables
from their net worth when computing their net capital.

(1) perform a reserve computation for PAB accounts; 35 (2) establish a separate special
reserve bank account; and (3) maintain cash or qualified securities in the reserve account
equal to the computed reserve requirement (“PAIB agreement”). Broker-dealers that
carry PAB accounts have the incentive to enter into PAIB agreements to prevent their
PAB account holders from choosing to open an account or enter into a clearing
agreement with another broker-dealer. Because many of the provisions in the PAIB
Letter are being incorporated in this rulemaking, the Commission is directing the
Commission staff to withdraw the PAIB Letter as of the effective date of these rule
amendments.
i.

Definition of “PAB account” under Rule 15c3-3(a)(16)

The Commission proposed, among other things, to add paragraph (a)(16) to Rule
15c3-3 that would have defined the term PAB account as “a proprietary securities
account of a broker or dealer (which includes a foreign broker or dealer, or a foreign bank
acting as a broker or dealer), but shall not include an account where the account owner is
a guaranteed subsidiary of the carrying broker or dealer, the account owner guarantees all
liabilities and obligations of the carrying broker or dealer, or the account is a deliveryversus-payment account or receipt-versus-payment account.” 36 Two commenters raised
concerns about the proposed definition because – by including proprietary accounts of
foreign broker-dealers and foreign banks acting as broker-dealers within the term PAB
account – it differed from provisions in the PAIB Letter, which excluded such accounts
35

Under new paragraph (e)(3), broker-dealers will be required to perform the PAB reserve
account computation (and its customer reserve account computation, if applicable) on a
weekly basis, as of the close of business on the last business day of the week. With
regard to PAB accounts, a broker-dealer that does not carry an account of a customer as
defined under Rule 15c3-3 or conduct a proprietary trading business may make the PAB
reserve account computation monthly rather than weekly. See new paragraph (e)(3)(iii)
of Rule 15c3-3.

from a PAIB computation. 37 One of these commenters stated that broker-dealers
(including foreign banks acting as broker-dealers) should be allowed to opt-out of PAB
account treatment because they do not require the same protections as customers as
defined in Rule 15c3-3. 38 The commenter stated that broker-dealers are able to
understand the insolvency risk of the broker-dealers at which they maintain proprietary
accounts. 39 This commenter noted that broker-dealer customers often self-insure or
otherwise account for such exposure regardless of their status under SIPA. 40 The second
commenter stated that foreign broker-dealers and foreign banks acting as broker-dealers
should be allowed to subordinate their claims to customers and creditors of the brokerdealer in order to remove their accounts from PAB account treatment because under
SIPA foreign broker-dealers and foreign banks acting as broker-dealers, under certain
circumstances, will not be deemed customers and, therefore, would not be entitled to a
pro rata share of the estate of customer property in a SIPA liquidation. 41 More
specifically, the commenter suggested that the Commission modify the definition of PAB
account, to exclude “any foreign broker-dealer and foreign bank to the extent that such
entity has a claim for cash or securities that is subordinated to the claims of creditors of
the carrying broker-dealer” in order to parallel the language in SIPA. 42 This commenter

37

See Dresdner Kleinwort Letter; Deutsche Bank Securities Letter. Though SIFMA
initially raised concerns about the proposed definition, it later withdrew its
recommendation that proprietary accounts of affiliated non-U.S. broker-dealers and nonU.S. banks be excluded from the PAB account definition. See SIFMA 2 Letter; SIFMA 4
Letter.

The definition of customer in SIPA excludes any person, to the extent that “such person
has a claim for cash or securities which by contract, agreement, or understanding, or by
operation of law, is part of the capital of the debtor, or is subordinated to the claims of

17

also recommended requiring the “subordinating” broker-dealer to follow the
requirements for non-conforming subordinated loans to remove an account from PAB
account treatment. 43
Another commenter stated that the Commission’s desire to close the gap between
Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA must be balanced against the potentially significant practical
issues the Commission’s proposal would raise in the case of accounts carried for
affiliated entities operating in non-U.S. jurisdictions. 44 In a subsequent letter, this
commenter stated that while it would prefer a more flexible solution that would allow
broker-dealers and non-U.S. banks acting as broker-dealers (especially non-U.S.
affiliates) to opt to have their accounts treated as neither customer accounts under SIPA
nor PAB accounts, the commenter recognized that there is a clear need for an immediate
solution that cannot be delayed until appropriate amendments to SIPA are adopted. 45
Consequently, the commenter withdrew its recommendation that the proprietary accounts
of affiliated non-U.S. broker-dealers and affiliated non-U.S. banks be excluded from the
“PAB account” definition, but continued to endorse its previous comments to achieve the

any and all creditors of the debtor, notwithstanding that some grounds exist for declaring
such contract, agreement, or understanding void or voidable in a suit between the
claimant and the debtor.” See 15 U.S.C. 78lll(2)(C)(iii).
43

See Deutsche Bank Securities Letter. See also SIFMA 4 Letter. Under Rule 15c3-1, a
broker-dealer can exclude liabilities that are subordinated to the claims of creditors
pursuant to a satisfactory subordination agreement, as defined in Appendix D to Rule
15c3-1, for purposes determining its net capital. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(ii) and 17
CFR 240.15c3-1d. See also 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(i)(x). A non-conforming
subordination agreement generally would not meet all the requirements of Appendix D to
Rule 15c3-1, and, therefore, a broker-dealer could not exclude the liability resulting from
the loan agreement in computing its net capital. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(ii).

44

See SIFMA 2 Letter. This commenter specifically raised concerns that it would be
cumbersome to subject transactions between a carrying broker-dealer and its foreign
affiliates to the proposed PAB requirements because of the integrated securities
processing and settlement activities of these entities, which would limit the ability of the
group as a whole to provide competitive services to U.S. investors.

45

See SIFMA 4 Letter.

18

goal of correcting the gap between Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA without creating undue or
unintended burdens. 46
The goal of the proposed amendments is to create a process that protects Rule
15c3-3 customers and PAB account holders of a failed carrying broker-dealer. The
amendments are designed to provide such protection by mitigating the risk that there will
be insufficient customer property to fully satisfy all customer claims in a SIPA
liquidation. The entitlement of PAB account holders to a pro rata share of the fund of
customer property places all SIPA customers at risk if the carrying firm does not establish
a PAB reserve account for excess credits owed to PAB account holders.
At the same time, the Commission appreciates the need to consider both the
practical issues raised by commenters and its objective to eliminate the inconsistency
between Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA. 47 Accordingly, in response to commenters, the final rule
adopted by the Commission excludes from the definition of PAB account in paragraph
(a)(16) of Rule 15c3-3 “an account that has been subordinated to the claims of creditors
of the carrying broker or dealer.” 48 A PAB account holder that has subordinated its
claims with respect to that account to claims of creditors of the carrying broker-dealer
will not be entitled to SIPA protection for that account. 49 Consequently, this provision
will provide flexibility to carrying broker-dealers and their broker-dealer affiliates to
structure their PAB account relationships in a manner that permits operational
46

See SIFMA 4 Letter. Among other things, the commenter suggested that the
Commission modify the proposed definition of PAB account to exclude any customer as
defined in Rule 15c3-3 and also to exclude the other types of persons who are specifically
excluded from the definition of customer. This suggestion included excluding accounts
whose claims are subordinated to the claims of other creditors of the carrying brokerdealer. Id.

efficiencies (i.e., the ability to exclude these accounts from the PAB reserve computation)
while still promoting the goal of the amendments to have a consistent treatment of these
accounts under Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA, and thereby protect accounts holders that are
“customers” under SIPA. 50 If a U.S. broker-dealer, however, chooses to subordinate its
claims to assets in that account to the claims of other creditors of the carrying brokerdealer, it will not be able to include those assets as allowable for its own net capital
computation. 51
Further, as was proposed, the definition of PAB account in the final rule excludes
accounts that operate on a delivery-versus-payment or a receipt-versus-payment basis, or
“DVP/RVP” basis, because these accounts generally hold securities and cash for short
durations. 52 The provision relating to DVP/RVP accounts is being adopted substantially
as proposed, though paragraph (a)(16), as adopted, has been modified by splitting the text
into two sentences. As adopted, the reference to the DVP/RVP accounts provision was
moved to the first sentence. The Commission is not adopting the proposed exclusions
from the PAB reserve computation requirement related to accounts established by a PAB
account holder that fully guarantee the obligations of, or whose accounts are fully
guaranteed by, the carrying broker-dealer. Rather than create a specific exemption for
such account holders, the Commission believes the better approach is to allow these
accounts to enter into subordination agreements with the carrying broker-dealer, in order
50

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(1) and 15 U.S.C. 78lll(2)(C)(ii). These accounts will be
excluded from both the definition of PAB account, as well from the definition of
customer under SIPA. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at
12863. Consequently, these account holders will not be entitled to the protections in
SIPA applicable to customers.

51

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(E).

52

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12863, n.17 (“[T]he
amendment would exclude delivery-versus-payment and receipt-versus-payment
accounts. These types of accounts pose little risk of reducing the estate of customer
property in a SIPA liquidation since they only hold assets for short periods of time.”).

20

for these accounts to be excluded from the definition of PAB account. This approach
simplifies the final rule, while continuing to provide a means for these account holders to
be excluded from its scope. Consequently, as adopted, paragraph (a)(16) to Rule 15c3-3
defines the term PAB account to mean “a proprietary securities account of a broker or
dealer (which includes a foreign broker or dealer, or a foreign bank acting as a broker or
dealer) other than a delivery-versus-payment account or a receipt-versus-payment
account.” 53 The definition of PAB Account does not include accounts that have been
subordinated to the claims of a carrying broker-dealer’s creditors. 54
ii.

Written Permission to Use PAB Account Securities

Because PAB account holders are not customers for purposes of Rule 15c3-3, a
carrying broker-dealer is not required to maintain possession or control of their nonmargin securities. Consequently, it has been a long-standing industry practice for
carrying broker-dealers to use these PAB securities in their business activities. Under the
final rule, a carrying broker-dealer that uses these PAB securities will need to include the
market value of the securities as a credit in the formula when performing the PAB reserve
computation. Thus, the amount that the carrying broker-dealer must maintain in its PAB
reserve account will increase by the amount of these credits because there would be no
corresponding debit item. 55
Using non-margin securities of PAB account holders presents the risk that
securities may increase in market value between PAB reserve computations and,
therefore, the amount of the credit items in the formula may be less than the value of the
securities for a short period of time. To accommodate industry practice, however, the

21

Commission did not propose amending Rule 15c3-3 to apply the possession or control
requirements to PAB accounts. The Commission proposed adding paragraph (b)(5) to
Rule 15c3-3 that would have required the carrying broker-dealer to obtain written
permission from a PAB account holder before it could use the PAB account holder’s
securities in the ordinary course of its securities business. In this way, the Commission
proposed increasing the protections for PAB account holders without interfering with
long-standing industry practice of carrying broker-dealers using the securities of their
broker-dealer account holders. However, securities not being used by the broker-dealer
must be maintained in accordance with the possession or control requirements of Rule
15c3-3.
One commenter stated that this provision should be eliminated from the proposed
amendments, arguing that “[t]he proposal interferes unnecessarily in the contractual
arrangements between broker-dealers, which are capable of understanding the terms of
standard industry custodial relationships.” 56 The commenter also noted that the PAIB
Letter did not contain any such requirement. 57 The Commission agrees with the
commenter that broker-dealers should be able to understand the implications of granting
another broker-dealer the ability to use their non-margin securities and, therefore, the
final rule requires written notice rather than written permission. An appropriate level of
protection for the PAB account holder may be achieved without requiring the carrying
broker-dealer to maintain possession or control of securities carried for a PAB account,

provided that the carrying broker-dealer gives written notice to its PAB account holders
that it may use their non-margin securities. 58
The Commission acknowledges that this change, as compared to the proposed
rule, will shift the burden to the PAB account holder to proactively object to the carrying
broker-dealer using the account holder’s securities. However, the new written notice
requirement increases the protections for PAB account holders from the status quo
without imposing substantial burdens on existing account relationships. The revised rule
is intended to provide to the PAB account holders the opportunity to negotiate different
terms if they do not want their securities used, while eliminating the need for, and the
costs that would result from, carrying broker-dealers reworking existing contracts.
As adopted, the Commission is modifying the final rule to add the phrase “and
has provided an opportunity for the account holder to object” following the phrase
“ordinary course of its securities business.” 59 This language was added to the final rule
to impose a requirement that the carrying broker-dealer provide the PAB account holders
an opportunity to object to the use of their non-margin securities after they receive the
written notice from the carrying broker-dealer. The rule does not prescribe the form in
which a PAB account holder must provide notice to the carrying broker-dealer of its
objection. This will provide the PAB account holder with flexibility to communicate the
objection in a manner the account holder determines is most effective in terms of
conveying such objection to the carrying broker-dealer. If the PAB account holder
objects, the carrying broker-dealer could not use the securities. Further, the PAB account

The Commission has deleted the phrase “obtained the written permission of the account
owner to use the securities in the ordinary course of its securities business” from
paragraph (b)(5) of the final rule and replaced it with “provided written notice to the
account holder that the securities may be used in the ordinary course of its securities
business, and has provided an opportunity for the account holder to object.”

holder could seek to move the account to another carrying broker-dealer or negotiate
different terms with the carrying broker-dealer with regard to the use of its securities.
Finally, the Commission has modified proposed paragraph (b)(5) to clarify in the
final rule that a broker-dealer is affirmatively required to maintain possession and control
of non-margin securities unless the broker-dealer has provided written notice to the PAB
account holder. 60 As modified, paragraph (b)(5) reads: “A broker or dealer is required to
obtain and thereafter maintain the physical possession or control of securities carried for
a PAB account, unless the broker or dealer has provided written notice to the account
holder that the securities may be used in the ordinary course of its securities business, and
has provided an opportunity for the account holder to object.” 61
iii.

PAB Reserve Bank Accounts

The Commission proposed amendments to paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 to
require a carrying broker with PAB accounts to establish and maintain a PAB reserve
account for PAB accounts, perform a separate PAB reserve computation for PAB
accounts, and maintain cash or qualified securities in the PAB reserve account in an
amount equal to the PAB reserve requirement. 62 The Commission also proposed
amendments to paragraph (f) of Rule 15c3-3 to require carrying broker-dealers with PAB
accounts to notify the bank about the status of the PAB reserve account and obtain an
agreement and notification from the bank that the PAB reserve account will be
maintained for the benefit of the PAB account holders. 63 The Commission is adopting

60

The modifications replaced the phrase “shall not be required” with the phrase “is
required” and replaced the phrase “provided that” with the word “unless.”

these amendments to paragraphs (e) and (f) of Rule 15c3-3 substantially as proposed,
with some technical modifications suggested by one commenter, including making
terminology consistent throughout the paragraphs. 64 In addition, the Commission is
adopting substantially as proposed the amendments to paragraph (g) of Rule 15c3-3
which specifies when the carrying broker-dealer can make withdrawals from a PAB
reserve account. 65 Finally, the Commission is adopting, as proposed, new paragraph
(e)(4) to Rule 15c3-3, which allows a carrying broker-dealer to use credits related to PAB
accounts to finance Rule 15c3-3 customer debits, but does not allow a carrying brokerdealer to use Rule 15c3-3 customer credits to finance PAB debits.
iv.

Other PAB Issues Raised by Commenters

In addition to specific comments on the proposed rule language, one commenter
had other interpretive questions and comments about the proposed PAB requirements. 66
The commenter requested that the Commission clarify whether PAB account holders
must obtain from their carrying broker-dealers a written agreement to perform the
calculation as required by the PAIB Letter. 67 Under the amendments, there is no
requirement that PAB account holders obtain a written agreement from the carrying firm
that it will perform the PAB reserve computation. Rule 15c3-3, as amended, requires the
carrying firm to perform the PAB reserve computation. As stated above, Rule 15c3-3

64

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

65

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(g). In this paragraph, the Commission deleted the phrase “his
Reserve Bank Accounts” and replaced it with the phrase “a Customer Reserve Bank
Account and PAB Reserve Bank Account.” The Commission also deleted the phrase
“each Reserve Bank Account” and replaced it with the phrase “the Customer Reserve
Bank Account and PAB Reserve Bank Account.” These were the only changes made to
the final rule in paragraph (g) of Rule 15c3-3.

66

See SIMFA 2 Letter.

prescribes the requirements for carrying firms with respect to PAB accounts, and the
PAIB Letter is being withdrawn. 68
In addition, the commenter requested the Commission to clarify that existing
PAIB reserve accounts need not be re-titled to comply with the proposed amendments. 69
Item 4 of the PAIB Letter required that a carrying broker-dealer, “establish and maintain
a separate ‘Special Reserve Account for the Exclusive Benefit of Customers’ with a bank
in conformity with the standards of paragraph (f) of Rule 15c3-3.” Paragraph (e)(1) of
Rule 15c3-3, however, requires that a carrying broker-dealer establish and maintain a
“Special Reserve Bank Account for Brokers and Dealers.” Given the small differences in
nomenclature and the time and expense associated with broker-dealers re-titling these
accounts, a carrying broker-dealer that has properly established PAB reserve account in
the manner described in Item 4 of the PAIB Letter need not re-title the account and obtain
a new notification from the bank. 70 However, all PAB reserve accounts established on or
after the effective date of these amendments must title the account in accordance with
paragraph (e)(1) of Rule 15c3-3.
Finally, the commenter urged the Commission to clarify whether, for purposes of
Rule 15c3-1, the term aggregate debit items means total aggregate debit items computed
in accordance with the customer reserve formula or the total aggregate debit items
computed in accordance with both the customer reserve formula and the PAB reserve
formula. 71 Aggregate debit items are used in the net capital rule to determine the
minimum net capital requirement for broker-dealers that elect to use the alternative

As discussed above in this section II.A.2., the Commission is directing the staff to
withdraw the PAIB Letter as of the effective date of these rules.

standard in computing their minimum net capital requirement. Specifically, the net
capital rule requires broker-dealers using the alternative standard to maintain net capital
of at least the greater of $250,000 or 2% of aggregate debit items. 72 Including PAB
aggregate debit items in this computation would significantly increase net capital
requirements for broker-dealers that use the alternative method. The intended purpose of
this rule change is to address the inconsistencies between Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA – not to
increase net capital requirements. Consequently, the requirements in Rules 15c3-1, 15c31d, and 17a-11 that refer to aggregate debit items continue to be based only on aggregate
debit items computed in accordance with the customer reserve computation, and do not
include aggregate debit items computed in accordance with the PAB reserve
computation. 73
v.

Amendment to Rule 15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(E) Related to PAB
Accounts

Finally, the Commission proposed an amendment to Rule 15c3-1 74 that would
have required a broker-dealer, when calculating net capital, to deduct from net worth cash
and securities held in a securities account at another broker-dealer if the other brokerdealer does not treat the account, and the assets therein, in compliance with the applicable

72

17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii). In addition, certain other financial responsibility rules
require that a broker-dealer that computes net capital pursuant to the alternative method
either report to the Commission, limit its ability to obtain, pre-pay, or repay subordinated
debt, or limit its business if its net capital falls below a certain level based on a
percentage of aggregate debit items (see, e.g., Rules 15c3-1(e)(2)(vi), 15c3-1d(b)(6)(iii),
15c3-1d(b)(7), 15c3-1d(b)(8)(i)(A), 15c3-1d(b)(10)(ii)(B), 15c3-1d(c)(2), 15c31d(c)(5)(ii)(A), and 17a-11(c)(2)).

73

Under paragraph (e)(4) to Rule 15c3-3, a carrying broker-dealer will be permitted to use
credits related to PAB accounts to finance Rule 15c3-3 customer debits. This rule,
however, does not affect the use of aggregate debit items in computing a broker-dealer’s
net capital under the alternative standard pursuant to paragraph (a)(1)(ii) of Rule 15c3-1.

74

17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(E).

27

PAB reserve account requirements of Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a. 75 A commenter
suggested modifying this proposed amendment, 76 arguing that “[a]lthough the Proposing
Release states that the Commission ‘would not expect broker-dealers to audit or examine
their carrying broker-dealers to determine whether the carrying broker-dealer is in
compliance with [the proposed rules],’ the text of the proposed amendment suggests that
they in fact would have such an obligation.” 77 The commenter also stated that a brokerdealer should not be deemed to have violated Rule 15c3-1 merely because its carrying
firm fails to properly perform requirements solely applicable to the carrying firm and that
paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(E) under Rule 15c3-1 should be explicitly modified to clarify that
cash and securities held in a securities account at another broker-dealer are not subject to
the deduction specified in that paragraph. 78
While the Commission did not intend to impose any monitoring requirement on
the PAB account holder, the Commission recognizes that the language, as proposed,
could have implied such a requirement and agrees with the commenter that a brokerdealer should not be deemed to have violated Rule 15c3-1 with respect to requirements
that are solely applicable to the carrying broker-dealer. To address this concern, the
Commission has modified the language in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(E) under Rule 15c3-1 to
eliminate the proposed capital charge of Rule 15c3-1 that would have resulted from a
failure of a carrying broker-dealer to comply with the PAB requirements in Rule 15c33. 79

Instead, the Commission has adopted amendments to Rule 15c3-1 providing that a
broker-dealer need not deduct cash and securities held in a securities account at a
carrying broker-dealer except where the account has been subordinated to the claims of
creditors of the carrying broker-dealer. 80 This provision is intended to prevent brokerdealers from including assets in their net capital that may not be readily available to be
returned because they would not be subject to the PAB account provisions discussed
above. Accordingly, the amendments to paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(E) of Rule 15c3-1 are
consistent with the exclusions from the definition of PAB account in paragraph (a)(16) of
Rule 15c3-3. 81

Banks Where Special Reserve Deposits May Be Held

As amended, paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 requires a broker-dealer to deposit
cash or qualified securities into the customer or PAB reserve account, 82 which must be
maintained at a bank. 83 While cash deposits at a bank are fungible and may be used by
the bank in its lending and investment activities, paragraph (f) of Rule 15c3-3 requires
that a broker-dealer obtain a written contract from the bank wherein the bank agrees not
to re-lend or hypothecate securities deposited into the reserve account. 84 This means the
bank cannot use the securities in its business, which provides a measure of protection by
requiring that the securities will be available to the broker-dealer if the bank falls into
dealer does not treat the account, and the assets therein in compliance with paragraphs
(b)(5) and (e) of § 240.15c3-3 . . . .”

The PAB reserve account and the customer reserve account are collectively referred to as

The term bank is defined in paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 15c3-3 as a “bank as defined in
section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act and will also mean any building and loan, savings

authority.” See paragraph (a)(7) to Rule 15c3-3, as adopted.

financial difficulty. Cash deposits, however, may be freely used in the course of the
bank’s commercial activities. 85 Therefore, to the extent a broker-dealer deposits cash in a
reserve account, there is a risk the cash could become inaccessible if the bank
experiences financial difficulties. 86 This could adversely impact the broker-dealer and its
customers. 87 To limit these risks, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-3
that would have: (1) prohibited a broker-dealer from maintaining cash deposits in the
reserve accounts for customers and PAB account holders if the bank was affiliated; and
(2) limited the amount of cash that could be deposited in both types of reserve accounts at
non-affiliated banks. 88 These restrictions would not have applied to securities held in the
reserve accounts because, as noted above, the bank must agree not to use the securities in
its business. The goal of the proposals was to limit cash reserve account deposits to
reasonably safe amounts as measured against the capitalization of the broker-dealer and
the bank. 89
Specifically, as proposed, paragraph (e)(5) of 15c3-3 provided that a carrying
broker-dealer would have been required to exclude the amount of cash deposited into
reserve accounts at affiliated banks when determining whether it maintained the
minimum amount required to be on deposit in the reserve accounts for its customers and
PAB account holders. In addition, the proposed amendment would have required a
carrying broker-dealer to exclude cash deposited in a reserve account at an unaffiliated
bank to the extent the amount of the cash deposited exceeded: (1) 50% of the brokerdealer’s excess net capital (based on the broker-dealer’s most recently filed FOCUS

Report); 90 or (2) 10% of the bank’s equity capital (based on the bank’s most recently
filed Call Report or Thrift Financial Report). 91
The Commission is adopting the amendments with modifications designed to
address issues identified by commenters. Twenty-three commenters addressed the
proposed amendments. 92 Fifteen commenters urged the Commission not to adopt the
proposed prohibition on broker-dealers maintaining cash in reserve accounts at affiliated
banks. 93 These commenters generally stated that, with regard to cash in reserve accounts,
affiliated banks should be treated the same as unaffiliated banks because both groups are
subject to the same financial regulation. 94 These commenters noted that banks are
subject to safety and soundness requirements of their respective banking regulators and,
90

Under Rule 17a-5, broker-dealers must file periodic reports on Form X-17a-5 (Financial
and Operational Combined Uniform Single Reports) (“FOCUS Reports”). See 17 CFR
240.17a-5(a). The FOCUS Report requires, among other financial information, a balance
sheet, income statement, and net capital and customer reserve computations. Excess net
capital is the amount that a broker-dealer’s net capital exceeds its minimum requirement.

therefore, the commenters argued that the proposed restriction with respect to affiliated
banks is unwarranted.
One commenter also stated that the Commission’s distinction between affiliated
and unaffiliated banks was not sufficiently supported in the proposing release. 95 More
specifically, this commenter stated that the Commission’s “bare statement that a brokerdealer ‘may not exercise due diligence with the same degree of impartiality when
assessing the soundness of an affiliate bank as it would with a non-affiliate...’ does not
suffice to justify the disparate treatment” with regard to the treatment of affiliated banks
under the proposed rule. 96 This commenter also stated that it is just as easy to argue that
broker-dealers are in a much better position to know about the soundness of an affiliated
bank then to learn about the soundness of a unaffiliated bank, which may not be willing
to provide complete and accurate information. 97 In addition, another commenter stated
that the Commission cited no empirical or anecdotal evidence to support its reasons for
prohibiting cash reserve deposits at an affiliated bank. 98 This commenter also stated that
the Commission’s concerns discount the operational efficiencies to be gained between an
affiliated broker-dealer and its bank, including: commonality between certain policies
and procedures; greater ease in communication internally; and greater operational
efficiencies leading to reduced operational risk in the transfer of funds to and from the
bank. 99

One commenter stated that it took no issue with the proposed restriction on
affiliated banks. 100 Another commenter noted that the financial industry has seen a
remarkable consolidation of the banking and securities industries, and, as a result, the
number of broker dealers affiliated with banks has increased, along with the number of
those broker-dealers maintaining deposits at affiliated banks. 101 This commenter stated
that broker-dealers would be required to move deposits from one institution and divide
that amount among several banks, resulting in credit risk to the broker-dealer, as well as
an increase in operational risk. 102 Finally, the commenter observed that the Commission
did not provide any specific examples of bank failures impacting affiliated brokerdealers, which led the commenter to question whether there is any realistic benefit to
offset the increased risk that broker-dealers would be required to take on as a result of the
proposal to place restrictions on cash deposits in reserve accounts at affiliated and
unaffiliated banks. 103
The Commission recognizes that all banks, whether or not affiliated with a
broker-dealer, are subject to regulation by their respective banking regulators. The
Commission’s continuing concern, however, is that a carrying broker-dealer may not
exercise due diligence with the same degree of impartiality and care when assessing the
financial soundness of an affiliated bank as it would with an unaffiliated bank. 104
Moreover, the goal of protecting the carrying broker-dealer’s customers through the Rule

100

See Raymond James Letter. In a subsequent comment letter, this commenter stated that
if this proposal is adopted, registered broker-dealers holding customer funds may be
required to move their reserve accounts if those accounts are currently held at affiliated
banks, which would increase costs. See Raymond James 2 Letter.

15c3-3 reserve requirement may be undermined in the event a holding company becomes
insolvent, with corresponding adverse consequences to both the bank and broker-dealer
subsidiaries.
In some cases, a broker-dealer may have access to more information about an
affiliated bank in comparison to an unaffiliated bank for purposes of conducting due
diligence. However, having more information would not be of benefit if the individuals
making the decision on where to maintain the reserve account are not objective in their
decision making. The Commission is concerned that a broker-dealer’s decision to hold
cash in a reserve account at an affiliated bank may be driven in part by profit or reasons
based on the affiliation, regardless of any due diligence it may conduct or the overall
safety and soundness of the bank.
In addition, in response to the comments regarding affiliated banks, the
Commission notes that substantial numbers of banks have failed or required government
assistance in recent years. 105 While a particular bank failure may not have materially
impacted an affiliated broker-dealer to date, 106 the risk remains that the financial
difficulty of an entity that is part of a holding company structure may adversely impact
other affiliated entities, including affiliated broker-dealers and banks. 107 Therefore, the
final rule retains the prohibition on maintaining customer reserve cash deposits at an
affiliated bank. 108
105

According to the FDIC, the number of FDIC-insured institutions that failed in the U.S.
over the last four years are: (1) 140 in 2009; (2) 157 in 2010; (3) 92 in 2011; and (4) 51 in
2012. A complete list of failed banks since October 1, 2000, is available at

This prohibition does not apply to securities on deposit at an affiliated bank, but
only cash deposits because, as noted above, the latter are fungible with other deposits
carried by the bank and may be freely used in the course of the bank’s commercial
activities. 109 Consequently, to the extent that operational or other efficiencies can be
achieved through the use of an affiliated bank, the carrying broker-dealer can use
qualified securities held at an affiliated bank to meet its reserve deposit requirements. 110
The ability to use qualified securities alleviates concerns that a broker-dealer would be
required to take deposits from one institution and divide that amount among several
banks, resulting in credit risk to the broker-dealer, as well as an increase in operational
risk. 111
In summary, while the Commission acknowledges concerns raised by
commenters, the Commission continues to believe that it is appropriate to exclude cash
deposited in affiliated banks from the calculation to determine whether a broker-dealer
has met its reserve account requirements. Therefore, the final rule excludes the amount
of any cash on deposit in an affiliated bank of the broker-dealer from being used to meet
the reserve requirements. 112 Broker-dealers that use affiliated banks for holding cash

customer reserve accounts will need to either deposit qualified securities into the
accounts or move their accounts to non-affiliated banks.
As for the limits on the amounts of cash that could be deposited in one
unaffiliated bank, some commenters argued that the proposed thresholds were too
restrictive. One commenter urged the Commission to reconsider the proposed limits,
noting that the proposed amendment will impose significant costs on broker-dealers and
potentially adversely impact the broker-dealers’ customers. 113 Several commenters
suggested that the Commission allow cash reserve deposits without the percentage
restrictions at unaffiliated banks that are well-capitalized or for which the broker-dealer
has performed due diligence. 114 One commenter suggested that the Commission consider
higher percentages for cash deposits at large money-center banks. 115 This commenter
stated that this would strike a better balance between the Commission’s concerns
regarding the safety of cash deposits and the costs imposed on broker-dealers arising
from having to use qualified securities (as opposed to cash) to meet deposit requirements
or having to maintain reserve accounts at multiple banks. 116 This commenter also stated
that the percentage thresholds would negatively impact smaller broker-dealers because
they would exceed the 50% of excess net capital threshold at lower deposit levels. 117
Two commenters noted that the proposed 10% bank equity capital limitation appears to
be derived from a 1988 NYSE staff interpretation, which stated that customer reserve
accounts may be maintained in money market deposit accounts if the total of such

deposits in any one bank does not exceed 50% of the broker-dealer’s excess net capital or
10% of the bank’s equity capital. 118 These commenters pointed out that significant
changes have taken place with respect to federal bank regulatory agency oversight of the
safety and soundness of banks since 1988, including the imposition of prompt corrective
action provisions. 119 These commenters stated that the concerns that gave rise to the
1988 interpretation have been mitigated by current statutes and regulations requiring
prompt corrective action in the event that a bank’s capital position deteriorates. 120
As stated above, substantial numbers of banks have failed or required government
assistance in recent years. 121 Consequently, the rule, as adopted, establishes requirements
designed to avoid the situation where a carrying broker-dealer’s cash deposits constitute a
substantial portion of the bank’s deposits. At the same time, the proposal has been
modified to mitigate concerns raised by commenters that broker-dealers would have to
maintain reserve accounts at multiple banks. First, the Commission has eliminated the
provision that would have excluded the amount of a cash deposit that exceeds 50% of the
broker-dealer’s excess net capital. As noted by comments, this provision likely would
have disproportionately impacted small and mid-size broker-dealers when they deposited
cash into large commercial banks since they would exceed the excess net capital
threshold well before exceeding the bank equity capital threshold. 122 Also, based on staff
experience monitoring larger broker-dealers, firms that maintain large amounts of cash in

The bank equity capital threshold is the more important metric since it relates
directly to the financial strength of the bank, which is the entity holding the account.
Thus, this metric more directly addresses the risk at issue: the potential impairment of the
bank’s ability to quickly return the customer reserve deposit to the broker-dealer.
Second, with respect to the bank equity capital threshold, in response to
comments, the Commission has increased the threshold from 10% to 15% of the bank’s
equity capital. The increase of the threshold to 15% is designed to address concerns
raised by commenters that the proposed percentage tests were unduly restrictive in certain
respects and should be modified, particularly with respect to large broker-dealers with
large deposit requirements. Consequently, the increase from 10% to 15% is designed to
mitigate commenters’ concerns that the 10% threshold would require broker-dealers to
spread out cash deposits over a number of banks, while still providing adequate
protection against the risk that arises when a bank’s deposit base is overly reliant on a
single depositor.
The elimination of the 50% of excess net capital threshold and increase in the
bank capital threshold from 10% to 15% is intended to address concerns raised by
commenters that they would have to substantially alter their current cash deposit practices
in light of the goal of the rule to promote the broker-dealer’s ability to have quick access
to the deposit.
As proposed, the equity capital threshold would have been based on equity capital
“as reported by the bank in its most recent Call Report or Thrift Financial Report.”
Under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank
Act”), 123 the supervision of savings associations was transferred from the OTS to the

OCC (for federal savings associations) and the FDIC (for state savings associations). 124
Also, beginning in the period ending March 31, 2012, savings associations began to file a
Call Report in lieu of a Thrift Financial Report, thereby ending the use of the Thrift
Financial Report. 125 Therefore, due to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and the
elimination of the Thrift Financial Report, as well as to provide more flexibility with
regard to any successor reports that may be required to be filed by a bank, the
Commission is modifying the phrase “Call Report or Thrift Financial Report” to read
“Call Report or any successor form the bank is required to file by its appropriate Federal
banking agency (as defined by section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C.
1813))”.
Two commenters expressed concern about the use of a Call Report to determine a
bank’s “equity capital” under the rule. 126 These commenters noted that there is no equity
capital line item in the Call Reports of U.S. branches of foreign banks due to these
branches not being separately incorporated legal entities. 127 Therefore, the proposed Call
Report provision potentially excluded U.S. branches of foreign banks from holding
reserve accounts. The commenters stated that for foreign banks, the equity capital can be
found in other forms, such as Form FR Y-7, Form FR Y-70, Form 6-K, and Form F-20,
among other financial statements filed with U.S. regulators. 128 One commenter
suggested the Commission revise the proposed provision to read: “The amount of the

deposit exceeds 10% of the bank’s equity capital (as reported by the bank in its most
recent Call Report or Thrift Financial Report if such report includes a line item for
‘equity capital’).” 129 Alternatively, these commenters suggested that in lieu of a Call
Report a U.S. branch of a foreign bank could periodically obtain a certificate from the
bank stating its equity capital (or stating that its equity capital exceeds a specified
level). 130
The Commission recognizes that the U.S. branches of some foreign banks may
meet the definition of bank under section (3)(a)(6) of the Exchange Act and, therefore,
also under paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 15c3-3. 131 However, the Commission is retaining the
requirement that the bank’s equity be determined using its most recent Call Report
because U.S. branches of foreign banks generally are not FDIC-insured. 132

131

The term bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Exchange Act is limited to banks
directly regulated by U.S. state or federal bank regulators. The determination whether
any particular financial institution meets the requirements of section 3(a)(6) is the
responsibility of the financial institution and its counsel. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6); cf.
Securities Issued Or Guaranteed By United States Branches Or Agencies of Foreign
Banks; Interpretive Release, Securities Act Release No. 6661 (Sept. 23, 1986), 51 FR
34460 (Sept. 29, 1986) (determination as to whether branch or agency of foreign bank
falls within the definition of bank under section 3(a)(2) of Securities Act of 1933, 15
U.S.C. 77c(a)(2), is responsibility of issuers and their counsel). However, section 4(d) of
the International Banking Act, 12 U.S.C. 3102(d), expressly prohibits agencies of foreign
banks established under federal law from receiving deposits or exercising fiduciary
powers, criteria necessary for qualification as a bank under section 3(a)(6)(C) of the
Exchange Act. See 12 U.S.C. 3102(d); see also Conference of State Bank Supervisors v.
Conover, 715 F.2d 604 (D.C. Cir. 1983), cert. denied, 466 U.S. 927 (1984) (stating that
federally-chartered agencies of foreign banks are prohibited from receiving deposits from
foreign, as well as domestic, sources).

132

The FDIC protects depositors’ funds in the event of the financial failure of their bank or
savings institution. FDIC deposit insurance covers the balance of each depositor’s
account, dollar-for-dollar, up to the insurance limit, including principal and any accrued
interest through the date of the insured bank’s closing. No depositor has suffered a loss
of insured deposits since the FDIC was created in 1933. See FDIC, When a Bank Fails –
Facts for Depositors, Creditors, and Borrowers, available at
http://fdic.gov/consumers/banking/facts/index.html. See also Federal Reserve, Structure

Consequently, deposits at these institutions would not receive the protections of FDIC
insurance in the event of a bank failure. FDIC insurance provides additional protections
to cash deposited in a reserve account at a bank in the event of a bank failure that would
not be available at an uninsured bank. 133 The Commission, however, will consider
requests for exemptive relief from broker-dealers that wish to hold a reserve account at a
U.S. branch of a foreign bank.
For these reasons, the Commission is adopting the final rule to exclude, when
determining whether a broker-dealer maintains the minimum deposits required under
paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3, cash deposited with an affiliated bank as well as cash
deposited with an unaffiliated bank “to the extent that the amount of the deposit exceeds
15% of the bank’s equity capital as reported by the bank in its most recent Call Report or
any successor form the bank is required to file by its appropriate Federal banking agency
(as defined by section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813)).” 134 As
discussed above, the Commission is deleting from the final rule the provision that would
have excluded the amount of cash on deposit that exceeds 50% of the broker-dealer’s
excess net capital.

Allocation of Customers’ Fully Paid and Excess Margin
Securities to Short Positions

Paragraph (d) of Rule 15c3-3 currently sets forth steps a broker-dealer must take
to retrieve securities from non-control locations if there is a shortfall in the fully paid or
and Share Data for U.S. Offices of Foreign Banks, available at
http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/iba/.
133

Id. Therefore, the availability of FDIC insurance could also be a contributing factor to
mitigating the risk that an impairment of the reserve deposit at an unaffiliated bank will
have a material negative impact on the broker-dealer’s ability to meet its obligations to
customers and PAB account holders. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility
Rules, 72 FR at 12864.

See paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted.

excess margin securities it is required to hold for its customers. The actions prescribed in
the rule do not include a requirement that the broker-dealer obtain possession or control
of a fully paid or excess margin security that is reflected on the broker-dealer’s stock
record as a long position of a customer that allocates to a broker-dealer or non-customer
short position. In the simplest case, this occurs when the carrying broker-dealer as
principal sells short a security to its own customer. Currently, in such a case, the brokerdealer is not required to have possession or control of the security even though its
customer has paid for the security in full. Rather, the broker-dealer must include the
mark-to-market value of the security as a credit item in the reserve formula. The brokerdealer can use the cash paid by the customer to purchase the security to make any
increased deposit requirement caused by the credit item. 135 As the Commission stated in
the proposing release, this permits the broker-dealer, in effect, to partially monetize the
customer’s security. 136 This result is contrary to the customer protection goals of Rule
15c3-3, which seek to ensure that broker-dealers do not use customer assets for
proprietary purposes. 137
To address these concerns, the Commission proposed an amendment to Rule
15c3-3 that would have required a broker-dealer to obtain physical possession or control
of customer fully paid and excess margin securities that allocate to a broker-dealer short
position. 138 Specifically, the proposed amendment would have added a fifth step to take
when a deficit arose in the amount of securities the broker-dealer was required to

In effect, the broker-dealer has monetized the customer’s security and has to
purchase or borrow it, at a future date, to return the customer’s fully paid securities.

maintain in possession or control; namely that for “[s]ecurities included on [the brokerdealer’s] books or records as a proprietary short position or as a short position for another
person, excluding positions covered by paragraph (m) of this section, for more than 10
business days (or more than 30 calendar days if the broker or dealer is a market maker in
the securities), […] the broker or dealer shall, not later than the business day following
the day on which the determination is made, take prompt steps to obtain physical
possession or control of such securities.” 139
Eleven commenters addressed this proposed amendment. 140 Three commenters
urged the Commission to disallow naked short selling of securities and one argued that
the Commission should force short sellers to pre-borrow. 141 Three commenters generally
opposed the proposed rule. They argued that the credit item added to the reserve formula
computation when a customer’s fully paid or excess margin security allocates to a short
position provides the customer with adequate protection. 142 Two of these commenters
requested that the 30 calendar days allowed for a broker-dealer acting as a market maker
to obtain possession or control over securities allocating to a short position be expanded
to include all situations where a broker-dealer must act pursuant to the rule (i.e., not be

See Glenn Letter; Bare Letter; Anonymous Letter; Hearne Letter. The Commission has
taken a number of measures to strengthen investor protections against potentially abusive
“naked” short selling, including adopting rules requiring that fails to deliver resulting
from short sales immediately be closed-out and expressly targeting fraud in short selling
transactions. See Amendments to Regulation SHO, Exchange Act Release No. 60388

Exchange Act Release No. 58774 (Oct. 14, 2008), 73 FR 61666 (Oct. 17, 2008). In
addition, the Commission adopted a short sale-related price test that, if triggered, imposes
a restriction on the prices at which securities may be sold short. See Amendments to
Regulation SHO, Exchange Act Release No. 61595 (Feb. 26, 2010), 75 FR 11232 (Mar.

limited to market maker positions). 143 These commenters argued that it would be
difficult to distinguish between market maker and non-market maker positions in
complying with the proposed rule. Another commenter requested that the Commission
reevaluate the proposed amendment because of its potential effects on investment and
hedging strategies in addition to the heavy burden it will impose on short sales. 144 One
commenter supported the amendments noting that it had “come to believe . . . that the
Commission’s proposal is consistent with the direction of the Commission’s other short
sale regulations . . . .” 145
As discussed above in section II.A.2.ii. of this release, the Commission has
determined that a credit item is sufficient to protect PAB account holders if the carrying
broker-dealer provides them with notice that it may be using their non-margin securities,
as well as the opportunity to object to such use. The use of the non-margin securities of
PAB account holders is a long-standing industry practice. In contrast, customers under
Rule 15c3-3, which include the carrying broker-dealer’s retail customers, have an
expectation that the fully paid and excess margin securities reflected on their account
statements are, in fact, in the possession or control of the carrying broker-dealer.
However, as described above, this expectation may be frustrated where the securities are
allocated to a short position carried by the broker-dealer, as the securities are not in the
possession or control of the broker-dealer.
This gap in the existing rule, in effect, permits the broker-dealer to partially
monetize the customer’s security. Also, under some circumstances (e.g., a change in the
market value of the securities), the amount the broker-dealer may have on deposit in the

customer reserve account as a consequence of the credit item may be less than the value
of the securities. Consequently, if the broker-dealer fails, sufficient funds may not be
readily available to purchase the securities to return them to customers. The use of
customer securities in this manner is contrary to the customer protection goals of Rule
15c3-3 and the expectations of a broker-dealer’s customers. 146 For these reasons, the
Commission is adopting the amendment. 147 The Commission agrees, however, that the
proposed distinction based upon a broker-dealer’s market maker status could present
operational challenges and, consequently, the final rule has been modified to allow a
uniform period of 30 calendar days before the possession and control requirement is
triggered.
Specifically, as adopted, paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 15c3-3 requires a broker-dealer
to take prompt steps to obtain physical possession or control over securities of the same
issue and class as those included “on the broker’s or dealer’s books or records that
allocate to a short position of the broker or dealer or a short position for another person,
excluding positions covered by paragraph (m) of this section, for more than 30 calendar
days . . . .” 148 The Commission does not believe that lengthening the time from 10
business days to 30 calendar days for non-market maker positions will significantly

See supra notes 12 and 18, and accompanying text.

Current paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 15c3-3 is being re-designated paragraph (d)(5), as
proposed.

148

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12865–12866. The
amendment will not apply to securities that are sold long for a customer but not obtained
from the customer within ten days after the settlement date. This circumstance is
addressed by paragraph (m) of Rule 15c3-3, which requires the broker-dealer to close the
transaction by purchasing securities of like kind and quantity. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(m).

diminish the protections provided by the new rule. 149 Therefore, the Commission is
adopting a uniform 30 calendar day time period in the final rule.
Three commenters requested that the Commission clarify that the aging process
begins when the Rule 15c3-3 possession and control deficit arises and not when the short
transaction is executed. 150 The proposed amendment was designed to require that the
aging process commence at the time a deficit in securities allocating to a short position
arises. One commenter 151 also requested that the Commission modify the proposed
amendment to specifically exclude an underwriter’s short position created in connection
with a distribution of securities until after the later of the completion of such
underwriter’s participation in the distribution (as defined in Rule 100 of Regulation M) 152
or the delivery date for securities acquired in the exercise of any overallotment option (or

For example, the rule currently has a thirty calendar day time period for securities failed
to receive and a forty-five calendar day time period for securities receivable as a result of
corporate actions (e.g., stock splits) before the broker-dealer must take prompt steps to
obtain possession or control of such securities. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(d)(2)–(3).

See Deutsche Bank Securities Letter; Citigroup Letter; SIFMA 2 Letter.

See SIFMA 2 Letter. The commenter stated: “Regulation M embodies a carefully crafted
scheme for the regulation of secondary market transactions by underwriters and other
distribution participants, including the regulation of ‘syndicate covering transactions,’
which should not be disrupted by proposed paragraph (d)(4).” Id. In addition, SIFMA
commented that where an underwriter sells short to a customer in anticipation of
obtaining the securities through the exercise of an overallotment option, paragraph (d)(4)
should not require the premature exercise of the overallotment option or the use of
secondary market purchases instead of the overallotment option. Id.

completed its participation in a distribution as follows: . . . (2) [a]n underwriter, when
such person’s participation has been distributed, including all other securities of the same
class that are acquired in connection with the distribution, and any stabilization
arrangements and trading restrictions in connection with the distribution have been

consistency between the final rule and Regulation M. 154 Consequently, the Commission
has added a sentence to the final rule to clarify that the 30 calendar day period with
respect to a syndicate short position established in connection with an offering does not
begin to run until the underwriter’s participation in the distribution is complete as
determined pursuant to Rule 100(b) of Regulation M. 155 Finally, the Commission is
adopting the revision to paragraph (n) as proposed to permit broker-dealers to apply to
their designated examining authority (“DEA”) for extensions of time related to

Importation of Rule 15c3-2 Requirements into Rule 15c3-3 and
Treatment of Free Credit Balances
i.

Importation of Rule 15c3-2

Rule 15c3-2 requires a broker-dealer holding free credit balances to provide its
customers (defined as any person other than a broker-dealer) at least once every three
months with a statement of the amount due the customer and a notice that: (1) the funds
are not being segregated, but rather are being used in the broker-dealer’s business; and
(2) the funds are payable on demand. The rule was adopted in 1964, before the adoption

153

A green shoe or overallotment option is a provision contained in an underwriting
agreement that gives the underwriting syndicate the right to purchase additional shares
from the issuer or selling security holders (in addition to those initially underwritten by
the syndicate) for the purpose of covering any overallotments that are made on behalf of
the syndicate in connection with an offering of securities.

154

Rule 100 of Regulation M also provides that an underwriter’s participation will not be
deemed to have been completed if a syndicate overallotment option is exercised in an
amount that exceeds the net syndicate short position at the time of exercise. 17 CFR

SROs generally have procedures in place for broker-dealers to apply for extensions of

47

of Rule 15c3-3 in 1972. 157 Since the adoption of Rule 15c3-3, broker-dealers have been
limited in their use of customer free credit balances. The Commission proposed
importing requirements in Rule 15c3-2 158 into Rule 15c3-3 and eliminating Rule 15c3-2
as a separate rule in the Code of Federal Regulations. 159 The Commission received two
comments supporting the proposal. 160
The Commission is adopting the amendments substantially as proposed – deleting
Rule 15c3-2 and adding paragraph (j)(1) to Rule 15c3-3. The Commission believes it is
appropriate to eliminate Rule 15c3-2 as a separate rule because it is largely irrelevant in
light of the requirements in Rule 15c3-3. Further, the provisions in Rule 15c3-2 that the
Commission wishes to retain are being re-codified in Rule 15c3-3. These provisions
include the requirement that broker-dealers inform customers of the amounts due to them
and that such amounts are payable on demand. 161 Consequently, the Commission is
amending Rule 15c3-3 to add new paragraph (j)(1), which provides that “[a] broker or
dealer must not accept or use any free credit balance carried for the account of any
customer of the broker or dealer unless such broker or dealer has established adequate
procedures pursuant to which each customer for whom a free credit balance is carried
will be given or sent, together with or as part of the customer’s statement of account,
whenever sent but not less frequently than once every three months, a written statement

Rule 15c3-2 contains an exemption for broker-dealers that also are banking institutions
supervised by a Federal authority. This exemption will not be imported into Rule 15c3-3
because there are no broker-dealers left that fit within the exemption. Further, the
definition of customer for purposes of the imported 15c3-2 requirements will be the
definition of customer in Rule 15c3-3, which is somewhat narrower than the definition in
Rule 15c3-2.

date of the statement, and that the funds are payable on demand of the customer.” 162
ii.

Treatment of Free Credit Balances

Free credit balances are funds payable by a broker-dealer to its customers on
demand. 163 They may result from cash deposited by the customer to purchase securities,
proceeds from the sale of securities or other assets held in the customer’s account, or
earnings from dividends and interest on securities and other assets held in the customer’s
account. Broker-dealers may, among other things, pay interest to customers on their free
credit balances or offer to routinely transfer (“sweep”) them to a money market fund or
bank account. On occasion, broker-dealers have changed the product to which a
customer’s free credit balances are swept – in recent years, most frequently from a money
market fund to an interest bearing bank account. Because of differences in these two
types of products, including the type of protection afforded the customer in the event of
insolvency, there may be investment consequences to the customer when changing from
one product to the other. The money market shares – as securities – would receive up to
$500,000 in SIPA protection in the event the broker-dealer failed. The bank deposits – as
cash – would receive up to $250,000 in protection from the FDIC in the event the bank
failed. On the other hand, the money market fund shares may incur market losses;
whereas, the full amount of the bank deposit would be guaranteed up to the FDIC’s
$250,000 limit. There also may be differences in the amount of interest earned from the
two products. In short, there may be consequences to moving a customer’s free credit
162

See paragraph (j)(1) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted. The Commission also modified the
phrase “[i]t shall be unlawful for a broker or dealer to” to the phrase “[a] broker or dealer
must not” in order to avoid using the term “unlawful.” Any violation of the rules and
regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act is unlawful and therefore it is
unnecessary to use this phrase in the final rule.

balances from one product to another, and, accordingly, customers should have a
sufficient opportunity to make an informed decision. 164
The Commission proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-3 that would have
established conditions required to be met in order for a broker-dealer to use or transfer
free credit balances in a customer’s securities account. 165 More specifically, as initially
proposed, the amendments would have structured the new rule to make it unlawful for a
broker-dealer to convert, invest, or otherwise transfer to another account or institution
free credit balances held in a customer’s account except as provided in the proposed
rule. 166 The proposed rule then prescribed three conditions to address three different
scenarios involving the use or transfer of customer free credit balances. The first
scenario involved the use or transfer of free credit balances outside the context of a
routine sweep to a money market fund or bank. As discussed below, proposed paragraph
(j)(2)(i) would have prohibited the use or transfer of free credit balances in this scenario
unless the customer had specifically ordered or authorized the transaction. The second
and third scenarios involved the use or transfer of free credit balances in the context of a
program to routinely sweep them to a money market fund or bank account (a “sweep
program”). As discussed below, proposed paragraph (j)(2)(ii) would have addressed
sweep program requirements for accounts opened after the effective date of the rule
(“new accounts”) and proposed paragraph (j)(2)(iii) would have addressed sweep
program requirements for accounts existing as of the effective date of the rule (existing
accounts). The Commission is adopting new paragraph (j)(2) to Rule 15c3-3 with

substantial modifications from the proposed rule in response to comments and to clarify
certain portions of the rule. 167
As proposed, the first sentence of paragraph (j)(2) of the rule would have
established the prohibition with respect to the treatment of free credit balances by
providing that “[i]t shall be unlawful for a broker or dealer to convert, invest, or
otherwise transfer to another account or institution, free credit balances held in a
customer’s account except as provided in paragraphs (j)(2)(i), (ii) and (iii).” 168 The
Commission received one comment in response to the proposed text of this first
sentence. 169 The commenter expressed concern that the proposed text in the first
sentence of paragraph (j)(2) could be construed broadly, in effect, to prohibit a brokerdealer from using, investing, or transferring cash deposits that are not swept to other
investments or products (and are included as credits in the reserve formula) in the normal
course of the broker-dealer’s business, as is currently permitted by Rule 15c3-3. The
commenter suggested that the text be revised to clarify the scope of the proposed rule by
prohibiting a broker-dealer from deducting a free credit balance from the customer’s
account at the broker-dealer and transferring it to another institution and investing it in
another instrument on behalf of the customer, except as permitted under paragraph
(j)(2). 170

In 2005, the NYSE addressed the issue of disclosure in a sweep program context by
issuing an information memo to its members discussing, among other things, the
disclosure responsibilities of a broker-dealer offering a sweep program to its customers.
See Information Memo 05-11 (Feb. 15, 2005). The memo stated that broker-dealers
should disclose material differences in interest rates between the different sweep products
and, with respect to the bank sweep program, further disclose the terms and conditions,
risks and features, conflicts of interest, current interest rates, manner by which future
interest rates will be determined, and the nature and extent of FDIC and SIPC protection.

In response to the comment, as a preliminary matter, cash balances in customer
securities accounts must be included as credits in the customer reserve formula. Further,
the net amount of the credits over debits must be deposited in a customer reserve account
in the form of cash or qualified securities. However, cash credit items that are net of
debit items can be used by the broker-dealer for the limited purpose of facilitating
transactions of its customers. 171 The commenter suggested that proposed paragraph (j)(2)
of Rule 15c3-3 could be interpreted to impose new limits on a broker-dealer’s ability to
use cash that is an asset on the firm’s balance sheet. In response to this concern, the
Commission notes that the prohibition in the first sentence of proposed paragraph (j)(2)
of Rule 15c3-3 is intended to place conditions only on the broker-dealer’s ability to
convert the cash asset of the customer (i.e., a receivable from the broker-dealer) into a
different type of asset (e.g., a security or an obligation of another institution outside the
context of a sweep program) or to transfer the customer’s cash asset to another account.
The Commission is adopting paragraph (j)(2) of Rule 15c3-3 with certain
technical modifications. 172 As adopted paragraph (j)(2) reads: “A broker or dealer must

171

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e)(2) (“It shall be unlawful for any broker or dealer to accept or
use any of the amounts under items comprising Total Credits under the formula referred
to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section except for the specified purposes indicated under
items comprising Total Debits under the formula, and, to the extent Total Credits exceed
Total Debits, at least the net amount thereof shall be maintained in the Reserve Bank
Account pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.”).

172

Specifically, the Commission is replacing the phrase “[i]t shall be unlawful for a broker
or dealer to” with the phrase “[a] broker or dealer must not” because – as noted above –
any violation of the rules and regulations promulgated under the Exchange Act is
unlawful and therefore it is unnecessary to use this phrase in the final rule. The
Commission also is replacing the phrase “free credit balance” with the phrase “credit
balances” to clarify that this provision covers both free credit balances and other credit
balances. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(8)–(9) (defining free credit balances and other
credit balances). The Commission is deleting the word “otherwise” because it would be
redundant. Finally, the rule text does not include a reference to paragraph (j)(2)(iii), as
proposed, because this paragraph was deleted from the final rule text.

not convert, invest, or transfer to another account or institution, credit balances held in a
customer’s account except as provided in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.” 173

a.

Treatment of Free Credit Balances Outside of a
Sweep Program

As proposed, paragraph (j)(2)(i) of Rule 15c3-3 would have permitted a brokerdealer to convert, invest or otherwise transfer to another account or institution free credit
balances held in a customer’s account only upon a specific order, authorization, or draft
from the customer, and only in the manner, and under the terms and conditions, specified
in the order, authorization, or draft. 174 This catchall provision would have applied to any
use or transfer of customer free credit balances outside the context of a sweep program.
The Commission proposed paragraph (j)(2)(i) in order to comprehensively cover
the range of possibilities with respect to the disposition of free credit balances in a
customer account other than pursuant to a sweep program. The Commission received
two comments recommending that proposed paragraph (j)(2)(i) be clarified to permit a
broker-dealer to obtain a one-time consent to ongoing transfers of any free credit
balances to a customer to another account, entity or product (outside of a sweep
program). 175 The commenters noted that customers, for example, may prefer that free
credit balances be regularly transferred to a linked account in their name at another
broker-dealer or bank that is not part of a sweep program, and that this clarification
would enable a broker-dealer to efficiently handle such customer requests by eliminating
the need to obtain individual “specific orders” for repeated transfers that are substantially

53

identical. 176 The Commission agrees with the commenters that a customer may consent
to ongoing routine transfers from the customer’s account outside of a sweep program
without obtaining the customer’s specific consent for each individual transfer, provided
the customer has consented to the ongoing transfers under paragraph (j)(2)(i) of Rule
15c3-3. This scenario would already be covered by the proposed rule, and, therefore, the
Commission is adopting paragraph (j)(2)(i) substantially as proposed, with certain
technical modifications. 177 As adopted, paragraph (j)(2)(i) of Rule 15c3-3 reads: “A
broker or dealer is permitted to invest or transfer to another account or institution, free
credit balances in a customer’s account only upon a specific order, authorization, or draft
from the customer, and only in the manner, and under the terms and conditions, specified
in the order, authorization, or draft.” 178
Finally, one commenter stated that both regulators and firms need the flexibility
to remove funds from a reserve account to cover extraordinary requests for payment of
customer free credit balances. 179 However, the commenter noted that “in light of recent
market events, we withdraw our earlier proposal to allow such withdrawals under
specified conditions and instead recommend that such withdrawals be permitted only by
approval of Commission staff or a broker-dealer’s [DEA].” 180 Broker-dealers currently

176

Id.

177

See paragraph (j)(2)(i) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted. The technical changes delete the
words “convert” and “otherwise” from the final rule because a broker-dealer would be
prohibited from “converting” a customer’s free credit balances and, therefore, it is not
necessary to include the word in the final rule. The word “otherwise” is redundant.

Id. In its June 15, 2007 comment letter, SIFMA urged “the Commission to consider
allowing a broker-dealer to remove funds from a reserve account to cover a large sameday request for payment of a free credit balance, as long as the free credit balance was
included in the latest Rule 15c3-3 reserve computation and the broker-dealer begins a
new reserve computation as of that date.” See SIFMA 2 Letter.

54

may make withdrawals under paragraph (g) of Rule 15c3-3. 181 In light of the risks that
could arise to customer funds, the Commission does not believe it would be appropriate
at this time to expand a firm’s ability to make additional withdrawals from its reserve
account.
b.

Treatment of Free Credit Balances in a Sweep
Program

The second and third set of conditions in the proposed rules addressed using or
transferring free credit balances in the context of a sweep program. 182 In particular, the
Commission proposed four conditions with respect to using or transferring free credit
balances in a sweep program. A broker-dealer would have been required to meet: (1) all
four conditions with respect to free credit balances in new accounts; 183 and (2) the
second, third, and fourth conditions with respect to free credit balances in existing
accounts. 184 The four conditions were:
1. The customer has previously affirmatively consented to such treatment of the free
credit balances after being notified of the different general types of money market
mutual fund and bank account products in which the broker or dealer may transfer
the free credit balances and the applicable terms and conditions that would apply
if the broker or dealer changes the product or type of product in which free credit
balances are transferred;
2. The broker or dealer provides the customer on an ongoing basis with all
disclosures and notices regarding the investment and deposit of free credit
balances as required by the self-regulatory organizations for which the broker or
dealer is a member;
3. The broker or dealer provides notice to the customer as part of the customer’s
quarterly statement of account that the money market mutual funds or bank
deposits to which the free credit balances have been transferred can be liquidated
on the customer’s demand and held as free credit balances; and

See paragraph (j)(2)(iii)(A)–(C) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted.

55

4. The broker or dealer provides the customer with at least 30 calendar days notice
before the free credit balances would begin being transferred to a different
product, different product type, or into the same product but under materially
different terms and conditions. The notice must describe the new money market
fund, bank deposit type, or terms and conditions, and how the customer can notify
the broker or dealer if the customer chooses not to have the free credit balances
transferred to the new product or product type, or under the new terms and
conditions.
Commenters generally agreed with the fundamental principle embodied in the proposal –
that customer free credit balances should not be transferred from an obligation of the
broker-dealer to an obligation of another entity without the customer’s authorization. 185
Other commenters supported the proposed disclosures but suggested additional
disclosures be made to customers, including clarification with respect to other protections
available to the customer. 186 Two commenters stated that the practice of sweep programs
should be banned entirely or that the Commission should adopt a “harder stance” and
require more than just disclosure. 187 One commenter responded to the Commission’s
request for comment as to the cost burdens that would result if the first condition (set
forth in proposed paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A)) to obtain a new customer’s prior agreement
were to be applied to existing customers. The commenter stated that such costs would be
substantial because broker-dealers would be required to amend their agreements with all
existing customers. 188 One commenter stated that the amendments in the proposing

185

See SIFMA 2 Letter; First Clearing Letter; Pace Letter.

186

See SIPC Letter.

187

See Ellis Letter; Dworkin Letter. One commenter stated that broker-dealers profit from
“excessive” fees charged to clients who opt out of the sweep programs. See Ellis Letter.
The second commenter suggested that the broker-dealer’s “customer has been effectively
denied the opportunity to opt out of bank account sweeps by [the broker-dealer]
preventing him or her from utilizing any other vehicle to park his or her free credit
balances . . . .” See Dworkin Letter. The commenter noted that by opting out of the
sweep, the customer is “confined to a situation where the free credit balance cannot earn
any kind of return at all[.]” Id.

188

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

56

release did not adequately address situations in which broker-dealers change customer
account elections without first obtaining customer authorization. 189
In adopting the final rule, the Commission has made some modifications to the
language in the proposed rule in response to commenters and to clarify its application.
For clarification and in response to comments, the Commission has defined the term
Sweep Program in paragraph (a)(17) of Rule 15c3-3 to identify the types of transactions
and products to which the new provisions apply.
Commenters raised concerns about limitations on the types of products brokerdealers could use for sweep arrangements under the proposed amendments. Three
commenters suggested that the Commission should not limit the types of products brokerdealers can use for sweep arrangements to money market funds and bank deposit
products. 190
Sweep programs provide a mechanism for excess cash in a customer’s securities
account to be held in a manner that allows the customer to earn interest on the funds but
retain the flexibility to quickly access that cash to purchase securities or withdraw it. 191
In effect, transferring this excess cash to a bank account or money market fund is an
alternative to retaining a credit balance in the customer’s securities account. The final
rule is designed to accommodate this alternative by providing broker-dealers with
flexibility in the operation of sweep programs. The Commission believes it is appropriate
to confine this flexibility to products that approximate the holding of a customer’s excess
cash in a securities account. The Commission does not view sweep accounts as a
mechanism for investing customers’ excess cash without their specific consent in longer

term or more volatile assets. For these reasons, the Commission does not believe it
would be appropriate to expand the products covered by the final rule beyond money
market funds as described in Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of 1940 or an
account at an insured bank as described in paragraph (a)(17) of Rule 15c3-3.
Consequently, paragraph (a)(17) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted, states “[t]he term
Sweep Program means a service provided by a broker or dealer where it offers to its
customers the option to automatically transfer free credit balances in the securities
account of the customer to either a money market mutual fund product as described in
[Rule 2a-7] or an account at a bank whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.” 192 The Commission intended that the definition of Sweep
Program provide that the bank to which free credits are swept be insured by the FDIC. 193
The revised text of the rule makes this explicit. Finally, under this definition, a one-time
or other special transfer of a customer’s free credit balances would not qualify as a Sweep
Program.
Three commenters raised the issue of bulk transfers. 194 They argued that the rule
should allow broker-dealers to process bulk transfers of customer assets between, for
instance, one money market fund and another money market fund or a bank deposit
product and a money market fund. These commenters identify a potential ambiguity in
the rule as proposed; namely, how transfers from one Sweep Program product to another
Sweep Program product are to be handled under the rule if they do not involve passing

accounts and certificates of deposit. The standard insurance amount is currently
$250,000 per depositor, per insured bank, for each account ownership category. 12 CFR

funds through the customer’s securities account. To address this issue, paragraph
(j)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3 is being modified from the proposal to clarify that the conditions
for operating a Sweep Program (which are set forth in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(A) and (B))
will apply to: (1) the transfer of free credit balances from a customer’s securities account
to a product in a Sweep Program; and (2) the transfer of a customer’s interest in one
Sweep Program product to another Sweep Program product. This will address both bulk
transfers 195 of customer positions from one product (e.g., a money market fund) to
another (e.g., a bank deposit product) and transfers of individual customer positions from
one product to another.
The Commission is modifying paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3 from the
proposal to delete the phrase “to either a money market mutual fund as described in §
270.2a-7 of this chapter or an interest bearing account at a bank without a specific order,
authorization or draft for each such transfer, provided” and instead to use the term Sweep
Program as defined in paragraph (a)(17) of the final rule. The Commission also replaced
the phrase “the account of a customer” with the phrase “a customer’s securities account”
to clarify that paragraph (j)(2)(ii) and its required conditions apply to the transfer of free
credit balances in connection with a customer’s securities account, in addition to the bulk

195

See also NASD Rule 2510 (Discretionary Accounts) (providing an exception from the
NASD rule for “bulk exchanges at net asset value of money market mutual funds . . .
utilizing negative response letters provided: (A) The bulk exchange is limited to
situations involving mergers and acquisitions of funds, changes of clearing members and
exchanges of funds used in sweep accounts; (B) The negative response letter contains a
tabular comparison of the nature and amount of the fees charged by each fund; (C) The
negative response letter contains a comparative description of the investment objectives
of each fund and a prospectus of the fund to be purchased; and (D) The negative response
feature will not be activated until at least 30 days after the date on which the letter was
mailed.”).

59

transfers described above. 196 As adopted, paragraph (j)(2)(ii) to Rule 15c3-3 reads, in
pertinent part: “[a] broker or dealer is permitted to transfer free credit balances held in a
customer’s securities account to a product in its Sweep Program or to transfer a
customer’s interest in one product in a Sweep Program to another product in a Sweep
Program, provided” the conditions set forth in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) are met. 197
As adopted, paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) establish four conditions that must be
met to lawfully transfer a customer’s free credit balances to a product in a Sweep
Program or to transfer a customer’s interest directly from one product in a Sweep
Program to another product in a Sweep Program. The first condition – set forth in
paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) – applies only with respect to accounts opened on or after the
effective date of the rule. This addresses the burden that would have been associated
with having broker-dealers re-document existing accounts. The remaining three
conditions – set forth in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(1) through (3) – apply to both existing and
new accounts.
Paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A), as adopted, provides that for an account opened on or after
the effective date of the rule, the customer must give prior written affirmative consent to
having free credit balances in the customer’s securities account included in the Sweep
Program after being notified: (1) of the general terms and conditions of the products
available through the Sweep Program; and (2) that the broker or dealer may change the
products available under the Sweep Program. 198

196

The final rule also deletes the phrase “opened on or after the effective date of this
paragraph” from paragraph (j)(2)(ii) and moves it to paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A), as described
below.

197

See paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted.

198

See paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted.

60

As stated above, the Commission has modified paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) in the final
rule to read “the customer gives prior written affirmative consent to having free credit
balances in the customer’s securities account included in the Sweep Program after being
notified . . . .” 199 The Commission modified this paragraph to incorporate the term
Sweep Program as defined in paragraph (a)(17) of the rule and the reference to the
“customer’s securities account” to make this paragraph consistent with other
modifications to paragraph (j)(2) of the final rule. Additionally, the Commission
modified this paragraph to clarify that the customer’s consent must be written, consistent
with the discussion in the proposing release, which noted customer consent could be
given in an account opening agreement. 200
The Commission received one comment stating that the text of proposed
paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) that would have required the disclosure of “applicable terms and
conditions that will apply if the broker or dealer changes the product or type of product”
could be read to require highly specific disclosure about product terms and conditions
that may only be established or modified in the future and, therefore, are unknown at the
time the customer opens an account with the broker-dealer. 201 In addition, the

199

Id. The proposed rule stated the “customer has previously affirmatively consented to
such treatment of the free credit balances after being notified of . . . .” In addition, as
noted above, the phrase “accounts opened on or after the effective date of this paragraph”
was deleted from proposed paragraph (j)(2)(ii) and moved to paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A), with
the reference to specific paragraph (j)(2)(ii) inserted after the word “paragraph.” Moving
this phrase to paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A) simplifies the final rule by eliminating the necessity
of codifying two largely overlapping sets of conditions, with three of the conditions being
repeated in both paragraphs. The effect of this change is to make the first condition only
applicable to new accounts and the remaining conditions (paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(1)
through (3)) applicable to both new and existing accounts. The word “accounts” also has
been replaced with the phrase “an account.”

200

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12866 (“[T]he customer
would need to agree prior to the change (e.g., in the account opening agreement) that the
broker-dealer could switch the sweep option between those two types of products.”).

201

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

61

commenter stated that under proposed paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(D), a broker-dealer would
already be required to describe any changes to the terms and conditions it makes
contemporaneously with such changes. Given this type of notice, the commenter stated
that there is no need for the type of generalized (and therefore less effective) disclosure
that would have been required by paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A). The Commission agrees with
the commenter and, therefore, has deleted the phrase “transfer the free credit balances
and the applicable terms and conditions that will apply if the broker or dealer changes the
product or type of product in which the free credit balances are transferred . . . .” In its
place, the Commission is adopting language in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A)(2) of Rule 15c3-3
under which the broker-dealer must notify the customer that the broker or dealer may
change the products available under the Sweep Program. 202
Paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B), as adopted, prescribes the following three conditions to
sweeping the customer’s free credit balances in a new or existing account:
•

The broker-dealer provides the customer with the disclosures and
notices regarding the Sweep Program required by each SRO of
which the broker-dealer is a member; 203

•

The broker-dealer provides notice to the customer, as part of the
customer’s quarterly statement of account, that the balance in the
bank deposit account or shares of the money market mutual fund in
which the customer has a beneficial interest can be liquidated on
the customer’s order and the proceeds returned to the securities
account or remitted to the customer; 204 and

•

The broker-dealer provides the customer with written notice at least 30 calendar
days before: (1) making changes to the terms and conditions of the Sweep
Program; (2) making changes to the terms and conditions of a product currently
available through the Sweep Program; (3) changing, adding or deleting products
available through the Sweep Program; or (4) changing the customer’s investment
through the Sweep Program from one product to another; and the notice

62

describes the new terms and conditions of the Sweep Program or product or the
new product, and the options available to the customer if the customer does not
accept the new terms and conditions or product. 205
As proposed, paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B) of Rule 15c3-3 would have required that the
broker-dealer provide these disclosures and notices “on an ongoing basis.” Three
commenters stated that there are no current SRO requirements that broker-dealers make
disclosures concerning sweep arrangements on an “ongoing basis” and that the
Commission should clarify the source and meaning of this requirement. 206 The
Commission has deleted the phrase “ongoing basis” from the final rule. As adopted, the
Commission has also modified the text in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B), now paragraph
(j)(2)(ii)(B)(1), to delete the phrase “investment and deposit of free credit balances as”
and inserted the phrase “Sweep Program” to incorporate the definition in paragraph
(a)(17). Finally, the Commission has modified the phrase “the self-regulatory
organizations” to read “each self-regulatory organization of” to clarify that the brokerdealer must provide the notices and disclosures required by each SRO of which it is a
member (including an SRO that is not its DEA). 207
As adopted, paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(2) states that the broker-dealer must provide
information on a quarterly basis with respect to the customer’s balance in an account or
fund “in which the customer has a beneficial interest.” 208 The rule text has been modified
to account for the fact that customers can have a beneficial interest in accounts in their

207

See 17 CFR 240.17d-1.

208

See paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(2) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted. More specifically, the
Commission modified the phrase “that the money market mutual funds or bank deposits
to which the free credit balances have been transferred” to read “that the balance in the
bank deposit account or shares of the money market mutual fund in which the customer
has a beneficial interest . . . .”

63

name and in omnibus accounts in the name of a custodian in which the assets of multiple
customers are commingled.
The Commission also modified language in paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(2) of Rule
15c3-3 to replace the phrase “on the customer’s demand” with the phrase “on the
customer’s order” to address concerns by two commenters that the former phrase could
lead customers to believe that they will receive immediate re-payment of those funds, or
they could revert to holding those funds as free credit balances at the broker-dealer. 209
These commenters pointed out that the disclosed terms of most sweep programs allow the
money market fund or bank up to seven days to meet requests for withdrawals. Further,
there are some broker-dealers that do not allow customers to maintain free credit balances
in securities accounts. In response to these comments, the Commission has deleted the
phrase “demand and held as free credit balances” and replaced it with the phrase “and the
proceeds returned to the securities account or remitted to the customer.” This language is
designed to account for broker-dealers that do not offer customers the option of having
their funds held as free credit balances. In such cases, the broker-dealer would remit the
funds withdrawn from the bank or derived from redeeming money market shares directly
to the customer (e.g., by transferring them to the customer’s bank account).
Proposed paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) and (iii)(C) – now paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(3) –
would have required the broker-dealer to provide the customer with notice at least thirty
days before the broker-dealer begins transferring the customer’s free credit balances to a
different product or product type, or into the same product but under materially different
terms and conditions. 210 As adopted, paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(3) will require brokerdealers to provide customers written notice at least 30 calendar days before the broker209

dealer: (1) makes changes to the terms and conditions of the Sweep Program; (2) makes
changes to the terms and conditions of a product currently available through the Sweep
Program; (3) changes, adds, or deletes products available through the Sweep Program; or
(4) changes the customer’s investment through the Sweep Program from one product to
another. 211 This modification to the final rule is in response to commenters’ requests that
the Commission provide clarity with respect to when the thirty day notice requirement
would be triggered. 212 In response to comments, the final rule is designed to make clear
that the triggering event for the thirty day notice is not exclusively related to the transfer
of the customer’s free credit balances, but rather changes relating to the terms and
conditions of the Sweep Program, as well as, the products available through the Sweep
Program. This greater specificity should enhance the protections under the final rule by
providing greater certainty that the customer will have time to evaluate available options
before a change to the Sweep Program is put into effect.
In addition, paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(B)(3)(i)(A)–(D) of Rule 15c3-3 require the
broker-dealer to provide the customer with written notice at least 30 calendar days
before: (1) making changes to the terms and conditions of the Sweep Program; (2)
making changes to the terms and conditions of a product currently available through the
Sweep Program; (3) changing, adding or deleting products available through the Sweep
Program; or (4) changing the customer’s investment through the Sweep Program from
one product to another. 213 Collectively, these provisions provide more specificity about
211

A broker-dealer could request exemptive relief from the rule in unusual or emergency
cases where it may be impractical or contrary to investor protection for a broker-dealer to
first provide customers 30 days’ written notice under the rule before taking one of these
actions. See, e.g., paragraph (k)(3) to Rule 15c3-3.

See paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(3)(i) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted. The requirements set forth

the types of disclosures and notices required under the final rule than under the proposal.
Further, the final rule includes the word “written” before the word “notice” to make
explicit that a written notice is required.
As adopted, paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(3)(ii) requires that “[t]he notice must describe
the new terms and conditions of the Sweep Program or product or the new product, and
the options available to the customer if the customer does not accept the new terms and

comment regarding the text of proposed paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) and (iii)(C). 215 The
commenter stated that, as drafted, proposed paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(D) and (iii)(C) would
have required a broker-dealer to disclose “how the customer can notify the [brokerdealer] if the customer chooses not to have the free credit balances transferred to the new
product or product type, or under new terms and conditions.” 216 The commenter stated
that these paragraphs appear to assume that the customer will have the option of
continuing to have free credit balances treated as they were prior to the change to the
sweep arrangement. 217 The commenter pointed out that, in fact, the broker-dealer may
elect not to continue offering the prior sweep options and not to offer another sweep
product. 218 To account for this possibility, the Commission has revised the text in
paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(3)(ii) 219 to require the broker-dealer to provide the customer with

214

See paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted. The final rule codifies this text
in a separate paragraph in order to emphasize the specific items the notice must contain.

More specifically, paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B)(3)(ii) provides that “the notice must describe

the options available to the customer if the customer does not accept the new terms and
conditions or product.” A customer that does not accept the new terms and conditions or

“Proprietary Accounts” under the Commodity Exchange Act

Some broker-dealers also are registered as futures commission merchants under
the Commodity Exchange Act (“CEA”). These firms carry both securities and
commodities accounts for customers. The definition of free credit balances in paragraph
(a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 does not include funds carried in commodities accounts that are
segregated in accordance with the requirements of the CEA. 221 However, regulations
promulgated under the CEA exclude certain types of accounts (“proprietary accounts”)
from the CEA’s segregation requirements. 222 This exclusion from the segregation
requirements under the CEA has raised a question as to whether a broker-dealer must
treat payables to customers in proprietary commodities accounts as “free credit balances”
when performing a customer reserve computation. 223
product would need to change how free credit balances are treated by, for example,
selecting investments outside the Sweep Program or having the balances transferred to an
account at another financial institution.

Rule 1.20 requires a futures commission merchant to segregate customer funds. See 17

The definition of customer excludes persons who own or hold a proprietary account as
that term is defined in Rule 1.3(y). See 17 CFR 1.3(y). Generally, the definition of
proprietary account refers to persons who have an ownership interest in the futures
commission merchant. Id.

In response to this question, the Commission notes that the objective of the
customer reserve requirement in Rule 15c3-3 is to require broker-dealers to hold
sufficient funds or qualified securities to facilitate the prompt return of customer property
to customers either before or during a liquidation proceeding if the firm fails. 224 Under
SIPA, customer property generally does not include funds held in a commodities
account. 225 Therefore, funds held in a proprietary commodities account generally would
not constitute customer property and persons having claims to those funds would not be
customers under SIPA. 226 Moreover, the regulations under the CEA similarly provide the
persons having claims to funds in proprietary commodities accounts are not customers for
purposes of those regulations. 227 For these reasons, the Commission proposed a specific

requirements). See also Broker-Dealers; Maintenance of Certain Basic Reserves,

identifiable property of customers.”); Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72

As noted above, customer property under SIPA includes “cash and securities (except
customer name securities delivered to the customer) at any time received, acquired, or
held by or for the account of the debtor from or for the securities accounts of a customer,
and the proceeds of any such property transferred by the debtor, including property
unlawfully converted.” 15 U.S.C. 78lll(4). To receive protection under SIPA, a claimant
must first qualify as a customer as that term is defined in the statute. Generally, a
customer is any person who has: (1) “a claim on account of securities received, acquired,
or held by the [broker-dealer];” (2) “deposited cash with the debtor for the purposes of
purchasing securities;” (3) “a claim against the debtor for…[positions]…received,
acquired, or held in a portfolio margin account carried as a securities account pursuant to
a portfolio margining program approved by the Commission;” or (4) “a claim against the
[broker-dealer] arising out of sales or conversions of such securities.” See 15 U.S.C.
78lll(2)(A)–(B). The definition of security in SIPA specifically excludes commodities
and non-securities futures contracts and, thus, a person with a claim for such assets (not
held in a portfolio margin account carried as a securities account) would not meet the
definition of customer. See 15 U.S.C. 78lll(14).

amendment to the definition of the term free credit balances in paragraph (a)(8) of Rule
15c3-3 that would have clarified that funds held in a commodities account meeting the
definition of a proprietary account under CEA regulations are not to be included as free
credit balances in the customer reserve formula. 228 As discussed below, the Commission
is adopting the amendment substantially as proposed.
The Commission received three comments in support of the proposed rule
change. 229 One commenter requested that the Commission clarify that the relevant
definition of proprietary account for these purposes is the definition contained in Rule
1.3(y) under the CEA. While Rule 1.3(y) under the CEA currently contains the relevant
definition of proprietary account for the purpose of the amendment, the definition could
be codified in a different rule in the future. Consequently, the Commission is adopting
the final rule amendment to paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3, as proposed. Thus, the final
rule does not include specific references to a specific rule. Rather, the amendment to
paragraph (a)(8) to Rule 15c3-3, as adopted, more generally refers to a “proprietary
account as that term is defined in regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act.”
As stated above, this amendment to paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 is designed to
clarify that funds held in a commodities account meeting the definition of a proprietary
account under CEA regulations are not to be included as “free credit balances” in the
customer reserve formula. Under Item 1 of Rule 15c3-3a, however, cash balances that do
not meet the definition of free credit balances (e.g., because they are not subject to
immediate payment) are included in the customer reserve formula if they meet the

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12868. The Commission
proposed additional amendments to paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 related to portfolio
margining. See also discussion below in section II.B. of this release.

definition of other credit balances under paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 15c3-3. 230 Therefore,
in order to remove any ambiguity as to the proper exclusion of proprietary accounts under
the CEA from Rule 15c3-3, the Commission also is amending the definition of the term
other credit balances in the final rule to delete the words “as aforesaid” and insert the
phrase “in accordance with the Commodity Exchange Act or in a similar manner, or
funds carried in a proprietary account as that term is defined in regulations under the
Commodity Exchange Act.” 231 Consequently, the amendments clarify that both free
credit balances and other credit balances as defined in Rule 15c3-3 do not include funds
carried in proprietary accounts under the CEA.
One commenter also suggested that due to the changes to the swap markets
mandated by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, swap accounts (in addition to commodities
accounts) are now subject to customer protection rules under the CEA. 232 This
commenter suggested that the Commission make it clear that funds in swap accounts also
do not constitute free credit balances, whether those funds are required to be segregated
by rules under the CEA (e.g., cleared swap accounts or uncleared swap accounts that
have opted for segregation) or excepted from segregation under the CEA (e.g., cleared
swaps proprietary accounts or uncleared swap accounts that have not opted for
segregation). The commenter noted this treatment “would be consistent with the
treatment of funds in commodities accounts and with the regulation of swap accounts

230

Item 1 of Rule 15c3-3a requires a broker-dealer to include in the customer reserve
formula “free credit balances and other credit balances in customers’ security accounts.”
Paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 15c3-3 defines other credit balances as “cash liabilities of a
broker or dealer to customers other than free credit balances and funds in commodities
accounts segregated as aforesaid.” 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(9).

under the CEA.” 233 The Commission agrees there may be additional accounts under the
CEA, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, that should explicitly be excluded from the
definition of free credit balances under Rule 15c3-3. However, the amendments today
are designed to clarify the specific question raised with respect to the treatment of funds
in proprietary commodities accounts under the CEA and, consequently, the suggestions
by the commenter are beyond the scope of this rulemaking.
7.

Expansion of the Definition of “Qualified Securities” to
Include Certain Money Market Funds

A broker-dealer is limited to depositing cash or qualified securities into the bank
account it maintains to meet its customer (and now PAB account) reserve deposit
requirements under Rule 15c3-3. Paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 15c3-3 defines qualified
securities to mean securities issued by the United States or guaranteed by the United
States with respect to principal and interest. 234 This strictly limits the types of assets that
can be used to fund a broker-dealer’s customer or PAB reserve account. The strict
limitation is designed to further the purpose of Rule 15c3-3; namely, that customer assets
be segregated and held in a manner that makes them readily available to be returned to
the customer. As the Commission noted when first proposing Rule 15c3-3:
The operative procedures of the Special [Reserve] Account
are designed to protect the integrity of customer-generated
funds by insulating them against inroads from the brokerdealer’s firm activities, whether they be underwriting,
market making, other trading, investing, or mere
speculation in securities, meeting overhead or any other
nature whatever. The Special [Reserve] Account should
achieve a virtual 100% protection to customers with respect
to the carrying and use of customers’ deposits or credit

balances which is mandated by Section 7(d) of the SIPC
Act. 235
In response to a petition for rulemaking, 236 the Commission proposed a limited
expansion of the definition of qualified security to include shares of an unaffiliated
money market fund that: (1) is described in Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act
of 1940; (2) invests solely in securities issued by the United States or guaranteed by the
United States as to interest and principal; (3) agrees to redeem fund shares in cash no
later than the business day following a redemption request by a shareholder; and (4) has
net assets equal to at least 10 times the value of the shares deposited by the broker-dealer
in its customer reserve account. 237 Twenty commenters addressed the proposed
amendment. 238 A majority of commenters supported the proposal and generally argued

As discussed in the proposing release, Federated submitted a petition for rulemaking on
April 3, 2003, which it later amended on April 4, 2005. See Amendments to Financial
Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12865, 12874. More specifically, Federated’s petition
requested that the Commission amend: (i) Rule 15c3-1 to lower the haircut for certain
money market funds to 0%; and (ii) Rule 15c3-3 to: (a) permit a broker-dealer to pledge
such money market funds when borrowing fully paid or excess margin securities from a
customer under paragraph (b)(3); and (b) treat such money market funds as “qualified
securities” that may be deposited into a broker-dealer’s customer reserve account. On
February 9, 2009, Federated submitted another request for rulemaking (Petition 4-577),
reiterating its first petition with respect to amending Rule 15c3-3 to allow a broker-dealer
to treat certain money market funds as “qualified securities” that may be deposited into a
reserve account. However, this new petition changed the definition of the types of funds
that could be treated as qualified securities. More specifically, the new petition proposed
amending Rule 15c3-3(a)(6) to define the term qualified securities to include, “a
redeemable security of an investment company registered under the Investment Company
Act of 1940 and described in 17 CFR 270.2a-7, unaffiliated with the broker-dealer and
which limits its investments to securities issued or guaranteed by the United States
Government or its agencies or instrumentalities (including repurchase transactions).” See

that the definition of qualified security should be expanded further to include more types
of instruments. One commenter noted that permitting the use of certain money market
funds to make up the required reserve account deposit would introduce “an intermediary
(namely, the holding company or money market fund) at which problems might arise.” 239
The commenter also noted that a number of SIPA liquidations have involved the
mishandling of money market or mutual fund shares or the confirmations of purchases of
nonexistent “money market funds.” 240
The Commission recently has proposed substantial amendments to its rules on
money market funds. 241 In light of these proposed amendments, 242 the Commission is

Rule 15c3-3 at this time. This will allow the Commission to assess the potential impact

B.

Holding Futures Positions in a Securities Portfolio Margin Account

Under SRO portfolio margin rules (“portfolio margin rules”), 243 a broker-dealer
can combine securities and futures positions in a portfolio margin securities account to
compute margin requirements based on the net market risk of all positions in the
account. 244 Until the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, however, SIPA only protected
customer claims for securities and cash, and specifically excluded from protection futures
contracts that are not also securities. This fact created a potential ambiguity as to how
futures positions in a portfolio margin securities account would be treated in a SIPA
liquidation. Consequently, the Commission proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-3 to
accommodate the holding of futures positions in a securities account that is margined on
a portfolio basis. 245
Subsequent to the Commission’s proposals, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the
definitions of customer, customer property, and net equity in section 16 of SIPA to take

into account futures and options on futures held in a portfolio margin account carried as a
securities account pursuant to a Commission-approved portfolio margining program. 246
As a result, persons who hold futures positions in a portfolio margining account carried
as a securities account are now entitled to SIPA protection.
While the Dodd-Frank Act addressed the protection under SIPA of futures and
futures options held in a securities portfolio margin account, the Commission’s proposed
amendments to Rule 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a will still serve an important purpose. In
particular, they complement the Dodd-Frank SIPA amendments, and will provide
additional protections to customers by requiring broker-dealers to treat these futures
positions in accordance with the segregation requirements in Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a.
Consequently, the Commission is adopting the amendments with modifications to
address, in part, comments.
To accommodate securities and futures portfolio margining, the Commission’s
proposals included several amendments. First, the Commission proposed amending the
definition of free credit balance in paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 to provide that the
term shall also include such liabilities carried in a securities account pursuant to an SRO
portfolio margining rule approved by the Commission under section 19(b) of the Act
(“SRO portfolio margining rule”), including daily marks to market, and proceeds
resulting from closing out futures contracts and options thereon, and, in the event the
broker-dealer is the subject of a proceeding under SIPA, the market value as of the filing
date as that term is defined in SIPA (15 U.S.C. 78lll(7)) of any long options on futures
contracts.

246

See Pub. L. No. 111–203 § 983.

75

In addition, the Commission proposed amendments to treat the unrealized value
of a futures option in a portfolio margin account on the SIPA filing date 247 as a free credit
balance for purposes of Rule 15c3-3. This amendment was designed to clarify that the
market value of such assets should be included in determining a customer’s net equity
claim in a SIPA proceeding. Unlike futures contracts, futures options do not generate
cash balances on a daily basis in the account (i.e., they have unrealized market value at
the end of a trading day). Since the broker-dealer is not holding cash for the customer,
there is no need to treat the futures options as a free credit balance for purposes of the
reserve formula. However, if the broker-dealer was liquidated under SIPA, the
unrealized gains or losses of the futures options should be included in calculating the
customer’s net equity in the account (along with the securities positions and all futuresrelated and securities-related cash balances). 248 The proposed amendments were
designed to provide for this outcome by defining the market value of the futures options
as a free credit balance as of the filing date of a SIPA liquidation of the broker-dealer. As
free credit balances, funds originating from futures transactions (e.g., margin deposits and
daily marks to market) and the market value of futures options as of the SIPA filing date
would constitute claims for cash in a SIPA proceeding and, therefore, become a part of a
customer’s net equity claim entitling the customer to up to $250,000 in advances to make
up for shortfalls.

247

The term filing date is defined in SIPA as, generally, being the date a SIPA proceeding is
commenced. See 15 U.S.C. 78lll(7).

248

See 15 U.S.C 78lll(11); see also Pub. L. No. 111–203 § 983 (revising definition of net
equity).

76

The Commission received six comments on the proposed amendments. 249 Three
commenters generally supported the amendments. 250 One commenter stated that the
amendments represent a positive step forward in resolving certain regulatory obstacles in
connection with the inclusion of futures contracts in a portfolio margin account. 251
Another commenter stated that it supported the Commission’s efforts to facilitate the
cross-margining of futures and securities in the portfolio margin account by clarifying the
treatment of futures and options positions under SIPA. 252 A commenter expressed
support for the development of rules for portfolio margining, and supported the
Commission’s effort to provide greater legal certainty regarding the SIPA treatment of
futures positions in a portfolio margin account. 253 In a subsequent comment letter,
however, this commenter stated that this amendment is no longer necessary in light of the
Dodd-Frank Act amendments, and recommended the Commission withdraw it. 254
Another commenter stated that the Commission’s proposal is premature in that including
futures in a portfolio margin account, which is a securities account, would conflict with
the segregation provisions under the CEA 255 and that SIPC has not determined that
protection should be extended to futures. 256
249

See SIFMA 2 Letter; CME Letter; SIPC Letter; Citigroup Letter; American Bar
Association Letter; SIFMA 4 Letter. The comment letters received as a result of the
original solicitation of comment pre-date the Dodd-Frank Act. As such, these comment
letters address the proposed amendments prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank SIPA
amendments related to portfolio margining. The comment letters received subsequent to
the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act address the SIPA amendments.

77

The Commission agrees, in part, with the commenter who stated that the DoddFrank Act SIPA amendments make the Commission’s proposed amendments to Rules
15c3-3 and 15c3-3a unnecessary. 257 As noted above, the definitions of customer,
customer property, and net equity in section 16 of SIPA were amended by the DoddFrank Act to take into account futures and options on futures held in a portfolio margin
account carried as a securities account pursuant to a Commission-approved portfolio
margining program. 258 Consequently, in a proceeding under SIPA, futures and options
on futures positions held in a portfolio margin account carried as a securities account
would be included in determining a customer’s net equity claim. 259 Therefore, the
proposed amendment relating to the unrealized value of a futures option is not necessary
to achieve the objective of providing SIPA protection for such positions. As a result, the
Commission is modifying the final rule to delete the proposed language in paragraph
(a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 that would have treated the unrealized value of a futures option in a
portfolio margin account on the filing date of a SIPA proceeding as a free credit balance
for purposes of Rule 15c3-3. 260

257

See SIFMA 4 Letter.

258

See Pub. L. No. 111–203 § 983.

259

Under the Dodd-Frank Act SIPA amendments, a customer’s net equity now includes all
positions in futures contracts and options on futures contracts held in a portfolio
margining account carried as a securities account pursuant to a portfolio margining
program approved by the Commission, including all property collateralizing such
positions, to the extent that such property is not otherwise included herein. See 15 U.S.C.
78lll(11)(A)(ii). Further, the amendment provided that a claim for a commodity futures
contract received, acquired, or held in a portfolio margining account pursuant to a
portfolio margining program approved by the Commission or a claim for a security
futures contract, shall be deemed to be a claim with respect to such contract as of the
filing date, and such claim shall be treated as a claim for cash. See 15 U.S.C. 78lll(11).

260

Specifically, the final rule does not include the proposed language: “, and, in the event the
broker-dealer is the subject of a proceeding under SIPA, the market value as of the “filing
date” as that term is defined in SIPA (15 U.S.C. 78lll(7)) of any long options on futures
contracts.”

As stated above, however, the remaining rule amendments to Rules 15c3-3 and
15c3-3a complement the amendments to SIPA and provide additional protections to
customers. Consequently, the Commission is adopting them with some technical
modifications in response to suggestions offered by commenters.
One commenter suggested a change to paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 that would
expand the definition of free credit balances to include cash balances related to futures
positions and the value of futures options positions on the SIPA filing date. 261 First, the
commenter noted that paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 concerns free credit balances,
which are funds subject to immediate payment (among other limitations). 262 The
commenter expressed concern that the Commission’s proposal could have been construed
as excluding cash balances in a portfolio margin account that are not subject to immediate
payment. The Commission agrees that the proposal could have been interpreted as
requiring that futures-related cash balances be treated differently depending on whether
or not they are subject to immediate payment.
The amendments to Rule 15c3-3 are designed to provide the same treatment to
futures-related cash balances in a portfolio margin account as applies to securities-related
cash balances. As discussed above, under Item 1 of Rule 15c3-3a, cash balances that do
not meet the definition of free credit balances (e.g., because they are not subject to
immediate payment) are included in the customer reserve formula if they meet the
definition of other credit balances under paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 15c3-3. 263
261

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

262

Id.

263

Item 1 of Rule 15c3-3a requires a broker-dealer to include in the customer reserve
formula free credit balances and other credit balances in customers’ securities accounts.
Paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 15c3-3 defines other credit balances as “cash liabilities of a
broker or dealer to customers other than free credit balances and funds in commodities
accounts segregated as aforesaid.” 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(9).

79

Consequently, to remove any ambiguity as to the effect of the rule changes in response to
the comments noted above, the Commission is amending paragraph (a)(9) of Rule 15c3-3
– which defines other credit balances – to include futures-related cash balances other than
free credit balances. In addition, the Commission has deleted the phrase “shall include
such liabilities,” in the amendment to proposed paragraph (a)(8) and replaced it with
“includes, if subject to immediate cash payment to customers on demand, funds...” to
clarify that this paragraph relates to cash balances in a portfolio margin account that are
subject to immediate payment and, hence, that paragraph (a)(9) relates to other cash
balances in a portfolio margin account.
One commenter suggested changes with respect to the marks to market language
in the rule, stating that the phrase relating to daily marks to market be modified to read
“variation margin or initial margin marks to market” and the phrase in the proposal that
read “proceeds resulting from closing out futures contracts and options thereon” be
modified to read “proceeds resulting from margin paid or released in connection with
closing out, settling or exercising futures contracts and options thereon.” 264 The
Commission agrees with these technical suggestions because they clarify the rule by
incorporating appropriate futures terminology.
Consequently, as adopted, the text in paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9) of Rule 15c3-3
expands the terms free credit balance and other credit balances to include “funds carried
in a securities account pursuant to a self-regulatory organization portfolio margin rule
approved by the Commission . . . including variation margin or initial margin, marks to
market, and proceeds resulting from margin paid or released in connection with closing

264

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

80

out, settling or exercising futures contracts and options thereon.” 265 The amendments, as
adopted, more precisely capture the Commission’s intent in terms of identifying the types
of futures-related cash balances that may be held in a portfolio margin account than the
language in the proposed rule.
On the debit side of the customer reserve formula, the Commission is adopting,
substantially as proposed, an amendment to Rule 15c3-3a Item 14 that permits a brokerdealer to include as a debit item the amount of customer margin required and on deposit
at a derivatives clearing organization related to futures positions carried in a portfolio
margin account. 266 Under SIPA, the term customer property includes, “resources
provided through the use or realization of customers’ debit cash balances and other
customer-related debit items as defined by the Commission by rule,” as well as, “in the
case of a portfolio margining account of a customer that is carried as a securities account
pursuant to a portfolio margining program approved by the Commission, a futures
contract or an option on a futures contract received, acquired, or held by or for the
account of a debtor from or for such portfolio margining account, and the proceeds
thereof.” 267 Under this provision of SIPA, this amendment to Rule 15c3-3 makes the

The Commission also is amending Item 14 of Rule 15c3-3a to replace the phrase
“Security futures products” with the phrase “security futures products.” In addition, the
Commission adopting some non-substantive amendments to Note G to Item 14,
including: (1) in paragraph (a) replacing the word “shall” with the word “must”; (2) in
paragraph (b) replacing the word “shall” with the word “will”; in the second line in
paragraph (b)(2) inserting the phrase “futures in a” before the phrase “portfolio margin
account” and deleting the word “margin”; (3) in paragraph (b)(2) replacing the word
“shall” with the word “will” in three places; (4) in the sixth and seventh lines of
paragraph (b)(2), inserting the phrase “futures in a” before the phrase “portfolio margin
account” and deleting the phrase “futures margin”; in paragraph (b)(3)(iv) replacing the
word “securities” with the word “security”, inserting the phrase “futures in a” before the
phrase “portfolio margin account” and deleting the word “futures”; and (4) in paragraph
(c), replacing the word “shall” with the word “will”, inserting the phrase “futures in a”
before the phrase “portfolio margin account” and deleting the word “futures.”

margin required and on deposit at a derivatives clearing organization part of the
“customer property” in the event the broker-dealer is placed in a SIPA liquidation. Thus,
it would be available for distribution to the failed firm’s customers.
Finally, one commenter suggested changes to Commission rules beyond those in
the proposing release. This commenter urged the Commission to consider amending
Rules 8c-1, 15c2-1, and 15c3-3 to provide that their provisions could be waived by
customers that are entitled to engage in derivative transactions in a portfolio margin
account, provided the customer agrees in writing to waive SIPA protection. 268 According
to the commenter, a customer executing such a waiver would not be entitled to the
protections under SIPA for customers and would be deemed a general creditor of the
broker-dealer with respect to claims arising from their portfolio margin accounts. At this
time, the Commission does not believe it would be appropriate to amend the rules as
recommended by the commenter because such changes are beyond the scope of this
rulemaking.
C.

Amendments With Respect to Securities Lending and Borrowing and
Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Transactions

In the proposing release, the Commission noted two concerns about stock lending
that arose from the failure of the registered broker-dealer MJK Clearing, Inc. (“MJK”); 269
namely: (1) that broker-dealers with principal liability in a stock loan transaction may
purport to be acting in an agency capacity and, consequently, not taking appropriate
capital charges; and (2) that broker-dealers that historically have not been active in stock
268

See American Bar Association Letter.

269

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12869. The failure of MJK
raised several concerns regarding securities lending transactions. As explained in more
detail in the proposing release, at the time of its failure, MJK owed cash collateral to
several borrowing broker-dealers. Id. at 12862, 12869–12870. These broker-dealers
suffered losses caused by MJK’s failures and, in later proceedings related to these losses,
questions arose as to whether these broker-dealers were acting as principal or agent.

82

loan activities may rapidly expand their balance sheets with such transactions and,
thereby, increase leverage to a level that poses significant financial risk to the firm and its
counterparties. In response, the Commission proposed, and is now adopting,
amendments to Rules 15c3-1 and 17a-11.
With respect to the Rule 15c3-1 proposal, the Commission is adopting the
amendment, as proposed. This amendment to subparagraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1
clarifies that broker-dealers providing securities lending and borrowing settlement
services are deemed, for purposes of the rule, to be acting as principal and are subject to
applicable capital deductions. 270 Under the amendment, these deductions can be avoided
if a broker-dealer takes certain steps to disclaim principal liability. In particular, the final
rule provides that “a broker or dealer that participates in a loan of securities by one party
to another party will be deemed a principal for the purpose of the deductions required
under this section, [i.e., deductions from net worth] unless the broker or dealer has fully
disclosed the identity of each party to the other and each party has expressly agreed in
writing that the obligations of the broker or dealer do not include a guarantee of
performance by the other party and that such party’s remedies in the event of a default by
the other party do not include a right of setoff against obligations, if any, of the broker or
dealer.” 271

270

A broker-dealer is required to deduct from net worth most unsecured receivables,
including the amount that the market value of a securities loan exceeds the value of
collateral obtained for the loan. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(B). Similarly, with
respect to repo transactions, a broker-dealer obligated to resell securities must, in
computing net capital, deduct the amount that the market value of the securities is less
than the resale price. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(F). A broker-dealer obligated to
repurchase securities must, in computing net capital, deduct the amount that the market
value of the securities is greater than the repurchase price to the extent the excess is
greater than certain percentages. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(c)(2)(iv)(F).

271

See paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1, as adopted. Standard master securities loan
agreements (including the annexes thereto) commonly used by the parties to a securities
lending transaction contain provisions for establishing agent (as opposed to principal)

83

The Commission received five comments on the proposed amendment. 272 Two
commenters objected to this amendment, stating that they believed the standard legal
documents used in securities lending transactions provide sufficient legal certainty on the
status of the parties. 273 The Commission, in recognition of standard stock loan agreement
templates, designed the amendment to accommodate the continued use of these industry
model agreements by incorporating their use into the rule’s requirements. For the
purposes of establishing a broker-dealer’s status as agent or lender, these agreements may
be sufficiently detailed to satisfy the new requirements. However, it would be the brokerdealer’s responsibility to ensure that any “standard” agreement contains the necessary
provisions to comply with this amendment, and that such provisions are not weakened by
any other language in the agreement or any subsequent amendment. The goal is to avoid
ambiguity about a broker-dealer’s status as agent or principal regarding the applicability
of the stock loan charges in the net capital rule. As the failure of MJK illustrated,
disputes can arise over whether a broker-dealer is acting as a principal or agent in a stock
loan transaction. 274 Under the formulation of the rule, a broker-dealer is presumed to be
acting in a principal capacity unless it can demonstrate through its agreements with the
other participants in the transaction that it is acting as agent. In this regard, a brokerdealer will be responsible for determining that its agreements are fully consistent with the
standards of the rule.

status in a securities lending and borrowing transaction that are consistent with the
requirements in paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1, as amended. See, e.g., 2000

84

One commenter asked for clarification on the timing of when the agent lender
must disclose the principal parties to one another in order to disclaim principal liability
under the rule. 275 This commenter stated that the amendment should be modified so as
not to require pre-trade disclosure of the identity of the principal, since under the agency
annex to standardized master lending agreements such disclosure can be made on the
next business day. 276 The amendment is intended to accommodate the continued use of
these industry model agreements by incorporating their use into the rule’s requirements.
Consequently, disclosure of principals in conformance with the requirements of the
“standard” stock loan agreement templates would be consistent with the requirements of
the rule (as long as the identity of the borrower and the lender is disclosed within one
business day after the trade date), which is designed to ensure that firms are taking the
required net capital charges related to the securities lending activity to the extent they
have principal liability.
The Commission also is adding new paragraph (c)(5) to Rule 17a-11 to help
identify broker-dealers with highly leveraged non-government securities lending and
borrowing and repurchase operations. 277 This new provision requires a broker-dealer to
notify the Commission whenever the total amount of money payable against all securities
loaned or subject to a repurchase agreement, or the total contract value of all securities
borrowed or subject to a reverse repurchase agreement, exceeds 2,500 percent of tentative
net capital; provided that, for purposes of this leverage threshold, transactions involving
government securities as defined in section 3(a)(42) of the Exchange Act, are excluded

from the calculation. 278 The amendment is designed to alert regulators to a sudden
increase in a broker-dealer’s stock loan and repo positions, which could indicate that the
broker-dealer is taking on new risk that it may have limited experience in managing.
One commenter supported the proposed amendment and believes the notification
could serve as “an early warning” that a firm is approaching insolvency and generally
supports the Commission’s efforts to protect customers from broker-dealers who
recklessly rely on excessively leveraged transactions. 279
In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that a leverage threshold of
25 times tentative net capital would be triggered by 21 broker-dealers on a regular
basis. 280 The Commission stated that this establishes a threshold high enough to only
capture on a regular basis those few firms highly active in securities lending and repo
transactions. The Commission did not receive any comments regarding the 2,500%
tentative net capital threshold in the proposing release. Based on FOCUS Report data, as
of December 31, 2011, there were six broker-dealers whose securities loaned and
securities borrowed transactions exceeded 25 times their tentative net capital. The
Commission continues to believe that the 2,500% threshold is an appropriate notice
trigger for a firm that historically has not been as active in these transactions but rapidly
leverages up its securities lending and repo positions. Given the updated estimates of
how many broker-dealers would trigger this threshold, the Commission believes the
proposed threshold is high enough to capture on a regular basis only those few firms

278

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42). “Government securities” generally present less market risk than
other types of securities used in securities lending and repo transactions. Consequently,
they are excluded from the scope of the rule.

86

highly active in securities lending and repo transactions. Therefore, the Commission is
retaining this 2,500% threshold in the final rule without revision.
As proposed, the amendment to Rule 17a-11 also would have provided that a
broker-dealer that submitted a monthly report of its stock loan and repo activity to its
DEA need not file the notices. This provision was designed to accommodate large
broker-dealers that are active in this business and regularly maintain stock loan and repo
balances that exceed the threshold. The Commission expects that these broker-dealers
have experience in managing the risks specific to these types of transactions and have
established controls to address those risks. Consequently, a notice under paragraph (c)(5)
from these broker-dealers might not be as useful in providing risk assessment information
to regulators. Instead, the monthly reports will provide the Commission and other
financial regulators with information with which to develop trend analysis, when deemed
appropriate. They could use this analysis to identify leverage levels that are outside the
normal trend range, and which may be indicative of a material change in the firm’s
business model that could indicate it was taking on higher levels of leverage, branching
into new products, or experiencing operational or financial difficulties (e.g., the firm
could be reducing leverage rapidly because creditors were not willing to enter into new
transactions).
Three commenters addressed the proposed monthly notification requirement. 281
They stated that the monthly report in lieu of the notification should be provided as part
of the monthly FOCUS report many broker-dealers file with their DEA. 282 The
Commission agrees that the FOCUS report may be an appropriate mechanism for
reporting stock loan and repo positions in lieu of the proposed monthly notification

87

requirement. 283 Consequently, the Commission has modified the final rule to delete the
phrase “submits a monthly report of” and replace it with “reports monthly.” 284 In
addition, as adopted, in order to provide that the monthly report be sent to a brokerdealer’s DEA, the Commission added the phrase “to its designated examining authority
in a form acceptable” before “to its designated examining authority.” 285 This language,
as adopted, will provide each DEA with the flexibility to prescribe how the monthly
reports are to be made and will accommodate a DEA that opts to use the FOCUS report
as the reporting mechanism. 286 In summary, as adopted, the notice exemption in
paragraph (c)(5) will state “provided further, however, that a broker or dealer will not be
required to send the notice required by this paragraph (c)(5) if it reports monthly its
securities lending and borrowing and repurchase and reverse repurchase activity
(including the total amount of money payable against securities loaned or subject to a
repurchase agreement and the total contract value of securities borrowed or subject to a
reverse repurchase agreement) to its designated examining authority in a form acceptable
to its designated examining authority.” 287
A commenter asked the Commission to clarify that the new reporting provision of
paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-11 is triggered only by principal activity meeting or
exceeding stated thresholds. 288 The notification provision applies when a broker-dealer is
acting as principal and exceeds the stated thresholds, and a broker-dealer will not need to

D.

Documentation of Risk Management Procedures

It is important for broker-dealers to document the controls they establish for
managing the material risk exposures that arise from their business activities. For
example, a broker-dealer active in securities lending is exposed to a variety of risks,
including market risk, 289 credit risk, 290 and liquidity risk. 291 Other broker-dealer
activities give rise to these risks as well, including managing a repo book, dealing in OTC
derivatives, trading proprietary positions, and lending on margin. A well-documented
system of internal controls designed to manage material risk exposures reflects the
determination of a firm’s management as to how its business activities should be
conducted in light of such exposures. It also enables management to better identify,
analyze, and manage the risks inherent in the firm’s business activities with a view to
preventing material losses and to review whether the firm’s activities are being conducted
in a manner that is consistent with such procedures and controls as well as in accordance
with the Federal securities laws. Risk management controls are particularly important for
the largest broker-dealers, which generally engage in a wide range of highly complex
activities across many different markets and geographical locations.
While most broker-dealers already have well-documented procedures and controls
for managing risks as a matter of business practice, it is important to reinforce the
289

Generally, market risk is the risk that prices, values, or rates will adversely change.

Generally, credit risk is the risk of loss resulting from a counterparty or other type of
obligor failing to meet an obligation, including an obligation with respect to a loan,
security, swap, option, or settlement.

practice and make it easier for regulators to understand a broker-dealer’s procedures and
controls so that they can review whether the broker-dealer is adhering to them.
Consequently, the Commission proposed an amendment to Rule 17a-3 that would have
required a broker-dealer to create a record documenting its “internal risk management
controls.” 292
Commenters raised concerns that the proposed amendment would be “overly
broad and ambiguous” 293 and “so broad as to create uncertainty.” 294 Three commenters
argued that the requirement, if adopted, should be limited to market, credit, and liquidity
risk management. 295 Another commenter recommended that the Commission propose
the minimum elements required to be documented, such as market risk, credit risk,
liquidity risk, and operational risk. 296 While market, credit, and liquidity risk were
among the specific examples of risk identified in the proposed rule, 297 the Commission
agrees that the phrase “risk controls” could be interpreted very broadly. To address this
concern, the Commission has modified the final rule to clarify its application. The final
rule requires the documentation of controls established specifically to manage market,
credit, and liquidity risk, “which have more commonly understood meanings within the
industry.” 298 This also focuses the rule on the key risks inherent in conducting a
securities business.

298

E*Trade Letter. The final rule also deletes the term “internal” because it would be
redundant.

90

Commenters also requested that the Commission clarify that, when a brokerdealer is part of a corporate family, risk management controls could be applicable to
multiple entities within the corporate family, including the broker-dealer. 299 In response,
the final rule does not specify the type of controls a broker-dealer must establish to
manage these risks. It simply requires the documentation of the procedures the brokerdealer has established. Broker-dealers that are part of holding companies may be subject
to procedures that are used globally throughout the organization. As long as the brokerdealer maintains documented procedures of controls pertaining to the designated entity,
the requirements of the rule would be met.
Other commenters requested that the Commission clarify that the risk
management controls do not have to include any minimum elements 300 and that the rule
does not impose any qualitative requirements. 301 Two commenters suggested that
because there were no stated content requirements for the risk management controls, it
would be difficult for a firm to prove that their risk management procedures were
adequate, which could lead to a “subjective process” 302 or to examiners applying a “one
size fits all” best practices standard. 303 One commenter suggested that to address this
issue, the Commission should articulate the process that examiners will follow when
examining risk management controls. 304 Finally, one commenter encouraged the

Commission to consider strengthening this requirement in terms of both its scope and
applicability. 305
The Commission is not mandating any specific controls, procedures, or policies
that must be established by a broker-dealer to manage market, credit, or liquidity risk, nor
is it requiring any minimum elements or specifying any procedures that would be
required to be included in a firm’s market, credit, and liquidity risk management policies.
Rather, the Commission is requiring that a control, procedure, or policy be documented if
it is in place. Based on staff experience monitoring large broker-dealers, the Commission
anticipates that most brokers-dealers that will be subject to this rule already have
documented controls, procedures, and policies as part of their overall risk management
processes. The purpose of this amendment is not to change the controls, procedures, and
policies that are in place, but to require that they be adequately documented.
For the foregoing reasons, paragraph (a)(23) to Rule 17a-3, as adopted, requires
certain broker-dealers to make and keep current a record documenting the credit, market,
and liquidity risk management controls established and maintained by the broker-dealer
to assist it in analyzing and managing the risks associated with its business activities. 306
This documentation requirement applies only to broker-dealers that have more than (1)
$1,000,000 in aggregate credit items as computed under the customer reserve formula of
Rule 15c3-3, or (2) $20,000,000 in capital, including debt subordinated in accordance
with Appendix D to Rule 15c3-1. 307

306

See paragraph (a)(23) of Rule 17a-3, as adopted.

The Commission also has modified paragraph (a)(23) of Rule 17a-3 from the proposed
rule to delete the reference to the term “member” in two places in the final rule because
the reference to “member” is unnecessary. Id.

92

The Commission also proposed adding paragraph (e)(9) to Rule 17a-4 to require a
broker-dealer to retain the documented risk management controls or procedures until
three years after the broker-dealer terminates the use of the system of controls or
procedures documented therein. One commenter stated that given the minimal cost of
electronic storage, the commenter believes that the retention period could be extended
beyond three years. 308 Conversely, two commenters suggested that Rule 17a-4 be revised
so that a broker-dealer would not be required to maintain outdated versions of its risk
management controls. 309
The Commission is adding paragraph (e)(9) to Rule 17a-4, with a minor
modification from the proposed amendment. Specifically, the final rule is modified to
require retention of the records until three years after termination of the use of the risk
management controls documented therein by replacing the phrase “systems of controls or
procedures” with the phrase “risk management controls.” 310 This modification maintains
consistency with the terminology in paragraph (a)(23) of Rule 17a-3, as adopted, which
requires broker-dealers to make and keep current a “record documenting the credit,
market, and liquidity risk management controls established and maintained by the broker
or dealer.” 311 Finally, the three year retention period is designed to establish an audit trail
between the risk management controls that have most recently been made inoperative and
the risk management controls currently in effect to provide sufficient opportunity to
review the former during the broker-dealer’s exam cycle. Three years also is consistent

with the retention period for many of the records required to be preserved under Rule
17a-4. 312
Finally, one commenter noted that the proposed amendment does not impose any
requirements beyond those applicable under Rule 15c3-4. 313 Accordingly, the
commenter urged the Commission to create an exception from the proposed amendment
to Rule 17a-3 for a broker-dealer that is effectively subject to Rule 15c3-4. With the
modifications to the final rule to include only market, credit, and liquidity risk, a brokerdealer subject to the conditions of Rule 15c3-4 would already comply with this
amendment given that these risks are included in the risks a broker-dealer would be
required to address under Rule 15c3-4. Therefore, an exception from the rule is
unnecessary.
E.

Amendments to the Net Capital Rule

Under Rule 15c3-1, broker-dealers are required to maintain, at all times, a
minimum amount of net capital. 314 The capital standard in Rule 15c3-1 is a net liquid
assets test. This standard is designed to allow a broker-dealer the flexibility to engage in
activities that are part of conducting a securities business (e.g., taking securities into
inventory) but in a manner that places the firm in the position of holding at all times more
than one dollar of highly liquid assets for each dollar of unsubordinated liabilities (e.g.,
money owed to customers, counterparties, and creditors). 315 For example, Rule 15c3-1

allows securities positions to count as allowable net capital, subject to standardized or
model-based deductions (“haircuts”). 316 The rule, however, does not permit most
unsecured receivables to count as allowable net capital. 317 This aspect of the rule
severely limits the ability of broker-dealers to engage in activities that generate unsecured
receivables (e.g., lending money without obtaining collateral). The rule also does not
permit fixed assets or other illiquid assets to count as allowable net capital, which creates
disincentives for broker-dealers to own real estate and other fixed assets that cannot be
readily converted into cash. 318 For these reasons, Rule 15c3-1 incentivizes brokerdealers to confine their business activities and devote capital to activities such as
underwriting, market making, and advising on and facilitating customer securities
transactions. 319

Rule 15c3-1 requires broker-dealers to maintain a minimum level of net capital
(meaning highly liquid capital) at all times. 320 The rule requires that a broker-dealer
perform two calculations: (1) a computation of the minimum amount of net capital the
broker-dealer must maintain; 321 and (2) a computation of the amount of net capital the
broker-dealer is maintaining. 322 The minimum net capital requirement is the greater of a
fixed-dollar amount specified in the rule and an amount determined by applying one of
two financial ratios: the 15-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net capital ratio or the 2% of
aggregate debit items ratio. 323
In computing net capital, the broker-dealer must, among other things, make
certain adjustments to net worth such as deducting illiquid assets, taking other capital
charges, and adding qualifying subordinated loans. 324 The amount remaining after these
adjustments is defined as tentative net capital. 325 The final step in computing net capital
is to take prescribed percentage deductions (“standardized haircuts”) from the mark-tomarket value of the proprietary positions (e.g., securities, money market instruments, and
commodities) that are included in its tentative net capital. 326 The standardized haircuts
are designed to account for the market risk inherent in these positions and to create a
buffer of liquidity to protect against other risks associated with the securities business. 327

taking market risk charges as an alternative approach in lieu of the standardized haircuts
for classes of positions for which they have been approved to use models. 328 Rule 15c3-1
imposes substantially higher minimum capital requirements for ANC broker-dealers and
OTC derivatives dealers, as compared to other types of broker-dealers, because, among
other reasons, the use of internal models to compute net capital can substantially reduce
the deductions for securities and money market positions as compared with the
standardized haircuts. 329

Requirement to Deduct From Net Worth Certain Liabilities or

justification for the exclusion is that a third party (usually a parent or affiliate) has
assumed responsibility for these expenses and debts through an expense sharing
agreement. 331 In some cases, however, the third party does not have the resources –
independent of the broker-dealer’s revenues and assets – to assume these liabilities.
Thus, the third party is dependent on the resources of the broker-dealer to pay the
expenses and debts. Excluding liabilities from the broker-dealer’s net worth calculation
in these situations may misrepresent the firm’s actual financial condition, deceive the
firm’s customers, and hamper the ability of regulators to monitor the firm’s financial
condition. 332
To address this issue, the Commission proposed – and is now adopting
substantially as proposed – an amendment to Rule 15c3-1 to add a new paragraph
(c)(2)(i)(F) that will require a broker-dealer, in calculating net capital, to take into
account any liabilities that are assumed by a third party if the broker-dealer cannot
demonstrate that the third party has the resources – independent of the broker-dealer’s
income and assets – to pay the liabilities. 333
The Commission received five comments regarding this proposal. 334 Two
commenters stated that the amendment was overly burdensome and that it would not
result in a more accurate picture of a broker-dealer’s financial condition than obtained

As adopted, the final rule does not include the “-” in the phrase “third-party.” In addition,
the final rule uses the phrase “broker or dealer” in the place of the phrase “broker-dealer”
(which appeared in two places) to maintain consistency throughout Rule 15c3-1, which
uses the phrase “broker or dealer.”

through current requirements. 335 One of these commenters added that any
implementation and enforcement of the amendments “should not be made retroactive.” 336
This commenter stated that it is unclear how, and unlikely that, this amendment would
achieve any of the desired results and argued that it could conversely impair a firm’s
ability to continue as a going concern. 337 Finally, this commenter also argued that this
amendment would affect capital transactions that originate at the holding company
level. 338 Two commenters agreed in principle with the amendments but urged the
Commission to carefully consider the potential consequences of implementation and to
provide clarification on the standard for demonstrating that the third party has adequate
financial resources, including factors beyond those referred to in the proposing release
that they believed would be potentially relevant. 339 One commenter supported the
Commission’s goal of clarifying disclosures relating to expense sharing or obligations. 340
As with the proposal, the amendment, as adopted, is designed to prohibit a
practice that could misrepresent a broker-dealer’s actual financial condition, deceive the
firm’s customers, and hamper the ability of regulators to monitor the firm’s financial
condition. Moreover, the amendment, as adopted, should not impose undue burdens or
present serious implementation difficulties because the requirement is consistent with
prior staff guidance regarding the treatment of broker-dealer expenses assumed by a third
party. 341 Finally, as compared to staff guidance, a federal regulation offers broker-

dealers greater certainty as to how to treat expense sharing agreements under Rule 15c31.
In response to the comments discussed above, and as the Commission explained
in the proposing release, a broker-dealer can demonstrate the adequacy of the third
party’s financial resources by maintaining records such as the third party’s most recent
(i.e., as of a date within the previous twelve months) audited financial statements, tax
returns, or regulatory filings containing financial reports. 342 Given that the entity to
which the broker-dealer is seeking to shift one or more liabilities typically is an affiliate,
the staff’s experience is that such records should be available to the broker-dealer.
Further, because the proposed rule change is consistent with prior staff guidance
regarding the need to be able to demonstrate the third party’s financial adequacy, 343 a
broker-dealer seeking to shift a liability to a third party already would be expected to
provide such evidence of the third party’s financial resources. For these reasons, the
change from staff guidance to Commission rule should not result in implementation and
burden concerns of the magnitude raised by the two commenters. 344
Finally, one commenter noted it would be helpful if the Commission would
clarify whether this amendment supersedes the Commission staff guidance in the Third
Party Expense Letter. 345 Unlike the PAIB Letter discussed above, the Commission is not
directing the staff to withdraw the Third Party Expense Letter on the effective date of
these amendments. The Third Party Expense Letter will still be relevant as staff

guidance, notwithstanding that it contains a condition that has been codified into Rule
15c3-1 (i.e., that an expense of the broker-dealer assumed by a third party will be
considered a liability for net capital purposes unless the broker-dealer can demonstrate
that the third party has adequate resources independent of the broker-dealer to pay the
liability or expense). 346 In particular, the letter contains additional staff guidance not
incorporated into the rule that will be relevant as staff guidance with respect to complying
with the amendment to Rule 15c3-1 being adopted today. For example, the letter
contains staff guidance with respect to the records a broker-dealer would be expected to
make, keep current, and preserve under Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 with respect to brokerdealer liabilities and expenses assumed by a third party, as well as requirements regarding
written expense sharing agreements. 347 Broker-dealers can continue to rely on the
guidance in the Third Party Expense Letter with respect to these matters in complying
with today’s amendment.
2.

Requirement to Subtract From Net Worth Certain NonPermanent Capital Contributions

In the proposing release, the Commission noted its concern that broker-dealers
may be receiving capital contributions from investors that are subsequently withdrawn
after a short period of time (often less than a year). 348 In some cases, the capital may be
contributed under an agreement giving the investor the option to withdraw it at the
investor’s discretion. In the past, the Commission has emphasized that capital
contributions to broker-dealers should not be temporary, 349 and the Commission staff has

explained that a capital contribution should be treated as a liability if it is made with the
understanding that the contribution can be withdrawn at the option of the investor. 350
Consistent with these Commission and staff positions that capital is not
temporary, 351 and given the importance of this issue and the Commission’s concern that
broker-dealers may not be properly treating short-term capital contributions as liabilities,
the Commission proposed amending Rule 15c3-1 to add paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G) to further
incorporate these positions into the rule. 352 The proposed change would require a brokerdealer to treat as a liability any capital that is contributed under an agreement giving the
investor the option to withdraw it or that is contributed with the intent to withdraw the
capital within one year. The Commission further proposed that capital withdrawn within
one year would be presumptively subject to treatment as a liability (i.e., it would be
presumed to have been contributed with the intent to withdraw within one year). 353
The Commission is adopting the final rule amendment with certain modifications.
As adopted, the rule requires that a broker-dealer treat as a liability any capital that is

is the view of the Division that, for net capital purposes, if an individual investor
contributes capital to a broker-dealer with an understanding that the contribution can be
withdrawn at the option of the individual investor, the contribution may not be included
in the firm’s net capital computation and must be re-characterized as a liability. Any
withdrawal of capital as to that investor within a period of one year, other than a
withdrawal described in paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule 15c3-1, shall be presumed to have
been contemplated at the time of the contribution.”) (footnote omitted); see also Net

contributed under an agreement giving the investor the option to withdraw it. The rule,
as adopted, also requires that a broker-dealer treat as a liability any capital contribution
that is intended to be withdrawn within one year of its contribution. In addition, the final
rule provides that capital withdrawn within one year of contribution is deemed to have
been intended to be withdrawn within one year unless the broker-dealer receives
permission in writing for the withdrawal from its DEA. 354 The ability of a broker-dealer
to seek permission in writing from its DEA to withdraw capital contributed within one
year will provide a means for firms to seek to withdraw capital in limited circumstances
after review by its DEA without having to reclassify the withdrawn capital as a liability
for net capital purposes. 355
In the final rule, the Commission has modified the proposed language by moving
the qualifier that the DEA can approve a withdrawal so that it modifies this presumption.
Specifically, as proposed, the rule provided that a contribution of capital had to be
subtracted from net worth if it “is intended to be withdrawn within a period of one year
unless the withdrawal has been approved in writing by the Examining Authority for the
broker or dealer.” As adopted, the rule provides that “[a]ny withdrawal of capital made
within one year of its contribution is deemed to have been intended to be withdrawn
within a period of one year, unless the withdrawal has been approved in writing by the

These requirements will not apply to withdrawals covered by paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule
15c3-1, namely, withdrawals used to make tax payments or to pay reasonable
compensation to partners. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(e)(4)(iii). These types of payments
are ordinary business expenditures and do not raise the types of concerns the proposed
rule is designed to address. One commenter suggested that the rule be amended to
explicitly exclude any withdrawals that would fall under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule
15c3-1.

Examining Authority for the broker or dealer.” 356 The change is intended to eliminate a
potential ambiguity in the proposal as to whether a withdrawal of capital within one year
could ever be approved by the firm’s DEA and, therefore, afford the intended relief from
the deduction. 357
The Commission received five comments regarding the amendment to paragraph
(c)(2)(i)(G)(2) of Rule 15c3-1. 358 In addition to the general request for comment
included in the proposing release, the Commission also requested specific comment on
whether the time period within which withdrawn and intended-to-be-withdrawn
contributions must be treated as liabilities should be longer than one year. 359 While the
commenters agreed in principle that contributions of capital to broker-dealers should not
be subject to withdrawal at will, they expressed concerns regarding the negative effect
that overly restrictive limitations on withdrawals of capital could have on obtaining
capital contributions and, therefore, on the financial health of broker-dealers. One
commenter, a registered broker-dealer, stated that it believed that the amendment would
raise its cost of capital to the point where it would be impossible to obtain capital from
unrelated third parties at all. 360 Two commenters also expressed concerns about the
potential burden posed by the amendment to broker-dealers in need of capital. 361 One
suggested the addition of exceptions to the rule for de minimis withdrawals and dividends

356

See paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G)(2) of Rule 15c3-1, as adopted.

357

The phrase “to the broker or dealer” following “one year of its contribution” is not
included in the final rule because it would be redundant, as the contributions covered in
the amendment all involve contributions to the broker-dealer.

or distributions. 362 Another commenter suggested that the proposal should be amended
to exclude a redemption right – a form of option - provided to the investor in connection
with the investor’s capital contribution to the broker-dealer, where (i) the redemption
right may only be exercised by the investor commencing more than one year following
the date of the capital contribution to the broker-dealer and (ii) the redemption right
would not be mandatorily redeemable. 363
Another commenter opposed the rule, stating that it contravenes pertinent legal
and accounting standards and is unnecessary in view of existing capital withdrawal
limitations and notification requirements. 364 This commenter stated that neither GAAP
nor Rule 15c3-1 contain a requirement that capital must be permanent, and the word
“capital” has no intrinsic meaning that requires it to be permanent. 365 This commenter
stated that if any further limitations on capital withdrawals are adopted beyond the
current provisions of the net capital rule, they should be designed to allow for the ability
of broker-dealer holding companies to withdraw excess net capital at their option for
legitimate purposes. 366
The fifth commenter agreed that there should be no circumstance in which a
broker-dealer accepted a capital contribution for net capital purposes that could be
withdrawn at the option of the investor. 367 This commenter, however, also stated that the
standard for withdrawals should be shortened from one year to nine or six months to
increase the availability of funds from investors and owners, allowing more broker362

dealers to raise capital and strengthen their financial stability. 368 The commenter
requested that the Commission consider the needs of small firms that it said likely will
require additional net capital over the next decade. 369
In response to the commenters’ concerns about firms’ ability to obtain capital and
that the amendment contravenes pertinent legal and accounting standards, the amended
rule merely clarifies what constitutes a broker-dealer’s permanent capital under Rule
15c3-1 and further emphasizes the requirement that capital contributions cannot be
temporary. 370 Rule 15c3-1 imposes a capital standard that is distinct from the use of the
term “capital” in other legal and accounting contexts, and the rule amendments under

See Net Capital Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 28927 (Feb. 28, 1991) (“The
Commission wishes to emphasize that the net capital maintained in a broker-dealer
should be permanent capital and not merely a temporary infusion of funds from an
affiliate or other sources. For example, there are instances where a broker-dealer receives
funds from an affiliate in an amount that would enable the broker-dealer to engage in a
transaction that it would otherwise be prohibited from doing because of minimum net
capital requirements. If the funds are transferred back to the affiliate within a relatively
short period of time after the transaction, the Commission questions whether the funds
transferred into the broker-dealer entity could properly be characterized as capital of the
firm. Instead, the transaction could be viewed as a loan by the affiliate to the brokerdealer, with the result that the broker-dealer would have to treat the transaction as a
liability.”). See also Net Capital Requirements for Brokers and Dealers, Exchange Act

exceptions for de minimis withdrawals, dividends, or distributions. As previously stated,
however, the Commission has emphasized that capital contributions should not be
temporary. 372 Moreover, paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-1 already contains mechanisms to
permit a broker-dealer to make capital withdrawals for specified purposes. 373 Finally, if a
broker-dealer believes it has a basis to appropriately withdraw capital within one year of
contribution because, for example, the withdrawal would be de minimis, the final rule

responsibility rules of the Commission and the various exchanges resulted in a semantic
confusion which too frequently has led to the mistaken belief that a broker-dealer’s net
capital is the equivalent of or has some relationship to the concept of “capital”, as that
term is commonly understood. “Net Capital” applies only to a hard core residue of net
liquid assets designed to enable a broker-dealer to meet all rightful current demands of
customers for their funds and securities.”). See also Capital, Margin, and Segregation

compute the broker-dealer’s net worth under GAAP. Next, the broker-dealer must make
certain adjustments to its net worth to calculate net capital. These adjustments are
designed to leave the firm in a position where each dollar of unsubordinated liabilities is
matched by more than a dollar of highly liquid assets. There are thirteen categories of net

proposed rule is designed to address.”).

provides a mechanism for the broker-dealer to seek permission in writing from its DEA
to make such a withdrawal. 374
With respect to a commenter’s view that the standard for withdrawal should be
less than one year (e.g., six or nine months), the Commission continues to believe that
one year is an appropriate amount of time that a broker-dealer must retain a contribution
in order to classify it as capital and not a liability. This is the standard that the
Commission staff and FINRA have applied for a number of years and there is no
compelling reason to change it. 375 Because the final rule change is an incorporation of,
among other things, existing Commission staff guidance into Rule 15c3-1, the
requirement should not significantly alter current practice.
Moreover, with respect to commenters’ concerns about the ability to obtain
capital, the rule does not prohibit an investor from withdrawing capital at any time. It
prohibits a broker-dealer from treating temporary cash infusions as capital for purposes of
Rule 15c3-1. Finally, as stated above, the final rule provides a mechanism for a brokerdealer to apply to its DEA to make a withdrawal without triggering the deduction. 376
This provides a process for firms to affect withdrawals within one year where
appropriate.

See paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G)(2) of Rule 15c3-1, as adopted.

See Temporary Capital Letter; FINRA Rule 4110(c)(1) (“No equity capital of a member
may be withdrawn for a period of one year from the date such equity capital is
contributed, unless otherwise permitted by FINRA in writing.”). See also Exchange Act
Release No. 60933 (Nov. 4, 2009), 74 FR 58334 (Nov. 12, 2009) (SR-FINRA-2008-067);
Net Capital Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 28927 (Feb. 28, 1991) (emphasizing “that
the net capital maintained in a broker-dealer should be permanent capital and not merely
a temporary infusion of funds from an affiliate or other sources”).

376

The final rule does not distinguish between complete and partial withdrawals of capital
and, consequently, the deduction could be triggered in either event. Moreover, a partial
withdrawal would require a deduction of the full amount of the original contribution as it
would indicate that the contribution was merely temporary in nature.

108

In summary, the Commission is adding paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G) to Rule 15c3-1 to
require a broker-dealer to subtract from net worth any contribution of capital to the
broker or dealer: “(1) [u]nder an agreement that provides the investor with the option to
withdraw the capital; or (2) [t]hat is intended to be withdrawn within a period of one year
of contribution.” 377 The final rule further provides that “[a]ny withdrawal of capital
made within one year of its contribution is deemed to have been intended to be
withdrawn within a period of one year, unless the withdrawal has been approved in
writing by the Examining Authority for the broker or dealer.” 378

Requirement to Deduct the Amount by which a Fidelity Bond
Deductible Exceeds SRO Limits

Under SRO rules, certain broker-dealers that do business with the public or that
are required to become members of SIPC must comply with mandatory fidelity bonding
requirements. 379 SRO rules typically permit a broker-dealer to have a deductible
provision included in the bond; however, such rules provide that the deductible may not
exceed certain amounts. With regard to firms that maintain deductible amounts over the
maximum amount specified, several SRO rules provide that the broker-dealer must
deduct this excess amount from its net worth when calculating net capital under Rule
377

See paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G) of Rule 15c3-1, as adopted.

378

Id.

379

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 4360, CBOE Rule 9.22, and NASDAQ OMX PHLX Rule 705.
SRO fidelity bonding requirements typically contain agreements covering areas such as:
a “Fidelity” insuring clause to indemnify against loss of property through dishonest or
fraudulent acts of employees; an “On Premises” agreement insuring against losses
resulting from crimes such as burglary and theft and from misplacement of property of
the insured; an “In Transit” clause indemnifying against losses occurring while property
is in transit; a “Forgery and Alteration” agreement insuring against loss due to forgery or
alteration of various kinds of negotiable instruments; and a “Securities Loss” clause
protecting against losses incurred through forgery and alteration of securities. Id.

109

15c3-1. 380 Other SROs require that any deductible amount elected by a broker-dealer
that is greater than 10% of the coverage purchased by the broker-dealer must be deducted
from the broker-dealer’s net worth when calculating net capital under Rule 15c3-1. 381
Rule 15c3-1, however, does not specifically reference the SRO deductible
requirements as a charge to net worth. Therefore, a broker-dealer would not be required
to account for the deduction required by an SRO rule in computing net capital under Rule
15c3-1 or in the net capital computation reflected on the broker-dealer’s FOCUS report.
To address this inconsistency, the Commission proposed to amend Rule 15c3-1 to add
paragraph (c)(2)(xiv) to require a broker-dealer to deduct, with regard to fidelity bonding
requirements, the amount required by the rules of the broker-dealer’s DEA, i.e., the
amount in excess of the deductible prescribed in the applicable DEA’s fidelity bond
rule. 382 The Commission received one comment supporting the proposal and one
opposing it. 383 The commenter opposing the amendment noted that amending Rule 15c31 to conform to FINRA Rule 4360 would create an increase in minimum net capital
requirements for some broker-dealers. 384
SRO rules prescribing fidelity bond deductibles, and capital charges for
deductibles in excess of a certain amount, are designed to incentivize broker-dealers to
carry fidelity bonds with a deductible low enough to help ensure customer protection.
Moreover, in response to the comment that this amendment would increase minimum net
capital requirements, the Commission notes that broker-dealers that are members of an

SRO with such a fidelity bonding rule already must account for the deduction in
complying with the net capital requirements of the SROs and nothing in the
Commission’s amendment to paragraph (c)(2)(xiv) of Rule 15c3-1 would alter this status
quo. Rather, the proposed rule change would conform the capital calculation under
paragraph (c)(2)(xiv) of Rule 15c3-1 to that required by the broker-dealer’s SRO.
For these reasons, the Commission is adopting paragraph (c)(2)(xiv) to Rule
15c3-1 with technical revisions to the proposed rule text to make the text of the final rule,
as adopted, a more generic cross reference to SRO fidelity bond requirements. The
technical changes are designed to increase the flexibility of the final rule so that revisions
to SRO fidelity bond requirements pursuant to section 19(b) of the Exchange Act 385 will
not require conforming amendments to paragraph (c)(2)(xiv) of Rule 15c3-1. 386 More
specifically, the proposed rule text, as set forth in the proposing release, would have
required the broker-dealer to deduct “with respect to fidelity bond coverage, the excess of
any deductible amount over the maximum deductible amount permitted by the
Examining Authority for the broker or dealer.” 387 The final rule, as adopted, provides
that the broker-dealer must deduct “the amount specified by rule of the Examining
Authority for the broker or dealer with respect to a requirement to maintain fidelity bond
coverage.” 388 Thus, the final rule does not include the phrase “maximum permissible
deductible amounts.” This phrase was borrowed from SRO fidelity bond rules. Because

Broker-Dealer Solvency Requirement

The Commission is adopting an amendment to paragraph (a) of Rule 15c3-1 to
require a broker-dealer to cease conducting a securities business if certain insolvency
events were to occur. Specifically, as adopted, amended paragraph (a) of Rule 15c3-1
provides that a broker-dealer must not be insolvent as that term is defined in new
paragraph (c)(16) of the rule. 390 By making solvency a requirement of Rule 15c3-1, this
amendment will require an insolvent 391 broker-dealer to cease conducting a securities
business pursuant to section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act, which generally prohibits a
broker-dealer from effecting any transaction in, or inducing or attempting to induce the
purchase or sale of, any security in contravention of the Commission’s financial
responsibility rules (which include Rule 15c3-1). 392
As proposed, paragraph (c)(16) of Rule 15c3-1 would have defined the term
insolvent as, among other things, a broker-dealer’s placement in a voluntary or
involuntary bankruptcy or similar proceeding; the appointment of a trustee, receiver, or
similar official; a general assignment by the broker-dealer for the benefit of its creditors;
an admission of insolvency; or the inability to make computations necessary to establish

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 4360. See also Exchange Act Release No. 63961 (Feb. 24,
2011), 76 FR 11542 (Mar. 2, 2011).

390

The final rule also has been modified by replacing the word “shall” with the word
“must.”

391

The definition of insolvent is intended to be broad enough to encompass any type of
insolvency proceeding or condition of insolvency; for example, the proposed definition
incorporates concepts of insolvency in the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and SIPA. See 11
U.S.C. 101; 15 U.S.C. 78eee(b)(1).

compliance with Rule 15c3-1. 393 As discussed more specifically below, the Commission
modified paragraph (c)(16) of Rule 15c3-1 in the final rule in response to concerns raised
by commenters.
In the proposing release, the Commission solicited comment on whether there are
other insolvency events that should be captured in the proposed definition. 394 One
commenter noted that involuntary insolvency proceedings do not necessarily indicate that
the broker-dealer is insolvent, as such proceedings can be frivolous, malicious, or
otherwise lacking in merit. 395 The commenter also noted that industry standard contract
forms generally provide a grace period for a party to such a proceeding to obtain a stay or
dismissal before an event of default is deemed to occur. 396 In response to this comment,
the Commission notes that the number of broker-dealer bankruptcy filings (voluntary or
involuntary) is small, and therefore, the institution of a frivolous involuntary proceeding
involving a broker-dealer likely is a very rare event. Thus, the Commission must
consider the potential need for an automatic grace period to address the potential for a
frivolous involuntary bankruptcy as well as the harm that could result from allowing a
broker-dealer to continue to effect securities transactions for a period of time even though
it is properly the subject of a bankruptcy proceeding. The Commission believes the more
appropriate approach is to address potentially frivolous proceedings on a case-by-case
basis. In the event that a case arises where there would be a need to fashion relief for a
393

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12872–12873. A brokerdealer’s inability to make computations necessary to establish compliance with Rule
15c3-1 may also impact the broker-dealer’s ability to make the computations necessary to
establish compliance with Rule 15c3-3 and vice versa. See, e.g., Rule 15c3-1(a)(1)(ii)
(incorporating computations under Rule 15c3-3 into the minimum net capital
requirement).

broker-dealer that was the subject of a frivolous or meritless involuntary petition, the
Commission’s existing authority permits it sufficient flexibility to fashion exemptions
under appropriate circumstances. 397
In addition to the comment discussed above, the Commission received four other
comment letters that addressed these amendments. 398 One commenter objected to the
amendments as unnecessary, citing the Rule 15c3-1 prohibition on broker-dealers
effecting securities transactions if their net capital is below certain minimums and noting
that a broker-dealer that was insolvent would “by definition” be below those
minimums.399 In response to this comment, the Commission notes that the purpose of the
amendment is to address cases where a broker-dealer is subject to an insolvency event but
takes the position that it is in compliance with the net capital rule. While such instances
may be rare, an insolvent broker-dealer could seek the protection of the bankruptcy laws
but continue to effect transactions with the public, potentially jeopardizing customers and
other creditors of the broker-dealer, including counterparties.
Another commenter requested that the Commission modify the definition of
insolvent to carve out market-wide disruptions that prevent the computation of net capital
but are unrelated to the solvency of the broker-dealer. 400 In response to this suggestion,
the Commission notes that if appropriate and necessary, such an event can be addressed
through the Commission’s exemptive authority, rather than by a specific exception in the
rule.

One commenter, while supporting the amendment, objected to the incorporation
of the definition of insolvent from section 101 of the Bankruptcy Code. 401 This
commenter argued a bankruptcy-based standard for insolvency was appropriate for a
notice requirement but that the proper standard for determining whether a broker-dealer
should be prohibited from continuing to conduct a securities business is its amount of net
capital. As noted above, allowing an insolvent broker-dealer to continue conducting a
securities business during the period of its insolvency, notwithstanding its net capital
position, could jeopardize customers and other market participants because a brokerdealer that has made an admission of insolvency, or is otherwise deemed insolvent or
entitled to protection from creditors, does not possess the financial resources necessary to
operate a securities business. 402 Continuing to operate in such circumstances poses a
significant credit risk to counterparties and to the clearance and settlement system, and, in
the event the firm subsequently is placed in a liquidation proceeding under SIPA, may
impair the ability of the SIPA trustee to make customers of the broker-dealer whole and
satisfy claims of other creditors out of the assets of the general estate. 403
In addition, this commenter also was concerned that under the proposed
amendment a firm would be prevented from effecting hedging or liquidating transactions
intended to reduce the risk the firm poses to the financial markets and its customers. The
commenter noted that such limitations also would be at odds with section 5(a)(2) of
SIPA, which contemplates that a broker-dealer that is in, or approaching, financial
difficulty may undertake to liquidate or reduce its business either voluntarily or pursuant

to the direction of an SRO. 404 The final rule amendment is not intended to affect in any a
broker-dealer’s ability to act under section 5(a)(2) of SIPA. 405
In addition, the Commission is amending the final rule to incorporate within the
term insolvency the circumstance in which a broker-dealer is unable to make such
computations as may be necessary to establish compliance with Rule 15c3-3. 406 In the
proposing release, the Commission stated that the “proposed definition of ‘insolvent’ is
intended to be broad enough to encompass any type of insolvency proceeding or
condition of insolvency,” 407 and noted that the proposed definition incorporates concepts
of insolvency from the U.S. Bankruptcy Code and SIPA. 408 Consequently, consistent
with the discussion in the proposing release, the modification in the final rule will more
closely align the definition of insolvent under paragraph (c)(16) of Rule 15c3-1 with the
grounds for the commencement of a proceeding under SIPA, 409 which includes the
circumstance that a broker-dealer is unable to make computations necessary to establish
compliance with the financial responsibility or hypothecation rules. 410 Rule 3a40-1
defines the term financial responsibility rules to include, among others, any rule adopted
404

See SIFMA 2 Letter; SIPC Letter. See also 15 U.S.C. 78eee(a)(5).

405

See15 U.S.C. 78eee(a)(5). Further, the amendment is not intended to affect in any way a
SIPA trustee’s ability to liquidate a broker-dealer. Effectively, a SIPA trustee steps into
the shoes of the debtor broker-dealer in order to liquidate the broker-dealer and protect its
customers’ interests.

406

The final rule adds the phrase “or with § 240.15c3-3” to follow the phrase “[i]s unable to
make such computations as may be necessary to establish compliance with this section.”
See paragraph (c)(16)(iv) of Rule 15c3-1. See also generally, SIPC Letter (favoring an
amendment requiring broker-dealers to cease doing business if insolvent as defined under
proposed Rule 15c3-l(c)(16) and noting that the circumstances under which the broker
would be required to cease doing business are consistent with the circumstances under
which SIPC may seek to place a firm in liquidation).

116

by the Commission pursuant to section 15(c)(3) of the Exchange Act – Rules 15c3-1 and
15c3-3 were adopted under section 15(c)(3). As a financial responsibility rule, the
inability of a broker-dealer to make a computation necessary to establish compliance with
Rule 15c3-3 constitutes a basis for commencing a SIPA proceeding. Consequently, this
modification to the proposed definition of insolvency under paragraph (c)(16) of Rule
15c3-1 will more closely align the definition with SIPA. 411
The Commission also is adopting an amendment to the first sentence of paragraph
(b)(1) of Rule 17a-11 to require that a broker-dealer meeting the definition of insolvent
must provide immediate notice to the Commission, the firm’s DEA and, if applicable, the
CFTC. One commenter specifically favored this amendment. 412 This notice will assist
regulators in taking steps to protect the insolvent firm’s customers, including, if
appropriate, notifying SIPC of the need to commence a SIPA proceeding. The
Commission is adopting the amendment to paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-11, with one
technical modification. 413

Amendment to Rule Governing Orders Restricting
Withdrawal of Capital from a Broker-Dealer

Paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-1, which places certain conditions on a broker-dealer
when withdrawing capital, 414 also allows the Commission to issue an order temporarily
restricting a broker-dealer from withdrawing capital or making loans or advances to
411

The Commission also has made three technical modifications to the text of the insolvency
definition. In response to a comment, the phrase “broker-dealer” was replaced with the
phrase “broker or dealer” to be consistent with the use of the phrase in Rule 15c3-1. In
addition, the phrase “for purposes of this section” was moved to the beginning of
paragraph (c)(16) in order to clarify that the term insolvency is defined for purposes of
Rule 15c3-1 in its entirety. Finally, the final rule does not include the phrase “whether
commenced voluntarily or involuntarily” because the phrase would be redundant.

The Commission is deleting the phrase “paragraph (c)(16) of” and inserting “(c)(16)”

stockholders, insiders, and affiliates under certain circumstances. 415 The rule, however,
limits such orders to withdrawals, advances, or loans that, when aggregated with all other
withdrawals, advances, or loans on a net basis during a 30 calendar day period, exceed 30
percent of the firm’s excess net capital. 416 When the Commission adopted this paragraph
of Rule 15c3-1 more than 20 years ago, the Commission stated that it intended this
section to be applied only where the continued viability of a broker-dealer appeared to be
at stake. 417 In the ensuing years, the Commission has utilized this provision only one
time. 418 The Commission has determined that the requirement is difficult to enforce, as it
generally would not be clear when the 30% threshold had been reached, due to the
inherent unreliability of a troubled broker-dealer’s books and records. Consequently, the
Commission proposed, and is adopting, a change to delete this provision and instead to
allow the Commission to restrict all withdrawals, advances, and loans so long as the other
conditions under the rule (all of which remain unchanged) are met. 419
The Commission received three comment letters addressing this proposal. 420 One
commenter supported the deletion of the 30% threshold, but believed its removal
reflected the Commission’s desire to regulate large firms with complex capitalization

without considering the needs of smaller firms. 421 This commenter recommended the
Commission set forth all conditions required for a firm to withdraw, repay, or redeem any
amount that affects its overall capitalization. 422 Specifically, the commenter suggested
the following non-exclusive list of conditions for consideration: (1) “[r]egulatory
minimum capital requirement related to all lines of business”; (2) “[e]xcess mandated by
that firms’ accruals for that period”; (3) “[e]xcess mandated by the firms’ upcoming onetime non-recurring costs within that quarter”; (4) “[e]xcess mandated by operating costs
expected[,] but not related to accruals for that period”; (5) [c]osts related to increased
personnel coverage or recruitment within that quarter”; and (6) “[d]etermination of the
Board of the firm that there is no reasonable expectation at the time of its approval of the
capital withdrawal, repayment or redemption, that the firm would be required to, or
advisable to, increase its net capital excess.”
The second commenter recommended several modifications to the amendment,
including: (1) clarifying that in addition to ordering complete restrictions on withdrawals,
advances, and loans, the Commission may also issue orders imposing partial or
conditional restrictions; (2) explicitly permitting certain types of withdrawals, advances,
or loans, such as those in paragraphs (e)(4)(ii) and (iii) of Rule 15c3-1 (e.g., required tax
payments or payments to partners for reasonable compensation) even after the issuance of
a temporary restrictive order; and (3) clarifying that the provision in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)
of the rule allowing a broker-dealer to request and receive a hearing on an order

421

See NIBA 2 Letter. As noted above, the 30% threshold provision only applied in
emergency situations and has only been used once before. As such, its deletion should
only affect a limited number of broker-dealers.

422

Id.

119

temporarily restricting withdrawals also applies to orders temporarily restricting advances
and loans (in addition to withdrawals). 423
Finally, the third commenter noted that the proposed amendment would eliminate
the 30% requirement limit and allow the Commission to restrict all withdrawals,
advances, and loans under specific circumstances. 424 The commenter believes this action
will impose an additional compliance burden on broker-dealers and will significantly
limit the flexibility of broker-dealers in the event of a liquidity crisis. 425
In response to these comments, the Commission notes that the 30% threshold
pertains only to paragraph (e)(3)(i) of Rule 15c3-1, which relates to the Commission’s
authority to temporarily restrict withdrawals of net capital. The Commission cannot
impose these restrictions without concluding under subparagraph (e)(3)(i) that “such
withdrawal, advance or loan may be detrimental to the financial integrity of the broker or
dealer, or may unduly jeopardize the broker or dealer’s ability to repay its customer
claims or other liabilities which may cause a significant impact on the markets or expose
the customers or creditors of the broker or dealer to loss without taking into account the
application of the Securities Investor Protection Act of 1970.” 426 While paragraph
(e)(3)(i) of Rule 15c3-1 would apply to all broker-dealers, the conditions under which the
Commission may exercise its authority under the rule apply only to circumstances where

426

120

the continued viability of the broker-dealer appears to be at stake. 427 As noted above, the
Commission has only utilized this provision once. 428
The Commission, however, agrees with the importance of maintaining flexibility
in the context of ordering restrictions on withdrawals, advances, and loans. Therefore,
the Commission is modifying the amendment, as adopted, to add language to paragraph
(e)(3)(i) to state (following the phrase “employee or affiliate”) that such orders will be
issued, “under such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or consistent with the protection of investors . . . .” 429
With respect to the suggestion that the Commission explicitly permit certain types of
withdrawals, advances, or loans even after the issuance of a temporary order, the
Commission does not believe that it would be appropriate to permit – by codifying in the
rule – a broker-dealer to take the actions described if the Commission has issued an order
placing temporary restrictions on a broker-dealer’s ability to withdraw net capital under
paragraph (e)(3) of the rule. The order would be intended to protect the customers and
creditors of the broker-dealer, and permitting the actions by rule could undermine those
protections. Moreover, there is no need to explicitly permit certain types of withdrawals,
advances or loans because if there were circumstances that merited the broker-dealer
making such payments, the Commission order could be fashioned as appropriate to
permit those payments.
With respect to the suggestion that the Commission clarify in paragraph (e)(3)(ii)
of Rule 15c3-1 that a broker-dealer may request and receive a hearing on orders

Amendment to Appendix A of Rule 15c3-1

The Commission is adopting an amendment to Appendix A of Rule 15c3-1,
which permits broker-dealers to employ theoretical option pricing models to calculate
haircuts for listed options and related positions that hedge those options. 431 The
amendment makes permanent a temporary amendment the Commission originally
adopted in 1997. 432 The temporary amendment expired on September 1, 1997, unless it
was otherwise extended by the Commission. 433 The Commission staff subsequently

Letter from Michael Macchiaroli, Associate Director, Division of Market Regulation,
Commission, to Richard Lewandowski, Vice President, Regulatory Division, The
Chicago Board Options Exchange, Inc. (Jan. 13, 2000) (stating that the Division of
Market Regulation “will not recommend . . . enforcement action if non-clearing option
specialists and market-makers continue to rely on subparagraph (b)(1)(iv) of Appendix A
to Rule 15c3-1 under the Exchange Act until such time as the Commission has
determined whether it should be extended”). The letter did not grant any other relief.

The temporary amendment decreased the range of pricing inputs to the approved
option pricing models, which effectively reduced the haircuts applied by the carrying
firm with respect to non-clearing option specialist and market maker accounts. 435 The
temporary amendment, which applied only to these types of accounts, was limited to
major market foreign currencies and diversified indexes. Even during periods of
substantial volatility, there have been no significant increases in the number of deficits in
non-clearing option specialist and market-maker accounts, nor did the lower capital
charges under paragraph (b)(1)(iv) result in excessive leverage. Consequently, this
amendment appropriately aligns the net capital requirements of affected firms with the
risks Rule 15c3-1 seeks to mitigate. The Commission received one comment letter
regarding this aspect of the proposing release. The commenter concurred with the
Commission’s conclusions as to the effect of the temporary amendment and supported
the proposal to make it permanent. 436 Accordingly, the Commission is amending
paragraph (b)(1)(iv) of Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1, as proposed, to make the temporary
amendment permanent. 437

Clarification

435

See Net Capital Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 38248 (Feb. 6, 1997), 62 FR 6474 (Feb.
12, 1997). Under Appendix A to Rule 15c3-1, a broker-dealer calculating net capital
charges for its options portfolios shocks the products in each portfolio (grouped by
underlying instrument) at ten equidistant points along a potential market move range.
The market move ranges for major market foreign currencies, high-capitalization
diversified indexes, and non-high-capitalization diversified indexes are, respectively: +(-)
6%, +(-) 10% and +(-) 15%. The temporary rule lowered these market move ranges to
respectively: +(-) 4½%, + 6% (-) 8% and +(-) 10% in terms of calculating haircuts for
positions of non-clearing options specialists and market makers. Id.

As a result, the Commission also is redesignating paragraphs (b)(1)(iv)(A),
(b)(1)(iv)(A)(1), (b)(1)(iv)(A)(2), and (b)(1)(iv)(A)(3) as paragraphs (b)(1)(iv),
(b)(1)(iv)(A), (b)(1)(iv)(B), and (b)(1)(iv)(C), respectively.

123

The Commission is adopting an amendment to paragraph (c)(2)(vi)(D)(1) of Rule
15c3-1 to clarify that a money market fund, for the purposes of paragraph
(c)(2)(vi)(D)(1), is a fund described in Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
1940 (“Rule 2a-7”). 438 The Commission did not receive any comments on this proposal
and is adopting it, as proposed.
b.

Proposed Haircut Reduction from 2% to 1%

The Commission proposed an amendment to reduce the “haircut” that brokerdealers apply under Rule 15c3-1 for money market funds. 439 In 1982, the Commission
adopted a 2% haircut requirement for redeemable securities of money market funds. 440
In 1991, the Commission adopted certain amendments to Rule 2a-7 that strengthened the
risk-limiting investment restrictions for money market funds. 441 Based on the
enhancements to Rule 2a-7, the Commission proposed to amend paragraph
(c)(2)(vi)(D)(1) of Rule 15c3-1 to reduce the haircut on such funds from 2% to 1% in
order to better align the net capital charge with the risk associated with holding shares of
a money market fund. 442 In addition to the general request for comments in the
proposing release, the Commission also specifically requested comments regarding
whether the haircut for certain types of money market funds should be reduced to 0% as
suggested in a petition for rulemaking submitted to the Commission.443

The Commission received a total of 14 responses from 12 different commenters
regarding this proposed amendment. All of the commenters supported a reduction in the
haircut for money market funds and urged that the haircut be reduced below the proposed
1%, with the majority proposing a haircut of 0% for “top-rated” money market funds
(i.e., those with the highest ratings). 444 Commenters cited the safety record of money
market funds, in particular AAA-rated money market funds, in support of imposing lower
haircuts. 445 Several commenters argued that top-rated money market funds were more
liquid and posed less credit and interest rate risk than other instruments and suggested
haircuts of 1/8 of 1% or even 0%. 446 One commenter argued that since broker-dealers
(like investors) view money market funds as cash equivalents, they would view a 1%
haircut as a significant cost and would therefore avoid using money market funds. 447
Two commenters suggested that if the Commission determined it necessary to impose a
haircut on some Rule 2a-7 money market funds, it should implement a bifurcated scheme
under which money market funds that qualify for deposit into a broker-dealer’s reserve
account under Rule 15c3-3 would be subject to a 0% haircut, 448 with one arguing that
such qualifying money market funds should in any case receive a haircut no greater than
1/8 of 1%. 449 Another commenter suggested that the proposed amendments to reduce the

haircut for money market funds should be deferred until the results of the Commission’s
money market reforms are known. 450 Another commenter suggested a haircut of 5/8 of
1%, based on a combination of the 1/8 of 1% haircut applied to highly rated shorter-term
(at least 30 but less than 91 days to maturity) commercial paper and municipal securities
and an additional charge of 1/2 of 1% to account for any minimal risk associated with the
nature or operation of mutual funds. 451 Finally, one commenter supported a 0% haircut
for applied to money market funds that: (1) do not hold investments in their affiliates or
holding companies; and (2) are not affiliated with the bank in which the broker-dealer
holds its cash reserves and operating funds. 452
As discussed above in section II.E.6.ii. of this release, the Commission recently
proposed substantial amendments to its money market fund rules. 453 In light of these
proposed amendments, 454 the Commission is deferring consideration of a reduction of the
haircut for money market funds in Rule 15c3-1 at this time. Therefore, the haircut that
broker-dealers apply for money market funds will remain at 2% under paragraph
(c)(2)(vi)(D)(1) of Rule 15c3-1. Deferring action will allow the Commission to assess
the potential impact of any money market fund reforms it may adopt and whether any
such impact would have consequences for the net liquid asset standard of Rule 15c3-1.

Aggregate Debit Items Charge

when computing their reserve requirements under Rule 15c3-3. 455 Under paragraph
(a)(1)(ii)(A) of Rule 15c3-1, a broker-dealer using the “alternative standard” 456 to
compute its minimum net capital requirement must reduce aggregate debit items by 3%
when computing its customer reserve requirement under Rule 15c3-3. Conversely, Note
E(3) to the customer reserve formula (Rule 15c3-3a) requires a broker-dealer using the
“basic method” of computing net capital under Rule 15c3-1 to reduce by 1% the total
debits in Item 10 of the formula (i.e., debit balances in customer cash and margin
accounts). 457 Both of these provisions serve to increase the amount of funds a brokerdealer must deposit into its customer reserve account; however, the deduction applicable
to alternative standard firms can result in an even larger reserve deposit requirement.
The Commission received four comment letters regarding these amendments and
all were supportive. 458 However, recent market turmoil has highlighted the importance of
maintaining adequate amounts of funds and qualified securities in the customer reserve
account under Rule 15c3-3 to protect customers. Consequently, it would be imprudent to
lower the debit reduction requirement for broker-dealers using the alternative standard at
this time (especially given the fact that this standard is primarily used by firms with a
substantial customer business). Therefore, the Commission has determined to defer
consideration of action on this amendment at this time.
F.

Technical Amendments

455

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12867.

456

Under the “alternative standard,” a broker-dealer’s minimum net capital requirement is
equal to 2% of the firm’s aggregate debit items. 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(1)(ii).

457

Under the “basic method,” a broker-dealer cannot permit its aggregate indebtedness
(generally total money liabilities) to exceed 1500% of its net capital. 17 CFR 15c31(a)(1)(i).

458

See Curian Clearing Letter; SIFMA 2 Letter; Deutsche Bank Securities Letter;
Citigroup Letter.

127

The Commission proposed a number of technical amendments to these rules,
including changes to the definitions of fully paid securities, margin securities, and bank
in Rule 15c3-3. 459 These proposed technical amendments were not designed to
substantively change the meanings of these defined terms but, rather, to amend out-ofdate citations and remove text that the Commission believed to be superfluous or
redundant.
Two commenters 460 opposed the proposed technical amendments to the Rule
15c3-3 definition of fully paid securities. As proposed, the definition of fully paid
securities would have included “all securities carried for the account of a customer unless
such securities are purchased in a transaction for which the customer has not made full
payment.” 461 The commenters contend that the amendments to the definition of fully
paid securities would significantly expand the universe of fully paid securities because
these securities generally are carried in a cash account, and under the proposed definition
any security, in any account, including a margin account, could be considered a fully paid
security (and subject to possession and control requirements) if it has been paid for in
full. As such, the commenter noted that the term fully paid securities, as proposed, would
require broker-dealers to determine whether securities in a margin account are fully paid
(in which case they could not be hypothecated even if they are not excess margin
securities). As a result, the commenter suggested that this definition should be limited to
include only securities in a cash account that have been paid for in full. After careful
consideration, and in response to the comment, the Commission has modified the text of
paragraph (a)(3) to Rule 15c3-3 to more closely follow the original definition, while still
459

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(3), (4), and (7), respectively.

128

adopting the updated references and terminology to reflect changes made to Regulation T
since 1972. As adopted, the term fully paid securities includes “all securities carried for
the account of a customer in a cash account as defined in Regulation T (12 CFR 220.1 et
seq.), as well as securities carried for the account of a customer in a margin account or
any special account under Regulation T that have no loan value for margin purposes, and
all margin equity securities in such account if they are fully paid . . . .” 462 The definition
also states that, “the term “fully paid securities” does not apply to any securities
purchased in transactions for which the customer has not made full payment.”
The Commission did not receive any comments on the proposed amendments to
the definition of margin securities under paragraph (a)(4) of Rule 15c3-3. The
Commission is adopting this definition as proposed. In addition, the Commission did not
receive any comments to the proposed amendments to the definition of bank under
paragraph (a)(7) of Rule 15c3-3. The Commission, however, has modified the language
in this paragraph to make the paragraph gender neutral by replacing the phrase “who
maintains his principal place of business” with the phrase “that maintains its principal
place of business.”
The Commission also has amended other provisions of Rule 15c3-3 to make the
rule gender neutral. Finally, the Commission has replaced the word “shall” throughout
the rule, as amended, with clearer words, such as “will” or “must.” This change will not
change either the nature or substance of the affected rule provisions.
III.

RESPONSES TO SPECIFIC REQUESTS FOR COMMENT

462

See paragraph (a)(3) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted.

129

In the proposing release, the Commission requested comment on certain specific
matters, in addition to the proposed rule amendments. 463 These matters included: (1) a
proposal to reduce the Rule 17a-11 notice requirement for broker-dealers that carry over
$10 billion in debits; (2) whether to harmonize the net capital deductions required under
paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1 for securities lending and borrowing transactions
with the deductions required under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(F) for securities repo
transactions; and (3) solicitation of comment on how third-party liens against customer
fully paid securities carried by a broker-dealer should be treated under the financial
responsibility rules, including Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-3 and Rule 17a-4.
The Commission received seven comment letters that addressed the solicitation of
comments for these matters. 464 With respect to the early warning level proposal, one
commenter proposed modifying the Commission’s early warning levels for very large
“alternative standard” firms with more than $10 billion in debits.465 The commenter
recommended this approach because of the increase in debit items at large broker-dealers
and the increased focus on effective risk management practices. 466 Another comment
supported the amendment, suggesting that the notification could serve as an early
warning if a firm is approaching insolvency. 467
In addition, the Commission received three comments with respect to
harmonizing the net capital deductions required under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule
15c3-1 for securities lending and borrowing transactions with the deductions required

under paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(F) for securities repo transactions. 468 These commenters
stated that the Commission should consider the potential disruption to the marketplace
that may arise in connection with any effort to harmonize capital charges. 469
The Commission also received seven comments in response to the solicitation of
comment on how third-party liens against customer fully paid securities carried by a
broker-dealer should be treated under the financial responsibility rules, including Rule
15c3-3, Rule 17a-3 and Rule 17a-4. 470 Two commenters stated that the Commission
should not require that a broker-dealer include third party liens as a credit in the reserve
formula and stated that this is an area in which it would be productive to have a detailed
discussion between Commission staff and the industry before any amendments are
proposed. 471 Another commenter stated that each of the suggested approaches in the
proposing release imposes burdens and requirements on broker-dealers that do not serve
to address the concerns noted by the Commission. 472 Two commenters stated that the
most effective way to avoid confusion regarding third party liens in a SIPC liquidation
would be to segregate securities subject to a lien to a separate pledge account in the name
of the pledgee. 473 Finally, one commenter argued that requiring broker-dealers to include
the amount of liens as a credit item in the reserve formula was not necessary to achieve
customer protection and would impose significant costs and burdens on the brokerdealers. 474

IV.

PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Certain provisions of the amendments contain “collection of information”

requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 475
The Commission published a notice requesting comment on the collection of information
requirements in the proposing release 476 and submitted the amendments to the Office of
Management and Budget (“OMB”) for review in accordance with the PRA. 477 An
agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a
collection of information unless it displays a currently valid control number. The
amended rules – Rule 15c3-1, Rule 15c3-3, Rule 17a-3, Rule 17a-4 and Rule 17a-11 –
contain currently approved collections of information under, respectively, OMB control
numbers 3235-0200, 3235-0078, 3235-0033, 3235-0279 and 3235-0085.
In response to comments received regarding the proposed amendments in the
proposing release, the Commission has modified the language in the final rules being
adopted, as discussed above. These comments and their impact on PRA estimates are
discussed below. In addition, the initial burden estimates in the proposing release have
been adjusted, 478 as discussed below, to reflect updated information used to make the
current estimates, including updated FOCUS Report data. 479

Finally, one commenter specifically stated that the estimates the Commission
provided utilized only that number of broker-dealers in its estimates that the Commission
“justifiably considers to be affected by the proposals.” 480 The commenter, however,
believes that most, if not all, broker-dealers will spend over 90 hours each analyzing the
effects of the rules as implemented, will spend many more than 90 hours each in
implementing procedures and modifying their written supervisory procedures to comply
with the new rules, will spend in excess of 240 hours each in the monitoring of such
rules, and will spend in excess of $15,000 each for outside counsel and auditor opinions
or work product. 481 This commenter did not provide additional detail about the basis for
its view that the Commission’s estimates were too low. The Commission agrees with the
commenter that broker-dealers directly affected by the rule amendments may be required
to implement procedures or modify their written supervisory procedures in order to
comply with the rule amendments. In cases where the rule amendments are requiring a
broker-dealer to implement or document certain policies and procedures, these hour
burdens are already included in the final hour estimates discussed below. 482 In addition,
the Commission acknowledges that a broker-dealer may need to review its operations to
determine whether or not it has any obligations under the rule amendments. Even if a
broker-dealer is not directly affected by the rule amendments, such a review may result in
an indirect effect on its operations. These indirect effects or costs, however, are more
appropriately addressed in the Economic Analysis in section V. of this release because

reports were from 2004 year end data. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility
Rules, 72 FR at 12875.

A.

Summary of the Collection of Information Requirements

The rule amendments contain recordkeeping and disclosure requirements that are
subject to the PRA. In summary, the amendments may require a broker-dealer, under
certain circumstances, to: (1) disclose the principals and obtain certain agreements from
the principals in a securities lending transaction where it performs settlement services if it
is to be considered an agent (as opposed to a principal) for the purposes of the net capital
rule; 483 (2) obtain permission in writing from its DEA to withdraw capital within one year
of contribution; 484 (3) enter into a subordination agreement with an account holder in
order to exclude such account holder from the definition of PAB account; 485 (4) provide
written notice to PAB account holders that their securities may be used in the ordinary
course of its securities business; 486 (5) perform a PAB reserve computation; 487 (6) obtain
written notification from each bank with which it maintains a PAB reserve account that
the bank was informed that all cash and/or qualified securities being held by the bank are
being held for the exclusive benefit of brokers and dealers; 488 (7) enter into a written
contract with a bank with which it maintains its PAB reserve accounts providing that the
cash and/or qualified securities shall at no time be used directly or indirectly as security

through the bank; 489 (8) develop adequate procedures to ensure a customer for whom a
free credit balance is carried is sent a written statement regarding the customer’s free
credit balances, including information regarding the amount due to the customer and that
the funds are payable on demand, prior to using funds arising from free credit balances in
the broker-dealer’s operations; 490 (9) obtain the written affirmative consent of a new
customer before including the customer’s free credit balances in a Sweep Program, as
well as provide certain disclosures and notices to all customers with regard to the brokerdealer’s Sweep Program; 491 (10) make and maintain records documenting its credit,
market, and liquidity risk management controls to assist the broker-dealer in analyzing
the risks associated with its business activities; 492 (11) provide notice to the Commission
and other regulatory authorities if the broker-dealer becomes insolvent; 493 and (12)
provide notice to the Commission and other regulatory authorities if the broker-dealer’s
securities borrowed and loaned or securities repurchase/reverse repurchase activity
reaches a certain threshold or, alternatively, report monthly its securities borrowed and
loan or securities repurchase/reverse repurchase activity to its DEA in a form acceptable
to its DEA. 494

The Commission, its staff, and SROs will use the information collected under the
amendments to Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 15c3-3 to determine whether the broker-dealer is in
compliance with each rule and to help fulfill their oversight responsibilities. The
collections of information would also help to ensure that broker-dealers are meeting their
obligations under the rule amendments and have any required policies and procedures in
place.
In particular, the record with respect to acting as agent in a securities loan
transaction will assist examiners in verifying that the broker-dealer is properly accounting
for securities loan deficits under Rule 15c3-1. The records with respect to obtaining
DEA approval prior to withdrawing capital within one year of contribution under Rule
15c3-1 will assist examiners in determining if a broker-dealer is computing its net capital
accurately with regard to the proper classification of its capital contributions, and will
help to ensure the DEA only approves capital withdrawals which are appropriate in light
of the firm’s current financial condition at the time of the requested withdrawal. The
amendments to Rule 15c3-1 also will facilitate the monitoring of the financial condition
of broker-dealers by the Commission and its staff, as well as by SROs.
The records with respect to the PAB accounts will assist examiners in verifying
that: (1) a carrying broker-dealer has properly excluded certain accounts from being
treated as PAB accounts by entering into subordination agreements with particular
account holders; (2) a carrying broker-dealer sent written notices to PAB accountholders
to use their PAB securities; (3) the broker-dealer performed the PAB reserve
computation; and (4) the bank holding the PAB reserve account agreed to do so free of
lien by entering into a written contract with the broker-dealer.
The records with respect to customer’s free credit balances will assist examiners
in verifying that: (1) a carrying broker-dealer has obtained the written affirmative consent

136

of a new customer before including a customer’s free credit balances in a Sweep
Program; (2) a carrying broker-dealer has provided the required disclosures and notices to
all customers with regard to the broker-dealer’s Sweep Program; and (3) the brokerdealer has maintained adequate procedures with regard to the use of a customer’s free
credit balances prior to using such customer’s free credit balances in its operations. The
amendments to Rule 15c3-3 will facilitate the process by which the Commission, its staff,
and SROs monitor how broker-dealers are fulfilling the customer protection requirements
of the rule. The written affirmative consent, disclosures and notices required to be
provided to customers also will alert customers to the alternatives available to them with
respect to their free credit balances.
The Commission, its staff, and SROs will use the information collected under the
amendments to Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 to determine whether the broker-dealer is adhering
to its documented credit, market, and liquidity risk management controls, as well as to
evaluate the effectiveness of these controls.
The Commission, its staff, and SROs will use the information collected under the
amendments to Rule 17a-11 to identify a broker-dealer experiencing financial difficulty.
This information will assist the Commission and other regulators in promptly taking
appropriate steps to protect customers, creditors, and counterparties. In particular, a
notice of insolvency will assist regulators in responding more quickly to protect
customers of a failing institution. The notices and reports with respect to securities
lending and repos will assist regulators in identifying broker-dealers that are active in
these transactions or suddenly take on large positions and thereby assist in monitoring
systemic risk.

Respondents

137

The final estimates of respondents below have been updated to reflect more recent
information. 495 The amendment to Rule 15c3-1 requiring a broker-dealer to make
disclosures to, and obtain certain agreements from, securities lending principals will
apply only to those firms that participate in the settlement of securities lending
transactions as agents. The Commission estimates that approximately 122 broker-dealers
will be affected by this requirement. 496 This estimate has been updated from the estimate
of 170 broker-dealers in the proposing release. 497 No comments were received on this
estimate.
The amendment to Rule 15c3-1 with respect to a broker-dealer obtaining
permission in writing from its DEA prior to withdrawing capital within one year of
contribution under Rule 15c3-1 will apply to any broker-dealer who wishes to withdraw
such capital. Because most broker-dealers already comply with existing interpretations
regarding the treatment of temporary capital contributions and similar SRO requirements,
or are familiar with such interpretations and requirements, this part of the amendment to
Rule 15c3-1 regarding temporary capital contributions likely will impact only a small
number of the approximately 4,709 broker-dealers registered with the Commission, as of
December 31, 2011 (based on FOCUS Report data). 498 Therefore, the Commission

495

The final estimates of respondents derived from FOCUS Reports filed by broker-dealers
pursuant to Section 17 of the Exchange Act and Rule 17a-5 have been updated in this
final release to reflect more recently available information, including FOCUS Report data
as of December 31, 2011. The estimates of respondents in the proposing release derived
from FOCUS reports were from 2004 year end data. See Amendments to Financial
Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12876.

estimates that approximately 90 broker-dealers will seek permission from their DEA in
writing to withdraw capital within one year of its contribution under the amendment. 499
The amendments to Rule 15c3-3 requiring a broker-dealer to perform a PAB
reserve computation and to obtain certain agreements and notices related to its PAB
accounts will affect only those firms that carry such accounts. Based on FOCUS Report
data, as of December 31, 2011, the Commission estimates that approximately 61 brokerdealers will carry such accounts. 500 The amendment to Rule 15c3-3 requiring a brokerdealer to obtain the affirmative consent of a new customer before changing the terms
under which the customer’s free credit balances are maintained will apply only to firms
that carry free credit balances for customers. Based on FOCUS Report data, as of
December 31, 2011, the Commission estimates that approximately 189 broker-dealers
carry free credit balances. 501
The Commission estimates that the amendment to Rule 15c3-3 permitting a
broker-dealer to exclude certain accounts from being treated as PAB accounts under Rule
15c3-3 by entering into subordination agreements with certain account holders will apply
to all 61 broker-dealers that will carry such accounts. The Commission estimates that

499

The Commission received 900 broker-dealer capital withdrawal notices under paragraph
(e) of Rule 15c3-1 in 2012. Because this amendment is consistent with prior
Commission and staff positions that capital is not temporary, as well as current SRO
requirements, it is likely that only a small number of these notices are capital withdrawals
made within one year of contribution, and therefore, based on staff experience with the
application of Rule 15c3-1, the Commission estimates that approximately 90 brokerdealers (10% of 900) will seek permission from their DEA in writing to withdraw capital
under the amendment. See Net Capital Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 28927 (Feb. 28,
1991); Temporary Capital Letter; and FINRA Rule 4110.

these 61 broker-dealers each will enter into an average of 11 subordination
agreements. 502
The amendments to Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 requiring a broker-dealer to make and
maintain records documenting the credit, market and liquidity risk management control
for analyzing and managing risks will apply only to firms that have more than $1,000,000
in aggregate credit items, or $20,000,000 in capital. Thus, its impact will be limited to
larger broker-dealers. Accordingly, the number of respondents will equal the number of
broker-dealers meeting the thresholds set forth in the amendment. The Commission
estimates that approximately 490 broker-dealers will meet at least one of these
thresholds. 503
One amendment to Rule 17a-11 will require a broker-dealer to provide the
Commission with notice if it becomes subject to certain insolvency events. The
Commission estimates that approximately two broker-dealers will become subject to one
of these events in a given year. 504 Another amendment to Rule 17a-11 will require a

affiliates per broker-dealer.”). Carrying firms likely will enter into subordination
agreements with affiliates, including foreign banks or foreign broker-dealers affiliated
with the carrying broker-dealer to exclude such accounts from the rule. See SIFMA 2
Letter.

broker-dealer to provide notice to the Commission if its securities borrowed or loaned, or
its securities repurchase or reverse repurchase activity reaches a certain threshold or,
alternatively, provide monthly reports to its DEA about such activities. This amendment
will only affect a limited number of firms per year. The Commission estimates that
approximately one broker-dealer 505 will provide notice and six broker-dealers 506 will opt
to send the monthly reports in a given year.

Total Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burden
1.

Securities Lending Agreements and Disclosures

The amendments to paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1 will require a brokerdealer to make disclosures to, and obtain certain agreements from, securities lending
principals in situations where the firm participates in the settlement of a securities lending
transaction but wants to be deemed an agent for purposes of Rule 15c3-1. 507 The
Commission has adopted the final rule substantially as proposed, and consequently, there
were no changes to the final rule amendments that would affect the Commission’s PRA
505

This estimate is derived from information filed by broker-dealers in their FOCUS
Reports. This estimate has been updated from the proposing release estimate of 11. See
Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12876. No comments were
received on this estimate. Based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, there
were seven broker-dealers whose securities borrowed or securities loaned exceeded 80%
of 25 times their tentative net capital, and there were six broker-dealers whose securities
borrowed or securities loaned exceeded 25 times their tentative net capital. Therefore,
the Commission assumes for purposes of the PRA that six broker-dealers would chose to
file monthly reports in lieu of the notice requirements, and that one would file a notice.

506

This estimate is derived from information filed by broker-dealers in their FOCUS
Reports. Based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, there were six brokerdealers whose securities borrowed or securities loaned exceeded 25 times their tentative
net capital. These firms likely will opt to file the monthly report under the proposed
amendments to Rule 17a-11. This estimate has been updated from our proposing release
estimate of 21 broker-dealers. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR
at 12876. No comments were received on this estimate. The estimated number of firms
filing notices and monthly reports has decreased largely due to an overall decrease in the
number of broker-dealers. See also id. at 12870 (discussing rationale for 2,500%
threshold).

estimates. In addition, the Commission did not receive any comments on the estimates in
the proposing release, 508 and is therefore is retaining the amendment’s PRA hour burden
estimates without revision. The Commission, however, is updating the number of
respondents to reflect more recently-available data from broker-dealer FOCUS Reports.
As discussed above in section II.C. of this release, the Commission, in recognition
of standard stock loan agreements, designed the amendment to accommodate the
continued use of these industry model agreements by incorporating their use into the
rule’s requirements. For the purpose of establishing a broker-dealer’s status as agent or
lender, these agreements may be sufficiently detailed to satisfy the new requirements.
Thus, the standard agreement used by the vast majority of broker-dealers may contain the
representations and disclosures required by the amendment. Nevertheless, based on staff
experience with securities lending agreements and disclosure and the application of Rule
15c3-1, the Commission continues to believe that a small percentage of broker-dealers
may need to modify their standard agreements. In the proposing release, the Commission
estimated that 5% 509 of broker-dealers may need to modify their standard agreements.
No comments were received on this estimate and the Commission believes 5% continues
to be an appropriate estimate for the final rule amendments. Thus, the Commission
estimates that 5% of the approximately 122 firms engaged in this business, or
approximately 6 firms, will not have used the standard agreements. 510 The Commission
estimates each of these firms will spend approximately 20 hours of employee resources

the total one-time burden to broker-dealers as a result of this requirement will be
approximately 120 hours. 512
2.

DEA Permission to Withdraw Capital within One Year of
Contribution

The amendment to paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G)(2) of Rule 15c3-1 will require that a
broker-dealer treat as a liability any capital contribution that is intended to be withdrawn
within one year of its contribution. 513 The rule amendment also includes the presumption
that capital withdrawn within one year of contribution is presumed to have been intended
to be withdrawn within one year, unless the broker-dealer receives permission in writing
for the withdrawal from its DEA. This amendment likely will impose annual
recordkeeping burdens on broker-dealers making the request.
The Commission estimates that 90 broker-dealers will seek to obtain permission
from their DEA in writing to withdraw capital within one year of its contribution, and
that it will take a broker-dealer approximately one hour to prepare and submit the request
to its DEA to withdraw capital. 514 Therefore, the Commission estimates that the total
annual hour burden with respect to the rule amendment will be approximately 90
hours. 515

511

Because these firms are already engaging in stock loan and repo activities, these
functions likely will be performed by in-house employees, rather than outside counsel.

512

6 broker-dealers x 20 hours per firm = 120 hours. This is an update from the proposing
release estimate of 9 broker-dealers x 20 hours = 180 hours. Id.

3.

Written Subordination Agreements under Rule 15c3-3

As discussed above in section II.A.2. of this release, in response to comments, the
final rule amendment adopted by the Commission excludes from the definition of PAB
account in paragraph (a)(16) of Rule 15c3-3, an account that “has been subordinated to
the claims of creditors of the carrying broker or dealer.” 516 This modification to the final
rule will result in one-time burdens under the collection of information for Rule 15c33. 517
In light of comments received 518 and based on staff experience, the Commission
understands most PAB account holders that enter into a subordinated loan agreement
with a carrying broker-dealer in order to not be treated as PAB accounts under paragraph
(a)(16) likely will be affiliates of the broker-dealer. 519 The Commission estimates that
the 61 broker-dealers that carry PAB accounts will enter into an average of 11
subordination agreements as a result of the rule amendment. 520 The Commission
estimates that it will take a carrying broker-dealer approximately 20 hours to develop a
subordination agreement, based on the Commission’s prior experience with the

516

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(16).

517

The proposing release did not contain any proposals with regard to subordination
agreements.

4.

PAB Reserve Bank Account Recordkeeping Requirements

The amendments to Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a require carrying broker-dealers to:
(1) perform a separate reserve computation for PAB accounts (in addition to the reserve
computation currently required for Rule 15c3-3 customer accounts); (2) establish and
fund a separate PAB reserve account; and (3) obtain and maintain physical possession or
control of non-margin securities carried in PAB accounts unless the carrying brokerdealer has provided written notice to the PAB account holders that it will use those
securities in the ordinary course of its securities business, and has provided opportunity
for the PAB account holder to object to such use.
In the proposing release, the Commission proposed to require that the carrying
broker-dealer obtain written permission from a PAB account holder before it could use
the securities of the PAB account holder in the ordinary course of its securities business.
The Commission estimated that, based on FOCUS Report data, there were approximately
2,533 existing PAB customers, and therefore, broker-dealers would have to amend
approximately 2,533 existing PAB agreements. 523 The Commission further estimated
that, on average, a firm would spend approximately 10 hours of employee resources
amending each agreement and that 75 firms would spend 20 hours amending their

standard PAB agreement template, for a total of 26,830 hours. 524 The Commission did
not receive any comments regarding these estimates in the proposing release.
In response to comments, as discussed above, the Commission determined not to
adopt the requirement, as proposed. Instead, paragraph (b)(5) of Rule 15c3-3 requires the
carrying broker-dealer to provide PAB account holders with written notice that the
account holder’s non-margin securities may be used in the ordinary course of its
business. 525 Therefore, the Commission is revising the final one-time hour burden in
light of the change in the rule to a notice requirement, which is expected to be less
burdensome than the proposed customer consent provision while still providing
customers with necessary information. The Commission estimates, based on FOCUS
Report data, that approximately 61 broker-dealers carry PAB accounts. 526 The
Commission further estimates, based on similar collections of information and the fact
that these firms already carry PAB accounts, and on average, a firm will spend
approximately 10 hours of employee resources drafting a standard notice template, for a
total one-time burden of 610 hours. 527 In addition, based on FOCUS Report data, the
Commission estimates that there are approximately 1,551 existing PAB customers and,

524

(2,533 PAB customers x 10 hours per customer) + (75 firms x 20 hours per firm) =
26,830. Id.

525

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(b)(5).

526

This estimate is based on the number of broker-dealers carrying PAB accounts as of
December 31, 2011. This is an update from the proposing release estimate of
approximately 75 broker-dealers that carry PAB accounts. See Amendments to Financial
Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12877.

527

61 firms x 10 hours = 610 hours. See also Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release No.
68071, 77 FR at 70298 (estimating that the notice required to be sent by a security based
swap dealer to a counterparty pursuant to section 3E(f) of the Exchange Act would take
an outside counsel 10 hours to draft).

146

therefore, broker-dealers will have to send approximately 1,551 written notices. 528 The
Commission estimates, based on staff experience, that a firm will spend approximately 10
minutes per account sending out the required written notice, for a total one-time burden
of 259 hours. 529
The Commission estimates that a broker-dealer will incur postage costs sending
out the required written notice to customers. These carrying broker-dealers likely will
use the least cost method to comply with this requirement and may include this
notification with other mailings sent to PAB account holders. The Commission,
however, conservatively estimates that the postage cost of for each notification, using the
current price of first class postage, will be approximately $.46 per document sent.
Therefore, the staff estimates that the cost of sending the required written notification to
PAB account holders will be approximately $713. 530
Based on FOCUS Report data, the Commission also estimates that approximately
61 broker-dealers carry PAB accounts, and based upon differences between the PAIB
Letter and the final rule, these 61 firms would have to amend their standard PAB
agreement template. The Commission estimates a firm will spend, on average,
approximately 20 hours of employee resources on this task, for a total of 1,220 hours. 531
In light of the changes to the final rule amendments which require a broker-dealer
to send a written notice, rather than obtain a customer’s consent regarding the use of a

The number of customers also is updated from the proposing release estimate of 2,533
customers. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12877.

529

1,551 PAB account holders x 10 minutes = 15,510 minutes/60 minutes = 258.5 hours
(rounded to 259 hours). See generally, Exchange Act Release No. 68071, 77 FR at
70298 (estimating that the notice required to be sent by a security based swap dealer to a
counterparty pursuant to section 3E(f) of the Exchange Act would take 10 minutes to
send).

530

1,551 notices x $0.46 = $713.46.

531

61 firms x 20 hours = 1,220.

147

PAB account holder’s securities, the 61 broker-dealers carrying PAB accounts likely will
engage outside counsel 532 to review the required notice, 533 as well as the standard PAB
template agreement under the final rule amendments to Rule 15c3-3. As a result, the
Commission estimates that these 61 broker-dealers will likely incur $2,000 in legal
costs, 534 or $122,000 535 in aggregate initial burden to review and comment on these
materials.
The requirements to perform a PAB reserve computation and obtain agreements
and notices from banks holding PAB accounts will result in annual burdens based on the
number of broker-dealers that hold PAB accounts and the number of times per year these
broker-dealers open new PAB reserve accounts. Currently, to obtain the relief provided
in the PAIB Letter, broker-dealers are required to obtain the agreements and notices from
the banks. 536 The Commission understands that broker-dealers generally already obtain
these agreements and notices. Therefore, the Commission estimates there will be no

533

17 CFR 240.15c3-1(b)(5).

534

5 hours x $400 per hour = $2,000. The Commission estimates the review of the notice
and standard PAB template would require 5 hours of outside counsel time, which is the
same estimate used for outside counsel review in another recent release. Based on staff
experience with the PAIB Letter and the application of Rule 15c3-3, the Commission
estimates the outside counsel review related to the PAB amendments will take a
comparable amount of time. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation Requirements for
Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital
Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release 68071, 77 FR at 70297, n.904.
The Commission estimates that the outside counsel would cost $400 per hour, which is
the same estimate used by the Commission in other recent releases. See Capital, Margin,
and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major SecurityBased Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act
Release 68071, 77 FR at 70297; Further Definition of “Swap,” “Security-Based Swap,”
and “Security-Based Swap Agreement”; Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement

additional burden imposed by this requirement. 537 The Commission did not receive any
comments on this estimate from the proposing release.
The amendment requiring a PAB reserve computation will produce a one-time
burden. Based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, the Commission
estimates that approximately 61 broker-dealers will perform a PAB reserve
computation. 538 These firms already perform a reserve computation for domestic brokerdealer customers under the PAIB Letter. Nonetheless, the Commission estimates these
firms will spend, on average, approximately 30 hours of employee resources per firm
updating their systems to implement changes that will be necessitated by the amendment.
Therefore, consistent with the hour estimates in the proposing release, the Commission
estimates that the total one-time burden to broker-dealers arising from updating their
systems to comply with this requirement will be approximately 1,830 hours. 539
The amendment requiring a PAB reserve computation also will produce an annual
burden. Based on FOCUS Report data, the Commission estimates that of the 61 brokerdealers estimated to perform a PAB reserve computation, approximately 56 of the current
PAB filers will perform the PAB reserve computation on a weekly basis, two brokerdealers will perform it on a monthly basis, and three broker-dealers will perform the PAB
reserve computation on a daily basis. 540 The Commission further estimates that a broker-

537

In addition, the hour burdens for broker-dealers to open new customer reserve bank
account under Rule 15c3-3 are already included within the currently approved collection
of information for Rule 15c3-3.

538

This estimate is based on the number of broker-dealers which currently perform a PAB
computation as of December 31, 2011. This is an update from the estimate in the
proposing release of 75 broker-dealers.

539

61 broker-dealers x 30 hours per firm = 1,830 hours. This is an update from the
proposing release estimate of 75 firms x 30 hours per firm = 2,250 hours. See
Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12877.

540

These estimates are based on the number of broker-dealers performing a PAB reserve
computation monthly, weekly, and daily, as of December 31, 2011. This is an update

149

dealer will spend, on average, approximately 2.5 hours to complete the PAB reserve
computation in order to make a record of such computation under Rule 15c3-3 as a result
of the amendment. 541 Therefore, consistent with the hour burden estimates in the
proposing release, the Commission estimates that the total annual burden to brokerdealers from this requirement will be approximately 9,215 hours. 542
5.

Adequate Procedures Required under Paragraph (j)(1) of Rule
15c3-3

The Commission proposed importing requirements in Rule 15c3-2 into Rule
15c3-3 and eliminating Rule 15c3-2 as a stand-alone rule in the Code of Federal
Regulations, and adopting new paragraph (j)(1) to Rule 15c3-3, which includes a
condition that a broker-dealer must establish adequate procedures that will impose a
paperwork burden if a broker-dealer wishes to accept or use any free credit balance for
the account of any customer of the broker-dealer. The Commission is adopting this
amendment substantially as proposed, which provides, “[a] broker or dealer must not
accept or use any free credit balance carried for the account of any customer of the broker
or dealer unless such broker or dealer has established adequate procedures pursuant to
which each customer for whom a free credit balance is carried will be given or sent,

from the estimate in the proposing release, which provided that of the 75 broker-dealers
estimated to perform a PAB computation, 71 broker-dealers would prefer PAB
computations on a weekly basis and four broker-dealers would perform it on a monthly
basis. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12877. No brokerdealers performed daily PAB computations as of the date of the proposing release. No
comments were received on this estimate.
541

This estimate is based on staff experience with the current estimate of 2.5 hours under the
current collection of information for Rule 15c3-3 to make a record of each reserve
computation. See 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(e)(3).

542

(56 weekly filers x 52 weeks x 2.5 hours per computation) + (2 monthly filers x 12
months x 2.5 hours per computation) + (3 daily filers x 250 business days per year x 2.5
hours per computation) = 9,215 total hours. This is an update from the proposing release
estimate of 9,350 hours. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at
12877, n.137.

together with or as part of the customer’s statement of account, whenever sent but not
less frequently than once every three months, a written statement informing the customer
of the amount due to the customer by the broker or dealer on the date of the statement,
and that the funds are payable on demand of the customer.” 543
The requirement that broker-dealers establish adequate procedures with regard to
free credit balances will result in one-time and annual hours burdens for broker-dealers
subject to the requirements of new paragraph (j)(1) to Rule 15c3-3. Based on FOCUS
Report data, the Commission estimates that 189 broker-dealers carry free credit balances.
Most firms may already have such procedures in place with regard to the requirements of
the rule, because these provisions are being imported from current Rule 15c3-2, which is
being eliminated as a result of these amendments. Therefore, the Commission estimates
that a broker-dealer will spend approximately 25 additional hours reviewing and updating
its procedures to ensure it is in compliance with new paragraph (j)(1) to Rule 15c3-3 and
approximately 10 additional hours per year reviewing and updating its procedures, for a
total one-time and annual hour burden of 4,725 hours 544 and 1,890 hours, 545
respectively. 546

544

189 broker-dealers x 25 hours = 4,725 hours. The 25 and 10 hour estimates are based on
similar collections of information and the Commission’s belief that many of these brokerdealers already have procedures in place and, therefore, most broker-dealers will only be
revising and updating their current policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the
rule. See Removal of Certain References to Credit Ratings Under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Release No. 64532 (Apr. 27, 2011), 76 FR 26550,

Treatment of Free Credit Balances

New paragraph (j)(2) to Rule 15c3-3 will require a broker-dealer to obtain the
written affirmative consent of a new customer before including a customer’s free credit
balances in a Sweep Program, as well as to provide certain disclosures and notices to all
customers with regard to the broker-dealer’s Sweep Program.
These requirements will result in one-time and annual burdens to broker-dealers
subject to its provisions. However, these requirements will apply only to a firm that
carries customer free credit balances and opts to have the ability to change how its
customers’ free credit balances are treated. The Commission did not receive comments
regarding the hour burden estimates relating to the treatment of free credit balances in the
proposing release.
In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that approximately 50 brokerdealers 547 would choose to provide new customers with the disclosures and notices
required under the amendment in order to have the ability to change how their customers’
free credit balances were treated. The Commission did not receive any comments on this
estimate. The Commission, however, is revising this estimate for the final rule to include
all 189 broker-dealers that carry free credit balances to reflect the fact that these firms
may have to update their systems to comply with these new requirements. The
Commission further estimates these firms will spend, on average, approximately 200
hours of employee resources per firm updating their current systems (including processes
for generating customer account statements) to incorporate changes that will be
necessitated by the amendment. Therefore, the Commission estimates that the total one-

547

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12877.

152

time burden to broker-dealers arising from this requirement will be approximately 37,800
hours. 548
The Commission also estimates that these firms will consult with outside counsel
in making these systems changes, particularly with respect to the language in the
disclosures and notices under new paragraph (j)(2) to Rule 15c3-3. The Commission
estimates that an outside counsel will spend, on average, approximately 50 hours
assisting a broker-dealer in updating its systems 549 for a one-time aggregate burden to
broker-dealers of 9,450 hours. 550 The Commission estimates that the average hourly cost
for an outside counsel will be approximately $400 per hour. 551 For these reasons,
consistent with its estimate in the proposing release, the Commission estimates that the
average one-time cost to a broker-dealer will be approximately $20,000 552 and the onetime cost to broker-dealers will be approximately $3,780,000. 553
As for the annual hour burden, the Commission estimates, consistent with its
estimate in the proposing release, these requirements will impact 5% 554 of the total

548

189 broker-dealers x 200 hours per firm = 37,800.

549

Because broker-dealers affected by these amendments are likely to already have existing
sweep programs in place, a broker-dealer likely will need to update its existing systems,
rather than be required to purchase additional hardware to comply with these rule
amendments.

550

189 broker-dealers x 50 hours per firm = 9,450 hours.

551

Based on staff experience, the Commission used the estimate of $400 per hour for legal
services provided by outside counsel, which is the same estimate used by the
Commission in other recent releases. See Capital, Margin, and Segregation
Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major Security-Based Swap
Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers, Exchange Act Release 68071,
77 FR at 70297; Further Definition of “Swap,” “Security-Based Swap,” and “SecurityBased Swap Agreement”; Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement
Recordkeeping; Final Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 67453 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR
48208 (Aug. 13, 2012).

552

$400 per hour x 50 hours = $20,000.

553

189 broker-dealers x $20,000 = $3,780,000.

broker-dealer customer accounts per year. Based on FOCUS Report data, the
Commission estimates there are approximately 110,493,215 customer accounts and,
consequently, 5% of the accounts (5,524,661 accounts per year) will be impacted. 555
Based on staff experience with similar requirements under the existing PRA collection
for Rule 17a-3, the Commission further estimates that a broker-dealer will spend, on
average, four minutes 556 of employee resources to process a written affirmative consent
for new customers, as well as disclosures required under paragraph (j) to Rule 15c3-3.
Therefore, the Commission estimates that the annual burden to broker-dealers arising
from the requirement will be approximately 368,311 hours. 557
7.

Documentation of Risk Management Procedures

The amendments to Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 will require certain large brokerdealers to make and keep current a record documenting credit, market, and liquidity risk
management controls established and maintained by the broker-dealer to assist it in
analyzing and managing the risks associated with its business activities. The amendment
only will apply to broker-dealers that have more than (1) $1,000,000 in aggregate credit
items as computed under the customer reserve formula of Rule 15c3-3, or (2)
$20,000,000 in capital, including debt subordinated in accordance with Appendix D to
Rule 15c3-1.
As proposed, the amendment would have required a broker-dealer to create a
record documenting its “internal risk management controls.” 558 To address commenters’
555

concerns that the proposed rule language was ambiguous and that the Commission should
narrow the application of the rule, the Commission modified new paragraph (a)(23) to
Rule 17a-3, as stated above, so that the final rule requires certain broker-dealers to
document risk management controls established to manage market, credit, and liquidity
risk, rather than all of its “internal risk management controls.”
In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that based on FOCUS Report
data, that there would be approximately 517 broker-dealers that would meet the
applicability threshold of this amendment ($1,000,000 in credits or $20,000,000 in
capital), and therefore would be subject to the proposed rule. 559 The Commission also
estimated that this requirement would result in a one-time burden to broker-dealers of
approximately 62,040 hours, based on the estimate that a broker-dealer would spend
approximately 120 hours of employee resources augmenting its procedures to comply
with the proposed rule. 560 The Commission did not receive any comments on this
estimate in the proposing release.
In light of the change in the final rule text to require the documentation of
controls established to manage market, credit, and liquidity risk, rather than all of its
“internal risk management controls,” the Commission is reducing the final PRA estimate
for Rule 17a-3 because the final rule narrows the scope of internal risk management
controls the broker-dealer is required to document. Consequently, the change to the final
rule should result in a reduction in the one-time hour burden estimate. The rule does not
specify the type of controls a broker-dealer must establish to manage these risks. It
simply requires the documentation of the procedures the broker-dealer has established.
Broker-dealers that are part of holding companies may be subject to procedures that are
559

560

517 broker-dealers x 120 hours = 62,040 hours.

155

used globally throughout the organization. As long as the broker-dealer maintains
documented procedures of controls pertaining to the designated entity, the requirements
of the rule would be met. The one-time hour burden to comply with the rule will vary
depending on the size and complexity of a firm. In addition, some larger broker-dealers
required to comply with Rule 15c3-4 (Internal Risk Management Control Systems for
OTC Derivatives Dealers) already would be required to document their internal risk
management control systems related to market, credit, and liquidity risk. 561
Taking this into account, as well as based on staff experience monitoring
compliance of risk management controls of broker-dealers, the Commission estimates
that a broker-dealer will spend, on average, approximately 100 hours of employee
resources to comply with this amendment to ensure its market, credit, and liquidity risk
controls are documented. For the reasons discussed above, including narrowing the
scope of the final rule, the estimate of 100 hours reflects a 20% reduction from the
estimate in the proposing release of 120 hours. Based on FOCUS Report data, as of
December 31, 2011, the Commission estimates there are approximately 490 brokerdealers that would be subject to the final rule amendment (because the firm has
$1,000,000 in credits or $20,000,000 in capital). Therefore, the Commission estimates
the total one-time burden to broker-dealers will be approximately 49,000 hours. 562
In addition to the one-time hour burden discussed in the proposing release, 563
based on similar collections of information requiring the documentation of risk
management controls, 564 large broker-dealers required to comply with the amendment as
561

See 17 CFR 240.15c3-4(a).

156

adopted likely will incur annual hour burdens. 565 Consequently, the Commission is
incorporating annual hour burdens for this collection of information in the final rule
amendments. 566 Therefore, the Commission estimates that a broker-dealer would spend
approximately 45 hours per year to ensure its compliance with the amendment to Rule
17a-3, for a total annual hour burden to the industry of 22,050 hours. 567
Additionally, the proposing release did not specifically allocate the estimated hour
burdens with respect to the amendments to Rule 17a-3 and 17a-4 between these two
rules. 568 As discussed above, and based on staff experience with the application of Rule
17a-4, the Commission estimates that broker-dealers meeting the threshold requirements
of paragraph (a)(23) of Rule 17a-3 will already have documented their established
procedures and controls to manage the risks arising from their business. Consequently,
the amendment to Rule 17a-4 to require a broker-dealer to preserve the records required
pursuant to paragraph (a)(23) of Rule 17a-3 until three years after the termination of the
use of the risk management controls documented therein should have a minimal impact
on the current annual hour burden for Rule 17a-4 because the paperwork burden
associated with this amendment derives from the substance of the amendments to
paragraph (a)(23) of Rule 17a-3. Therefore, the Commission is retaining the current
annual hour burden for Rule 17a-4 without change.

565

See NIBA 2 Letter.

566

The proposing release did not contain annual hour burden estimates for this collection of
information.

567

490 broker-dealers x 45 hours = 22,050 hours. The 45 per hour annual estimate is based
on a similar collection of information. See Risk Management Controls for Brokers or
Dealers with Market Access; Final Rule, Exchange Act Release No. 63241 (Nov. 3,
2010), 75 FR 69792, 69815 (Nov. 15, 2010).

568

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12878.

157

Because the final rule amendment requires a broker-dealer to document its
liquidity, credit, and market risk management controls, if it has established such controls,
these broker-dealers may incur one-time startup costs to hire outside counsel to review
the documented controls to ensure the broker-dealer is meeting the requirements of the
rule. Based on staff experience with similar reviews, the Commission estimates that
these broker-dealers would incur $2,000 in legal costs, 569 or $980,000, 570 in the
aggregate, initial one-time burden to review and comment on the documented risk
management controls. 571
8.

Notice Requirements

The amendment to Rule 17a-11 requiring notice when a broker-dealer becomes
subject to certain insolvency events will result in irregular filings from a small number of
broker-dealers. As noted above, SIPC’s 2012 annual report indicates that the average
annual number of broker-dealers which have become subject to a liquidation proceeding
under SIPA over the last ten years is two. Accordingly, the Commission estimates that
approximately two insolvency notices will be sent per year and that a broker-dealer will
spend, on average, approximately ten minutes of employee resources to prepare and send
the notice. 572 The Commission did not receive any comments on its estimates from the

569

The Commission staff estimates that the review of the documented controls would
require 5 hours of outside counsel time at a cost of $400 per hour. See also Capital,
Margin, and Segregation Requirements for Security-Based Swap Dealers and Major
Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for Broker-Dealers,
Exchange Act Release 68071, 77 FR at 70297, n.904.

570

490 broker-dealers x $2,000 = $980,000.

571

See NIBA 2 Letter.

572

This is an update from the proposing release estimate of an average of six broker-dealers
per year have become subject to a liquidation proceeding under SIPA, based on SIPC’s
2005 annual report. The proposing release also contained a 10 minute estimate per
broker-dealer (6 notices x 10 minutes per notice = 1 hour). See Amendments to Financial
Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12878.

158

proposing release. Therefore, the Commission estimates that the total annual burden to
broker-dealers arising from this amendment will be approximately 20 minutes. 573
The amendment to Rule 17a-11 requires broker-dealers engaged in securities
lending or repurchase activities to either: (1) file a notice with the Commission and their
DEA whenever the total money payable against all securities loaned, subject to a reverse
repurchase agreement or the contract value of all securities borrowed or subject to a
repurchase agreement, exceeds 2,500% of tentative net capital; or, alternatively, (2)
report monthly their securities lending and repurchase activities to their DEA in a form
acceptable to their DEA. The Commission did not receive any comments on these
specific estimates in the proposing release and continues to believe they are appropriate.
As such, the Commission is adopting this amendment with a minor modification that
does not impact the collection of information.
In addition, based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, the
Commission estimates that approximately one stock loan/borrow notice will be sent per
year. 574 The Commission further estimates that a broker-dealer will spend, on average,
approximately ten minutes of employee resources to prepare and send the notice.
Therefore, the Commission estimates that the total annual burden to broker-dealers
arising from this amendment will be approximately ten minutes. 575
573

2 notices x 10 minutes per notice = 20 minutes.

574

This estimate is an update of the proposing release estimate that twelve notices will be
sent per year based on FOCUS data. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules,
72 FR at 12878. As of December 31, 2011, there were seven broker-dealers whose
securities borrowed or securities loaned exceeded 80% of 25 times their tentative net
capital, and there were six broker-dealers whose securities borrowed or securities loaned
exceeded 25 times their tentative net capital. The Commission assumes for purposes of
the PRA that six broker-dealers would chose to file monthly reports in lieu of the notice
requirements, and that one would file a notice.

575

1 notice x 10 minutes per notice = 10 minutes. This is an update of the proposing release
estimate of 2 hours (12 notices x 10 minutes per notice). See Amendments to Financial
Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12878. The Commission does not expect broker-dealers

159

Based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, and staff experience, the
Commission estimates that, annually, six broker-dealers will submit the monthly stock
loan/borrow report. 576 Based on staff experience, the Commission estimates each firm
will spend, on average, approximately 100 hours of employee resources updating its
systems to generate the information required in the monthly report. Therefore, the
Commission estimates that the total one-time burden to broker-dealers arising from this
requirement will be approximately 600 hours. 577 With respect to the annual hour burden,
the Commission estimates each firm will spend, on average, approximately one hour per
month (or twelve hours per year) of employee resources to prepare and send the report or
to prepare the information for the FOCUS report (as required by the firm’s DEA, if
applicable). Therefore, the Commission estimates the total annual burden arising from
this amendment will be approximately 72 hours. 578
E.

Collection of Information Is Mandatory

These recordkeeping and notice requirements are mandatory with the exception
of: (1) the option for a broker-dealer to report monthly its securities lending activities to
its DEA in lieu of filing the notice required under paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-11; (2) the
option for a broker-dealer to request written approval from its DEA in order to withdraw
capital that has been contributed within one year under paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G)(2) of Rule
to incur postage costs as a result of this amendment because most broker-dealers file
these notices via facsimile or email. Therefore, any incremental postages costs will likely
be minimal.
576

This is an update from the proposing release estimate that 21 broker-would submit a
monthly report. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12878.

577

6 broker-dealers x 100 hours per firm = 600 hours. This is an update from our proposing
release estimate of 2,100 hours (21 broker-dealers x 100 hours per firm). See
Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12878.

578

6 broker-dealers x 12 hours per year = 72 hours. This is an update from the proposing
release estimate of 252 hours (21 broker-dealers x 12 hours per year). See Amendments

15c3-1; and (3) the option of a carrying broker-dealer to enter into a subordination
agreement with an account holder in order to exclude such account holder’s account from
being treated as a PAB account under paragraph (a)(16) of Rule 15c3-3.
F.

Confidentiality

Some of the information the Commission expects to receive may be confidential
information. The information collected under the amendments to Rules 15c3-1, 15c3-3,
17a-3, and 17a-4 would be stored by the broker-dealers and made available to the
Commission, Commission staff, and SROs, as required in connection with examinations,
investigations, and enforcement proceedings. The information collected under the
amendments to Rule 17a-11 would be generated from the internal records of the brokerdealers. It would be provided to the Commission, its staff, and SROs but not on a regular
basis (except for the optional monthly reports).
To the extent that the Commission receives confidential information pursuant to
these collections of information, the Commission is committed to protecting the
confidentiality of such information to the extent permitted by law. 579
Broker-dealers will send required written notices regarding use of a PAB account
holder’s securities to its customers, as required by Rule 15c3-3. 580 In addition, brokerdealers will send certain notices and disclosures to customers regarding the treatment of

579

See, e.g., Exchange Act Section 24, 15 U.S.C. 78x (governing the public availability of
information obtained by the Commission) and 5 U.S.C. 552 et seq. (Freedom of
Information Act – “FOIA”). FOIA provides at least two pertinent exemptions under
which the Commission has authority to withhold certain information. FOIA Exemption 4
provides an exemption for “trade secrets and commercial or financial information
obtained from a person and privileged or confidential.” 5 U.S.C. 552(b)(4). FOIA
Exemption 8 provides an exemption for matters that are “contained in or related to
examination, operating, or condition reports prepared by, on behalf of, or for the use of
an agency responsible for the regulation or supervision of financial institutions.” 5

their free credit balances under new paragraph (j)(2) to Rule 15c3-3. To the extent these
standard notices and disclosures are made available to the Commission, they may not be
kept confidential.
G.

Record Retention Period

One amendment to Rule 15c3-1 will require broker-dealers to make disclosures to
principals and obtain agreements from principals with respect to securities lending
transactions where the broker-dealer acts as agent. In addition, the amendment to Rule
15c3-3 to define the term PAB account will require carrying broker-dealers to enter into
subordination agreements with certain account holders if they wish their account to be
excluded from the definition. These records will have to be maintained for not less than
three years under paragraph (b)(7) of Rule 17a-4. 581
The amendments to Rule 15c3-3 require broker-dealers to provide PAB account
holders with written notice that the securities may be used in the ordinary course of its
business, obtain the written affirmative consent of a new customer before including a
customer’s free credit balances in a Sweep Program, and provide certain disclosures and
notices to all customers with regard to the broker-dealer’s Sweep Program. These
agreements relate to the terms and conditions of the maintenance of the customer’s
account and, accordingly, fall within the record retention requirements of paragraph (c) of
Rule 17a-4. 582 Under this paragraph, the records must be retained until six years after the
closing of the customer’s account. The amendments to Rule 15c3-3 also require brokerdealers to obtain notices and contracts from the banks holding their PAB reserve
accounts. In order to comply with Rule 15c3-3, broker-dealers must have these notices

581

17 CFR 240.17a-4(b)(7).

582

17 CFR 240.17a-4(c).

162

and contracts in place and documented. These records will have to be maintained for not
less than three years under the requirements of Rule 17a-4. 583
The amendments to Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 require broker-dealers to document
credit, market, and liquidity risk management controls. The amendments to Rule 17a-4
include the establishment of a retention period for these records, which will be until three
years after the termination of the use of the risk management controls documented therein
under new paragraph (e)(9) of Rule 17a-4. The three-year retention period is designed to
document former and current procedures and to provide sufficient opportunity to review
the records during the broker-dealer’s normal exam cycle.
The amendments to Rule 17a-11 will require broker-dealers to provide notice or
report monthly to the Commission and other regulatory authorities under certain
circumstances. These notices and reports will constitute communications relating to a
broker-dealer’s “business as such” and, therefore, will need to be retained for three
years. 584

ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Introduction

The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits of its rules. When engaging
in rulemaking that requires the Commission to consider or determine whether an action is
necessary or appropriate in the public interest, section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires
that the Commission consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the
action will promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 585 In addition, section
23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to consider the effects on
583

17 CFR 240.17a-4.

competition of any rules the Commission adopts under the Exchange Act, and prohibits
the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden on competition not
necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 586
In the proposing release, 587 the Commission solicited comment on the costs and
benefits of the proposed amendments including whether these costs and benefits were
accurate. 588 The Commission also requested that commenters identify and assess any
costs and benefits not discussed in the proposing release. The Commission further
encouraged commenters to provide specific data and analysis in support of their views. 589
The Commission also requested comment on whether the proposed amendments would
place a burden on competition, and promote efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. 590 In May 2012, the Commission re-opened the comment period to permit
commenters additional opportunity to address these, and any other, issues raised by the

586

15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).

period).

588

For the purposes of this final economic analysis, the Commission is using salary data
from the SIFMA Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012,
which provides base salary and bonus information for middle-management and
professional positions within the securities industry. The salary costs derived from the
report and referenced in this cost/benefit section, are modified to account for an 1800hour work year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee
benefits and overhead. Hereinafter, references to data derived from the report as
modified in the manner described above will be cited as “SIFMA 2012 Report as
Modified.” The proposing release used salary information for New York based
employees derived from the SIA Report on Management and Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2005. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at
12879, n.151.

proposed rule amendments. 591 The general comments received, as well as comments
received relating to specific rule amendments, are discussed below.
In adopting the rule amendments, the Commission has been mindful of the
associated costs and benefits. The discussion focuses on the Commission’s reasons for
adopting these amendments, the affected parties, the costs and benefits of the
amendments compared to a baseline, and alternative courses of action. The discussion of
the costs of the rule amendments includes a discussion of certain implementation burdens
and related costs, 592 which may include assessment costs, personnel costs, and other costs
(e.g., technology costs). 593 The cost estimates and related data derived from FOCUS
Reports discussed in the proposing release have also been updated in this final release to
reflect more recently available data. 594
Many of the benefits and costs discussed below are difficult to quantify, in
particular when discussing enhancements in investor protection. For example, it is
unknown how much the amendments to the financial responsibility rules will result in
enhanced compliance with those rules. Therefore, much of the discussion is qualitative
in nature but, where possible, the Commission has attempted to quantify the costs.
However, the inability to quantify these costs and benefits does not mean that the costs
and benefits of these rule amendments are any less significant.

Release No. 66910 (May 3, 2012), 77 FR 27150 (May 9, 2012).

592

In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that the one-time and annual costs to
broker-dealers would be $32,814,454 and $39,651,716, respectively. See Amendments
to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12887.

593

As discussed in section IV. of this release, the Commission has estimated certain indirect
burdens and related costs of these implementation requirements.

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12887. The FOCUS
Report data from the proposing release was derived from 2004 year end numbers.

As discussed throughout this release, in part in response to comments, the
Commission has modified the proposed rules to reduce compliance burdens where
consistent with investor protection. In addition, where commenters identified additional
costs, the Commission has revised its economic analysis of the final rules to take these
costs into account. Finally, the Commission has considered all comment letters received
related to the impact of the proposed amendments on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation, and responds to these comments in the sections below discussing individual
rule amendments.
B.

Economic Baseline

The regulatory changes adopted today amend requirements that apply to brokerdealers registered with the Commission. The discussion below includes the approximate
numbers of broker-dealers that will be affected by today’s amendments and a description
of the economic baseline against which the costs and benefits, as well as the impact on
efficiency, competition, and capital formation, of today’s amendments are measured.
The broker-dealers registered with the Commission vary significantly in terms of
their size, business activities, and the complexities of their operations. For example,
carrying broker-dealers hold customer securities and funds. 595 Clearing broker-dealers
clear transactions as members of security exchanges, the Depository Trust & Clearing

595

Rule 15c3-1 specifies that a broker-dealer shall be deemed to carry customer accounts “if,
in connection with its activities as a broker or dealer, it receives checks, drafts, or other
evidences of indebtedness made payable to itself or persons other than the requisite
registered broker or dealer carrying the account of a customer, escrow agent, issuer,
underwriter, sponsor, or other distributor of securities” or “if it does not promptly
forward or promptly deliver all of the securities of customers or of other brokers or
dealers received by the firm in connection with its activities as a broker or dealer.” 17
CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(2)(i). Rule 15c3-3 defines the term securities carried for the account
of a customer to mean “securities received by or on behalf of a broker or dealer for the
account of any customer and securities carried long by a broker or dealer for the account
of any customer,” as well as securities sold to, or bought for, a customer by a brokerdealer. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(2).

Corporation and the Options Clearing Corporation. 596 Many clearing broker-dealers are
carrying broker-dealers, but some clearing broker-dealers clear only their own
transactions and do not hold customer securities and cash.
In addition, a broker-dealer that does not hold customer securities and/or cash is
generally referred to as a “non-carrying broker-dealer.” Non-carrying broker-dealers
include “introducing brokers.” 597 These introducing broker-dealers accept customer
orders and introduce their customers to carrying broker-dealers that hold the securities
and cash of the customers of the introducing broker-dealers along with the securities and
cash of their direct customers. A carrying broker-dealer generally receives and executes
orders of the introducing broker-dealers’ customers. 598 Carrying broker-dealers generally
also prepare trade confirmations, settle trades, and organize book entries of the securities
purchased and sold. 599 Introducing broker-dealers also may use carrying broker-dealers
to clear the introducing firm’s proprietary trades and carry the firm’s securities. Another
group of non-carrying broker-dealers effects transactions in securities like mutual funds
on a subscription-way basis, where customers generally purchase the securities by

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 4311 (Carrying Agreements). This FINRA rule governs the
requirements applicable to FINRA members when entering into agreements for the
carrying of any customer accounts in which securities transactions can be effected.
Historically, the purpose of this rule has been to ensure that certain functions and
responsibilities are clearly allocated to either the introducing or carrying firm, consistent
with the requirements of the SRO’s and Commission’s financial responsibility and other
rules and regulations, as applicable. See also Notice of Filing of Amendment No. 1 and

providing the funds directly to the issuer. 600 Finally, some non-carrying broker-dealers
act as finders by referring prospective purchasers of securities to issuers. 601
While these amendments will impact investors and markets more generally, the
broker-dealer industry is the primary industry directly affected by the rule amendments.
In some cases, the amendments impose requirements on certain types of broker-dealers
that engage in specific activities. For example, only carrying broker-dealers that carry
free credit balances would be subject to the requirements regarding the treatment of free
credit balances under paragraph (j) of Rule 15c3-3. All broker-dealers would be subject
to the requirements to deduct from net worth certain liabilities or expenses assumed by
third parties under Rule 15c3-1.
To establish a baseline for competition among broker-dealers, the Commission
looked at the status of the broker-dealer industry detailed below. In terms of size, the
following table provides the distribution of broker-dealers by total capital levels and the
aggregate total capital within each capital bracket.

Exchange Act of 1934, Exchange Act Release No. 44992 (Nov. 2, 2001) (“[T]he
Commission recognizes that for some types of transactions, such as purchases of mutual
funds or variable annuities, the customer may simply fill out an application or a
subscription agreement that the broker-dealer then forwards directly to the issuer.”).

According to FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, there were
approximately 4,709 broker-dealers registered with the Commission. Nine brokerdealers hold over half of broker-dealers’ total capital. Further, based on FOCUS Report
data, as of December 31, 2011, the Commission also estimates that there are
approximately 287 broker-dealers that are clearing or carrying firms that do not claim
exemptions pursuant to paragraph (k) of Rule 15c3-3. Based on FOCUS Report data, as
of December 31, 2011, approximately 189 of these broker-dealers carry free credit
balances, while 61 broker-dealers carry PAB accounts.
For the purposes of this economic analysis, the baseline is the current customer
protection, net capital, books and records, and notification requirements for brokerdealers promulgated under the Exchange Act and existing interpretations thereunder, and
how they affect broker-dealers.
As discussed above in section II.A.1. of this release, Rule 15c3-3 – the customer
protection rule – in effect mandates a separation of customer assets from broker-dealer

602

The information in this chart is based on FOCUS Report data filed by broker-dealers in
2011. The information in the “Aggregate Total Capital” column is based on data
reported on line 3530 of the FOCUS Report, which includes total capital and allowable
subordinated liabilities.

assets through two fundamental requirements: (1) that a carrying broker-dealer must
maintain physical possession or control over customers’ fully paid and excess margin
securities; and (2) that a carrying broker-dealer must maintain a reserve of cash or
qualified securities 603 in an account at a bank that is at least equal in value to the net cash
owed to customers, including cash obtained from the use of customer securities. These
provisions are designed to require the broker-dealer to hold customer securities and cash
in a manner that enables the prompt return of these assets in the event that the firm falls
into financial difficulty or becomes insolvent. The goal of the rule is to place a brokerdealer in a position where it is able to wind down in an orderly self-liquidation without
the need for financial assistance from SIPC through a formal proceeding under SIPA. 604
As discussed above in section II.E. of this release, Rule 15c3-1 – the net capital
rule – requires broker-dealers to maintain a minimum level of net capital (meaning highly
liquid capital) at all times. 605 The rule requires that a broker-dealer perform two
calculations: (1) a computation of the minimum amount of net capital the broker-dealer
must maintain; 606 and (2) a computation of the amount of net capital the broker-dealer is
maintaining. 607 The minimum net capital requirement is the greater of a fixed-dollar
amount specified in the rule and an amount determined by applying one of two financial
ratios: the 15-to-1 aggregate indebtedness to net capital ratio or the 2% of aggregate debit

make certain adjustments to net worth, such as deducting illiquid assets, taking other
capital charges, and adding qualifying subordinated loans. 609 The amount remaining
after these adjustments is defined as tentative net capital. 610 The final step in computing
net capital is to take prescribed percentage deductions (“standardized haircuts”) from the
mark-to-market value of the proprietary positions (e.g., securities, money market
instruments, and commodities) that are included in its tentative net capital. 611
As discussed above in section II.D. of this release, Rule 17a-3 and 17a-4 – the
books and records rules – require broker-dealers to make and keep current certain records
(e.g., trade blotters, asset and liability ledgers, income ledgers, customer account ledgers,
etc.), which must be maintained in a specific manner for required retention periods. 612
Finally, Rule 17a-11 – the notification rule – requires a broker-dealer to notify the
Commission and its DEA when certain events occur, such as if it fails to maintain certain
levels of net capital. 613
The specific requirements as well as the benefits and costs of each amendment
and how broker-dealers will be affected are discussed in more detail in the sections
below.

participants, as well as any other costs and benefits that may result from the adoption of
the proposed rules. 614 In response to this specific request, the Commission received two
comment letters. 615 The first commenter who was explicitly addressing the
Commission’s Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis stated that the Commission should
pay “explicit attention to regulatory trends in the rest of the world” because doing so
“benefits not only small entities [the focus of the Initial Regulatory Flexibility Analysis]
(by reducing their regulatory burden) but all entities, as larger entities can experience
more consistent regulatory procedures around the world.” 616 The commenter suggested
that the Commission consider a “Basel II type approach to net capital requirements.” 617
The second commenter requested that the Commission publish an update to all statistics
and costs referenced in the proposing release. 618 The commenter further requested that,
once published, the Commission reopen the comment period so that comments could be
provided based on “current conditions and statistics.” 619
In response to the first commenter’s request that the Commission should
explicitly examine the alternatives used by regulators in other jurisdictions, 620 in adopting
the final rule amendments today, as discussed throughout this section, the Commission
considered reasonable alternatives, including alternatives in other jurisdictions, as well as
the costs and benefits of the amendments. Moreover, the amendments relate to discrete
areas of the broker-dealer financial responsibility rules (i.e., they do not establish new

financial responsibility standards such as would be the case if the Commission were to
adopt a “Basel II type approach to net capital requirements.”). Consequently, the
commenter’s suggestion is beyond the scope of this rulemaking. 621
In response to the second commenter, the Commission is publishing updated costs
and statistics in this release. The Commission, however, believes that it is unnecessary to
reopen the comment period to obtain comment on the updated statistics for several
reasons. First, in proposing the rule changes, the Commission included then current
estimates in the proposing release. Second, as noted above, the Commission reopened
the comment period in 2012. 622 The reopening of the comment period afforded
commenters an additional opportunity to comment on the proposed rules (including
estimated costs and benefits), given the economic events since the rule amendments were
proposed, the regulatory developments, the comments received on the proposed
amendments, the continuing public interest in the proposed amendments, and the passage
of time. 623 The Commission received a total of 97 comment letters on the proposed
amendments. 624 As discussed below, in many cases, the revised data included in this
release reflects a decrease in overall costs because of the decline in the total number of
broker-dealers (including the number of broker-dealers that will be affected by each of
these rule amendments). As of the 2004 year end, the number of registered brokerdealers was 6,339. As of the 2011 year end, the number of registered broker-dealers was
621

The commenter cited the JP Morgan Letter in support of the suggestion to “consider
regulatory trends in the rest of the world.” Id. The JP Morgan Letter recommends that
the Commission adopt a due diligence standard – citing a U.K. regulation – with respect
to the amendments regarding customer reserve account cash deposits. See JP Morgan
Letter. The Commission addresses this comment below in section V.D.1.i.b.(III) of this
release.

4,709, reflecting a net decrease of 1,630 (or 26%) in the number of registered brokerdealers. Consequently, many of the aggregate costs included in the proposing release
have declined due to the decrease in the number of registered broker-dealers.
Further, the costs incurred by a broker-dealer to comply with the rule amendments
will generally depend, among other factors, on the size and complexity of its business
activities. Because the size and complexity of broker-dealers varies significantly, their
costs also could vary significantly. In some cases, the Commission provided in the
proposing release, and is providing here, estimates of the average cost per broker-dealer,
taking into consideration the variance in size and complexity of the business activities of
broker-dealers. In other cases, the cost impact to broker-dealers will depend on whether
the broker-dealer is conducting activities that are subject to the rule amendments. For
example, the amendments to Rule 15c3-3 will apply, for the most part, only to brokerdealers that carry PAB accounts (e.g., PAB account amendment), have a reserve deposit
requirement (e.g., reserve bank account amendments), or carry free credit balances (e.g.,
free credit balance amendments). These amendments would have no direct cost impact
on non-carrying broker-dealers, many of which are small broker-dealers. Moreover,
given that some amendments are largely codifications of existing Commission and staff
guidance (e.g., amendments related to PAB accounts, third parties assuming brokerdealer liabilities, temporary capital contributions, and fidelity bond deductions), any
economic effects, including costs and benefits, should be compared to the baseline of
current practice. Broker-dealers that are already complying with these requirements
would not be expected to incur substantial costs to comply with these amendments.
The second commenter also stated that broker-dealers are dealing with relatively
static commission and fee schedules in comparison to what they might charge customers,
and, as such, broker-dealers will be unable to pass on any cost increases resulting from

174

these rule amendments directly to customers. 625 The commenter stated that these cost
increases over a relatively short period of time threaten the viability of all small brokerdealers, irrespective of their business line types or classes. 626 The commenter noted that
the estimates provided by the Commission utilized only the number of broker-dealers in
its estimate that the Commission justifiably considered to be affected by the proposals. 627
In contrast, the commenter believes that most, if not all broker-dealers will spend over 90
hours each analyzing the effects of these proposals and, if the rules are implemented, will
spend much more than 90 hours each in implementing procedures to comply with the
new rules. The commenter also believes that implementation will require broker-dealers
to modify their written supervisory procedures and supervisory controls, and brokerdealers will spend in excess of 240 hours each in the monitoring of such rules on an
ongoing basis. Consequently, the commenter believes that each broker-dealer will spend
in excess of $15,000 for outside counsel and auditor opinions or work product. 628 This
commenter did not provide additional detail about the basis for its view that the
Commission’s estimates were too low.
As stated above in section IV. of this release, the Commission agrees with the
commenter that the broker-dealers directly affected by the rule amendments may be
required to implement procedures or modify their written supervisory procedures to
comply with the rule amendments. In cases where the rule amendments require a brokerdealer to directly implement or document certain policies and procedures, these hour
burdens and costs already are incorporated into the PRA costs discussed above in section

See NIBA 2 Letter.

IV. of this release, and incorporated into the discussion below. 629 In response to the
commenter, the Commission also acknowledges that a broker-dealer may need to review
its operations to determine whether it has any obligations under the rule amendments.
Even if the broker-dealer is not affected by the rule amendments, such a review may
result in an indirect effect on its operations. These indirect costs are discussed in more
detail below. In adopting these final rules, as discussed throughout the release, including
this economic analysis, the Commission has sought to take into account the costs and
benefits associated with each particular rule amendment. The Commission has also
considered the indirect costs that a broker-dealer would incur to assess the impact of
these final rule amendments.
The Commission estimates that a broker-dealer likely will hire outside counsel to
assess the impact of the final rules on the broker-dealer’s operations because all brokerdealers may be affected by the final rules, including non-carrying broker-dealers that may
be affected by certain amendments, such as the Rule 15c3-1 amendments regarding third
party liabilities or temporary capital contributions. Whether a broker-dealer determines
to incur such assessment costs will depend on the nature and size of the broker-dealer’s
business and the range of activities the broker-dealer conducts. Therefore, while the
Commission cannot estimate an aggregate assessment cost for all broker-dealers, the
Commission estimates that these assessment costs would range approximately from
$2,000 to $30,000 630 per broker-dealer. 631
629

See, e.g., paragraph (j)(1) of Rule 15c3-3 and paragraph (a)(23) of Rule 17a-3, as
adopted.

630

These costs estimates include hour estimates in the range of 5 hours to 75 hours for
outside counsel assessment review. A small broker-dealer may hire outside counsel to
review only 1 or 2 of the final rule amendments for approximately 5 hours x $400 per
hour = $2,000. See Business Conduct Standards for Security-Based Swap Dealers and
Major Security-Based Swap Participants, Exchange Act Release No. 64766, 76 FR 42396

Economic Analysis of the Amendments and Alternatives

This section discusses costs and benefits of the rule amendments for the affected
parties against the economic baseline identified above, both in terms of each of the
specific changes from the baseline and in terms of the overall impact. In considering
costs, benefits, and overall impact, this discussion addresses comments received,
modifications made to the proposed amendments, and reasonable alternatives, where
applicable.
This section also discusses the Commission’s considerations on the burden on
competition, and the promotion of efficiency, competition, and capital formation. 632 In
significant part, the effects of the final rules on efficiency and capital formation are
linked to the effects of these rules on competition. Competitive markets are generally
expected to promote an efficient allocation of capital. Rules that promote, or do not
unduly restrict, investor participation and competition in the broker-dealer industry can

legal services by outside counsel). See also Further Definition of “Swap Dealer,”
“Security-Based Swap Dealer,” “Major Swap Participant,” “Major Security-Based Swap
Participant” and “Eligible Contract Participant”, Exchange Act Release No. 66868 (Apr.
27, 2012), 77 FR 30596 (May 23, 2012) (noting that the review of the final rules by
outside counsel for a large firm would generally cost more because the review would be
more complex).
631

As discussed above, and in section IV. of this release, broker-dealers directly affected by
a specific rule amendment may be required to implement procedures or modify their
written supervisory procedures in order to comply with the rule amendments. The hours
and related costs are discussed in section IV. of this release, and are incorporated into the
specific sections below discussing each rule amendment. Therefore, while the range of
hours is less than 90 hours (as suggested by the commenter), the Commission has
adjusted other specific hour and cost estimates (in sections IV. and V. of this release) in
response to the commenter’s concerns, and believes these adjusted estimates, in totality,
for the reasons discussed above, adequately address the estimated costs as well as the
commenter’s concerns. See NIBA 2 Letter.

632

In the proposing release, the Commission stated that its preliminary view was that the
proposed amendments promote efficiency, competition, and capital formation and would
not have any anti-competitive effects. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility
Rules, 72 FR at 12887.

Proprietary Accounts of Broker-Dealers
(I).

Summary of Amendments

Today’s amendments to Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a require carrying brokerdealers to: (1) perform a separate reserve computation for PAB accounts (in addition to
the customer reserve computation currently required under Rule 15c3-3); 633 (2) establish
and fund a separate reserve account for the benefit of the PAB account holders; 634 and (3)
obtain and maintain physical possession or control of securities carried for a PAB
account, unless the carrying broker-dealer has provided written notice to the PAB
account holder that the securities may be used in the ordinary course of its securities
business, and has provided opportunity for the PAB account holder to object. 635 In
addition to the amendments to Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a, the Commission is adopting
amendments to Rule 15c3-1 that will require a broker-dealer to deduct from net capital
cash and securities held in a securities account at a carrying broker-dealer except where
the account has been subordinated to the claims of creditors of the carrying brokerdealer. 636
As discussed above in section II.A.2. of this release, there is a disparity between
the customer reserve requirements in Rule 15c3-3 and the treatment of customers in a

liquidation proceeding under SIPA. 637 Broker-dealers are not within the definition of
customer for the purposes of Rule 15c3-3. 638 Accordingly, a carrying broker-dealer that
carries PAB accounts is not required to treat these accounts as customer accounts for the
purposes of Rule 15c3-3. However, the definition of customer in SIPA is broader than
the definition in Rule 15c3-3 in that the SIPA definition does not exclude brokerdealers. 639
SIPA customers are entitled to a number of protections if their broker-dealer fails
and is liquidated in a SIPA proceeding, including the right to share pro rata with other
SIPA customers in the customer property held by the broker-dealer and, if the fund of
customer property is insufficient to make each SIPA customer whole, the entitlement to
receive an advance from the SIPC fund of up to $500,000 (of which only $250,000 can
be used to cover cash claims). 640 Broker-dealers that are SIPA customers have the right
to share pro rata in customer property. 641 Consequently, when a carrying broker-dealer is
liquidated in a SIPA proceeding, each customer (including a SIPA customer that is a
broker-dealer) has a claim on the customer property. However, because the possession
and control and customer reserve account provisions of Rule 15c3-3 do not apply to PAB
account holders by virtue of the definition of customer in the rule, the carrying broker-

by or for the account of the debtor from or for the securities accounts of a customer, and
the proceeds of any such property transferred by the debtor, including property
unlawfully converted.” Therefore, customer property includes those securities positions
that are held for customers and the cash that is owed to customers. 15 U.S.C. 78lll(4).

The treatment of PAB account holders as customers for the purposes of SIPA but
not as customers for the purposes of Rule 15c3-3 increases the risk that, in the event that
a carrying broker-dealer is liquidated under SIPA, the claims of all SIPA customers will
exceed the amount of customer property available and, thereby, expose the SIPC fund
and potentially SIPA customers to losses. In addition, if the customer property is
insufficient to satisfy fully all SIPA customer claims, and losses are incurred, the brokerdealer SIPA customers could be potentially placed in financial distress causing adverse
effects to the securities markets, in addition to the adverse effects resulting from the
failure of the carrying broker-dealer. 642
The amendments address the disparity between the customer reserve requirements
in Rule 15c3-3 and the treatment of customers in a liquidation proceeding under SIPA by
requiring broker-dealers to reserve for the amount that credits exceed debits with respect
to broker-dealer accounts. The amendments create a process that protects customers and
PAB account holders of a failed carrying broker-dealer, and are designed to provide such
protection by mitigating the risk that there will be insufficient customer property to fully
satisfy all customer claims in a SIPA liquidation. By requiring the protection of PAB
account holders (who qualify as customers under SIPA), the amendments to Rule 15c3-3
also reduce the risk that advances from the SIPC fund would be necessary to protect
customer claims.

642

As noted above, while broker-dealers are customers for the purposes of SIPA, they are
not entitled to the advances from the SIPC fund of up to $500,000 (limited to $250,000
for cash claims) allowed under SIPA to make up for potential shortfalls after the pro rata
distribution of customer property. 15 U.S.C. 78fff-3(a).

180

The amendments to Rule 15c3-1 are intended to prevent broker-dealers from
including in their net capital amount assets that may not be readily available to be
returned to such broker-dealer account holders because the assets would not be subject to
the PAB account provisions under Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a. The amendments to Rule
15c3-1 also provide consistency with the exclusions from the definition of PAB account
in paragraph (a)(16) of Rule 15c3-3.
Overall, the PAB-related amendments to Rules 15c3-3, 15c3-3a, and 15c3-1
should serve to reduce certain risks to investors and PAB account holders and, thereby,
strengthen customer protection. The Commission requested comment on available
metrics to quantify these benefits and any other benefits a commenter may identify. The
Commission did not receive any comments in response to this request.
(II).

Baseline and Incremental Economic
Effects

Under the no-action relief set forth in the PAIB Letter, 643 discussed in section
II.A.2 of this release, broker-dealers currently perform a reserve computation for
domestic broker-dealer accounts and have obtained the necessary agreements and notices
from the banks holding their PAIB reserve deposits. Therefore, as compared to the
baseline of current Rule 15c3-1 and existing interpretations and guidance thereunder,
including the no-action relief set forth in the PAIB Letter, the amendments will likely
result only in small incremental benefits and costs because the final rule codifies many of
the provisions of the PAIB Letter. 644
Incorporation of certain aspects of the PAIB Letter into Rule 15c3-3 is intended to
provide broker-dealers with more certainty with respect to the PAB requirements because
643

See PAIB Letter.

644

See section II.B. of this release. The PAIB Letter is being withdrawn as of the effective
date of these rule amendments.

181

these requirements will be expressly stated in a Commission rule. Moreover, the PAB
final rule amendments will not impose a significant additional burden on broker-dealers
presently utilizing the interpretive relief provided in the PAIB Letter since the provisions
of the final rule amendments are substantially similar. Relative to the baseline, there will
be economic differences to the extent that carrying broker-dealers are currently not
following the PAIB Letter, as compliance with conditions of the PAIB Letter are
voluntary, while the PAB amendments to Rule 15c3-3 will be mandatory for the carrying
broker-dealers subject to its requirements. Consequently, to the extent that carrying
broker-dealers are not currently complying with the PAIB Letter, and to the extent the
amendments as adopted differ from the PAIB Letter, they may incur incremental costs,
including possible costs of capital as firms reallocate capital to comply with the rule
amendments.
(III). Alternatives
In adopting these amendments, the Commission considered alternatives suggested
by commenters on specific provisions of the rule, and incorporated some of these
alternative approaches into the final rule amendments.
Two commenters raised concerns about the proposed definition of the term PAB
account, because by including proprietary accounts of foreign broker-dealers and foreign
banks acting as broker-dealers within the definition, the definition would differ from
provisions in the PAIB Letter, which excluded such accounts from a PAIB
computation. 645 The first commenter suggested allowing broker-dealers to “opt out” of
the rule. 646 The second commenter stated that foreign broker-dealers and foreign banks
acting as broker-dealers should be allowed to subordinate their claims to customers and
645

646

See Dresdner Kleinwort Letter.

182

creditors of the broker-dealer to remove their accounts from PAB account treatment
because under SIPA foreign broker-dealers and foreign banks acting as broker-dealers,
under certain circumstances, will not be deemed customers and, therefore, would not be
entitled to a pro rata share of the estate of customer property in a SIPA liquidation. 647
More specifically, the commenter suggested that, to parallel the language in SIPA, 648 the
Commission modify the definition of PAB account to exclude “any foreign broker-dealer
and foreign bank, to the extent that such entity has a claim for cash or securities that is
subordinated to the claims of creditors of the carrying broker-dealer.” This commenter
also recommended that the subordinating broker-dealer would need to follow the
requirements for non-conforming subordinated loans to remove an account from being
treated as a PAB account. 649
In response to commenters’ concerns and suggested alternatives, the Commission
is excluding from the PAB account definition accounts that have been subordinated to the
claims of creditors of the carrying broker-dealer. Consequently, this provision will
provide flexibility to carrying broker-dealers and their broker-dealer affiliates to structure
their PAB account relationships in a manner that permits operational efficiencies (i.e., the
ability to exclude these accounts from the PAB reserve computation) while still
promoting the goal of the amendments to have a consistent treatment of these accounts
under Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA, and thereby protect accounts holders that are customers
under SIPA. As discussed below, however, the requirement to enter into a subordination
647

See Deutsche Bank Securities Letter.

648

Id. The definition of customer in SIPA excludes any person, to the extent that “such
person has a claim for cash or securities which by contract, agreement, or understanding,
or by operation of law, is part of the capital of the debtor, or is subordinated to the claims
of any or all creditors of the debtor, notwithstanding that some ground exists for
declaring such contract, agreement, or understanding void or voidable in a suit between
the claimant and the debtor.” 15 U.S.C. 78lll(2)(C)(ii).

649

See Deutsche Bank Securities Letter.

183

agreement with certain account holders to exclude them from the definition of PAB
account may result in a one-time cost to broker-dealers.
In addition, in the proposing release, the Commission proposed to require that a
carrying broker-dealer obtain written permission from a PAB account holder before it
could use the securities of the PAB account holder in the ordinary course of its securities
business. One commenter stated that this provision should be eliminated from the
proposed amendments, arguing that it interferes unnecessarily in the contractual
arrangements between broker-dealers, which are capable of understanding the terms of
standard industry custodial relationships and that the PAIB Letter did not contain any
such requirements. The Commission considered this alternative and believes that an
appropriate level of protection for PAB account holders will be achieved by requiring the
carrying broker-dealer to provide written notice to the PAB account holders that the firm
may use their non-margin securities in the ordinary course of its securities business. The
written notice requirement in the final rule will increase protection for PAB account
holders from the status quo without imposing substantial burdens on existing account
relationships. The revised rule will alert PAB account holders to the fact that the carrying
broker-dealer may use their securities in its business for its own benefit, thereby reducing
possible contractual ambiguity between the PAB account holder and the broker-dealer.
The revised rule also will provide a PAB account holder the opportunity to seek to move
the account to another broker-dealer or to negotiate different terms with regard to the use
of its securities. Finally, this amendment will eliminate the need for, and the costs that
would result from, carrying broker-dealers reworking existing contracts.
An alternative considered in adopting the PAB-related amendments to Rule 15c31 would have required a broker-dealer, when calculating net capital, to deduct from net
worth cash and securities held in a securities account at another broker-dealer, if the other

184

broker-dealer does not treat the account, and the assets in the account, in compliance with
the applicable PAB requirements of the rule. 650 Although the proposing release stated
that the Commission did not expect broker-dealers to audit or examine their carrying
broker-dealers to determine whether such firms were in compliance with the proposed
rule, commenters expressed concern that the proposed rule text suggested that brokerdealers in fact would have such an obligation. 651 There were also concerns expressed
that a broker-dealer should not be deemed to have violated the net capital rule because its
carrying firm fails to properly perform requirements solely applicable to the carrying firm
and that Rule 15c3-1 should be modified to clarify that cash and securities held in a
securities account at another broker-dealer are not subject to the deduction specified in
paragraph (c)(2)(iv)(E) of Rule 15c3-1. 652 In response to these concerns, the
Commission has modified the language in the Rule 15c3-1 to eliminate the proposed
capital charge that would have resulted from a failure of a carrying broker-dealer to
comply with the PAB requirements. Instead, the Commission has adopted amendments
providing that a broker-dealer need not deduct cash and securities held in a securities
account at another broker-dealer, with one exception. As discussed in section II.A.2. of
this release, the exception generally parallels the exclusions from the definition of PAB
account in Rule 15c3-3.
(IV). Compliance Cost Estimates
The Commission is mindful of the compliance costs associated with the final PAB
rule amendments. In particular, the Commission recognizes that, though many
requirements of the PAB rule amendments being adopted by the Commission today are
650

See section II.A.2.v. of this release.

652

185

incorporated from the PAIB Letter, there may be incremental imposed costs. For
example, as discussed above in section II.A.2. of this release, because the possession and
control and customer reserve account provisions of Rule 15c3-3 do not apply to PAB
account holders by virtue of the definition of customer in the rule, the carrying brokerdealer is not restricted from using the securities and cash in those accounts for its own
business purposes. Broker-dealers carrying PAB accounts will be required to comply
with the final PAB rule amendments, in contrast to the provisions of the PAIB Letter,
which are voluntary. 653 To the extent that carrying broker-dealers are not currently
complying with the PAIB Letter, or to the extent the amendments as adopted differ from
the PAIB Letter, they may incur incremental costs, including possible costs of capital as
firms reallocate capital to comply with the rule amendments.
The requirement to enter into a subordination agreement with certain account
holders to exclude them from the definition of PAB account, 654 the requirement to
provide written notice to PAB account holders that their securities may be used in the
ordinary course of the carrying broker-dealer’s securities business, 655 the requirement to
amend the standard PAB agreement templates, 656 and the need to update systems to

implement the necessary changes 657 may also impose one-time costs. In addition, a
carrying broker-dealer will incur postage costs as a result of the requirement to send
written notices to PAB account holders regarding the use of their non-margin securities,
as well as outside counsel fees to review the notice and standard PAB agreement
template. 658 Finally, the requirements to compute and establish a separate reserve for
PAB accounts will result in annual costs to carrying broker-dealers to the extent that
these requirements will lengthen the time needed to compute and establish the PAB
reserve account under the PAIB Letter. The Commission estimates that these
requirements would impose one-time and annual costs in the aggregate of approximately
$6,434,840 659 and $2,709,210, 660 respectively.
As noted above, the Commission requested comment on the proposed cost
estimates. 661 In particular, the Commission requested comment on whether there would
be additional costs to broker-dealers as a consequence of these proposals. The
Commission requested comment on whether these requirements would result in such
costs and, if so, how to quantify the costs. The Commission also requested comment on
whether these proposals would impose costs on other market participants, including

658

The estimated postage costs are calculated as follows: 1,551 notices x $0.46 =

Banks Where Special Reserve Deposits May Be
Held
(I).

Summary of Amendments

As amended, paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 requires carrying broker-dealers to
deposit cash or qualified securities into their customer or PAB reserve account, which
must be maintained at a “bank.” 662 As adopted, the final rule excludes when determining
whether a broker-dealer maintains the minimum deposits required under paragraph (e) of
Rule 15c3-3: (1) cash deposited with an affiliated bank; and (2) cash deposited at a “nonaffiliated bank to the extent that the amount of the deposit exceeds 15% of the bank’s
equity capital as reported by the bank in its most recent Call Report or any successor
form the bank is required to file by its appropriate Federal banking agency (as defined by
Section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813)).”
Under paragraph (f) of Rule 15c3-3, a broker-dealer is currently required to obtain
a written contract from the bank wherein the bank agrees not to re-lend or hypothecate
the qualified securities deposited into the reserve account. 663 This means that the bank
cannot use the qualified securities in its business, which provides a measure of protection
by requiring that the securities will be available to the broker-dealer if the bank falls into

662

The term qualified securities is defined in paragraph (a)(6) of Rule 15c3-3 to mean
securities issued by the United States or guaranteed by the United States with respect to
principal and interest. 17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(6). The term bank is defined in paragraph
(a)(7) of Rule 15c3-3 as a “bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act and will also
mean any building and loan, savings and loan or similar banking institution subject to the
supervision by a Federal banking authority.” See paragraph (a)(7) to Rule 15c3-3, as
adopted.

financial difficulty. Cash deposits, however, may be freely used in the course of the
bank’s commercial activities. Therefore, because they do not have that same type of
protection, the amendments to Rule 15c3-3 enhance customer protection by prohibiting a
carrying broker-dealer from holding customer cash deposits at its affiliated bank and
establishing requirements designed to avoid the situation where a carrying brokerdealer’s cash deposits constitute a substantial portion of the bank’s deposits.
Customer cash deposits may be at risk if a carrying broker-dealer does not
exercise due diligence when assessing the financial soundness of an affiliated bank with
the same degree of impartiality and care as it would with an unaffiliated bank. The
situation where a broker-dealer’s cash constitutes a substantial portion of a bank’s
deposits also poses a risk that some or all of the cash deposits may not be readily
available for quick withdrawal by the broker-dealer. Depending on the relative size of
the deposit, a lost deposit that is large relative to the broker-dealer’s capital could cause
the firm to fail. 664 If the broker-dealer fails and the deposit is not recovered, the SIPC
fund may not recover advances that it has made for the purpose of returning customer
assets. To the extent that customer losses exceed the SIPA advance limits, customers
may suffer permanent losses.
The amendment to Rule 15c3-3 should serve to reduce certain risks to investors in
the event of a bank’s failure and, thereby, enhance customer protection. The Commission
requested comment on available metrics to quantify these benefits and any other benefits
a commenter may identify. Commenters were also requested to identify sources of
empirical data that could be used for the proposed metrics. The Commission did not
receive any comments in response to these requests.

(II).

Baseline and Incremental Economic
Effects

The current baseline for the amendment to paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3 is the
existing customer protection requirements under Rule 15c3-3 and interpretations of the
rule. Under paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-3, broker-dealers are currently required to
deposit cash or qualified securities into the customer reserve account, which must be
maintained at a “bank.” Under current interpretations, broker-dealers are limited in their
reserve account cash deposits at parent or affiliated banks to 50% of the broker-dealer’s
excess net capital or 10% of the bank’s equity capital. 665 Current interpretations also
place similar restrictions on certain types of products at unaffiliated banks, including
restrictions on concentration in money market deposit accounts and time deposits. 666
As compared to the baseline, the Commission estimates that the incremental costs
resulting from this amendment will be limited. Using FOCUS Report data, as of
December 31, 2011, the Commission estimates that approximately 224 broker-dealers
report reserve deposits. 667 A considerable proportion of these broker-dealers, including
some of the largest firms, meet their deposit requirements using mostly qualified
securities as opposed to cash and, therefore, will be marginally impacted by this
amendment. For example, based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, for
the 224 broker-dealers with reserve deposits, 79% of the total customer reserve
requirement was met using qualified securities that could still be deposited at affiliated
banks to meet customer reserve requirements, under the rule, as adopted. The remaining
customer reserve requirement could be met by using qualified securities (as opposed to

cash) and/or opening one or more accounts at unaffiliated banks, which would hold the
cash within the limits permitted under the rule.
Relative to the current baseline, broker-dealers may incur two types of costs. The
first type of cost relates to the costs of opening a new account at an unaffiliated bank for
broker-dealers that currently hold cash in a reserve account at an affiliated bank. It is
difficult to estimate the number of broker-dealers that hold cash reserve deposits at an
affiliated bank because FOCUS Report data does not include the names of banks at which
broker-dealers maintain their reserve accounts. Therefore, this data is not readily
available to the Commission and commenters did not provide it. Based on an analysis of
FOCUS Report data as of December 31, 2011, as well as available bank data, 668 the
Commission, however, estimates that there are approximately 50 broker-dealers 669 that
have an affiliated bank and cash in their customer reserve accounts.
The second type of cost relates to the costs of opening and maintaining multiple
bank accounts if the cash deposit exceeds the 15% bank equity capital threshold as
defined in the final rule, the likelihood of which the Commission expects to decrease
because, with the relaxation of the bank equity capital threshold in the final rule, fewer
broker-dealers will be required to open multiple accounts, relative to the current baseline.
Broker-dealers, however, may replace these types of cost with the costs of converting
cash into qualified securities to meet some or all of their reserve deposit requirements
under Rule 15c3-3.
Moreover, in an attempt to reduce search costs, the potential exists that brokerdealers will select one or a few large unaffiliated banks or create networks on the basis of
668

names, as well as customer reserve account data, from FOCUS Report data.

191

reciprocity between broker-dealers and banks. This could result in a potential
concentration of reserve cash deposits at a few banks. If as a result of such concentration,
the carrying broker-dealer’s deposit constitutes a substantial portion of the bank’s total
deposits, the risk increases that the bank may not have the liquidity to quickly return the
deposit to the broker-dealer. Finally, the affiliated banks that are currently holding and
using broker-dealer reserve cash deposits in the course of their business may incur
funding costs, resulting from the possible transfer of cash deposits in the reserve account
by broker-dealers to unaffiliated banks. These incremental funding costs to the affiliated
banks may potentially be offset by the benefit of receiving cash deposits from unaffiliated
broker-dealers.
(III). Alternatives
In adopting the final rule, the Commission considered several alternative
approaches suggested by commenters. For example, commenters urged the Commission
not to adopt the proposed prohibition on broker-dealers maintaining cash in reserve
accounts at banks that are affiliates, stating that affiliated banks should be treated the
same as unaffiliated banks because both groups are subject to the same financial
regulation. One commenter noted that if a broker-dealer must move their reserve
accounts to an unaffiliated bank this may require the broker-dealer to enter into new or
additional banking relationships to comply with the amendment, which would increase
the costs and administrative burdens of those reserve account funds. 670
Several commenters suggested that the Commission allow cash reserve deposits
without percentage restrictions at unaffiliated banks that are well-capitalized or for which

670

See Raymond James 2 Letter.

192

a broker-dealer has performed due diligence. 671 One of these commenters cited a U.K.
regulation that requires a firm selecting a bank to hold customer deposits to undertake
due diligence on the bank taking into consideration a number of factors including: (1) the
capital of the bank; (2) the amount of client money placed, as a proportion of the bank’s
capital and deposits; (3) the credit rating of the bank (if available); and (4) to the extent
the information is available, the level of risk in the investment and loan activities
undertaken by the bank and its affiliated companies. 672
One commenter suggested that the Commission consider higher percentages for
cash deposits at large money-center banks. 673 This commenter also stated that the
percentage thresholds would negatively impact small broker-dealers because they would
cross the 50% of excess net capital threshold at lower deposit levels. 674 Another
commenter suggested that the Commission reconsider the proposed limitation on the
amount of reserve account cash deposits that may be held at any one bank because the
limitation would result in significant costs for broker-dealers and could potentially
adversely impact the customers of broker-dealers. 675
In the final rule, the language excluding customer and PAB reserve cash deposits
at affiliated banks from counting towards a broker-dealer’s reserve requirement is being
adopted as proposed. As discussed further below, relative to the proposed rule, in the
final rule, the Commission eliminated the proposed language that would have excluded
the amount of the deposit at an unaffiliated bank that exceeded 50% of a broker-dealer’s

excess net capital and based on the Commission’s expert judgment, increased the bank
equity capital threshold from 10% to 15%. 676
In response to comments on the proposed rule (including comments suggesting a
due diligence standard instead of an objective threshold), the Commission modified the
final rule text in ways that are designed to substantially mitigate the costs identified by
commenters. While the final rule amendment excludes the amount of any cash on
deposit at an affiliated bank from being used to meet a broker-dealer’s reserve
requirement, the Commission eliminated the provision that would have excluded the
amount of a deposit that exceeds 50% of a broker-dealer’s excess net capital. This
provision would have impacted small and mid-size broker-dealers when they deposited
cash into large commercial banks since the cash deposits of these firms would exceed the
broker-dealer excess net capital threshold before exceeding the bank equity capital
threshold.
The elimination of the broker-dealer excess net capital threshold, combined with
the increase of the bank equity capital threshold from 10% to 15%, is intended to
substantially mitigate the costs, burdens and inefficiencies that commenters believed
would be imposed on small and mid-size broker-dealers if such firms had to open
multiple bank accounts as a result of the proposed rule. The rule, as adopted, will allow
small and mid-size broker-dealers to maintain reserve accounts at one bank if they so
choose, provided that the bank equity capital threshold is not exceeded. In contrast to the
proposed thresholds, the final rule amendments should reduce the costs associated with
implementing the necessary changes to systems, operations, and contractual agreements
related to a broker-dealer’s reserve bank accounts.

676

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12864.

194

Further, in response to comments, increasing the threshold from 10% to 15% of
the bank’s equity capital is intended to address concerns raised by large broker-dealers
with large deposit requirements that the 10% threshold would have resulted in increased
costs of having to spread out deposits over a number of banks. The decrease in the cost
of opening and maintaining multiple accounts resulting from the increased threshold to
15% of the bank’s equity capital may counterbalance the increase in the cost of
transferring cash deposits to an unaffiliated bank. In summary, the rule, as adopted, with
an increase to a 15% threshold will, in the Commission’s expert judgment, substantially
mitigate the cost concerns raised by commenters, while still providing adequate customer
protection consistent with the goal of the rule to promote the broker-dealer’s ability to
have quick access to the deposit.
With respect to qualified securities, one commenter argued that if a broker-dealer
elects to use qualified securities as opposed to cash to meet its reserve requirement, the
broker-dealer will likely have a significant amount of additional operational and
transactional costs. 677 In addition, this commenter stated that while large broker-dealers
may be able to reallocate existing trading desk, operational, regulatory reporting, and
treasury functions to assist in ongoing maintenance activities, small and mid-sized
broker-dealers may be required to hire additional staff to manage and maintain a
securities portfolio. 678 In response to the commenter, many large broker-dealers already
hold large amounts of their reserve deposits in qualified securities. As the commenter
677

See JP Morgan Letter. The commenter noted that “[c]ertain broker-dealers may be
required to hire additional staff to manage and maintain a securities portfolio.” Id.
“Managing a pool of qualified securities involves a myriad of tasks such as monitoring
income collection, redemption processing, marking the securities to market, collateral
substitutions and collateral segregation amongst other tasks.” Id. The commenter did not
quantify the costs of managing a pool of qualified securities or the costs of additional
staff to manage the securities portfolio.

678

Id.

195

noted, if a large broker-dealer needed to shift more of its reserve deposits into qualified
securities as opposed to cash, then these firms would most likely reallocate existing
functions to assist in ongoing maintenance activities, thus offsetting any costs associated
with the shift of reserve deposits into qualified securities. Finally, with the elimination of
the 50% excess net capital threshold in the rule as amended, most small and mid-sized
firms likely would not have ongoing costs, because under the final rules, all firms will
now only have to comply with the bank equity capital threshold, which as confirmed by
comments, would be of concern primarily for the large firms. Therefore, under the final
rule, broker-dealers should not incur significant operational or transactional costs in
complying with the amendment. 679
(IV). Compliance Cost Estimates
In the proposing release, in quantifying costs, the Commission estimated that, of
the 216 firms with reserve deposit requirements, only 11 broker-dealers would need to
open new bank accounts or substitute cash for qualified securities in an existing reserve
account, 680 and that this would result in an estimated total one-time cost of approximately
$2,630 per broker-dealer 681 and approximately $28,930 in the aggregate. 682 As noted
above, the Commission requested comment on the proposed cost estimates. Commenters
were asked to identify the metrics and sources of any empirical data that support their

The Commission estimated in the proposing release that it would take approximately 10
hours to implement these changes. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules,

cost estimates. The Commission received seven comment letters in response to the
proposed cost estimates. 683
One commenter stated that the estimate is inaccurate and arbitrary, and does not
take into account situations where a broker-dealer will need to establish numerous
banking relationships. 684 Commenters also stated that the Commission failed to consider
the ongoing costs of maintaining and monitoring multiple bank accounts. 685 One
commenter believes that limiting Rule 15c3-3 deposits at a single bank to 50% of a
broker-dealer’s excess net capital will require a significant number of broker-dealers to
open a number of additional cash and/or securities accounts and devote ongoing
operational resources to the management of such accounts. 686 This commenter stated that
at any one time, approximately 10% to 15% of broker-dealer customers could be
impacted by the proposed rule change and many of those customers would be required to
open accounts at multiple institutions.687
Commenters also stated that the proposed amendments would impose
requirements whose costs are not adequately justified by their benefits and that the
Commission substantially underestimated the costs. 688 One commenter noted that there
are significant costs associated with implementing the necessary changes to systems,
operations, and contractual agreements that the Commission did not appear to take into

account. 689 Another commenter stated that the proposal also fails to quantify the inherent
inefficiency of forcing broker-dealers to set up numerous bank accounts to satisfy the
restrictive broker-dealer net capital and bank equity capital requirements. 690 Another
commenter suggested that the Commission consider higher percentage limits for cash
deposits held at very large money center banks, stating that a higher percentage limit
would strike a better balance between the Commission’s concerns regarding the safety of
cash deposits and the substantial costs imposed on broker-dealers by overly restrictive
deposit limitations.691 Two commenters believed that the upfront and ongoing cost to
each broker-dealer is far higher than the one-time estimate of $2,630 that the Commission
estimated in the proposing release. 692 One commenter stated that conducting due
diligence and opening new accounts and the ongoing monitoring and periodic reevaluation of such additional accounts would require much more time than the 10 hours
originally estimated by the Commission.693 One commenter, referencing the SIFMA 2
Letter, stated that it agreed with SIFMA that the Commission significantly
underestimated the cost of the proposal to smaller firms. 694 Finally, commenters did not
provide the Commission with revised cost estimates or data related to these amendments.
In quantifying costs, the Commission is increasing its estimate of the number of
broker-dealers that will likely incur the cost of opening a new account at an unaffiliated
bank (or substituting cash for qualified securities in their reserve accounts) from the
estimated 11 broker-dealers in the proposing release to 50 broker-dealers, as described

diligence and opening new accounts would require much more time than the 10 hours
originally estimated by the Commission,696 the Commission also is increasing the onetime hour estimates discussed in the proposing release from 10 to 25 hours. 697 In
response to the commenters pointing that the amendments would require ongoing
monitoring of bank equity capital levels, 698 the Commission is including an annual cost
estimate in this release (in addition to the estimated one-time costs) to account for
incremental ongoing costs to monitor compliance with the rule. 699 The Commission
further estimates that the average cost per firm to make these changes will be
approximately $4,925 on a one-time basis and $12,675 on an annual basis. 700 For these
reasons, the Commission estimates that the total cost to broker-dealers will be
approximately $246,250 on a one-time basis and $633,750 on an annual basis. 701
Finally, using FOCUS Report data and top decile bank equity capital data at year
end 2011, 702 the Commission estimates that approximately 30 broker-dealers are no

The Commission estimates that the responsibility for the one-time opening a new reserve

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

estimates that the Senior Treasury/Cash Management Manager will spend approximately
25 hours performing these changes on a one-time basis.

698

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

699

The Commission estimates that the responsibility for the annual compliance review of
these rule amendments likely would be split between a Senior Treasury/Cash
Management Manager at $197 per hour and a Compliance Attorney at $310 per hour, and
will likely take 50 hours per year.

700

$197 per hour x 25 hours = $4,925; ($197 per hour x 25 hours) + ($310 x 25 hours) =
$12,675.

701

50 broker-dealers x $4,925 = $246,250; 50 broker-dealers x $12,675 = $633,750.

longer required to sustain the cost of maintaining multiple bank accounts, as a result of
removing the 50% excess net capital threshold and increasing the bank equity capital
threshold to 15%. This change to the final rule may result in potential cost savings to
broker-dealers, which may have been required to maintain multiple bank accounts under
the rule, as proposed.
c.

Allocation of Customers’ Fully Paid and Excess
Margin Securities to Short Positions

The amendment to paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 15c3-3 requires broker-dealers to
take prompt steps to obtain possession or control over fully paid and excess margin
securities on the broker-dealer’s books or records that allocate to a short position of the
broker-dealer or a short position for another person, excluding positions covered by
paragraph (m) of Rule 15c3-3, for more than 30 calendar days. 703 This amendment
protects broker-dealer customers by helping to ensure that customer securities are
available to be returned in the event of a broker-dealer failure. Therefore, in addition to
broker-dealer customers, the amendment benefits the SIPC fund to the extent that it
mitigates potential outlays from the fund to make advances to customers of a failed
broker-dealer that cannot return all customer securities.
The Commission requested comment on available metrics to quantify these
benefits and any other benefits a commenter may identify. In particular, the Commission
requested comment on whether there would be additional costs to broker-dealers as a
consequence of these proposals and whether these proposals would impose costs on other
market participants, including broker-dealer customers. The Commission also requested
that commenters identify sources of empirical data that could be used for the metrics they

703

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(d)(4).

200

proposed. The Commission received one comment in response to these requests. 704 The
commenter stated that the proposed amendments would “greatly increase the cost of
proprietary and customer short positions that were established and maintained in
accordance with all applicable short sale regulations at the time entered.” 705 However,
this commenter did not quantify its cost estimates in terms of dollars, nor did it provide
data to support its conclusion.
In response to this comment, modifications were made to the final rule that should
mitigate the commenter’s concern because the changes were designed to reduce
operational burdens and to more closely align the final rule with current regulations
related to short sales. More specifically, as discussed in section II.A.4., as adopted, final
paragraph (d)(4) of Rule 15c3-3 contains a uniform 30 calendar day period and clarifies
that the 30 calendar day period with respect to a syndicate short position established in
connection with an offering does not begin to run until the underwriter’s participation in
the distribution is complete as determined pursuant to Rule 100(b) of Regulation M. In
addition, the proposed amendment was designed to require that the aging process
commence at the time a deficit in securities allocating to a short position arises. These
modifications clarify the rule amendment, while continuing to strengthen customer
protections under Rule 15c3-3.
Three commenters argued that the credit item added to the reserve formula
computation when a customer’s fully paid or excess margin securities are allocated to a
short position provides the customer with adequate protection. 706 The Commission
considered this alternative, as well as the cost concerns raised above, in adopting these
704

201

final rule amendments. It has been a long-standing industry practice for carrying brokerdealers to use securities of PAB account holders in their business activities. In contrast,
as stated above in section II.A.4. of this release, customers under Rule 15c3-3, which
include the carrying broker-dealer’s retail customers, have an expectation that the fully
paid and excess margin securities reflected on their account statements are, in fact, in the
possession or control of the carrying broker-dealer. However, as described above, this
expectation may be frustrated where the securities are allocated to a short position carried
by the broker-dealer, as the securities are not in the possession or control of the carrying
broker-dealer. This gap in the existing rule, in effect, permits the broker-dealer to
partially monetize the Rule 15c3-3 customer’s securities. Also, under some
circumstances (e.g., a change in the market value of the securities), the amount the
broker-dealer may have on deposit in the reserve account as a consequence of the credit
item may be less than the value of the securities. Consequently, if the broker-dealer fails,
sufficient funds may not be readily available to purchase the securities to return them to
customers. The use of customer securities in this manner is contrary to the customer
protection goals of Rule 15c3-3 and the expectations of a broker-dealer’s customers. 707
Therefore, the Commission believes that any increased costs related to this final rule
amendment are justified by the enhancements to the customer protection goals of Rule
15c3-3. For these reasons, and those discussed throughout this release, the Commission
is adopting the amendment.
The Commission estimates this requirement will result in a one-time cost to firms
that carry customer securities to update systems for complying with the possession or
control requirements in Rule 15c3-3. Based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31,

707

See section II.A.1. of this release.

202

2011, the Commission estimates that approximately 287 broker-dealers carry customer
accounts. 708 The Commission further estimates these firms will spend, on average,
approximately 40 hours of employee resources per firm updating their systems to
implement changes that will be necessitated by the amendment. 709 Therefore, the
Commission estimates that the average cost per firm to make these changes will be
approximately $11,280. 710 The Commission estimates that the total one-time cost to
broker-dealers will be approximately $3,237,360. 711
In addition to systems costs, broker-dealers may incur other costs to comply with
the rule amendment because they may be required to change their existing practices. For
example, the amendment could result in some broker-dealers borrowing securities to
cover proprietary short positions rather than using customer securities, resulting in
increased borrowing costs. However, under the current baseline, when broker-dealers use
customer securities to cover short positions they are required to add a credit item in the
Rule 15c3-3 reserve formula equal to the value of the securities. This credit item can
result in higher reserve deposit requirements, which must be made using the brokerdealer’s own capital. Thus, in response to commenters concerns regarding the costs of
this amendments, 712 the increased costs associated with having to borrow securities to
cover a short position likely will be offset by decreased costs associated with devoting
capital to customer reserve requirements.
708

This is an update of the proposing release estimate of 350 broker-dealers. See
Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12881.

709

For the purposes of this cost analysis, the Commission estimates that this work will be
undertaken by a Senior Programmer at $282 per hour.

710

$282 per hour x 40 hours = $11,280.

711

287 broker-dealers x $11,280 = $3,237,360. In the proposing release, the Commission
estimated that the total one-time cost to broker-dealers would be $3,752,000. See

Importation of Rule 15c3-2 Requirements into
Rule 15c3-3

Today’s amendment to Rules 15c3-2 and 15c3-3 imports requirements in Rule
15c3-2 713 to Rule 15c3-3 and eliminates Rule 15c3-2 as a separate rule in the Code of
Federal Regulations. 714 Rule 15c3-2 requires a broker-dealer holding free credit balances
to provide its customers (defined as any person other than a broker-dealer) at least once
every three months with a statement of the amount due the customer and a notice that the
funds are not being segregated, but rather are being used in the broker-dealer’s business
and that the funds are payable on demand. The Commission believes it is appropriate to
eliminate Rule 15c3-2 because it is largely irrelevant in light of the requirements of Rule
15c3-3 (which was adopted after Rule 15c3-2).
This amendment will benefit broker-dealers by streamlining and consolidating
relevant provisions of Rule 15c3-2 into Rule 15c3-3, promoting efficiency in the
rulemaking process while not modifying the legal requirements. These provisions
include the requirements that broker-dealers inform customers of the amounts due to
them and that such amounts are payable on demand, which have been moved to new
paragraph (j)(1) of Rule 15c3-3. 715 Finally, the definition of customer for purposes of the
imported Rule 15c3-2 requirements will be the definition of customer in Rule 15c3-3, 716
which is somewhat narrower than the definition in Rule 15c3-2. The application of the

714

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12867.

715

The provisions in Rule 15c3-2 that are being re-codified in Rule 15c3-3, include the
requirements that broker-dealers inform customers of the amounts due to them and that
such amounts be payable on demand. In addition, Rule 15c3-2 contains an exemption for
broker-dealers that are also banking institutions supervised by a Federal authority. This
exemption will not be imported into Rule 15c3-3 because there are no broker-dealers that
fit within this exemption.

716

17 CFR 240.15c3-3(a)(1).

204

narrower definition of customer in Rule 15c3-3 should not increase related costs.
Alternatively, it may result in decreased costs because the narrowing of the rule’s scope
may reduce the compliance burden on broker-dealers.
The Commission considered reasonable alternatives with regard to the proposed
deletion of Rule 15c3-2 and the importation of certain requirements into paragraph (j)(1)
of Rule 15c3-3. Not adopting the rule amendment and thus leaving Rule 15c3-2 in the
Code of Federal Regulations was a considered alternative. The Commission, however,
believes consolidating the relevant provisions in Rule 15c3-3 is a more appropriate
alternative because it promotes efficiency in the rulemaking process, and streamlines the
Commission’s customer protection rules.
The amendments – because they only re-codify provisions of Rule 15c3-2 into
Rule 15c3-3 717 – should not be a new source of costs as compared to the baseline because
these provisions are continuations of existing requirements. However, the re-codification
and placement of these provisions into Rule 15c3-3 may cause broker-dealers to review
and update their existing procedures from time-to-time and, therefore, could result in
incremental costs. 718

Treatment of Free Credit Balances
(I).

Summary of Amendments

Today, the Commission is adopting the amendment to add new paragraph (j)(2) to
Rule 15c3-3 that prohibits a broker-dealer from converting, investing, or transferring to
another account or institution, free credit balances held in a customer’s account except as
provided in paragraphs (j)(2)(i) and (ii) of the rule. As adopted, the amendment defines a
717

See paragraph (j)(1) of Rule 15c3-3.

718

Based on the estimated hour burdens in section IV.D.5. of this release, there could be
one-time internal costs of $1,464,750 and annual internal costs of $585,900, if the review
and update is performed by a Compliance Attorney at $310 per hour.

Sweep Program as “a service provided by a broker or dealer where it offers to its
customer the option to automatically transfer free credit balances in the securities account
of the customer to either a money market mutual fund product as described in § 270.2a-7
of this chapter or an account at a bank whose deposits are insured by the Federal Deposit
Insurance Corporation.” 719
With regard to the treatment of free credit balances outside the context of a Sweep
Program, paragraph (j)(2)(i) of Rule 15c3-3 permits a broker-dealer to invest or transfer
to another account or institution free credit balances held in a customer’s account only
upon a specific order, authorization, or draft from the customer, and only in the manner,
and under the terms and conditions, specified in the order, authorization, or draft. 720 Two
commenters suggested that the proposal should be clarified to permit a broker-dealer to
obtain a one-time consent to ongoing transfers of any free credit balances to a customer
to another account, entity or product (outside of a Sweep Program). As discussed above,
this scenario was covered by the proposed rule and is being adopted under paragraph
(j)(2)(i) of Rule 15c3-3.
With regard to the treatment of free credit balances in the context of a Sweep
Program, new paragraph (j)(2)(ii) of Rule 15c3-3 requires broker-dealers to meet
conditions that vary depending on the date when a customer’s account was opened. For
accounts opened on or after the effective date of the rule, a broker-dealer must meet the
conditions of (j)(2)(ii)(A) and (B) of the rule. For any account, the broker-dealer must
meet the conditions in paragraphs (j)(2)(ii)(B) of the rule. Under paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A),
for accounts opened on or after the effective date of the rule, the amendment to Rule
15c3-3 requires a broker-dealer to obtain the written affirmative consent of a new
719

See paragraph (a)(17) of Rule 15c3-3.

206

customer to have free credit balances in the customer’s securities account included in the
Sweep Program. Under paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(B), a broker-dealer must comply with the
remaining three conditions for any account: (1) providing the customer with the
disclosures and notices regarding the Sweep Program required by each SRO of which the
broker-dealer is a member; (2) providing notice to the customer, as part of the customer’s
quarterly statement of account, that the balance in the bank deposit account or shares of
the money market mutual funds in which the customer has a beneficial interest can be
liquidated on the customer’s order and the proceeds returned to the securities account or
remitted to the customer; and (3) providing the customer written notice at least 30
calendar days before the broker-dealer makes certain changes to the Sweep Program and
describes the options available to the customer if the customer does not accept the new
terms and conditions or product. 721
Free credit balances constitute money that a broker-dealer owes its customers.
Customers may maintain these balances at the broker-dealer in anticipation of future
stock purchases. Under current practices, customer account agreements set forth how the
broker-dealer will invest these balances. For example, the broker-dealer may sweep them
into a money market fund or, alternatively, pay an amount of interest on the funds. On
occasion, broker-dealers may change the product to which a customer’s free credit
balances are swept – most frequently from a money market fund to an interest bearing
bank account. Because of differences in these two types of products, there may be
investment consequences when changing from one to the other. 722

721

See new paragraph (j)(ii)(B)(1)–(3) of Rule 15c3-3, as adopted.

722

Differences include the type of protection afforded the customer in the event of an
insolvency, and the amount of interest or dividends earned on the product. See
Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12866.

207

New paragraph (j)(2) to Rule 15c3-3 should serve to enhance customer protection
by prohibiting a broker-dealer from transforming the credit risk faced by a customer
through transfer of the broker-dealer’s obligation to another entity without the required
notice to, or approval from, the customer.
(II).

Baseline and Incremental Economic
Effects

In the absence of new paragraph (j)(2) of Rule 15c3-3, current practices represent
the existing baseline. As compared to the baseline, new paragraph (j)(2) to Rule 15c3-3
will enhance customer protection by requiring broker-dealers to obtain the written
affirmative consent of a new customer before including a customer’s free credit balances
in a Sweep Program, as well as to provide certain disclosures and notices to all customers
with regard to the broker-dealer’s Sweep Program. The Commission requested comment
on available metrics to quantify these benefits and any other benefits a commenter may
identify. The Commission did not receive any comments in response to this request.
Relative to the baseline, broker-dealers carrying free credit balances will incur
incremental one-time and periodic costs (e.g., systems changes, outside counsel, and
notification costs) to comply with new paragraph (j)(2) of Rule 15c3-3. The Commission
requested comment on whether there would be additional costs to broker-dealers as a
consequence of the proposals. The Commission also requested comment on whether the
proposals would impose costs on other market participants, including broker-dealer
customers. Commenters were requested to identify sources of empirical data that could
be used for the metrics they proposed. The Commission did not receive any comments in
response to these requests.

208

(III). Alternatives
As stated above in section II.A.5.ii. of this release, the Commission is adopting
new paragraph (j)(2) to Rule 15c3-3 with substantial modifications from the proposed
rule in response to comments and to clarify certain portions of the rule.
Commenters generally agreed with the fundamental principle embodied in the
proposal – that customer free credit balances should not be transferred from an obligation
of the broker-dealer to an obligation of another entity without the customer’s
authorization. 723 Other commenters supported the proposed disclosures but suggested
additional disclosures be made to customers including clarification with respect to other
protections available to the customer. 724 Two commenters stated that the practice of
sweep programs should be banned entirely or that the Commission should adopt a
“harder stance” and require more than just disclosure. 725 One commenter responded to
the Commission’s request for comment as to the cost burdens that would result if the first
condition (set forth in proposed paragraph (j)(2)(ii)(A)) to obtain a new customer’s prior
agreement were to be applied to existing customers. The commenter stated that such
costs would be substantial because broker-dealers would be required to amend their
agreements with all existing customers. 726 One commenter stated that the amendments in
the proposing release did not adequately address situations in which broker-dealers

723

See SIFMA 2 Letter; First Clearing Letter; Pace Letter.

724

See SIPC Letter.

725

See Ellis Letter; Dworkin Letter. One commenter stated that broker-dealers profit from
“excessive” fees charged to customers who opt out of the sweep programs. See Ellis
Letter. The second commenter suggested that the broker-dealer’s “customer has been
effectively denied the opportunity to opt out of bank account sweeps by [the brokerdealer] preventing him or her from utilizing any other vehicle to park his or her free
credit balances . . . .” See Dworkin Letter.

726

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

209

change customer account elections without first obtaining customer authorization. 727
Commenters also raised concerns about limitations on the types of products brokerdealers can use for sweep arrangements. 728
The Commission considered alternatives, including whether to adopt the
amendments and, in adopting the final rule, the Commission modified the language in the
final rule in response to commenters and to clarify its application. In response to
comments that the Commission should ban sweep programs or adopt a “harder stance,”
the Commission notes that sweep programs provide a mechanism for excess cash in a
customer’s securities account to be held in a manner that allows the customer to earn
interest on the funds but retain the flexibility to quickly access that cash to purchase
securities or withdraw it. 729 In effect, transferring this excess cash to a bank account or
money market fund is an alternative to retaining a credit balance in the customer’s
securities account. The final rule is intended to appropriately balance commenters’
concerns while providing broker-dealers with flexibility in the operation of sweep
programs. 730
In addition, in response to the comments that the Commission should not limit the
types of products broker-dealers can use for sweep accounts to money market funds and
bank deposit products, 731 as discussed above in section II.A.5.ii. of this release, the
Commission does not view sweep accounts as a mechanism for investing customers’
excess cash in longer term or more volatile assets without specific consent from

210

customers. Therefore, the Commission believes that it is not appropriate to modify the
final rule amendments to expand the permitted products for Sweep Programs.
In response to commenters’ concern regarding cost burdens resulting from the
application of the affirmative consent requirement to existing accounts, the final rule
retains the proposed requirement to require a broker-dealer to obtain a customer’s prior
affirmative consent for accounts opened on or after the effective date of the rule before
transferring the customer’s free credit balance to a product in the firm’s Sweep Program,
and makes explicit that the consent must be in writing. This will provide new customers
with the opportunity to evaluate the broker-dealer’s Sweep Program before consenting to
the transfer of the customer’s free credit balances into such program. In the proposing
release, the Commission requested comment as to the cost burdens that would result if
the condition to obtain a new customer’s prior agreement were to be applied to existing
customers. One commenter stated that such costs would be substantial because brokerdealers would be required to amend their agreements with existing customers. The
Commission considered this alternative and agrees with the commenter that requiring a
broker-dealer to amend its existing agreements with customers would be substantial.
Therefore, to address the burden that would have been associated with having brokerdealers re-paper existing account documentation, the prior affirmative consent
requirement will continue to apply only to accounts opened on or after the effective date
of the rule.
However, as discussed above in section II.A.5.ii. of this release, all customers will
be provided written notice at least 30 days before a broker-dealer changes certain terms
and conditions or products of its Sweep Program. This notice must also contain a
description of the options available to the customer if the customer does not accept the
new terms and conditions or product. This is intended to benefit new and existing

211

customers by giving them sufficient opportunity to make an informed decision and
evaluate the effects of changes in the terms and conditions or product of the sweep
program and the options available.
(IV). Compliance Cost Estimates
Broker-dealers will incur one-time and periodic costs to implement the changes
necessitated by the amendment. These changes include providing customers with the
disclosures and notices (including the description of the options available if a customer
does not accept the new terms or conditions or product) in order to have the flexibility to
change the treatment of customers’ free credit balances. This would require that brokerdealers update their systems (including processes for generating customer account
statements) to incorporate the necessary changes. 732 Additionally, broker-dealers may
incur one-time costs of outside counsel in implementing these system changes,
particularly with respect to the language in the disclosures and notices required by
paragraph (j)(2) of the rule.
The Commission further estimates that broker-dealers will incur costs to process
an affirmative consent for new customers. 733 Specifically, the Commission estimates that
broker-dealers may incur aggregate one-time and annual costs of approximately $14.4
million734 and $23.2 million, 735 respectively related to the changes necessitated by these
rule amendments. 736

732

The internal hours would likely be performed by a senior programmer. Therefore, the
estimated internal costs for this hour burden would be calculated as follows: Senior
Programmer at $282 per hours x 37,800 hours = $10,659,600. See section IV.D.6. of this
release.

733

The internal hours would likely be performed by a compliance clerk. Therefore, the
estimated internal costs for this hour burden would be calculated as follows: Compliance
Clerk at $63 per hour x 368,311 hours = $23,203,593. See section IV.D.6. of this release.

“Proprietary Accounts” under the Commodity
Exchange Act

Some broker-dealers also are registered as futures commission merchants under
the CEA. These firms carry both securities and commodities accounts for customers.
The definition of free credit balances in paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 does not include
funds carried in commodities accounts that are segregated in accordance with the
requirements of the CEA. 737 However, regulations promulgated under the CEA exclude
proprietary accounts from the CEA’s segregation requirements. 738 This exclusion from
the segregation requirements under the CEA has raised a question as to whether a brokerdealer must treat payables to customers in proprietary commodities accounts as “free
credit balances” when performing a customer reserve computation. 739 For these reasons,
the specific amendment to the definition of the term free credit balances in paragraph
(a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 clarifies that funds held in a commodities account meeting the
definition of a proprietary account under CEA regulations are not to be included as free
credit balances in the customer reserve formula.

In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that broker-dealers would incur onetime costs of approximately $3.68 million ($2.68 million internal costs and $1.0 million
for outside counsel) and annual costs of approximately $24.6 million. See Amendments
to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12882.

Rule 1.20 requires a futures commission merchant to segregate customer funds. See 17
CFR 1.20. Rule 1.3(k) defines the term customer for this purpose. See 17 CFR 1.3(k).
The definition of customer excludes persons who own or hold a proprietary account as
that term is defined in Rule 1.3(y). See 17 CFR 1.3(y). Generally, the definition of
proprietary account refers to persons who have an ownership interest in the futures
commission merchant. Id.

Rule 15c3-3a formula “to include the net balance due to customers in non-regulated
commodities accounts reduced by any deposits of cash or securities with any clearing
organization or clearing broker in connection with the open contracts in such accounts”).

213

One commenter requested that the Commission clarify that the relevant definition
of proprietary account for purposes of this amendment will be the definition contained in
17 CFR 1.3(y). 740 The Commission considered this alternative suggested by the
commenter. While Rule 1.3(y) under the CEA currently contains the relevant definition
of proprietary account for the purpose of the amendment, the definition could be codified
in a different rule in the future. Consequently, the Commission is adopting the final rule
amendment to paragraph (a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3, as proposed. Thus, the final rule does not
include specific references to a specific rule. Rather, the amendment to paragraph (a)(8)
to Rule 15c3-3, as adopted, more generally refers to a “proprietary account as that term is
defined in regulations under the Commodity Exchange Act.”
In addition, one commenter stated that, due to the changes to the swap markets
mandated by Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, swap accounts (in addition to commodities
accounts) are now subject to customer protection rules under the CEA. This commenter
suggested that the Commission make it clear that funds in swap accounts also do not
constitute free credit balances, whether those funds are required to be segregated by rules
under the CEA (e.g., cleared swap accounts or uncleared swap accounts that have opted
for segregation) or excepted from segregation under the CEA (e.g., cleared swaps
proprietary accounts or uncleared swap accounts that have not opted for segregation).
The commenter noted this treatment “would be consistent with the treatment of funds in
commodities accounts and with the regulation of swap accounts under the CEA.” 741 The
Commission agrees there may be additional accounts under the CEA, as amended by the
Dodd-Frank Act that should explicitly be excluded from the definition of free credit
balances under Rule 15c3-3. However, the amendments today are designed to clarify the
740

See SIFMA 2 Letter.

741

Id.

214

specific question raised with respect to the treatment of funds in proprietary commodities
accounts under the CEA and, consequently, the suggestions by this commenter are
beyond the scope of this rulemaking.
The Commission considered reasonable alternatives in adopting the final rule
amendment. These alternatives included adopting the proposed rule, with modifications
suggested by commenters described above, as well as leaving the current rule in place
without the amendments. The Commission believes that the adoption of the final rule is
the more appropriate approach at this time because the final rule amendment will benefit
broker-dealers that are registered as futures commission merchants by eliminating any
ambiguity with respect to such accounts and avoiding situations where they unnecessarily
increase reserve amounts.
The Commission does not anticipate that the amendments will result in any costs
to broker-dealers and, as funds in certain commodities accounts are not protected under
SIPA, will not expose the SIPC fund to increased liabilities. Because this amendment is
intended to be a clarification of existing interpretations, broker-dealers are not expected
to incur additional costs against the baseline of current Rule 15c3-3 and its existing
interpretations. This clarification is designed to provide broker-dealers with more
certainty as to the Commission’s stated legal requirements.

Consideration of Burden on Competition, and
Promotion of Efficiency, Competition, and Capital

215

positions, 744 the treatment of free credit balances, 745 and the clarification of the treatment
of proprietary accounts under the CEA are designed to protect and preserve customer
property held at broker-dealers. 746 These protections are primarily intended to reduce the
risks borne by investors.
In particular, first, the final rule amendment on PAB accounts is intended to fill a
gap in the definition of customer between Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA, reducing the risk that
customers could face losses in the case of a liquidation of a carrying broker-dealer. The
final rule codifies many of the provisions of the PAIB Letter. The Commission believes
that it is prudent, and will provide greater regulatory clarity, to incorporate into Rule
15c3-3 specified provisions of the PAIB Letter. Further, the Commission understands
that the relief in the PAIB Letter has been widely, if not universally, utilized by brokerdealers that carry customer accounts. Thus, the benefits associated with codifying
specified provisions of the PAIB Letter will continue to provide SIPA customers with the
protections currently provided by broker-dealers complying with the PAIB Letter.
Setting forth these requirements in a Commission rule will benefit the securities markets
by helping to diminish the risks and incidences of non-compliance.
Second, the final rule amendments regarding the banks where reserve deposits
may be held are intended to protect customers’ cash deposits by mitigating the risk that
the funds in the customer reserve account will not be readily available to be withdrawn
by the broker-dealer.
Third, the final rule amendments regarding the allocation of customers’ fully paid
and excess margin securities to a broker-dealer short position are designed to enhance the
744

745

See section II.A.5.ii. of this release.

746

See section II.A.6.i. of this release.

216

customer protection goals of Rule 15c3-3, which seek to ensure that broker-dealers do not
use customer assets for proprietary activities.
Fourth, the final rule amendments regarding the importation of Rule 15c3-2
requirements into paragraph (j)(1) of Rule 15c3-3 and the elimination of Rule 15c3-2
streamline the regulatory requirements for broker-dealers. Also, the addition of new
paragraph (j)(2) to Rule 15c3-3 is intended to protect a customer’s free credit balances
from being swept to products or programs without the appropriate approval, notice or
disclosure.
Fifth, the final rule amendment establishing that the funds in certain commodities
accounts need not be treated as free credit balances or other credit balances may enhance
efficiency at the broker-dealers by freeing up cash that may have been required to be
deposited into a broker-dealer’s customer reserve account, and clarifying an ambiguity in
Rule 15c3-3.
By strengthening requirements designed to protect customer assets, these
amendments will mitigate potential exposure to the SIPC fund that is used to make
advances to customers whose securities or cash are unable to be returned by a failed
broker-dealer. To the extent that the amendments to Rule 15c3-3 achieve this goal,
investors might be more willing to transact business in securities with broker-dealers.
The possible positive effects on investor participation in the securities markets may
promote capital formation as investor assets are able to be allocated more efficiently
across the opportunity set.
As discussed above, the Commission recognizes that the amendments to Rule
15c3-3 adopted today may impose certain costs on broker-dealers that might place a
burden on competition among broker-dealers. However, the Commission is of the
opinion that these costs are justified by the significant benefits described in this

217

economic analysis, as well as in the discussion of the rule amendments above.
Amendments to Rule 15c3-3 should not place a burden on competition for non-carrying
broker-dealers, which are generally small broker-dealers, because the amendments
primarily affect broker-dealers that perform PAB and customer reserve computations,
carry customer accounts, and carry free credit balances. In addition, for those carrying
broker-dealers that already follow the PAIB Letter, any difference from the baseline
with regard to cost burdens should be marginal. In sum, the costs of compliance
resulting from the requirements in the amendments to Rule 15c3-3 should not impose a
burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the
Exchange Act in light of the benefits discussed above.

Holding Futures Positions in a Securities Portfolio Margining
Account
i.

Economic Analysis

As discussed in section II.B. of this release, the Commission is adopting
amendments to Rule 15c3-3 to accommodate futures positions in a securities account that
is margined on a portfolio basis. The amendments revise the definition of free credit
balances and other credit balances in paragraphs (a)(8) and (a)(9) of Rule 15c3-3,
respectively, by expanding these definitions to include funds in a portfolio margin
account relating to certain futures and futures options positions. Consequently, as part of
free credit balances and other credit balances, these funds will be included as a credit
item on the credit side of the customer reserve formula. The Commission is also
adopting, as proposed, an amendment to Rule 15c3-3a Item 14 that permits a brokerdealer to include as a debit item, on the debit side of the customer reserve formula, the
amount of customer margin required and on deposit at a derivatives clearing organization
related to futures positions carried in a portfolio margin account.

218

The amendments are designed to provide greater protection to customers with
portfolio margin accounts, through the reserve requirements of Rule 15c3-3 and SIPA, by
requiring a broker-dealer to include all cash balances (including portfolio margin cash
balances) of its customers’ securities accounts in the computation of the customer
reserve. The customer reserve computation under Rule 15c3-3 is designed to ensure that
the funds a broker-dealer owes to customers are available to be returned to customers in
the event the broker-dealer fails.
Subsequent to the Commission’s proposals, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the
definitions of customer, customer property, and net equity in section 16 of SIPA to take
into account futures and options on futures held in a portfolio margin account carried as
a securities account pursuant to a Commission-approved portfolio margining program. 747
As a result, persons who hold futures positions in a portfolio margining account carried
as a securities account are now entitled to SIPA protection.
While the Dodd-Frank Act addressed the protection under SIPA of futures and
futures options held in a securities portfolio margin account, the Commission’s
amendments to Rule 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a will still serve an important purpose. In
particular, they complement the Dodd-Frank SIPA amendments, and will provide
additional protections to customers by requiring broker-dealers to treat these futures
positions in accordance with the segregation requirements in Rules 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a.
Consequently, the Commission is adopting the amendments with modifications to
address, in part, comments. As noted above, the requirements of Rule 15c3-3 and Rule
15c3-3a are designed to enable the prompt return of customer securities and cash in the
event the broker-dealer falls into financial difficulty or becomes insolvent. The goal is to

747

See Pub. L. No. 111–203 § 983.

219

place a broker-dealer in a position where it is able to wind down in an orderly selfliquidation without the need for financial assistance from SIPC.
The Commission received six comments on the proposed amendments. 748 Three
commenters generally supported the amendments. 749 One commenter supported the
development of rules for portfolio margining and the Commission’s effort to provide
greater legal certainty regarding the SIPA treatment of futures positions in a portfolio
margin account. 750 This commenter, however, in a subsequent comment letter, stated that
this amendment is no longer necessary in light of the Dodd-Frank Act amendments, and
recommended that the Commission withdraw it. 751 Another commenter stated that the
Commission’s proposal is premature in that the inclusion of futures in a portfolio margin
account, which is a securities account, would conflict with the segregation provisions
under the CEA 752 and that SIPC has not determined that protection should be extended to
futures. 753 Commenting in 2007 before the adoption of the Dodd-Frank Act, SIPC stated
that the proposed rules seek to extend SIPC protection to all positions in the portfolio
margin account, irrespective of whether the positions are securities under SIPA or are on
deposit in connection with a securities transaction. 754

See, e.g., 17 CFR 1.20-1.29.

753

See CME Letter; see also SIPC Letter (expressing “grave concerns” about potential
conflict between the proposed amendments and SIPA).

754

See SIPC Letter. SIPC also urged the Commission to reconsider its adoption of the
portfolio margin proposals, stating that if the changes are in order, the Commission
should seek to have them made by legislative amendment and not rulemaking.

220

The Commission agrees, in part, with the commenter who stated that the DoddFrank Act SIPA amendments make the Commission’s proposed amendments to Rules
15c3-3 and 15c3-3a unnecessary. 755 As noted above, the definitions of customer,
customer property, and net equity in section 16 of SIPA were amended by the DoddFrank Act to take into account futures and options on futures held in a portfolio margin
account carried as a securities account pursuant to a Commission-approved portfolio
margining program. 756 Consequently, in a proceeding under SIPA, futures and options
on futures positions held in a portfolio margin account carried as a securities account
would be included in determining a customer’s net equity claim. 757 Therefore, the
proposed amendment relating to the unrealized value of a futures option is not necessary
to achieve the objective of providing SIPA protection for such positions. As a result, the
Commission is modifying the final rule to delete the proposed language in paragraph
(a)(8) of Rule 15c3-3 that would have treated the unrealized value of a futures option in a
portfolio margin account on the filing date of a SIPA proceeding as a free credit balance
for purposes of Rule 15c3-3. 758

755

See SIFMA 4 Letter.

756

See Pub. L. No. 111–203 § 983.

757

Under the Dodd-Frank Act SIPA amendments, a customer’s net equity now includes all
positions in futures contracts and options on futures contracts held in a portfolio
margining account carried as a securities account pursuant to a portfolio margining
program approved by the Commission, including all property collateralizing such
positions, to the extent that such property is not otherwise included herein. See 15 U.S.C.
§ 78lll(11)(A)(ii). Further, the amendments provided that a claim for a commodity
futures contract received, acquired, or held in a portfolio margining account pursuant to a
portfolio margining program approved by the Commission or a claim for a security
futures contract, shall be deemed to be a claim with respect to such contract as of the
filing date, and such claim shall be treated as a claim for cash. See 15 U.S.C. § 78lll(11).

758

Specifically, the final rule does not include the proposed language: “, and, in the event the
broker-dealer is the subject of a proceeding under SIPA, the market value as of the “filing
date” as that term is defined in SIPA (15 U.S.C. 78lll(7)) of any long options on futures
contracts.”

221

While the legislation provides additional certainty with respect to how futures in a
portfolio margin account would be treated in a SIPA liquidation, the Commission’s
amendments will require that positions are subject to the protections of Rule 15c3-3, thus
enhancing customer protection. Therefore, while the Commission has considered the
suggested alternatives in developing the final rule amendments (including not adopting
the amendments), the Commission has determined that adopting the portfolio margining
amendments was a more appropriate approach in furtherance of enhancing customer
protection.
The Commission requested comment on available metrics to quantify these
benefits and any other benefits a commenter may identify, including the identification of
sources of empirical data that could be used for such metrics. The Commission did not
receive any comments in response to these requests.
Current SRO portfolio margin rules permit futures to be held in a securities
portfolio margin account. 759 However, pending further regulatory action by the
Commission and the CFTC, the ability to combine securities and futures products into a
single portfolio margin account will be unavailable. 760 Therefore, under the current
baseline of SRO portfolio margin rules, with the inclusion of only securities positions in
the securities account, this amendment would have no effect as compared to the baseline

759

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 4210.

760

See Section 713 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 713 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the
Exchange Act and CEA to facilitate portfolio margining by allowing cash and securities
to be held in a futures account and futures and options on futures and related collateral to
be held in a securities account by a dually-registered broker-dealer and futures
commission merchant pursuant to an approved portfolio margin program, subject to
certain requirements, including regulatory action by the Commission and CFTC
(pursuant to an exemption, or by rule or regulation). See generally, A Joint Report of the
SEC and the CFTC on Harmonization of Regulation (Oct. 19, 2009).

222

until the Commission and CFTC take such further action with respect to portfolio
margining. 761
The requirements imposed by the portfolio margin amendments will be elective.
The requirements will apply only to broker-dealers choosing to offer their customers
portfolio margin accounts. The Commission estimates that approximately 35 brokerdealers will elect to offer their customers portfolio margin accounts that will include
futures and futures options. 762 The amendment to the definition of free credit balances in
Rule 15c3-3 will require broker-dealers to include in the reserve formula credit balances
related to futures positions in a portfolio margin account. The amendment to Rule 15c33a Item 14 in the reserve formula will enable broker-dealers to include as a debit item the
amount of customer margin required and on deposit at a derivatives clearing
organization. Accordingly, these amendments will require changes to the systems
broker-dealers use to compute and account for their reserve requirements. Consistent
with the proposing release, 763 the Commission assumes that the responsibility for
updating these systems will be undertaken by a Senior Programmer. 764 Therefore, the
Commission estimates that the program and systems changes would result, on average, in

761

See generally, A Joint Report of the SEC and the CFTC on Harmonization of Regulation
(Oct. 19, 2009).

762

This estimate is based on OCUS Report data. This is an update from the estimate in the
proposing release of 33 broker-dealers. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility
Rules, 72 FR at 12883.

763

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12883.

764

The SIFMA 2012 Report as Modified indicates the average hourly cost of this position is
approximately $282. Consistent with the proposing release, the Commission estimates
the Senior Programmer will spend approximately 130 hours modifying software to
conform it to the requirements of the amendments. See Amendments to Financial
Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12883.

223

a one-time cost of approximately $36,660 per broker-dealer. 765 Thus, the Commission
estimates the total one-time cost to broker-dealers will be approximately $1,283,100. 766
The Commission requested comment on the proposed cost estimates. In
particular, the Commission requested comment on additional costs to broker-dealers that
would arise from the proposals, such as system costs in addition to those discussed above
(e.g., costs associated with purchasing new software and updates to existing software).
The Commission also requested comment on whether these proposals would impose
costs on other market participants, including broker-dealer customers. Commenters were
asked to identify the metrics and sources of any empirical data that supported their costs
estimates. The Commission did not receive any comments in response to these requests.
ii.

Consideration of Burden on Competition, and
Promotion of Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation

The final rule amendments to Rule 15c3-3 to accommodate futures positions in a
securities account margined on a portfolio basis 767 should complement the Congressional
amendments and provide additional protections to portfolio margin customers through the
strengthened reserve requirements of Rule 15c3-3. These additional protections may
reduce the risk of loss of collateral to securities customers, promote participation in the
securities markets, and enhance competition and price discovery. Moreover, these
additional protections may make portfolio margining more attractive to investors.
Portfolio margining may significantly reduce customer margin requirements by offsetting
765

130 hours x $282 = $36,660. In the proposing release, the Commission estimated this
cost would be $34,840. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at
12883.

766

35 broker-dealers x $36,660 = $1,283,100. In the proposing release, the Commission
estimated this cost would be $1,149,720. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility
Rules, 72 FR at 12883.

767

See section II.B. of this release.

224

positions involving securities and futures products, which in turn reduces the costs of
trading such products and enhances efficiency. Portfolio margining may also promote
better price discovery across securities and futures products by allowing customers to
offset a position assumed in one market with a product traded in another market. The
enhanced efficiencies as a result of increases in the use of portfolio margin accounts may
facilitate capital formation through the availability of additional capital for customers as a
result of reduced margin costs.
While today’s amendments promote efficiency within the securities markets, the
increased costs associated with the rule amendments may impose a burden on
competition among broker-dealers. However, the Commission is of the opinion that
these costs are justified by the significant benefits described in this economic analysis. In
sum, the costs of compliance resulting from the requirements in the portfolio margining
amendments to Rule 15c3-3 should not impose a burden on competition not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act in light of the benefits
discussed above.
3.

Amendments With Respect to Securities Lending and
Borrowing and Repurchase/Reverse Repurchase Transactions
i.

Economic Analysis

The Commission is adopting amendments to Rules 15c3-1 and 17a-11 to
strengthen the financial responsibility of broker-dealers engaging in a securities lending
business. First, the amendment to subparagraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1 clarifies
that broker-dealers providing securities lending and borrowing settlement services are
deemed, for purposes of the rule, to be acting as principals and are subject to applicable
capital deductions. Under the amendment, these deductions could be avoided if a brokerdealer takes certain steps to disclaim principal liability. Second, the amendment to

225

paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-11 requires a broker-dealer to: (1) file a notice with the
Commission and its DEA whenever the total money payable against all securities loaned,
subject to a reverse repurchase agreement or the contract value of all securities borrowed
or subject to a repurchase agreement exceeds 2,500% of tentative net capital; or,
alternatively, (2) report monthly its securities lending and repurchase activities to its
DEA in a form acceptable to its DEA.
Both amendments are intended to strengthen the financial responsibility of
broker-dealers engaged in a securities lending or repurchase business. The first
amendment to subparagraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1 will help eliminate the legal
uncertainty among counterparties as to the role played by broker-dealers in such
transactions and clarify the nature of the services that securities lending intermediaries
provide their counterparties.
Thus, a broker-dealer will be considered a principal unless the broker-dealer has
disclosed the identity of each party to the other, and the parties have agreed in writing
that the obligations of the broker-dealer do not include a guarantee of performance by the
other party and that in the event of default, neither party shall have the right of setoff
against the obligations, if any, of the broker-dealer. In addition, this amendment will help
avoid ambiguity regarding the applicability to a particular broker-dealer of the stock loan
charges in the net capital rule.
In response to comments that standard legal documents currently used in
securities lending transactions provide sufficient legal certainty with respect to the status
of the parties, 768 the Commission considered whether to adopt the proposed approach or
whether to rely on existing industry practice. The Commission considered the

768

See section II.C. of this release. See also SIFMA 2 Letter; Citigroup Letter.

226

alternatives and believes that the rule as adopted appropriately balances the commenters’
objections to the proposal with the Commission’s concerns about stock lending practices,
particularly with regard to the failure of MJK. 769 In recognition of standard stock loan
agreement templates, the Commission designed the amendment to accommodate the
continued use of these industry model agreements by incorporating their use into the
rule’s requirements.
The second amendment to paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-11 will help identify
broker-dealers with highly leveraged non-government securities lending and borrowing
and repo activity. 770 This new provision requires that a broker-dealer notify the
Commission whenever the total amount of money payable against all securities loaned or
subject to a repurchase agreement, or the total contract value of all securities borrowed or
subject to a reverse repurchase agreement exceeds 2,500% of tentative net capital;
provided that, for purposes of this leverage threshold, transactions involving government
securities, as defined in Section 3(a)(42) of the Exchange Act, are excluded from the
calculation. 771 The notice provision is designed to alert regulators to a sudden increase in
a broker-dealer’s stock loan and repo positions, which could indicate that the brokerdealer is taking on new or additional risk that it may have limited experience or increased
difficulty in managing. This amendment will assist securities regulators in monitoring
such activities and responding to situations where a broker-dealer experiences financial
difficulty due to a large securities lending or repo position. This may help prevent

769

See section II.C. of this release.

770

17 CFR 240.17a-11(c)(5).

771

15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(42). Government securities generally present less market risk than
other types of securities used in securities lending and repo transactions. Consequently,
they are excluded from the scope of this rule.

227

significant losses to the broker-dealer’s customers and other broker-dealers, and reduce
systemic financial risk.
As adopted, new paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-11 also permits a broker-dealer to
report monthly its stock loan and repo activity to its DEA in a form acceptable to its DEA
in lieu of the notices required by paragraph (c)(5). This approach will provide each DEA
with the flexibility to prescribe how the monthly reports are to be made and will
accommodate a DEA that opts to use the FOCUS report as the reporting mechanism. 772
This provision will also accommodate large broker-dealers that are active in this business
and regularly maintain stock loan and repo balances that exceed the threshold. The
Commission expects that these broker-dealers have experience in managing the risks
associated with these types of transactions and have established controls to address those
risks. Consequently, notice under Rule 17a-11 from these broker-dealers will not be as
useful to regulators. On the other hand, the monthly reports will provide securities
regulators with information useful, for example, to develop trend analysis, if deemed
appropriate. This analysis can be used to identify leverage levels that are outside the
normal trend range and that may be indicative of a material change in the firm’s business
model (e.g., taking on higher levels of leverage, branching into new products, or
experiencing operational or financial difficulties).
The Commission requested comment on available metrics to quantify these
benefits and any other benefits a commenter may identify. Commenters were requested
to identify sources of empirical data that could be used for the metrics they propose. The
Commission did not receive any comments in response to these requests.
772

As proposed, the amendment to Rule 17a-11 would have provided that a broker-dealer
that submitted a monthly report of its stock loan and repo activity to its DEA not be
required to file the Rule 17a-11 notices required by paragraph (c)(5). See Amendments
to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12870.

The Commission expects that broker-dealers may incur costs related to the
implementation of the rule amendments. Using current Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 17a-11 as a
baseline, the Commission expects that some broker-dealers may incur costs in connection
with the implementation of these rule amendments.
With regard to the amendment to subparagraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1, the
Commission understands that most existing standard securities lending master
agreements in use today already contain language requiring agent lenders to disclose
principals and for principals to agree not to hold the agents liable for a counterparty
default. Thus, the standard agreement used by the vast majority of broker-dealers should
contain the representations and disclosures required by the proposed amendment.
However, a small percentage of broker-dealers may need to modify their standard
agreements. The Commission estimates that the total one-time cost to broker-dealers for
this change will be approximately $45,480. 773
The Commission requested comment on the cost estimates. In particular, the
Commission requested comment on additional costs to broker-dealers that would arise
from the proposals, such as costs arising from making systems changes. The
Commission also requested comment on whether these proposals would impose costs on
other market participants, including broker-dealer customers. Commenters were also
asked to identify the metrics and sources of any empirical data that support their costs
estimates. The Commission did not receive any comments in response to these requests.
With regard to the amendment to Rule 17a-11, the Commission received several
suggested alternatives from commenters which contributed to the modification of the
773

In the proposing release, the Commission estimated that the total one-time cost to brokerdealers would be approximately $62,604. See Amendments to Financial Responsibility
Rules, 72 FR at 12884. The internal hours would likely be performed by an in-house
Attorney at $379 per hour, resulting in the estimated internal cost calculated as follows:
120 hours at $379 per hour = $45,480. See section IV.D.1. of this release.

229

final rule from the proposal. Three commenters addressed the proposed monthly
notification requirement. They stated that the monthly report in lieu of the notification
should be provided as part of the monthly FOCUS report many broker-dealers file with
their DEA. 774 The Commission agrees that the FOCUS report may be an appropriate
mechanism for reporting stock loan and repo positions in lieu of the proposed monthly
notification requirement. 775 Consequently, the Commission modified the final rule
amendment to delete the phrase “submits a monthly report of” and replace it with the
phrase “reports monthly.” In addition, as adopted, in order to provide that the monthly
report shall be sent to a broker-dealer’s DEA, the Commission added the phrase “to its
designated examining authority in a form acceptable” before “to its designated examining
authority.” This approach, as adopted, is intended to provide each DEA with the
flexibility to tailor the reporting requirements.
Based on FOCUS Report data, the Commission estimates that approximately one
notice per year will be sent pursuant to this amendment. 776 Therefore, approximately one
broker-dealer per year will incur costs to prepare and send the notice. 777 Consequently,
the Commission estimates that the costs to broker-dealers associated with this
requirement will be de minimis.

774

See Abbey National Letter; Citigroup Letter; SIFMA 2 Letter.

775

Carrying broker-dealers are generally required to submit FOCUS reports on a monthly
basis.

776

This estimate is derived from FOCUS Report data, and adjusted based on staff
experience. This estimate has been updated from the proposing release estimate of 11.
No comments were received on this estimate.

777

The internal hours would likely be performed by junior stock loan manager for 10
minutes at $134 per hour x 1 notice = $22.33. See section IV.D.8. of this release.

230

In addition, the Commission estimates that six broker-dealers will choose the
option of reporting monthly778 and will incur a one-time cost to update their systems to
generate the information for the report. 779 The Commission also estimates that these
broker-dealers will incur annual costs generating and filing the monthly reports or
preparing the information to include in monthly FOCUS Reports (as applicable). 780
Therefore, the Commission estimates that the total one-time cost and annual costs to
broker-dealers will be approximately $169,200 781 and $9,648 782 respectively. The
Commission’s total one-time and annual cost estimates have decreased from the
proposing release primarily due to an overall decrease in the number of broker-dealers.
As noted above, the Commission requested comment on the proposed cost
estimates. In particular, the Commission requested comment on additional costs to
broker-dealers that would arise from the proposals. The Commission also requested
comment on whether these proposals would impose costs on other market participants,
including market participants active in the securities lending and repurchase markets.
Commenters were asked to identify the metrics and sources of any empirical data that

The internal hours would likely be performed by a senior programmer. Therefore, the
estimated internal costs for this hour burden would be calculated as follows: Senior
Programmer for 100 hours at $282 per hour = $28,200. See section IV.D.8. of this
release. This is an update from the proposing release estimate of $26,800. See
Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12884.

780

The internal hours would likely be performed by a junior stock loan manager. Therefore,
the estimated internal costs for this hour burden would be calculated as follows: Junior
Stock Loan Manager for 12 hours at $134 per hour = $1,608. See section IV.D.8. of this
release. This is an update from the proposing release estimate of $2,496 per firm. See
Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12884.

response to these requests.
ii.

Consideration of Burden on Competition, and
Promotion of Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation

As described above, the amendment to subparagraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-1
and new paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-11 are designed to address two areas of concern
that emerged from the Commission’s experience with the failure of MJK. 783 First,
broker-dealers with principal liability in a stock loan transaction may be deemed to be
acting in an agency capacity and therefore not taking appropriate capital charges.
Second, broker-dealers that historically have not been very active in stock loan activities
may rapidly expand their balance sheets and increase leverage to a level that poses
significant financial risk to the firm and counterparties. Either potential event could
result in significant, adverse consequences for customers and counterparties of the
broker-dealer. For the customers, the fact that the broker-dealer could avoid taking
appropriate capital charges would imperil the broker-dealer’s ability to self-liquidate,
thereby impeding the ability of customers to be promptly paid in full. For the
counterparties, the fact that the broker-dealer could rapidly escalate its leverage increases
the likelihood that the broker-dealer could fail and its counterparties could experience,
losses of value associated with the rapid unwinding of positions with the failing brokerdealer.
Overall, the amendments to Rule 15c3-1 and Rule 17a-11 will help enhance the
monitoring of securities lending or repurchase activities by securities regulators, thereby
reducing the effect on customers and counterparties of the potential impact of a financial

783

See section II.C. of this release.

232

collapse of the broker-dealer. 784 This will strengthen the securities markets and make
them more attractive to investors, thereby enhancing efficiency and capital formation.
Moreover, the language in the final rule that provides each DEA with the flexibility to
prescribe how the monthly reports are to be made may enhance efficiencies for brokerdealers by providing the ability for a DEA to tailor the reporting requirements. Finally,
the costs of compliance with the amendments to Rules 15c3-1 and 17a-11 should not
impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in the furtherance of the
purposes of the Exchange Act in light of the benefits discussed above.
4.

Documentation of Risk Management Procedures
i.

Economic Analysis

As discussed in section II.D. of this release, the Commission is adopting new
paragraph (a)(23) to Rule 17a-3 to require certain broker-dealers to make and keep
current a record documenting the credit, market, and liquidity risk management controls
established and maintained by certain broker-dealers to assist them in analyzing and
managing the risks associated with their business activities, including, for example,
securities lending and repo transactions, OTC derivative transactions, proprietary trading,
and margin lending. 785 The amendment will apply only to broker-dealers that have more
than $1,000,000 in aggregate credit items as computed under the customer reserve
formula of Rule 15c3-3, or $20,000,000 in capital including debt subordinated in
accordance with Appendix D to Rule 15c3-1.
These amendments require large broker-dealers to document the controls they
have implemented to address the risks they face as a result of their business activities. As
proposed, the amendment would have required a broker-dealer to create a record
784

Id.

785

17 CFR 240.17a-3(a)(23).

233

documenting its “internal risk management controls,” rather than its market, credit, and
liquidity risk controls. Commenters generally raised concerns with the proposed
amendment stating, for example, that the proposed documentation of internal
management controls over risks arising from the broker-dealer’s business activities was
overly broad and ambiguous. 786 The Commission considered the proposed approach and,
as discussed above, in part in response to comments, the Commission narrowed the
application of the amendment so that the final rule now requires the documentation of
internal risk management controls established to manage market, credit, and liquidity
risk. 787 The final rule benefits firms and their customers by mitigating the risk of losses
associated with a firm’s normal activities, while at the same time placing an increased
recordkeeping burden on broker-dealers by requiring them to document certain risks in
writing.
A well-documented system of internal controls designed to manage material risk
exposures related to market, credit, and liquidity risk reflects the expectations of a firm’s
management as to how its business activities should be conducted in light of such
exposures. Written risk management procedures enable management to better identify,
analyze, and manage the risks inherent in the firm’s business activities with a view to
preventing material losses and to review whether the firm’s activities are being conducted
in a manner that is consistent with such procedures and controls. This will likely benefit
market participants and reduce systemic financial risk.
In addition, by making the documented controls a required record under Rule 17a3, a broker-dealer’s regulator likely will have better access to them, as this benefit will
only be realized to the extent that a broker-dealer has existing market, credit, and
786

See E*Trade Letter; Citigroup Letter.

787

See section II.D. of this release.

234

liquidity risk management controls in place because the rule does not specify the type of
controls a broker-dealer must establish to manage these risks. It simply requires
documentation of the procedures that the broker-dealer has established. The final rule
amendment will require any such records of the market, credit, and liquidity risk
management controls to be available to the broker-dealer’s regulators so that they can
review whether the broker-dealer is adhering to these controls.
The Commission requested comment on available metrics to quantify these
benefits and any other benefits a commenter may identify. Commenters were requested
to identify sources of empirical data that could be used for the metrics they proposed.
The Commission did not receive any comments in response to these requests.
These amendments apply to a limited number of broker-dealers, namely, those
firms with more than $1 million in customer credits or $20 million in capital and amend
recordkeeping requirements in Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4. Therefore, against the existing
baseline of these current rules, the Commission expects that the requirement will result in
a one-time cost to some of these firms to the extent that they have established controls
that have not been documented. However, since most firms are expected to be already
compliant, the incremental costs are expected to be small. For example, broker-dealers
that are approved to compute capital using internal models are already subject to Rule
15c3-4, which requires these firms to establish, document, and maintain a system of
internal risk controls to assist them in managing the risks associated with its business
activities, including market, credit, leverage, liquidity, legal, and operational risks. 788

788

17 CFR 240.15c3-4; 17 CFR 240.15c3-1(a)(7)(iii). Based on staff experience monitoring
broker-dealer risk management procedures, the internal hours would likely be
coordinated by a broker-dealer’s in-house attorney (19,600 hours), working with
operation specialists (24,500 hours), and overseen by an associate general counsel (4,900
hours). Therefore, the estimated internal costs for this hour burden would be calculated
as follows: [(Attorney for 19,600 hours at $379 per hour) + (Operations Specialist for

235

These firms would most likely incur no or minimal costs to comply with the final rule. In
addition, this rule amendment does not mandate any specific control, procedure, or policy
be established; rather, the Commission is requiring that a control, procedure, or policy be
documented if it is in place. For these reasons, the Commission estimates that the onetime hourly burden to meet the requirements of these rules will range from zero hours for
some firms to hundreds of hours for other firms. Taking this into account, the
Commission estimates that the total one-time cost to broker-dealers to document controls
in compliance with this amendment will be approximately $13,783,700. 789 The
Commission also estimates that the annual cost to broker-dealers to ensure compliance
with the amendment to Rule 17a-3 will be approximately $8,356,950. 790
As noted above, the Commission requested comment on the proposed cost
estimates. In particular, the Commission requested comment on additional costs to
broker-dealers that would arise from the proposals, such as costs arising from making
changes to systems and costs associated with maintaining these records. The
Commission also requested comment on whether the proposals would impose costs on
other market participants, including broker-dealer customers. Commenters were also
asked to identify the metrics and sources of any empirical data that support their cost
estimates. The Commission did not receive any comments in response to these requests.

24,500 hours at $126 per hour) + (Associate General Counsel for 4,900 hours at $467) =
$12,803,700. Broker-dealers are also expected to incur one-time outside counsel costs of
$980,000 for a total one-time cost of $13,783,700. See section IV.D.7. of this release.
789

See section IV.D.7. of this release. In the proposing release, the Commission
estimated this cost would be approximately $14,201,990. See Amendments to
Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12885.

790

The internal hours would likely be performed by a broker-dealer’s in-house
attorney. Therefore, the estimated internal costs for this hour burden would be
calculated as follows: Attorney at $379 per hour x 22,050 hours = $8,356,950. See
section IV.D.7. of this release.

236

ii.

Consideration of Burden on Competition, and
Promotion of Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation

The amendments to Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 require firms to document their
market, credit, and liquidity risk management controls. The amendments will help
strengthen broker-dealer internal controls. Documenting internal controls will encourage
enhanced consideration of, and thus a firmer grasp upon, the risks attendant to a brokerdealer’s business activities. This is designed to reduce the risks inherent to the business
of operating as a broker-dealer. The final approach the Commission has taken with these
rule amendments – encouraging effective internal controls while preserving flexibility –
will enhance a broker-dealer’s financial soundness and, consequently, may help to reduce
the likelihood of broker-dealer failures with possible positive effects on investor
participation, competition, and capital formation. The amendments may also increase
efficiencies in broker-dealer examinations through the ready availability of records for
examiners.
Finally, the Rule 17a-3 and 17a-4 amendments are not expected to place a burden
on competition for small non-carrying broker-dealers because such firms would not be
subject to these amendments. 791 As discussed above, there will be some incremental
costs to compliance related to these amendments for carrying broker-dealers but the costs
of compliance should not impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act and in light of the benefits discussed
above.

791

The amendments only apply to broker-dealers that have more than $1,000,000 in
aggregate credit items as computed under the customer reserve formula of Rule 15c3-3,
or $20,000,000 in capital including debt subordinated in accordance with Appendix D to
Rule 15c3-1.

Amendments to the Net Capital Rule
i.

Economic Analysis
a.

Requirement to Deduct From Net Worth Certain
Liabilities or Expenses Assumed By Third
Parties
(I).

Summary of Amendments

The amendments to Rule 15c3-1 add a new paragraph (c)(2)(i)(F) requiring a
broker-dealer to adjust its net worth when calculating net capital by including any
liabilities that are assumed by a third party if the broker-dealer cannot demonstrate that
the third party has the resources, independent of the broker-dealer’s income and assets, to
pay the liabilities. This amendment is intended to assist investors and regulators by
requiring broker-dealers to provide a more accurate picture of their financial condition.
This should help regulators react more quickly if a broker-dealer experiences financial
difficulty and benefit customers of the troubled broker-dealer as well as its
counterparties.
The purpose of the requirement in new paragraph (c)(2)(i)(F) of Rule 15c3-1 is to
address the practices of a broker-dealer that raise concerns when a broker-dealer shifts
liabilities to an entity with no revenue or assets independent of the broker-dealer to
inappropriately increase its reported net capital, by excluding the liability from the
calculation of net worth. The final rule is designed to prohibit a practice that could
misrepresent a broker-dealer’s actual financial condition, mislead the firm’s customers,
and hamper the ability of regulators to monitor the firm’s financial condition.
The Commission requested comment on available metrics to quantify these
benefits and any other benefits a commenter may identify. Commenters were requested

238

to identify sources of empirical data that could be used for the metrics they proposed.
The Commission did not receive any comments in response to these requests.
(II).

Baseline and Incremental Economic
Effects

As discussed in section II.E.1. of this release, the baseline of this rule amendment
is current Rule 15c3-1 and existing guidance and interpretations. The Commission staff
has provided guidance with respect to the treatment and recording of certain brokerdealer expenses and liabilities that is consistent with the rule amendment. 792
Consequently, as against the current baseline, the Commission does not expect significant
incremental benefits and costs to the extent that they already comply with existing
guidance and interpretations. 793
While the amendments apply to all broker-dealers, they will impact only those
few that shift liabilities to entities with no revenue or assets independent of the brokerdealer (i.e., shell corporations) to boost the broker-dealer’s reported net capital. Based on
staff experience in supervising broker-dealer compliance with Rule 15c3-1, the vast
majority of broker-dealers likely either do not seek to transfer responsibility for their
liabilities to a third party or, if they do so, rely on a third party that has the financial
resources – independent of the assets and revenue of the broker-dealer – to pay the
obligations as they become due. Because of this, it is difficult to quantify the benefits
and costs impact of this rule amendment.

792

See, e.g., Third Party Expense Letter; see also FINRA Notice to Members 03-6, Expense
Sharing Agreements.

793

Under this amendment, some broker-dealers may request permission in writing from their
DEA to withdraw capital within one year of contribution under the rule, resulting in
annual costs to broker-dealers of approximately $144,150 (465 hours x $310 per hour for
a Compliance Attorney). See section IV.D.2. of this release.

239

The Commission conservatively estimates that the amendment may impact all
broker-dealers that do not report any liabilities. FOCUS Report data, as of December 31,
2011, indicates that approximately 289 broker-dealers report having no liabilities. While
this number is likely at the upper boundary of the total number of broker-dealers affected
by this amendment, the number of broker-dealers reporting no liabilities likely represents
a reasonable sample of broker-dealers on which to base the cost estimates.
Requiring these broker-dealers to book liabilities will decrease the amount of
equity capital held by the firms and in some cases may require them to obtain additional
capital. The majority of broker-dealers reporting no liabilities are introducing brokerdealers that have a $5,000 minimum net capital requirement, while the reported average
of total liabilities is approximately $491,355 per broker-dealer. Therefore, conservatively
estimating that each of the 289 broker-dealers will have to raise $491,355 in additional
capital as result of the requirement, the total aggregate amount of additional capital that
will need to be raised is $142 million.794
Further, relative to the proposing release, the Commission is revising the cost of
capital from approximately 5%, which was determined based on historical interest rates
published by the Federal Reserve, to 12% as the average cost of equity capital determined
using the capital asset pricing model (“CAPM”). 795 Therefore, the Commission

794

289 broker-dealers x $491,355 = $142,001,595. This is an update from the proposing
release estimate of 702 broker-dealers with aggregate liabilities of $280,354 per firm,
resulting in an estimated amount of additional capital that would have to be raised in the
amount of $196,808,508 (702 broker-dealers x $280,354 = $196,808,508). See
Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12885, n.189 and
accompanying text.

795

The CAPM is a central model in modern financial theory and is widely used in
applications, such as estimating the cost of capital for firms and evaluating the
performance of managed portfolios. Based on conventional assumptions and historical
stock price data available on Bloomberg, the Commission estimates a risk-free rate of
2.5% and an equity risk premium of 7.8%. Using, five-year, as well as two-year,

240

conservatively estimates that the total annual cost to broker-dealers will be approximately
$17 million,796 which is an increased estimate relative to the proposing release. For the
broker-dealers to whom this increased estimate applies, the Commission expects that
there would be greater costs imposed. However, the Commission expects that the
benefits outlined above would also accrue to the customers of these broker-dealers.
The Commission requested comment on the proposed cost estimates. In
particular, the Commission requested comment on additional costs to broker-dealers that
would arise from the proposals. The Commission also requested comment on whether
these proposals would impose costs on other market participants, including broker-dealer
customers. Commenters were also asked to identify the metrics and sources of any
empirical data that support their costs estimates. The Commission received five
comments in response to this request for comment. 797
One commenter noted that the Commission has provided no evidence that the
public has been endangered or has been left financially unprotected as a result of the
practice of having another entity book some or all of a member’s liabilities. 798 This
commenter asserted that the amendment will affect 14% of total member firms and that
member firms may be shut down, sold or merged as an unintended consequence of the

monthly returns for a sample of listed broker-dealers, the Commission estimates an
adjusted beta of approximately 1.25.
796

$142,001,595 x 12.25% = $17,395,195. In the proposing release, the Commission
estimated that this cost would be approximately $10 million. See Amendments to
Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12885.

amendment. 799 The commenter questioned how many member firms will fail as a result
of this proposal. 800
Another commenter stated that the true costs of the amendment should be
calculated and verified before a proposed amendment is offered and that the true costs of
these amendments were given little time, research, and consideration. 801 This commenter
also argued that the estimated 5% cost of capital has no basis and a firm would be
fortunate to borrow funds for double the estimate of 5%. 802 This same commenter also
stated that the proposal would require 702 debt-free introducing broker-dealers to
needlessly take on debt of approximately $280,354. 803 Another commenter stated that it
is unclear and unlikely how this amendment would achieve any of the desired results and
may conversely impair a firm’s ability to continue as a going concern. 804 None of the
commenters provided the Commission with revised cost estimates.
One commenter stated that if small firms were required to raise over $300,000 in
capital each, there would be the largest dissolution of small broker-dealers in the history
of the regulated securities industry. 805 This commenter also stated that the Commission’s
estimate of a gross cost of capital of 7.5% (5% + 2.5%) is a totally unrealistic cost of
capital for small broker-dealers and that these broker-dealers will categorically have costs
significantly higher than 7.5%. 806 Finally, the commenter stated that, until the
Commission convenes a small broker-dealer representative panel to assist it with

establishing such costs, the Commission is speculating on such costs, and is therefore
without adequate information to consider the effects of such costs and changes on small
firms. 807
(III). Alternatives
The Commission considered all comments received 808 and the alternative of not
adopting the rule, and decided to adopt the amendments substantially as proposed. In
response to the comment regarding the unrealistic cost of capital, 809 the Commission has
increased the cost of capital to 12% as an average cost of equity capital for brokerdealers. As discussed in section II.E.1 of this release, the baseline of this amendment is
current Rule 15c3-1 and existing guidance and interpretations. The Commission staff has
provided guidance with respect to the treatment and recording of certain broker-dealer
expenses and liabilities that is consistent with the rule amendment. 810 Existing brokerdealer recordkeeping rules require a broker-dealer to record its income and expenses. 811
For example, paragraph (a)(2) of Rule 17a-3 requires a broker-dealer to make and keep
current ledgers (or other records) reflecting all assets and liabilities, income and expense
and capital accounts. 812 Consequently, as against the current baseline, the above
estimates are intended to be conservative. The Commission expects that broker-dealers
will incur costs to comply with this amendment, including costs to obtain additional
capital, only to the extent they are not currently complying with existing guidance and
interpretations.

243

In response to comments, 813 the Commission does not expect broker-dealers to
incur significant costs to comply with this amendment to the extent that they are
appropriately recording their assets and liabilities under current Commission rules and
interpretive guidance, because these items will already appear on a broker-dealer’s
balance sheet and be included in its net capital computation. Consequently, the rule
amendment, as adopted, should not: (1) cause firms to be classified as “a going
concern;” 814 (2) cause firms to fail, dissolve, or otherwise close; 815 (3) impose undue
burdens; or (4) present serious implementation difficulties to firms (small or large) if they
are appropriately recording their assets and liabilities under current Commission rules
and interpretive guidance. 816 Further, as stated above, the estimates are intended to be
conservative, and therefore, the Commission expects that the “true” costs 817 that may be
incurred by broker-dealers should be less than the maximum estimated. Therefore, the
Commission does not believe a longer time period for compliance or the formation of a
small broker-dealer advisory cost committee is necessary. 818

Summary of Amendments

As discussed in section II.E.2. of this release, the amendment adds paragraph
(c)(2)(i)(G) to Rule 15c3-1, requiring a broker-dealer to treat as a liability any capital that
is contributed under an agreement giving the investor the option to withdraw it. The rule,

244

as adopted, also requires that a broker-dealer treat as a liability any capital contribution
that is withdrawn within a year of its contribution unless the broker-dealer receives
permission in writing from its DEA. 819 The amendment to Rule 15c3-1 is intended to
assist investors and regulators by requiring broker-dealers to provide a more accurate
picture of their financial condition. This amendment will help regulators react more
quickly if a broker-dealer experiences financial difficulty and benefits customers of a
troubled broker-dealer as well as its counterparties.
The Commission requested comment on available metrics to quantify these
benefits and any other benefits a commenter may identify. Commenters were requested
to identify sources of empirical data that could be used for the metrics they proposed.
The Commission did not receive any comments in response to these requests.
(II).

Baseline and Incremental Economic
Effects

As discussed in section II.E.2. of this release, the baseline of this rule amendment
is current Rule 15c3-1 and existing guidance and interpretations. The Commission
estimates that the amendments requiring broker-dealers to treat certain capital
contributions as liabilities should not result in significant incremental benefits and costs,
as compared to the baseline. Because of existing Commission and staff guidance

819

One commenter suggested that the rule be amended to explicitly exclude any withdrawals
that would fall under paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule 15c3-1. See American Bar Association
Letter. It is unnecessary to explicitly exclude any withdrawals that would fall under
paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule 15c3-1because these requirements will not apply to
withdrawals covered by paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule 15c3-1, namely, withdrawals used
to make tax payments or to pay reasonable compensation to partners. 17 CFR 240.15c31(e)(4)(iii). These types of payments are ordinary business expenditures and do not raise
the types of concerns the proposed rule is designed to address. See Amendments to
Financial Responsibility Rules, 74 FR at12872, n.79.

regarding the permanency of capital, 820 broker-dealers typically do not enter into
agreements permitting an owner to withdraw capital at any time. To the extent some
firms may have engaged in this practice, they may need to raise capital to meet the rule
requirement.
While the amendments apply to all broker-dealers, they will impact only the few
broker-dealers that provide investors with the option to withdraw capital at any time or
within one year. Because of existing Commission and staff interpretations related to
temporary capital contributions, 821 most broker-dealers likely do not accept capital
contributions under agreements permitting the investor to withdraw the capital at any
time or within one year. Therefore, it is difficult to quantify the cost impact of this rule
amendment.
Based on staff experience with the treatment of capital contributions and the
application of Rule 15c3-1, the Commission estimates that no more than $100 million in
capital at broker-dealers is subject to such agreements. 822 Further, with regard to the
treatment of temporary capital contributions, in the proposing release, the Commission
assumed an incremental cost of capital of 2.5%, 823 and estimated that the amendment
would result in an annual cost of approximately $2.5 million.824

The Commission requested comment on the proposed cost estimates. In
particular, the Commission requested comment on additional costs to broker-dealers that
would arise from the proposals. The Commission also requested comment on whether
these proposals would impose costs on other market participants, including broker-dealer
customers. Commenters were also asked to identify the metrics and sources of any
empirical data that support their costs estimates.
The Commission received three comments. 825 One commenter stated that the
Commission’s estimate that no more than $100 million of capital at broker-dealers is
subject to agreements permitting an owner to withdraw capital at any time greatly
underestimates the impact of the proposed rule. 826 The commenter stated that the
Commission makes no case for deviating from the already established standards. 827
Another commenter believed that the proposal would raise its cost of capital to such an extent
that it would be impossible for the firm to raise capital from unrelated third parties. 828

One commenter stated that the Commission’s estimate of a gross cost of capital of
7.5% (5% + 2.5%) is a totally unrealistic cost of capital for small broker-dealers and that
these broker-dealers will categorically have costs significantly higher than 7.5%. 829
Finally, the commenter stated that, until the Commission convenes a small broker-dealer
representative panel to assist it with establishing such costs, the Commission is
“speculating” on such costs, and is therefore without adequate information to consider the
effects of such costs and changes on small firms. 830

In response to comments, 831 the Commission is revising this estimate in the final
rule to an estimated cost of capital of approximately 12%, which is determined as the
average cost of equity capital of broker-dealers using the CAPM. The overall estimated
cost of capital is not incremental to the amendment discussed above regarding third party
liabilities. The estimated cost of capital would be 12% for a broker-dealer seeking
additional equity capital. Therefore, with regard to the treatment of temporary capital
contributions, the Commission estimates the amendment will result in an annual cost of
approximately $12.0 million, 832 which is an increased estimate relative to the proposing
release. For the broker-dealers to whom this increased estimate applies, and who may not
be complying with the rule amendments, the Commission expects that there would be
greater costs imposed. However, the Commission expects that the benefits outlined
above would also accrue to the customers of these broker-dealers. 833
(III). Alternatives
The Commission considered all comments discussed above and the alternative of
not adopting the rule, and decided to adopt the amendments substantially as proposed. In
response to commenters’ concerns about the impact on capital and the $100 million
estimate, 834 as discussed above, the final rule amendment is a codification of existing
Commission staff guidance, 835 and thus should not represent a change for broker-dealers
with respect to capital withdrawals. Moreover, with respect to commenters’ concerns
about obtaining capital, 836 the rule does not prohibit an investor from withdrawing capital

at any time. Rather, it prohibits a broker-dealer from treating temporary cash infusions as
capital for purposes of the net capital rule. Finally, the final rule amendment provides a
mechanism for a broker-dealer to apply to its DEA to make a withdrawal within one year
of the capital contribution without triggering the deduction under certain circumstances.
In the final rule, the Commission has increased the estimated cost of capital from
2.5% to 12%, in response to comments regarding the unrealistic cost of capital, and
because the estimated cost of capital is not incremental to the estimated cost of capital to
the amendment to Rule 15c3-1 regarding third party liabilities. 837 The estimated cost of
capital would be 12% for a broker-dealer seeking a loan for any additional capital. In
addition, based on staff experience with the treatment of capital contributions and for the
reasons discussed above, the Commission continues to believe that the estimate of $100
million regarding the temporary capital contributions is reasonable. 838
Further, the final rule amendments relating to temporary capital contributions
have been revised to clarify that a withdrawal of capital made within one year of its
contribution to the broker-dealer is deemed to have been intended to be withdrawn within
one year, unless the withdrawal has been approved in writing by the broker-dealer’s
DEA. 839 The Commission made this change to eliminate a potential ambiguity as to
whether a withdrawal of capital within one year could ever be approved by a brokerdealer’s DEA. The final rule amendment clarifies the intent to provide a mechanism for
broker-dealers to apply for approval to withdraw capital within one year and to be
granted such approval where appropriate.

While owners of most broker-dealers have the option of withdrawing capital,
most owners likely do not have agreements that provide the option of withdrawing capital
at any time. 840 Paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-1 contains mechanisms to permit a brokerdealer to make capital withdrawals for specified purposes. 841 If there is a specific need
for a broker-dealer to seek permission to make a capital withdrawal within one year of
contribution, the final rule already provides a mechanism for the broker-dealer to seek
permission in writing from its DEA to make such a withdrawal. 842 Based on the
discussion above, the Commission believes the final cost estimates are appropriate. 843
c.

Requirement to Deduct the Amount by which a
Fidelity Bond Exceeds SRO Limits

As discussed in section II.E.3. of this release, this amendment requires brokerdealers to deduct from net capital, with regard to fidelity bonding requirements
prescribed by a broker-dealer’s examining authority, the excess of any deductible amount
over the amount permitted by SRO rules.
Under SRO rules, certain broker-dealers that do business with the public or are
required to become SIPC members must comply with mandatory fidelity bonding
requirements. 844 SRO rules typically permit a broker-dealer to have a deductible
840

See SIG Letter.

841

See paragraphs (e)(1)(iii)(B) and (e)(4)(iii) of Rule 15c3-1. See also Amendments to
Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12872, n.79 (“These requirements would not
apply to withdrawals covered by paragraph (e)(4)(iii) of Rule 15c3-1, namely,
withdrawals used to make tax payments or pay reasonable compensation to partners.
These types of payments are ordinary business expenditures and do not raise the types of
concerns the proposed rule is designed to address.”)

842

See paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G)(2) of Rule 15c3-1.

843

See NIBA 2 Letter.

844

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 4360, CBOE Rule 9.22, and NASDAQ OMX PHLX Rule 705.
SRO fidelity bonding requirements typically contain agreements covering the following
areas: a “Fidelity” insuring clause to indemnify against loss of property through dishonest
or fraudulent acts of employees; an “On Premises” agreement insuring against losses
resulting from crimes such as burglary and theft and from misplacement of property of

250

provision included in the bond; however, such rules provide that the deductible must not
exceed certain amounts. With regard to firms that maintain deductible amounts over
certain specified amounts, a number of SRO rules provide that the broker-dealer must
deduct this specified amount from net worth when calculating net capital under Rule
15c3-1. 845
Rule 15c3-1, however, does not specifically reference the SRO deductible
requirements as a charge to net worth, meaning that a broker-dealer would not be
required for the purposes of Commission rules to show the impact of the deduction in the
net capital computation required by an SRO on the FOCUS Report. 846 To address the
reporting inconsistency, the Commission is amending Rule 15c3-1 to add paragraph
(c)(2)(xiv), which will require broker-dealers to deduct the amount specified by rule of
the Examining Authority of the broker-dealer with respect to a requirement to maintain
fidelity bond coverage. This rule amendment will provide consistency in broker-dealer
reporting requirements. 847
This amendment will also codify in a Commission rule capital charges that
broker-dealers are currently required to take pursuant to the rules of various SROs.
Consequently, any economic effects, including costs and benefits, should be compared to
a baseline of current practices. The amendment should not impose additional costs on
broker-dealers with respect to the purchasing or carrying of fidelity bond coverage. Nor

the insured; an “In Transit” clause indemnifying against losses occurring while property
is in transit; a “Forgery and Alteration” agreement insuring against loss due to forgery or
alteration of various kinds of negotiable instruments; and a “Securities Loss” clause
protecting against losses incurred through forgery and alteration of securities. Id.
845

See, e.g., FINRA Rule 4360 and CBOE Rule 9.22.

846

See 17 CFR 240.17a-5.

847

Conversely, not adopting this rule amendment would have resulted in continued
inconsistency among existing SRO rules and Rule 15c3-1.

251

will the amendment cause broker-dealers to incur additional costs in determining or
reporting excess deductible amounts over the deductible permitted. Broker-dealers
already make such determinations under SROs rules, and the manner in which such
excesses are typically reported (i.e., through periodic FOCUS Reports and other reports)
would remain the same.
The Commission received one comment opposing the fidelity bond amendment,
stating that FINRA Rule 4360 and the Commission’s amendment would result in a de
facto increase in minimum net capital requirements for some broker-dealers. 848 Any
increase in net capital cited by the commenter would result from existing SRO rules. 849
Stated differently, broker-dealers that are members of an SRO with such a fidelity
bonding rule must already account for the deduction in complying with the net capital
requirements of SROs and nothing in the Commission’s amendment to paragraph
(c)(2)(xiv) of Rule 15c3-1 would alter this status quo. Consequently, while there is
currently no deduction required under the baseline of current Rule 15c3-1 relating to
fidelity bond deductibles, because SRO rules currently require this deduction, the
adoption of this amendment under Rule 15c3-1 should not impose any additional costs on
broker-dealers that they are not already incurring under existing SRO rules.

848

See NIBA 2 Letter.

For example, the Commission approved FINRA Rule 4360 through the SRO rule filing
process. See Order Approving Proposed Rule Change to Adopt FINRA Rule 4360
(Fidelity Bonds) in the Consolidated FINRA Rulebook, Exchange Act Release No. 63961
(Feb. 24, 2011), 76 FR 11542 (Mar. 2, 2011). Pursuant to Section 19(b)(1) of the
Exchange Act, each SRO must file with the Commission any proposed change in,
addition to, or deletion from the rules of the exchange electronically on a Form 19b-4
through the Electronic Form 19b-4 Filing System, which is a secure website operated by
the Commission. 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(1) and 17 CFR 240.19b-4.

d.

Broker-Dealer Solvency Requirement

As discussed in section II.E.4., the amendment to paragraph (a) of Rule 15c3-1
states that no broker-dealer shall be “insolvent” as that term is defined under paragraph
(c)(16) of the rule. The companion amendment to paragraph (b)(1) of Rule 17a-11
requires insolvent broker-dealers to provide notice to regulatory authorities.
Allowing an insolvent broker-dealer to continue conducting a securities business
during the period of its insolvency, notwithstanding its net capital position, could
jeopardize customers and other market participants because a broker-dealer that has made
an admission of insolvency, or is otherwise deemed insolvent or entitled to protection
from creditors, does not possess the financial resources necessary to operate a securities
business. Continuing to operate in such circumstances poses a significant credit risk to
counterparties and to the clearance and settlement system, and, in the event the firm ends
up in a liquidation proceeding under SIPA, may impair the ability of the SIPA trustee to
make the customers of the broker-dealer whole and satisfy the claims of other creditors
out of the assets of the general estate. 850
Consequently, the amendment to Rule 15c3-1 benefits the securities markets, and
indirectly, all other market participants, by removing risks associated with the continued
operation of a financially unstable firm. For example, the amendment will limit the
potential that an insolvent firm would take on new customers and place their assets at
risk. Furthermore, the broker-dealer will not be able to enter into proprietary transactions
with other broker-dealers and place them or clearing agencies at further risk of
counterparty default. The broker-dealer’s existing customers also will benefit from

850

See Amendments to Financial Responsibility Rules, 72 FR at 12872.

253

preservation of any remaining capital of the firm, which could be used to facilitate an
orderly liquidation.
The amendment to Rule 17a-11 also benefits the securities markets in that it will
provide regulators with the opportunity to more quickly take steps to protect customers
and counterparties at the onset of the insolvency, including, if appropriate, notifying
SIPC of the need to commence a SIPA liquidation.
The baseline for this proposed amendment is current Rules 15c3-1 and 17a-11,
which currently do not contain requirements to cease conducting a securities business (or
to notify the Commission) if certain insolvency events were to occur. The amendments
generally will have no impact on broker-dealers when compared to the current baseline.
Should a broker-dealer become subject to an insolvency proceeding, it will incur the cost
of sending notice of that fact to the Commission and its DEA. The Commission
estimated in the PRA that it will occur approximately two 851 times a year for all brokerdealers. 852 For these reasons, the Commission estimates that any costs arising from this
amendment will be de minimis.
One commenter stated that involuntary bankruptcy proceedings do not necessarily
indicate that the broker-dealer is insolvent, as such proceedings can be frivolous,
malicious, or otherwise lacking in merit, and noted standard industry forms generally
provide a grace period for a party to such a proceeding to obtain a stay or dismissal
before an event of default is deemed to have occurred. The Commission considered this
alternative approach and notes that if a firm believes that it is the subject of an
851

This estimate is based on the 2012 SIPC Annual Report, which indicates that over the last
ten year-period, the annual average of new customer protection proceedings was three. A
copy of the 2012 Annual Report is available at http://www.sipc.org/.

852

The internal hours would likely be performed by a compliance clerk. Therefore, the
estimated internal costs for this hour burden would be calculated as follows: Compliance
Clerk at $63 per hour x 20 minutes = $21.00. See section IV.D.8. of this release.

254

unwarranted involuntary bankruptcy proceeding and that its case will not be dismissed
within the 30 day timeframe, as is the case with existing net capital requirements,
pursuant to Rule 15c3-1(b)(3), the Commission may, upon written application, exempt
the broker-dealer from the requirement.
In addition, one commenter objected to the amendments as unnecessary, citing the
Rule 15c3-1 prohibition on broker-dealers effecting securities transactions if their net
capital is below certain minimums.853 The commenter stated that the net capital of an
insolvent broker-dealer would, by definition, be below those minimums. 854 The
Commission considered the commenter’s view and the alternative of not adopting the
amendments. The purpose of the amendment is to address cases where the broker-dealer
is subject to an insolvency event but maintains that it is in compliance with the net capital
rule. Therefore, the Commission is adopting this amendment, because, while such
instances may be rare, an insolvent broker-dealer could seek the protection of the
bankruptcy laws but continue to effect transactions with the public, potentially
jeopardizing customers and other creditors of the broker-dealer, including counterparties.
As noted above, the Commission requested comment on this cost estimate. In
particular, the Commission requested comment on whether there would be costs to
broker-dealers as a consequence of the proposal. The Commission also requested
comment on whether this proposal would impose costs on other market participants,
including broker-dealer customers. Commenters were asked to identify the metrics and
sources of any empirical data that supported their costs estimates. The Commission did
not receive any comments in response to these requests.

Amendment to Rule Governing
Restrictions of Withdrawals of Capital

As discussed in section II.E.5. of this release, paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-1, which
places certain conditions on a broker-dealer when withdrawing capital, 855 also allows the
Commission to issue an order temporarily restricting a broker-dealer from withdrawing
capital or making loans or advances to stockholders, insiders, and affiliates under certain
circumstances. 856 The rule, however, limits such orders to withdrawals, advances, or
loans that, when aggregated with all other withdrawals, advances, or loans on a net basis
during a 30 calendar day period, exceed 30% of the firm’s excess net capital. 857
The Commission has determined that the requirement is difficult to enforce, as it
generally would not be clear when the 30% threshold had been reached, due to the
inherent unreliability of a troubled broker-dealer’s books and records. The Commission
considered retaining the 30% threshold, but determined that a more appropriate approach
would be to eliminate the 30% threshold requirement from the rule, rather than retain a
provision that is difficult to enforce. Consequently, the Commission proposed, and is
adopting, a change to delete this provision and instead to allow the Commission to
restrict all withdrawals, advances, and loans so long as the other conditions under the rule
(all of which remain unchanged) were met.
The amendment to paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-1 benefits the securities markets by
protecting customers and counterparties of a financially stressed broker-dealer. For
example, by prohibiting unsecured loans to a stockholder or withdrawal of equity capital
while the order is outstanding, the amendment will help to preserve the assets and

liquidity of the broker-dealer and enable the Commission and its staff, as well as other
regulators, to examine the broker-dealer’s financial condition, net capital position, and
the risk exposure to the customers and creditors of the broker-dealer.
The current rule permitting the Commission to restrict withdrawals of capital
from a financially distressed broker-dealer was adopted in 1991. 858 This rule is the
baseline for purposes of this economic analysis. When the Commission adopted this
paragraph of Rule 15c3-1 more than twenty years ago, the Commission stated that it was
intended to be an emergency provision, applicable only to the most exigent of
circumstances where the continued viability of the broker-dealer appears to be at stake. 859
In the ensuing years, the Commission has only utilized this provision one time. 860 Based
on this experience with the rule, and the fact that the rule is intended as an emergency
provision only, as compared to the current baseline, the Commission estimates that the
amendment will result in no or de minimis costs to broker-dealers.
As noted above, the Commission requested comment on this cost estimate. The
Commission also requested comment on whether the proposal would impose costs on
other market participants. Commenters were asked to identify the metrics and sources of
any empirical data that support their cost estimates. One commenter supported the
amendment but believed that the rule is intended to protect the capitalization of large
firms while ignoring small firms, and proposed that the Commission state all the
conditions that need to exist for a firm to withdraw, repay or redeem any amount that

does not endanger the firm or its customers. 861 The commenter also stated that it opposes
regulation that arbitrarily reduces the value of small broker-dealers and their competitive
position relative to larger broker-dealers. A second commenter noted that the proposed
amendment would impose additional compliance burdens on broker-dealers and would
significantly limit broker-dealers’ flexibility in the event of a liquidity crisis. 862
In adopting the final rule, the Commission considered the alternatives and
modifications suggested by commenters. In response to these comments, the
Commission notes that the amendment would eliminate the 30% threshold from
paragraph (e)(3)(i) of Rule 15c3-1, which relates to the Commission’s authority to
temporarily restrict withdrawals of net capital. It cannot impose these restrictions
without concluding that “such withdrawal, advance or loan may be detrimental to the
financial integrity of the broker or dealer, or may unduly jeopardize the broker or dealer’s
ability to repay its customer claims or other liabilities which may cause a significant
impact on the markets or expose the customers or creditors of the broker or dealer to loss
without taking into account the application of the Securities Investor Protection Act of
1970.” 863 While paragraph (e)(3)(i) of Rule 15c3-1 would apply to all broker-dealers, the
stringent conditions under which the Commission may exert its authority under the rule
to temporarily restrict a broker-dealer’s withdrawals of net capital would apply to only
the circumstances where the continued viability of the broker-dealer appears to be at
stake. 864 The Commission, however, agrees with the importance of maintaining
flexibility in the context of ordering restrictions on withdrawals, advances, and loans.

258

Therefore, the Commission modified the amendment, as adopted, to add language to
paragraph (e)(3)(i) to state (following the phrase “employee or affiliate”) that such orders
will be issued, “under such terms and conditions as the Commission deems necessary or
appropriate in the public interest or consistent with the protection of investors . . . .” 865
In summary, the Commission does not believe that the deletion of the 30%
threshold will affect the competitiveness or unduly restrict the ongoing business
operations of small broker-dealers as compared to larger firms. All broker-dealers
remain subject to the other notice and withdrawal limitations on equity capital set forth in
paragraphs (e)(1) and (e)(2) of Rule 15c3-1, which are not the subject of this rule
amendment.

Amendment to Rule 15c3-1 Appendix A

As discussed in section II.E.6.i. of this release, the amendment to paragraph
(b)(1)(vi) of Rule 15c3-1a will make permanent the reduced net capital requirements that
apply to listed option positions in major market foreign currencies and high-capitalization
and non-high-capitalization diversified indexes in non-clearing option specialist and
market maker accounts. This change will benefit the broker-dealers that have been
calculating charges under a temporary amendment the Commission originally adopted in
1997. 866 The temporary amendment expired on September 1, 1997, subject to
extension. 867 The Commission staff subsequently issued a no-action letter on January 13,
2000, which stated that the staff would not recommend enforcement action if broker-

dealers continued to rely on the temporary amendment. 868 The Commission considered
whether to keep the amendment temporary but determined that making the temporary
amendment permanent, as proposed, was the more appropriate alternative because it
creates certainty for broker-dealers relying on the rule.
Because this amendment seeks to match capital requirements with actual risks, it
should not have an adverse impact on the financial strength of broker-dealers. Moreover,
because broker-dealers are already operating under the temporary relief, which is the
current baseline, the amendment should not result in any costs for broker-dealers as
compared to the current baseline.
The Commission requested comment on available metrics to quantify the benefits
identified above and any other benefits the commenter may identify. In addition, the
Commission requested comment on whether the proposal would result in any costs.
Commenters were asked to identify the metrics and sources of any empirical data that
support their cost estimates. The Commission did not receive any comments in response
to these requests.

Consideration of Burden on Competition, and
Promotion of Efficiency, Competition, and Capital
Formation

Rule 15c3-1 is designed to help ensure that a broker-dealer holds at all times
liquid assets sufficient to pay its non-subordinated liabilities and retain a “cushion” of
liquid assets used to pay customers without delay in the event that the broker-dealer fails.
For example, a broker-dealer that inappropriately excludes certain liabilities when

260

presenting its financial position 869 or includes non-permanent capital contributions in its
financial statements 870 distorts the view of the firm’s financial condition and undermines
the rule. In either event, such practices jeopardize the broker-dealer’s ability to selfliquidate and promptly pay customers.
The Commission’s experience with the broker-dealer financial responsibility
rules, underscored by the 2008 financial crisis, highlights the effects that the failure of a
broker-dealer, particularly a large carrying broker-dealer, could have on customers and
other market participants. Losses resulting from the disorderly winding down of a
broker-dealer may often undermine the participation of investors in the U.S. capital
markets, with possible negative effects on capital formation and market efficiency. Thus,
it is imperative that broker-dealers operate in compliance with Rule 15c3-1 and that the
Commission takes the necessary steps to help ensure that broker-dealers are prohibited
from engaging in practices that obscure noncompliance.
The amendments to Rule 15c3-1 are designed to reduce the risk of a disorderly
failure of a broker-dealer and lessen the potential that market participants may seek to
rapidly withdraw assets and financing from broker-dealers during a time of market stress.
These Rule 15c3-1 amendments may affect efficiency and capital formation through their
positive impact on competition among broker-dealers. Specifically, markets that are
competitive can, all other things equal, be expected to promote an efficient allocation of
capital. 871

and Major Security-Based Swap Participants and Capital Requirements for BrokerDealers, Exchange Act Release No. 68071 (Oct. 18, 2012), 77 FR 70213, 70315 (Nov.
23, 2012).

261

The amendments to Rule 15c3-1 – (1) requiring a broker-dealer to account for
certain liabilities or treat certain capital contributions as liabilities, 872 (2) requiring a
broker-dealer to deduct certain fidelity bond deductibles, 873 (3) requiring an insolvent
broker-dealer to cease conducting a securities business and provide notice under the
amendment to Rule 17a-11, 874 (4) eliminating the qualification on Commission orders
restricting withdrawals, advances, and unsecured loans to instances where recent
withdrawals, advances or loans, in the aggregate, exceed 30% of the broker-dealer’s
excess net capital, 875 and (5) making permanent the reduced net capital requirements
under Appendix A for market makers 876 – are consistent with promoting efficiency,
competition, and capital formation in the market place.
First, a broker-dealer that fails to include liabilities that depend on the brokerdealer’s assets and revenues and accepts temporary capital contributions is obscuring its
true financial condition. This also interferes with the process by which regulators
monitor the financial condition of broker-dealers and, thereby, impedes their ability to
take proactive steps to minimize the harm resulting from a broker-dealer failure to
customers, counterparties, and clearing agencies.
Second, requiring broker-dealers to take net capital charges for excess fidelity
bond deductibles imposed under SRO rules will promote efficiency by providing
consistency among Rule 15c3-1 and SRO rules. Because fidelity bond requirements
provide a safeguard with regard to broker-dealer financial responsibility, the amendment
will enhance competition through the operation of more financially sound firms.

Third, the continued operation of an insolvent broker-dealer or the withdrawal of
capital from a broker-dealer that may jeopardize such broker-dealer’s financial integrity
poses financial risk to its customers, counterparties, and the registered clearing agencies.
These risks increase costs and decrease efficiency of the marketplace.
Fourth, the elimination of the limitation on Commission orders restricting capital
withdrawals under paragraph (e)(3) of Rule 15c3-1 from a financially troubled brokerdealer will provide greater protection to customers and counterparties of the firm and
registered clearing agencies. While such orders are expected to be infrequent, when
issued they should lower costs to these entities associated with having an outstanding
obligation from the troubled broker-dealer, thereby promoting efficiency and facilitating
capital formation.
One commenter expressed concern that the proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1
would be particularly burdensome on small broker-dealers, negatively impacting capital
formation for small issuers and increasing the cost of capital for small broker-dealers. 877
For example, the commenter stated that it believed that the proposed changes requiring a
broker-dealer to subtract from net worth certain non-permanent capital contributions and
to deduct from net worth certain liabilities or expenses assumed by third parties would
negatively impact capital formation for small issuers and increase the cost of capital for
small broker-dealers. 878
While the Commission is cognizant that the Rule 15c3-1 amendments may
impose burdens on broker-dealers, including non-carrying broker-dealers, the commenter
is treating the amendments as entirely new additions to the net capital rule. Yet, as
discussed in section II.E. of this release, the Commission has emphasized that capital
877

See NIBA 2 Letter.

878

Id.

263

contributions to broker-dealers should not be temporary. Further, the Commission staff
has explained that a capital contribution should be treated as a liability if it is made with
the understanding that such contribution can be withdrawn at the option of the
investor. 879 Based on the Commission’s experience with the application of Rule 15c3-1,
the majority of broker-dealers operate consistent with past Commission and staff rules
and guidance regarding the nature of capital and, thus, the Rule 15c3-1 amendments
should not represent a substantial change for most broker-dealers. Therefore, the final
rule should not negatively impact capital formation for small issuers, nor increase the cost
of capital for small broker-dealers, to the extent that these firms already comply with
current guidance and interpretations. 880 For those firms that will need to raise capital to
comply with the amendments to Rule 15c3-1, the rule amendments potentially may
negatively impact capital formation. However, the potential costs to some broker-dealers
could be offset by the aggregate increase in capital formation related to heightened
confidence in broker-dealer financial requirements.
Finally, the Commission recognizes that, as discussed above, the amendments to
Rule 15c3-3 adopted today impose certain costs on broker-dealers that could affect
competition among broker-dealers. However, the Commission is of the opinion that
these costs are justified by the significant benefits described in this economic analysis. In
sum, the costs of compliance resulting from the requirements in the amendments to Rule
15c3-3 should not impose a burden on competition not necessary or appropriate in
furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act in light of the benefits discussed above.

FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
The Commission proposed amendments to Rules 15c3-1, 15c3-1a, 15c3-2, 15c3-

3, 15c3-3a, 17a-3, 17a-4, and 17a-11 under the Exchange Act. An Initial Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis (“IRFA”) was included in the proposing release. 881 This Final
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“FRFA”) has been prepared in accordance with the
provisions of the RFA. 882
The Commission requested comment with regard to matters discussed in the
IRFA, including comments with respect to the number of small entities that may be
affected by the proposed rule amendments. 883 The Commission also requested that
commenters specify the costs of compliance with the proposed amendments, and suggest
alternatives that would accomplish the goals of the amendments. 884 The Commission
received one general comment on the IRFA. 885 In addition, the Commission received a
number of comments regarding the impact on small entities with respect to specific
aspects of the proposed rule amendments, including comments relating to amendments
under Rule 15c3-3 with respect to where special reserve deposits may be held, and
amendments under Rule 15c3-1 relating to the requirement to subtract from net worth
certain liabilities or expenses assumed by third parties. 886 The general comment on the
IRFA is discussed directly below. The specific comments are discussed in the applicable
sections below.

General Issues Raised by Public Comments

The commenter stated that the Commission should pay “explicit attention to
regulatory trends in the rest of the world” because doing so “benefits not only small
entities (by reducing their regulatory burden) but all entities, as larger entities can
experience more consistent regulatory procedures around the world.” 887 The commenter
suggested that the Commission consider a “Basel II type approach to net capital
requirements.” 888 In response to the commenter, the Commission notes that the
amendments relate to discrete areas of the broker-dealer financial responsibility rules
(i.e., they do not establish new financial responsibility standards such as would be the
case if the Commission were to adopt a “Basel II type approach to net capital
requirements.”). As noted above, the commenter’s suggestion is beyond the scope of this
rulemaking. 889
B.

Amendments to the Customer Protection Rule
1.

Need for and Objectives of the Rule Amendments

The final rule amends certain provisions of Rule 15c3-3. 890 The amendment that
requires broker-dealers to perform a PAB reserve computation is designed to address a
disparity between Rule 15c3-3 and the SIPA, and to incorporate provisions of the PAIB
Letter into Commission rules. 891 The amendment that will require broker-dealers to

exclude cash deposited at an affiliated bank and cash deposited with an unaffiliated bank
to the extent that the amount exceeds 15% of the bank’s equity capital from being used to
meet a broker-dealer’s reserve requirements is designed to avoid the situation where a
carrying broker-dealer’s cash deposits constitute a substantial portion of the bank’s
deposits. 892 The amendment that will require broker-dealers to obtain possession and
control of customers’ fully paid and excess margin securities allocated to a short position
is designed to address the fact that Rule 15c3-3 currently permits a broker-dealer to
monetize customer securities, which is contrary to the customer protection goals of Rule
15c3-3, which seeks to ensure that broker-dealer’s do not use customer assets for
proprietary purposes. 893 The amendment that will require broker-dealers to provide
certain notices and disclosures before changing the terms and conditions under which the
broker-dealer treats customer free credit balances is intended to help ensure that the use
of customer free credit balances accords with customer preferences. 894 The importation
of certain provisions of Rule 15c3-2 into Rule 15c3-3 streamlines the customer protection
rules and eliminates irrelevant provisions in Rule 15c3-2 due to Rule 15c3-3. 895 The
amendments clarifying that funds in certain commodities accounts are not to be treated as
free credit balances or other credit balances are intended to remove uncertainty with
respect to their treatment under Rule 15c3-3. 896
The amendments to Rule 15c3-3 are intended to strengthen the protections
afforded to customer assets held at a broker-dealer. The amendments are designed to

held in a manner that is inconsistent with a customer’s expectations.
2.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comment

The Commission received numerous comments with respect to the amendment
under paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 15c3-3 that will require broker-dealers to exclude cash
deposited at an affiliated bank and cash deposited with an unaffiliated bank to the extent
that the amount exceeds 15% of the bank’s equity capital from being used to meet a
broker-dealer’s reserve requirements. 897 As proposed, new paragraph (e)(5) of 15c3-3
would have provided that, in determining whether a broker-dealer maintains the
minimum reserve deposits required (customer and PAB), the broker-dealer must exclude
any cash deposited at an affiliated bank. In addition, the proposed amendment would
have required a broker-dealer to also exclude cash deposited at an unaffiliated bank to the
extent the cash deposited exceeds (1) 50% of the broker-dealer’s excess net capital (based
on the broker-dealer’s most recently filed FOCUS Report), 898 or (2) 10% of the bank’s
equity capital (based on the bank’s most recently filed Call Report or Thrift Financial
Report). 899
With respect to the proposed limits on the amounts that could be deposited in
unaffiliated banks, some commenters argued that the percentages were too restrictive
while other commenters suggested alternative approaches to the proposed percentage
limitations. 900 One commenter stated that the percentage thresholds would negatively
impact smaller broker-dealers because these firms would still be required under the

proposed rule to maintain at least two reserve bank accounts at different banks. 901 This
commenter noted that limiting Rule 15c3-3 deposits at a single bank to 50% of a brokerdealer’s excess net capital could impact 10 to 15% of its broker-dealer customers in that
many of these customers would be required to open accounts at multiple institutions.902
This commenter suggested the Commission consider higher percentages for cash deposits
at large money-centered banks, since the proposed percentage thresholds would
negatively impact small broker-dealers because they would exceed the 50% of excess net
capital threshold at lower deposit levels. 903 This commenter also noted that conducting
due diligence and opening new accounts and the ongoing monitoring and periodic reevaluation of such additional accounts would require much more time than the 10 hours
originally estimated by the Commission.904 A second commenter concurred with this
cost assessment, stating that the Commission significantly underestimated the cost of the
proposal to smaller firms. 905
With respect to the use of qualified securities to meet reserve requirements, one
commenter noted that broker-dealers will “likely have a significant amount of additional
operational and transactional costs.” 906 The commenter believes that “[w]hile larger
broker-dealers may be able to reallocate existing trading desk, operational, regulatory
reporting and treasury functions to assist in ongoing maintenance activities, midsized and
901

See SIFMA 2 Letter (“[T]he [percentage] tests could prevent a smaller firm from
maintaining reserve account deposits at any single bank, even though those deposits are
relatively small compared to the size of the bank – e.g., a broker- dealer with excess net
capital of $500,000 could not maintain more than $250,000 in reserve account cash
deposits at any one bank, regardless of the ratio between such bash deposits and the
overall size or equity capital of the bank.”).

smaller broker-dealers may be required to hire additional staff to manage and maintain a
securities portfolio.” 907
In response to commenters concerns, the Commission has eliminated the
provision that would have excluded the amount of a deposit that exceeds 50% of the
broker-dealer’s excess net capital. After review of the comment letters, the Commission
believes that this provision likely would have disproportionately impacted small and midsize broker-dealers when they deposited cash into large commercial banks since they
would exceed the excess net capital threshold well before exceeding the bank equity
capital threshold. 908 The bank equity capital threshold is the more important metric since
it relates directly to the financial strength of the bank, which is the entity holding the
account. In particular, if the carrying broker-dealer’s deposit constitutes a substantial
portion of the bank’s total deposits, the bank may not have the liquidity to quickly return
the deposit to the broker-dealer. The elimination of the excess net capital threshold
should mitigate concerns expressed by small broker-dealers that they would need to open
multiple bank accounts to make cash deposits or hire additional staff, if they sought to
deposit qualified securities in a reserve account in order to avoid opening multiple
accounts. This is because the excess net capital threshold likely would have impacted
smaller broker-dealers, which – consistent with their size – maintain less net capital than
larger firms.
Second, with respect to the bank equity capital threshold, in response to
comments, the Commission has increased the trigger level from 10% to 15% of the

907

Id. The commenter noted that managing pools of qualified securities involves various
tasks, such as “monitoring income collection, redemption processing, marking the
securities to market, collateral substitutions and collateral segregation amongst other
tasks.” Id.

908

270

bank’s equity capital. The increase of the threshold to 15% is designed to address
concerns raised by commenters that the proposed percentage tests were unduly restrictive
in certain respects and should be modified, particularly with respect to large brokerdealers with large deposit requirements. Consequently, the increase from 10% to 15% is
designed to mitigate commenters concerns that the 10% threshold would require brokerdealers to spread out deposits over an excessive number of banks, while still providing
adequate protection against undue concentrations of deposits, particularly where smaller
banks are concerned.
The elimination of the 50% of excess net capital threshold and increase of the
bank capital threshold from 10% to 15% is designed to appropriately address concerns
raised by commenters that they would have to substantially alter their current cash
deposit practices in light of the goal of the rule to promote the broker-dealer’s ability to
have quick access to the deposit.
With the elimination of the broker-dealer excess net capital threshold, and the
increase in the bank equity capital threshold, it is likely that very few broker-dealers
(including small broker-dealers) would be required to maintain reserve accounts at
multiple banks, unless they chose to do so for operational, business or other reasons.
Therefore for the reasons discussed above, as adopted, paragraph (e)(5) of Rule 15c3-3,
should not significantly impact a substantial number of small entities.
3.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule

Paragraph (c)(1) of Rule 0-10 909 states that the term small business or small
organization, when referring to a broker-dealer, means a broker or dealer that had total
capital (net worth plus subordinated liabilities) of less than $500,000 on the date in the

909

17 CFR 240.0-10(c)(1).

271

prior fiscal year as of which its audited financial statements were prepared pursuant to
Rule 17a-5(d); 910 and is not affiliated with any person (other than a natural person) that is
not a small business or small organization.
Based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, the Commission
estimates there are approximately 5 broker-dealers that performed a customer reserve
computation pursuant to Rule 15c3-3 and were “small” for the purposes Rule 0-10.
4.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and other Compliance
Requirements

The amendments (1) require broker-dealers to perform a PAB reserve
computation, (2) limit the amount that a broker-dealer may deposit in a reserve account at
any individual bank in the form of cash, (3) require broker-dealers to obtain possession
and control of customers’ fully paid and excess margin securities allocated to a short
position by borrowing equivalent securities or through other means within a specified
period of time, and (4) require broker-dealers to obtain the written affirmative consent of
a new customer before including a customer’s free credit balances in a Sweep Program,
as well as provide certain disclosures and notices to all customers with regard to the
broker-dealer’s Sweep Program.
5.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would
accomplish the stated objectives, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on
small entities. In connection with adopting the final rules, the Commission considered, as
alternatives, establishing different compliance or reporting requirements that take into
account the resources available to smaller entities, exempting smaller entities from

910

17 CFR 240.17a-5(d).

272

coverage of the disclosure requirements, and clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying
disclosure for small entities. 911
As discussed above, the impact on individual small broker-dealers, as well as all
small broker-dealers, should be minimal, and thus the Commission is not establishing
different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables; clarifying, consolidating, or
simplifying compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; or
exempting small entities from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof. The amendments
impose performance standards and do not dictate for entities of any size any particular
design standards (e.g., technology) that must be employed to achieve the objectives of the
amendments.
C.

Holding Futures Positions in a Securities Portfolio Margining Account
1.

Need for and Objectives of the Amendments

The amendments to Rule 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a are designed to accommodate
futures positions in a securities account that is margined on a portfolio basis. 912 Under
SRO portfolio margin rules, a broker-dealer can combine securities and futures positions
in a portfolio margin securities account to compute margin requirements based on the net
market risk of all positions in the account. The amendments to Rule 15c3-3 and 15c3-3a
complement the amendments to SIPA in the Dodd-Frank Act, as well as provide
additional protections to customers through the strengthened reserve requirements of
Rule 15c3-3. In particular, the changes will apply the protections in Rules 15c3-3 and
Rule 15c3-3a to all positions in a portfolio margin account.
These additional protections should make portfolio margining more attractive to
investors. Portfolio margining can significantly reduce customer margin requirements for
911

offsetting positions involving securities and futures products, which in turn reduces the
costs of trading such products.
2.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments

The Commission did not receive any specific comments with respect to this
portion of the IRFA.
3.

Small Entities Subject to the Rules

As discussed above in section V.D.2. of this release, based on FOCUS Report
data, as of December 31, 2011, the Commission estimates that approximately 35 brokerdealers will elect to offer their customers portfolio margin accounts that will include
futures and futures options. None of these broker-dealers are “small” for purposes of
Rule 0-10.
4.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and other Compliance
Requirements

These amendments (1) revise the definition of free credit balances and other credit
balances in Rule 15c3-3 to include funds in a portfolio margin account relating to certain
futures and futures options positions, and (2) add a debit line item to the customer reserve
formula in Rule 15c3-3a consisting of margin posted by a broker-dealer to a derivatives
clearing organization.
5.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

As stated above, the Commission does not believe that any of the broker-dealers
that will elect to offer portfolio margining are “small” for purposes of Rule 0-10.
Further, the requirements imposed by the portfolio margin amendments will be elective.
Therefore, the Commission does not believe it is necessary or appropriate to establish
different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables; clarify, consolidate, or
simplify compliance and reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; or

274

exempting small entities from coverage of the rule, or any part thereof. The amendments
also contain performance standards and do not dictate for entities of any size any
particular design standards (e.g., technology) that must be employed to achieve the
objectives of the proposed amendments.
D.

Securities Lending and Borrowing and Repurchase/Reverse
Repurchase Transactions
1.

Need for and Objectives of the Amendments

These rules amend subparagraph (c)(2)(iv)(B) of Rule 15c3-3 to clarify that
broker-dealers providing securities lending and borrowing settlement services are
deemed, for purposes of the rule, to be acting as principals and are subject to applicable
capital deductions, unless the broker-dealer takes certain steps to disclaim principal
liability. 913 In addition, the Commission is adopting paragraph (c)(5) to Rule 17a-11 to
require that a broker-dealer notify the Commission whenever the total amount of money
payable against all securities loaned or subject to a repurchase agreement exceeds 2,500
percent of tentative net capital. 914 The final rule also exempts a broker-dealer from this
17a-11 notice requirement if it reports monthly its securities lending and borrowing and
repurchase and reverse repurchase activity to its DEA in a form acceptable to its DEA.
In 2001, MJK Clearing, a broker-dealer with a substantial number of customer
accounts, failed when it could not meet its securities lending obligations. This failure has
highlighted the risks associated with securities lending and repurchase and reverse
repurchase agreements and the need to manage those risks. More specifically, two
concerns arose from the failure of MJK, namely, (1) that broker-dealers with principal
liability in a stock loan transaction may erroneously be considering themselves as acting
913

See section II.C. of this release.

914

Id.

275

in an agency capacity and, consequently, not taking appropriate capital charges; and (2)
that broker-dealers that have historically not been very active in stock loan transactions
may be rapidly expanding their balance sheets with such transactions, and thereby,
increase leverage to a level that poses significant financial risk to the firm and its
counterparties.
These amendments are intended to strengthen the documentation controls brokerdealers employ to manage their securities lending and borrowing and securities
repurchase and reverse repurchase activities and to enhance regulatory monitoring. The
intended result of the amendments is to avoid ambiguity regarding the applicability of the
stock loan charges in the net capital rule to a particular broker-dealer. As the failure of
MJK illustrated, disputes can arise over whether a broker-dealer is acting as a principal or
agent in a stock loan transaction. 915
The amendments to paragraph (c)(5) to Rule 17a-11 will help identify brokerdealers with highly leveraged non-government securities lending and borrowing and repo
operations and make it easier for regulators to respond more quickly and protect
customers in the event a firm is approaching insolvency. 916 This notice provision is
designed to alert regulators to a sudden increase in a broker-dealer’s stock loan and repo
positions, which could indicate that the broker-dealer is taking on new risk that it may
have limited experience in managing, as well as to help identify those broker-dealers
highly active in securities lending and repos. Finally, the objective of the exemption
from the notice provision of paragraph (c)(5) of Rule 17a-11 through monthly reporting
is designed to accommodate large broker-dealers that are active in this business and
regularly maintain stock loan and repo balances that exceed the threshold.

3.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule

Based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, the Commission
estimates that none of the broker-dealers that engage in securities lending and borrowing
or securities repurchase and reverse repurchase activity are “small” for the purposes Rule
0-10. Therefore, the amendments should not affect “small” broker-dealers.
4.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance
Requirements

These amendments require broker-dealers to (1) disclose the principals and obtain
certain agreements from the principals in a transaction where they provide settlement
services in order to be considered an agent (as opposed to a principal) for the purposes of
the net capital rule, and (2) provide notice to the Commission and other regulatory
authorities if the broker-dealer’s securities lending or repo activity reaches a certain
threshold or, alternatively, report monthly the broker-dealer’s securities lending and repo
activity to the broker-dealer’s DEA, in a form acceptable to the DEA.
5.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

As noted above, the Commission estimates that this amendment will have no
impact on small entities. Thus, the Commission does not believe it is necessary or
appropriate to establish different compliance or reporting requirements or timetables, nor
is it clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and reporting requirements
under the rule for small entities; or exempt small entities from coverage of the rule, or
any part thereof. The amendments also use performance standards and do not dictate for

277

entities of any size any particular design standards (e.g., technology) that must be
employed to achieve the objectives of the proposed amendments.
E.

Documentation of Risk Management Procedures
1.

Need for and Objectives of the Amendments

Requiring certain large broker-dealers to document and preserve their internal
credit, market, and liquidity risk management controls under paragraph (a)(23) to Rule
17a-3 and (e)(9) to Rule 17a-4 will assist firms in evaluating and adhering to their
established internal risk management controls and regulators in reviewing such
controls. 917
These amendments are intended to strengthen the controls certain large brokerdealers employ to manage risk. These amendments are designed to lower systemic risk
primarily in the securities markets by enhancing risk management through reinforcement
of documentation practices and making it easier for regulators to access a broker-dealer’s
procedures and controls, to ensure a broker-dealer is adhering to such documented
controls.
Additionally, by making the documented controls a required record under Rule
17a-3, a broker-dealer’s regulator likely will have better access to them, as this benefit
will only be realized to the extent a broker-dealer has existing market, credit and liquidity
risk management controls in place because the rule does not specify the type of controls a
broker-dealer must establish to manage these risks. It simply requires the documentation
of the procedures the broker-dealer has established. The final rule amendment will
require any such records of the market, credit, and liquidity risk management controls be

917

See section II.D. of this release.

278

available to the broker-dealer’s regulators so they can review whether the broker-dealer is
adhering to these controls.
2.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments

The Commission did not receive any specific comments with respect to this
portion of the IRFA.
3.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule

These amendments apply to a limited number of broker-dealers, namely, those
firms with more than $1 million in customer credits or $20 million in capital. Based on
FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, the Commission estimates that none of
the broker-dealers that will be subject to this amendment will be “small” for the purposes
Rule 0-10.
4.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance
Requirements

These amendments will require broker-dealers to document any credit, market,
and liquidity risk management controls established and maintained by the broker-dealer
to assist it in analyzing and managing the risks associated with its business activities.
The Commission is not mandating any specific controls, procedures, or policies that must
be established by a broker-dealer to manage market, credit, or liquidity risk. Rather, the
Commission is requiring that a control, procedure, or policy be documented if it is in
place.
5.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

As noted above, these amendments will have no impact on “small” brokerdealers. Thus, the Commission is not establishing different compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables; clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and

279

reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; nor exempting small entities from
coverage of the rule, or any part thereof.
The amendments also use performance standards and do not dictate for entities of
any size any particular design standards (e.g., technology) that must be employed to
achieve the objectives of the amendments.
F.

Amendments to the Net Capital Rule
1.

Need for and Objectives of the Amendments

The amendments to Rule 15c3-1 are designed to address several areas of concern
regarding the financial responsibility requirements for broker-dealers. Some brokerdealers have excluded from their regulatory financial reports certain liabilities that have
been shifted to third parties that lack the resources – independent of the assets and
revenue of the broker-dealer – to pay the liabilities, or have utilized infusions of
temporary capital. These practices may misrepresent the true financial condition of the
broker-dealer and, thereby, impede the ability of regulators to take proactive steps to
reduce the harm to customers, counterparties and clearing agencies that may result from
the broker-dealer’s failure. To address these issues, the Commission is adopting an
amendment to Rule 15c3-1 to add a new paragraph (c)(2)(i)(F) requiring a broker-dealer
to adjust its net worth when calculating net capital by including any liability or expense
for which a third party has assumed the responsibility, unless the broker-dealer can
demonstrate that the third party has adequate resources, independent of the broker-dealer
to pay the liability or expense. 918 In addition, the Commission is adopting amendments
to paragraph (c)(2)(i)(G)(2) of Rule 15c3-1, to require a broker-dealer to subtract from
net worth any contribution of capital to the broker-dealer: (1) under an agreement that

918

See section II.E.1. of this release.

280

provides the investor with the option to withdraw the capital; or (2) that is intended to be
withdrawn within a period of one year of its contribution. Under the final rule, any
withdrawal of capital made within one year of its contribution is deemed to have been
intended to be withdrawn within a period of one year, unless the withdrawal has been
approved in writing by the broker-dealer’s DEA. 919
Further, currently, broker-dealers are required to take net capital charges pursuant
to SRO rules relating to fidelity bond deductibles, but Rule 15c3-1 does not explicitly
incorporate such charges for purposes of computing net capital. To address this
inconsistency, the Commission is adopting paragraph (c)(2)(xiv) to Rule 15c3-1. 920
In addition, a number of broker-dealers have sought to obtain protection under the
bankruptcy laws while still engaging in a securities business. Permitting an insolvent
broker-dealer to continue to transact a securities business endangers its customers and
counterparties and places securities clearing agencies at risk. To address this concern, the
Commission is adopting an amendment to paragraph (a) of Rule 15c3-1 to require a
broker-dealer to cease its securities business activities if certain insolvency events were to
occur, as defined in new paragraph (c)(16) to Rule 15c3-1. 921
Finally, an important goal of the Commission is to protect the financial integrity
of the broker-dealer so that if the firm must liquidate it may do so in an orderly fashion.
Allowing a capital withdrawal that may jeopardize the financial integrity of a brokerdealer exposes customers and creditors of the broker-dealer to unnecessary risk.
Paragraph (e) of Rule 15c3-1, which places certain conditions on a broker-dealer when

281

withdrawing capital, 922 allows the Commission to issue an order temporarily restricting a
broker-dealer from withdrawing capital or making loans or advances to stockholders,
insiders, and affiliates under certain circumstances. 923 The rule, however, limits such
orders to withdrawals, advances, or loans that, when aggregated with all other
withdrawals, advances, or loans on a net basis during a thirty calendar day period, exceed
30% of the firm’s excess net capital. The Commission is amending paragraph (e) to
remove the 30% of excess net capital limitation because the Commission has determined
that the requirement is difficult to enforce, as it generally would not be clear when the
30% threshold had been reached, due to the inherent unreliability of a troubled brokerdealer’s books and records. 924
Finally, the Commission is making permanent a temporary amendment to
Appendix A of Rule 15c3-1, which permits broker-dealers to employ theoretical option
pricing models to calculate haircuts for listed options and related positions that hedge
those options. 925 The temporary amendment decreased the range of pricing inputs to the
approved option pricing models, which effectively reduced the haircuts applied by the
carrying firm with respect to non-clearing option specialist and market maker

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comments

The Commission received three comments in response to requests for comment
related to the amendments to the net capital rule requiring broker-dealers to add back to
its net worth certain liabilities assumed by third parties and treat certain temporary capital
contributions as liabilities. 927
One commenter noted that there should be no circumstance in which a brokerdealer accepted a capital contribution for net capital purposes that could be withdrawn at
the option of the investor. 928 This commenter also noted that if small firms were required
to raise over $300,000 in capital each, there will be the largest dissolution of small
broker-dealers in the history of the regulated securities industry. 929 The commenter
requested that the Commission state a reasonable time period for broker-dealers to raise
capital to meet these new standards. 930 This commenter also stated that the
Commission’s estimate of a gross cost of capital of 7.5% (5% + 2.5%) is a totally
unrealistic cost of capital for small broker-dealers and that these broker-dealers will
categorically have costs significantly higher than 7.5%. 931
Further, the commenter stated that, until the Commission convenes a small
broker-dealer representative panel to assist it with establishing such costs, the

Commission is “speculating” on such costs, and is therefore without adequate
information to consider the effects of such costs and changes on small firms. 932 This
commenter specifically requested the Commission consider the needs of small firms that
will likely require additional net capital over the next decade. 933
Additionally, this commenter believed that the rule is intended to protect the
capitalization of large firms while ignoring small firms. The commenter also noted that it
opposes regulation that arbitrarily reduces the value of small broker-dealers and their
competitive position relative to larger broker-dealers. 934 Finally, the commenter
expressed concern that the proposed amendments to Rule 15c3-1 would be particularly
burdensome on small broker-dealers, negatively impacting capital formation for small
issuers and increasing the cost of capital for small broker-dealers. 935
Another commenter stated that this proposal will require the 702 mentioned debtfree introducing broker-dealers to needlessly take on debt of approximately $280,354. 936
Further, the commenter stated that, if the proposed is approved, it would force the
majority of small firms out of business and ultimately deny investors the right and

932

Id.

933

Id. The commenter stated that any rule that would “restrict small broker-dealers from
raising capital as a result of uncertainty of investors or owner-operators related to the
return of their capital in a reasonable time frame will create a disproportionate and
impossible hurdle for small broker-dealers to overcome.” See NIBA 2 Letter.

934

See NIBA 2 Letter.

935

Id. The commenter noted that broker-dealers “are dealing with a relatively static
commission and fees matrix versus what they may charge customers.” Consequently, the
commenter believes “broker-dealers will be unable to pass any of these costs increases
directly to customers, irrespective of the type of customer or type of business that they
are conducting with small broker-dealers, which further threatens the financial profit
potential and return on equity of small broker-dealers.” Id. The commenter further
believes that the cost increases over a short period of time will threaten the viability of all
small broker-dealers. Id.

opportunity to deal with smaller, more personalized and debt-free member firms. 937 One
commenter stated that it also must be considered that any implementation and
enforcement of these proposed changes should not be made retroactive, because to
subject firms to a new set of rules and guidelines will effectively penalize small firms that
have been in full compliance with the rules and regulations. 938
The Commission considered all comments discussed above and the potential
impact on small broker-dealers. 939 The Commission continues to believe that the
estimated cost of capital is not unrealistic for small broker-dealers. However, as
discussed above in section V. of this release, in response to comments, the Commission
increased the estimated cost of capital for these amendments is 12%.
Moreover, as discussed in section II.E.1 and 2. of this release, the baseline of
these rules is current Rule 15c3-1 and existing guidance and interpretations. The
Commission staff has provided guidance with respect to the treatment and recording of
certain broker-dealer expenses and liabilities that is consistent with the rule
amendment. 940 In addition, existing broker-dealer recordkeeping rules require that a
broker-dealer record its income and expenses. 941 For example, paragraph (a)(2) of Rule
17a-3, requires a broker-dealer to make and keep current ledgers (or other records)
reflecting all assets and liabilities, income and expense and capital accounts. 942
Therefore, the Commission does not expect small broker-dealers to incur significant costs

or burdens to comply with the amendment regarding broker-dealers and payment of
expenses by third parties. 943
At the same time, the purpose of the requirement in new paragraph (c)(2)(i)(F) of
Rule 15c3-1 is to address the practices of a broker-dealer that raise concerns when a
broker-dealer shifts liabilities to an entity with no revenue or assets independent of the
broker-dealer to inappropriately increase its reported net capital, by excluding the liability
from the calculation of net worth. Therefore, the final rule, as discussed above in section
II.E.1. of this release, is designed to prohibit a practice that could misrepresent a brokerdealer’s actual financial condition, deceive the firm’s customers, and hamper the ability
of regulators to monitor the firm’s financial condition.
Moreover, in response to comments, 944 the rule amendment, as adopted, should
not impose burdens or present serious implementation difficulties to small brokerdealers 945 that are appropriately recording their assets and liabilities under current
Commission rules and interpretive guidance. 946 These broker-dealers also should not be
required to obtain loans to increase their capital as a result of the Rule 15c3-1
amendments. Therefore, the Commission does not believe a longer time period for
compliance or the formation of a small broker-dealer advisory cost committee is
necessary. 947
In response to the commenters’ concerns about the negative impact of the rule
amendments on the capital of small broker-dealers, 948 as discussed above, the final rule

See Beer Letter; Levene Letter; NIBA 2 Letter.

286

amendment is a codification of existing Commission staff guidance, 949 and thus should
not represent a change for small broker-dealers with respect to capital withdrawals.
Moreover, with respect to commenters’ concerns about obtaining capital, 950 the rule does
not prohibit an investor from withdrawing capital at any time. Rather, it prohibits a
broker-dealer from treating temporary cash infusions as capital for purposes of the net
capital rule. Finally, the final rule amendments provide a mechanism for a broker-dealer
to apply to its DEA to make a withdrawal within one year of the capital contribution
without triggering the deduction under certain circumstances (e.g., de minimis
withdrawals).
3.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule

Based on FOCUS Report data, as of December 31, 2011, the Commission
estimates that there are approximately 2,506 introducing and carrying broker-dealers that
are “small” for the purposes Rule 0-10. The amendments relating to certain subtractions
from net worth and the restrictions on the withdrawal of capital will apply to all “small”
broker-dealers in that they will be subject to the requirements in the amendments. The
amendment to Appendix A of Rule 15c3-1 likely should have no, or little, impact on
“small” broker-dealers, because based on staff experience, most, if not all, of these firms
do not carry non-clearing option specialist or market maker accounts.
4.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance
Requirements

The amendments will require an “insolvent” broker-dealer to cease conducting a
securities business and provide the securities regulators with notice of its insolvency.
The amendments also will require broker-dealers to deduct from net worth certain
949

See Temporary Capital Letter. See also section II.E.2. of this release.

950

See Beer Letter; NIBA 2 Letter.

287

liabilities and certain temporary capital contributions, as well as require broker-dealers to
deduct from net capital, certain specified amounts as required by SRO fidelity bond rules.
Finally, under the amendment to the rule on Commission orders restricting withdrawals
of capital, a broker-dealer subject to an order will not be permitted to withdraw capital.
Finally, the amendments will make permanent a temporary rule that reduced the haircut
for non-clearing options specialist and market maker accounts under Appendix A to Rule
15c3-1.
5.

Agency Action to Minimize Effect on Small Entities

As discussed in detail above, the Commission considered all comments received
and adopted the amendment substantially as proposed. 951 The Commission understands
the concerns relating to small broker-dealers raised by commenters 952 and reiterates that
the rule is designed to address situations where there is no legitimate reason to book
liabilities to a separate legal entity that otherwise would accrue to the broker-dealer.
Moreover, the final rule is consistent with current staff interpretations regarding thirdparty expense sharing and thus should not represent a change for broker-dealers. The
Commission also notes that the final rule is designed to prohibit a practice that could
misrepresent a broker-dealer’s actual financial condition, deceive the firm’s customers,
and hamper the ability of regulators to monitor the firm’s financial condition. Moreover,
the rule change, as adopted, should not impose undue burdens or present serious
implementation difficulties for large or small broker-dealers. As the Commission
explained in the proposing release, a broker-dealer can demonstrate the adequacy of the
third party’s financial resources by maintaining records such as the third party’s most
951

See section II.E.1. of this release.

952

See Beer Letter; Beer 2 Letter; Levene Letter; Lowenstein Letter; NIBA 2 Letter.
See also discussion in section II.E.1. of this release.

288

recent (i.e., as of a date within the previous twelve months) audited financial statements,
tax returns, or regulatory filings containing financial reports. 953 Given that the entity to
which the broker-dealer is seeking to shift one or more liabilities typically is an affiliate,
the staff’s experience is that such records should be available to the broker-dealer.
Further, because the proposed rule change is consistent with prior staff guidance
regarding the need to be able to demonstrate the third party’s financial adequacy, the
broker-dealer seeking to shift a liability to a third party already would, under existing
staff interpretations, expect to be ready to provide such evidence of the third party’s
financial resources. Taken together, these realities should mitigate the implementation
and burden concerns raised by commenters as they relate to small broker-dealers.
One or more of these record types are generally readily available. The general
availability of a satisfactory measure of financial resources should mitigate the
implementation and burden concerns raised by the commenters.
As discussed above, given the minimal impact these amendments will have on
small entities, the Commission is not establishing different compliance or reporting
requirements or timetables; clarifying, consolidating, or simplifying compliance and
reporting requirements under the rule for small entities; nor exempting small entities from
coverage of the rule, or any part thereof.
The amendments use performance standards and do not dictate for entities of any
size any particular design standards (e.g., technology) that must be employed to achieve
the objectives of the amendments.

§ 240.15c3-3 Customer protection–reserves and custody of securities.
(a) * * *
(3) The term fully paid securities means all securities carried for the account of a
customer in a cash account as defined in Regulation T (12 CFR 220.1 et seq.), as well as
securities carried for the account of a customer in a margin account or any special
account under Regulation T that have no loan value for margin purposes, and all margin
equity securities in such accounts if they are fully paid: Provided, however, that the term
fully paid securities does not apply to any securities purchased in transactions for which
the customer has not made full payment.

298

(4) The term margin securities means those securities carried for the account of a
customer in a margin account as defined in section 4 of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.4), as
well as securities carried in any other account (such accounts hereinafter referred to as
“margin accounts”) other than the securities referred to in paragraph (a)(3) of this section.
*****
(7) The term bank means a bank as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act and will
also mean any building and loan, savings and loan or similar banking institution subject
to supervision by a Federal banking authority. With respect to a broker or dealer that
maintains its principal place of business in Canada, the term “bank” also means a
Canadian bank subject to supervision by a Canadian authority.
(8) The term free credit balances means liabilities of a broker or dealer to
customers which are subject to immediate cash payment to customers on demand,
whether resulting from sales of securities, dividends, interest, deposits or otherwise,
excluding, however, funds in commodity accounts which are segregated in accordance
with the Commodity Exchange Act or in a similar manner, or which are funds carried in a
proprietary account as that term is defined in regulations under the Commodity Exchange
Act. The term “free credit balances” also includes, if subject to immediate cash payment
to customers on demand, funds carried in a securities account pursuant to a selfregulatory organization portfolio margining rule approved by the Commission under
section 19(b) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78s(b)) (“SRO portfolio margining rule”), including
variation margin or initial margin, marks to market, and proceeds resulting from margin
paid or released in connection with closing out, settling or exercising futures contracts
and options thereon.
(9) The term other credit balances means cash liabilities of a broker or dealer to
customers other than free credit balances and funds in commodity accounts which are

299

segregated in accordance with the Commodity Exchange Act or in a similar manner, or
funds carried in a proprietary account as that term is defined in regulations under the
Commodity Exchange Act. The term “other credit balances” also includes funds that are
cash liabilities of a broker or dealer to customers other than free credit balances and are
carried in a securities account pursuant to an SRO portfolio margining rule, including
variation margin or initial margin, marks to market, and proceeds resulting from margin
paid or released in connection with closing out, settling or exercising futures contracts
and options thereon.
*****
(16) The term PAB account means a proprietary securities account of a broker or
dealer (which includes a foreign broker or dealer, or a foreign bank acting as a broker or
dealer) other than a delivery-versus-payment account or a receipt-versus-payment
account. The term does not include an account that has been subordinated to the claims
of creditors of the carrying broker or dealer.
(17) The term Sweep Program means a service provided by a broker or dealer
where it offers to its customer the option to automatically transfer free credit balances in
the securities account of the customer to either a money market mutual fund product as
described in § 270.2a-7 of this chapter or an account at a bank whose deposits are insured
by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.
(b) * * *
(5) A broker or dealer is required to obtain and thereafter maintain the physical
possession or control of securities carried for a PAB account, unless the broker or dealer
has provided written notice to the account holder that the securities may be used in the
ordinary course of its securities business, and has provided an opportunity for the account
holder to object.

300

*****
(d) * * *
(4) Securities included on the broker’s or dealer’s books or records that allocate to
a short position of the broker or dealer or a short position for another person, excluding
positions covered by paragraph (m) of this section, for more than 30 calendar days, then
the broker or dealer must, not later than the business day following the day on which the
determination is made, take prompt steps to obtain physical possession or control of such
securities. For the purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), the 30 day time period will not
begin to run with respect to a syndicate short position established in connection with an
offering of securities until the completion of the underwriter’s participation in the
distribution as determined pursuant to § 242.100(b) of Regulation M of this chapter (17
CFR 242.100 through 242.105); or
*****
(e) Special reserve bank accounts for the exclusive benefit of customers and PAB
accounts. (1) Every broker or dealer must maintain with a bank or banks at all times
when deposits are required or hereinafter specified a “Special Reserve Bank Account for
the Exclusive Benefit of Customers” (hereinafter referred to as the Customer Reserve
Bank Account) and a “Special Reserve Bank Account for Brokers and Dealers”
(hereinafter referred to as the PAB Reserve Bank Account), each of which will be
separate from the other and from any other bank account of the broker or dealer. Such
broker or dealer must at all times maintain in the Customer Reserve Bank Account and
the PAB Reserve Bank Account, through deposits made therein, cash and/or qualified
securities in amounts computed in accordance with the formula attached as Exhibit A (17
CFR 240.15c3-3a), as applied to customer and PAB accounts respectively.

301

(2) With respect to each computation required pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this
section, a broker or dealer must not accept or use any of the amounts under items
comprising Total Credits under the formula referred to in paragraph (e)(1) of this section
except for the specified purposes indicated under items comprising Total Debits under the
formula, and, to the extent Total Credits exceed Total Debits, at least the net amount
thereof must be maintained in the Customer Reserve Bank Account and PAB Reserve
Bank Account pursuant to paragraph (e)(1) of this section.
(3) Reserve Bank Account computations.
(i) Computations necessary to determine the amount required to be deposited in
the Customer Reserve Bank Account and PAB Reserve Bank Account as specified in
paragraph (e)(1) of this section must be made weekly, as of the close of the last business
day of the week, and the deposit so computed must be made no later than one hour after
the opening of banking business on the second following business day; provided,
however, a broker or dealer which has aggregate indebtedness not exceeding 800 percent
of net capital (as defined in § 240.15c3-1) and which carries aggregate customer funds
(as defined in paragraph (a)(10) of this section), as computed at the last required
computation pursuant to this section, not exceeding $1,000,000, may in the alternative
make the Customer Reserve Bank Account computation monthly, as of the close of the
last business day of the month, and, in such event, must deposit not less than 105 percent
of the amount so computed no later than one hour after the opening of banking business
on the second following business day.
(ii) If a broker or dealer, computing on a monthly basis, has, at the time of any
required computation, aggregate indebtedness in excess of 800 percent of net capital,
such broker or dealer must thereafter compute weekly as aforesaid until four successive

302

weekly Customer Reserve Bank Account computations are made, none of which were
made at a time when its aggregate indebtedness exceeded 800 percent of its net capital.
(iii) A broker or dealer that does not carry the accounts of a “customer” as defined
by this section or conduct a proprietary trading business may make the computation to be
performed with respect to PAB accounts under paragraph (e)(1) of this section monthly
rather than weekly. If a broker or dealer performing the computation with respect to PAB
accounts under paragraph (e)(1) of this section on a monthly basis is, at the time of any
required computation, required to deposit additional cash or qualified securities in the
PAB Reserve Bank Account, the broker or dealer must thereafter perform the
computation required with respect to PAB accounts under paragraph (e)(1) of this section
weekly until four successive weekly computations are made, none of which is made at a
time when the broker or dealer was required to deposit additional cash or qualified
securities in the PAB Reserve Bank Account.
(iv) Computations in addition to the computations required in this paragraph
(e)(3), may be made as of the close of any business day, and the deposits so computed
must be made no later than one hour after the opening of banking business on the second
following business day.
(v) The broker or dealer must make and maintain a record of each such
computation made pursuant to this paragraph (e)(3) or otherwise and preserve each such
record in accordance with § 240.17a-4.
(4) If the computation performed under paragraph (e)(3) of this section with
respect to PAB accounts results in a deposit requirement, the requirement may be
satisfied to the extent of any excess debit in the computation performed under paragraph
(e)(3) of this section with respect to customer accounts of the same date. However, a
deposit requirement resulting from the computation performed under paragraph (e)(3) of

303

this section with respect to customer accounts cannot be satisfied with excess debits from
the computation performed under paragraph (e)(3) of this section with respect to PAB
accounts.
(5) In determining whether a broker or dealer maintains the minimum deposits
required under this section, the broker or dealer must exclude the total amount of any
cash deposited with an affiliated bank. The broker or dealer also must exclude cash
deposited with a non-affiliated bank to the extent that the amount of the deposit exceeds
15% of the bank’s equity capital as reported by the bank in its most recent Call Report or
any successor form the bank is required to file by its appropriate Federal banking agency
(as defined by section 3 of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act (12 U.S.C. 1813)).
(f) Notification of banks. A broker or dealer required to maintain a Customer
Reserve Bank Account and PAB Reserve Bank Account prescribed by paragraph (e)(1)
of this section or who maintains a Special Account referred to in paragraph (k) of this
section must obtain and preserve in accordance with § 240.17a-4 a written notification
from each bank with which it maintains a Customer Reserve Bank Account, a PAB
Reserve Bank Account, or a Special Account that the bank was informed that all cash
and/or qualified securities deposited therein are being held by the bank for the exclusive
benefit of the customers and account holders of the broker or dealer in accordance with
the regulations of the Commission, and are being kept separate from any other accounts
maintained by the broker or dealer with the bank, and the broker or dealer must have a
written contract with the bank which provides that the cash and/or qualified securities
will at no time be used directly or indirectly as security for a loan to the broker or dealer
by the bank and will not be subject to any right, charge, security interest, lien, or claim of
any kind in favor of the bank or any person claiming through the bank.

304

(g) Withdrawals from the reserve bank accounts. A broker or dealer may make
withdrawals from a Customer Reserve Bank Account and a PAB Reserve Bank Account
if and to the extent that at the time of the withdrawal the amount remaining in the
Customer Reserve Bank Account and PAB Reserve Bank Account is not less than the
amount then required by paragraph (e) of this section. * * *
*****
(j) Treatment of free credit balances. (1) A broker or dealer must not accept or
use any free credit balance carried for the account of any customer of the broker or dealer
unless such broker or dealer has established adequate procedures pursuant to which each
customer for whom a free credit balance is carried will be given or sent, together with or
as part of the customer’s statement of account, whenever sent but not less frequently than
once every three months, a written statement informing the customer of the amount due
to the customer by the broker or dealer on the date of the statement, and that the funds are
payable on demand of the customer.
(2) A broker or dealer must not convert, invest, or transfer to another account or
institution, credit balances held in a customer’s account except as provided in paragraphs
(j)(2)(i) and (ii) of this section.
(i) A broker or dealer is permitted to invest or transfer to another account or
institution, free credit balances in a customer’s account only upon a specific order,
authorization, or draft from the customer, and only in the manner, and under the terms
and conditions, specified in the order, authorization, or draft.
(ii) A broker or dealer is permitted to transfer free credit balances held in a
customer’s securities account to a product in its Sweep Program or to transfer a
customer’s interest in one product in a Sweep Program to another product in a Sweep
Program, provided:

305

(A) For an account opened on or after the effective date of this paragraph
(j)(2)(ii), the customer gives prior written affirmative consent to having free credit
balances in the customer’s securities account included in the Sweep Program after being
notified:
(1) Of the general terms and conditions of the products available through the
Sweep Program; and
(2) That the broker or dealer may change the products available under the Sweep
Program.
(B) For any account:
(1) The broker or dealer provides the customer with the disclosures and notices
regarding the Sweep Program required by each self-regulatory organization of which the
broker or dealer is a member;
(2) The broker or dealer provides notice to the customer, as part of the customer’s
quarterly statement of account, that the balance in the bank deposit account or shares of
the money market mutual fund in which the customer has a beneficial interest can be
liquidated on the customer’s order and the proceeds returned to the securities account or
remitted to the customer; and
(3)(i) The broker or dealer provides the customer with written notice at least 30
calendar days before:
(A) Making changes to the terms and conditions of the Sweep Program;
(B) Making changes to the terms and conditions of a product currently available
through the Sweep Program;
(C) Changing, adding or deleting products available through the Sweep Program;
or

306

(D) Changing the customer’s investment through the Sweep Program from one
product to another.
(ii) The notice must describe the new terms and conditions of the Sweep Program
or product or the new product, and the options available to the customer if the customer
does not accept the new terms and conditions or product.
*****
(l) Delivery of securities. * * *
(2) Margin securities upon full payment by such customer to the broker or dealer
of the customer’s indebtedness to the broker or dealer; and, subject to the right of the
broker or dealer under Regulation T (12 CFR 220) to retain collateral for its own
protection beyond the requirements of Regulation T, excess margin securities not
reasonably required to collateralize such customer’s indebtedness to the broker or dealer.

Notes Regarding the Customer Reserve Bank Account Computation
Note A. Item 1 must include all outstanding drafts payable to customers which have been
applied against free credit balances or other credit balances and must also include checks drawn
in excess of bank balances per the records of the broker or dealer.
Note B. Item 2 must include the amount of options-related or security futures product-related
Letters of Credit obtained by a member of a registered clearing agency or a derivatives clearing

309

organization which are collateralized by customers’ securities, to the extent of the member’s
margin requirement at the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization. Item 2
must also include the amount of Letters of Credit which are collateralized by customers’ securities
and related to other futures contracts (and options thereon) carried in a securities account
pursuant to an SRO portfolio margining rule.
Note C. Item 3 must include in addition to monies payable against customers’ securities
loaned the amount by which the market value of securities loaned exceeds the collateral value
received from the lending of such securities.
Note D. Item 4 must include in addition to customers’ securities failed to receive the amount
by which the market value of securities failed to receive and outstanding more than thirty (30)
calendar days exceeds their contract value.
Note E. (1) Debit balances in margin accounts must be reduced by the amount by which a
specific security (other than an exempted security) which is collateral for margin accounts
exceeds in aggregate value 15 percent of the aggregate value of all securities which collateralize
all margin accounts receivable; provided, however, the required reduction must not be in excess
of the amounts of the debit balance required to be excluded because of this concentration rule. A
specified security is deemed to be collateral for a margin account only to the extent it represents
in value not more than 140 percent of the customer debit balance in a margin account.
(2) Debit balances in special omnibus accounts, maintained in compliance with the
requirements of Section 7(f) of Regulation T (12 CFR 220.7(f)) or similar accounts carried on
behalf of another broker or dealer, must be reduced by any deficits in such accounts (or if a
credit, such credit must be increased) less any calls for margin, mark to the market, or other
required deposits which are outstanding 5 business days or less.
(3) Debit balances in customers’ cash and margin accounts included in the formula under
Item 10 must be reduced by an amount equal to 1 percent of their aggregate value.
(4) Debit balances in cash and margin accounts of household members and other persons
related to principals of a broker or dealer and debit balances in cash and margin accounts of
affiliated persons of a broker or dealer must be excluded from the Reserve Formula, unless the

310

broker or dealer can demonstrate that such debit balances are directly related to credit items in
the formula.
(5) Debit balances in margin accounts (other than omnibus accounts) must be reduced by the
amount by which any single customer’s debit balance exceeds 25% (to the extent such amount is
greater than $50,000) of the broker-dealer’s tentative net capital (i.e., net capital prior to securities
haircuts) unless the broker or dealer can demonstrate that the debit balance is directly related to
credit items in the Reserve Formula. Related accounts (e.g., the separate accounts of an
individual, accounts under common control or subject to cross guarantees) will be deemed to be
a single customer’s accounts for purposes of this provision.
If the registered national securities exchange or the registered national securities association
having responsibility for examining the broker or dealer (“designated examining authority”) is
satisfied, after taking into account the circumstances of the concentrated account including the
quality, diversity, and marketability of the collateral securing the debit balances or margin
accounts subject to this provision, that the concentration of debit balances is appropriate, then
such designated examining authority may grant a partial or plenary exception from this provision.
The debit balance may be included in the reserve formula computation for five business days
from the day the request is made.
(6) Debit balances in joint accounts, custodian accounts, participation in hedge funds or
limited partnerships or similar type accounts or arrangements that include both assets of a person
or persons who would be excluded from the definition of customer (“noncustomer”) and assets of
a person or persons who would be included in the definition of customer must be included in the
Reserve Formula in the following manner: if the percentage ownership of the non-customer is
less than 5 percent then the entire debit balance shall be included in the formula; if such
percentage ownership is between 5 percent and 50 percent then the portion of the debit balance
attributable to the non-customer must be excluded from the formula unless the broker or dealer
can demonstrate that the debit balance is directly related to credit items in the formula; or if such
percentage ownership is greater than 50 percent, then the entire debit balance must be excluded
from the formula unless the broker or dealer can demonstrate that the debit balance is directly
related to credit items in the formula.

311

Note F. Item 13 must include the amount of margin required and on deposit with the Options
Clearing Corporation to the extent such margin is represented by cash, proprietary qualified
securities and letters of credit collateralized by customers’ securities.
Note G. (a) Item 14 must include the amount of margin required and on deposit with a
clearing agency registered with the Commission under section 17A of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78q-1)
or a derivatives clearing organization registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
under section 5b of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 7a-1) for customer accounts to the
extent that the margin is represented by cash, proprietary qualified securities, and letters of credit
collateralized by customers’ securities.
(b) Item 14 will apply only if the broker or dealer has the margin related to security futures
products, or futures (and options thereon) carried in a securities account pursuant to an approved
SRO portfolio margining program on deposit with:
(1) A registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization that:
(i) Maintains the highest investment-grade rating from a nationally recognized statistical rating
organization; or
(ii) Maintains security deposits from clearing members in connection with regulated options or
futures transactions and assessment power over member firms that equal a combined total of at
least $2 billion, at least $500 million of which must be in the form of security deposits. For the
purposes of this Note G, the term “security deposits” refers to a general fund, other than margin
deposits or their equivalent, that consists of cash or securities held by a registered clearing
agency or derivative clearing organization; or
(iii) Maintains at least $3 billion in margin deposits; or
(iv) Does not meet the requirements of paragraphs (b)(1)(i) through (b)(1)(iii) of this Note G, if
the Commission has determined, upon a written request for exemption by or for the benefit of the
broker or dealer, that the broker or dealer may utilize such a registered clearing agency or
derivatives clearing organization. The Commission may, in its sole discretion, grant such an
exemption subject to such conditions as are appropriate under the circumstances, if the
Commission determines that such conditional or unconditional exemption is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, and is consistent with the protection of investors; and

312

(2) A registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization that, if it holds funds or
securities deposited as margin for security futures products or futures in a portfolio margin
account in a bank, as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6)), obtains and
preserves written notification from the bank at which it holds such funds and securities or at which
such funds and securities are held on its behalf. The written notification will state that all funds
and/or securities deposited with the bank as margin (including customer security futures products
and futures in a portfolio margin account), or held by the bank and pledged to such registered
clearing agency or derivatives clearing agency as margin, are being held by the bank for the
exclusive benefit of clearing members of the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization (subject to the interest of such registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization therein), and are being kept separate from any other accounts maintained by the
registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization with the bank. The written
notification also will provide that such funds and/or securities will at no time be used directly or
indirectly as security for a loan to the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization by the bank, and will be subject to no right, charge, security interest, lien, or claim of
any kind in favor of the bank or any person claiming through the bank. This provision, however,
will not prohibit a registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization from pledging
customer funds or securities as collateral to a bank for any purpose that the rules of the
Commission or the registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization otherwise
permit; and
(3) A registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization establishes, documents,
and maintains:
(i) Safeguards in the handling, transfer, and delivery of cash and securities;
(ii) Fidelity bond coverage for its employees and agents who handle customer funds or
securities. In the case of agents of a registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing
organization, the agent may provide the fidelity bond coverage; and
(iii) Provisions for periodic examination by independent public accountants; and
(iv) A derivatives clearing organization that, if it is not otherwise registered with the
Commission, has provided the Commission with a written undertaking, in a form acceptable to the

313

Commission, executed by a duly authorized person at the derivatives clearing organization, to the
effect that, with respect to the clearance and settlement of the customer security futures products
and futures in a portfolio margin account of the broker or dealer, the derivatives clearing
organization will permit the Commission to examine the books and records of the derivatives
clearing organization for compliance with the requirements set forth in § 240.15c3-3a, Note G
(b)(1) through (3).
(c) Item 14 will apply only if a broker or dealer determines, at least annually, that the
registered clearing agency or derivatives clearing organization with which the broker or dealer
has on deposit margin related to securities future products or futures in a portfolio margin account
meets the conditions of this Note G.
Notes Regarding the PAB Reserve Bank Account Computation
Note 1. Broker-dealers should use the formula in Exhibit A for the purposes of computing the
PAB reserve requirement, except that references to “accounts,” “customer accounts, or
“customers” will be treated as references to PAB accounts.
Note 2. Any credit (including a credit applied to reduce a debit) that is included in the
computation required by § 240.15c3-3 with respect to customer accounts (the “customer reserve
computation”) may not be included as a credit in the computation required by § 240.15c3-3 with
respect to PAB accounts (the “PAB reserve computation”).
Note 3. Note E(1) to § 240.15c3-3a does not apply to the PAB reserve computation.
Note 4. Note E(3) to § 240.15c3-3a which reduces debit balances by 1% does not apply to
the PAB reserve computation.
Note 5. Interest receivable, floor brokerage, and commissions receivable of another broker
or dealer from the broker or dealer (excluding clearing deposits) that are otherwise allowable
assets under § 240.15c3-1 need not be included in the PAB reserve computation, provided the
amounts have been clearly identified as payables on the books of the broker or dealer.
Commissions receivable and other receivables of another broker or dealer from the broker or
dealer that are otherwise non-allowable assets under § 240.15c3-1 and clearing deposits of
another broker or dealer may be included as “credit balances” for purposes of the PAB reserve
computation, provided the commissions receivable and other receivables are subject to

314

immediate cash payment to the other broker or dealer and the clearing deposit is subject to
payment within 30 days.
Note 6. Credits included in the PAB reserve computation that result from the use of
securities held for a PAB account (“PAB securities”) that are pledged to meet intra-day margin
calls in a cross-margin account established between the Options Clearing Corporation and any
regulated derivatives clearing organization may be reduced to the extent that the excess margin
held by the other clearing corporation in the cross-margin relationship is used the following
business day to replace the PAB securities that were previously pledged. In addition, balances
resulting from a portfolio margin account that are segregated pursuant to Commodity Futures
Trading Commission regulations need not be included in the PAB Reserve Bank Account
computation.
Note 7. Deposits received prior to a transaction pending settlement which are $5 million or
greater for any single transaction or $10 million in aggregate may be excluded as credits from the
PAB reserve computation if such balances are placed and maintained in a separate PAB Reserve
Bank Account by 12 p.m. Eastern Time on the following business day. Thereafter, the money
representing any such deposits may be withdrawn to complete the related transactions without
performing a new PAB reserve computation.
Note 8. A credit balance resulting from a PAB reserve computation may be reduced by the
amount that items representing such credits are swept into money market funds or mutual funds
of an investment company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 on or prior to
10 a.m. Eastern Time on the deposit date provided that the credits swept into any such fund are
not subject to any right, charge, security interest, lien, or claim of any kind in favor of the
investment company or the broker or dealer. Any credits that have been swept into money market
funds or mutual funds must be maintained in the name of a particular broker or for the benefit of
another broker.
Note 9. Clearing deposits required to be maintained at registered clearing agencies may be
included as debits in the PAB reserve computation to the extent the percentage of the deposit,
which is based upon the clearing agency’s aggregate deposit requirements (e.g., dollar trading
volume), that relates to the proprietary business of other brokers and dealers can be identified.

315

Note 10. A broker or dealer that clears PAB accounts through an affiliate or third party
clearing broker must include these PAB account balances and the omnibus PAB account balance
in its PAB reserve computation.
