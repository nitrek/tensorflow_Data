These slides were presented at the Forums on Auditing in the Small Business
Environment hosted by the PCAOB during 2009. Participants were auditors from
smaller registered public accounting firms. The slides are intended to provide a
sampling of issues that the CF Staff frequently encounters when reviewing filings
for smaller public companies as well as an overview of developments within the
Division of Corporation Finance. Comments issued by the CF Staff may be
different or additional to those included here based upon individual facts and
circumstances. The slides are accompanied by detailed footnotes that provide
additional context.

Division of Corporation Finance
(DCF)
Mission – “To see that investors are provided with
material information in order to make informed
investment decisions — both when a company
initially offers its stock to the public and on a
regular basis as it continues to give information
to the marketplace.”
 Selectively review the disclosure documents filed by

public companies (including initial registrations)

 Provide interpretive assistance to companies on SEC 

rules and forms 

 Propose new and revised rules to the Commission

Organization
 11 industry groups

 Legal and Regulatory Policy Offices

The Division of Corporation Finance assists the Commission in executing its
responsibility to oversee corporate disclosure of important information to the
investing public. Corporations are required to comply with regulations pertaining to
disclosure that must be made when stock is initially sold and then on a continuing
and periodic basis. The Division of Corporation Finance Staff (“CF Staff”) routinely
reviews the disclosure documents filed by companies. The Staff also provides
companies with assistance interpreting the Commission's rules and recommends to
the Commission new rules for adoption.
The Division of Corporation Finance reviews documents that publicly-held
companies are required to file with the Commission. These documents disclose
information about the companies' financial condition and business practices to help
investors make informed investment decisions. Through the Division's review
process, the CF Staff checks to see if publicly-held companies are meeting their
disclosure requirements and seeks to improve the quality of the disclosure.
Corporation Finance provides administrative interpretations of the Securities Act of
1933, the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, and
recommends regulations to implement these statutes. The CF Staff provides guidance
and counseling to registrants, prospective registrants, and the public to help them
comply with the law and related regulations. For example, a company might ask
whether the offering of a particular security requires registration with the SEC.
Corporation Finance would share its interpretation of the relevant securities
regulations with the company and give its informal advice on compliance with the
appropriate disclosure requirement. The Division uses no-action letters and
interpretive letters to provide guidance on the regulations in a more formal manner.

From http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/cffilingreview.htm:
The Division performs its primary review responsibilities through eleven offices
Staffed with approximately 80 percent of the Division’s employees. The members
of these eleven offices have specialized industry, accounting, and disclosure
expertise. The Division assigns filings by companies in a particular industry to one
of the eleven Assistant Director Offices. The Division has Staffed each office with
25 to 35 professionals, primarily accountants and lawyers. An Associate Director
(Paul Belvin, James Daly, or Barry Summer) oversees each Assistant Director
Office. The Deputy Director (Shelley Parratt) and Director (Meredith Cross)
oversee the entire filing review process.

The Division’s Office of Chief Accountant (CF-OCA) answers questions regarding
financial reporting and related issues, including the requirements relating to the
form and content of financial statements required to be included in Commission
filings. Questions may be submitted to CF-OCA by telephone and by online form.
Letters requesting a waiver or accommodation relating to certain financial reporting
requirements may be submitted to CF-OCA via dcaoletters@sec.gov. Companies
and their advisors seeking interpretive guidance or informal advice on applying the
Commission’s financial reporting requirements, such as Regulation S-X, should
contact CF-OCA.
CF-OCA works closely with the Division’s Disclosure Operations Groups in
resolving accounting and financial reporting issues that arise through the comment
letter process. The office also works closely with the Commission’s Office of the
Chief Accountant in addressing pre-filing submissions on the application of GAAP
pertaining to specific registrants.

The Chief Accountant is principal adviser to the Commission on accounting and
auditing matters. The Office of the Chief Accountant assists the Commission in
executing its responsibility under the securities laws to establish accounting
principles, and for overseeing the private sector standards-setting process. The
Office works closely with the Financial Accounting Standards Board, to which the
SEC has delegated authority for accounting standards setting.
In addition to its responsibility for accounting standards, the Commission is
responsible for the approval or disapproval of rules put forward by the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board, a private-sector regulator established by the
Sarbanes-Oxley Act to oversee the auditing profession. The Commission also has
oversight responsibility for all of the activities of the PCAOB, including approval of
its annual budget. To assist the Commission in the execution of these
responsibilities, the Office of the Chief Accountant is the principal liaison with the
PCAOB. The Office also consults with registrants and auditors on a regular basis
regarding the application of accounting and auditing standards.
Because of its expertise and ongoing involvement with questions concerning the
financial books and records of public companies registered with the SEC, including
their independent auditors, the Office of the Chief Accountant is often called upon
to assist in addressing issues that arise in the context of Commission enforcement
actions.

The Office of Small Business Policy (OSBP) answers questions on disclosure and
other issues relating to smaller public companies, including those classified as
"smaller reporting companies," and on limited, private, and intrastate offerings of
securities. Examples of specific topics about which OSBP answers questions
include:
•Regulation D — Rules 504, 505, and 506 — and Form D
•Section 3(a)(11) and Rule 147 — intrastate securities offerings
•Rule 701 — equity incentive compensation for employees of non-Exchange
Act reporting companies, both domestic and foreign
•Regulation A
Questions may be submitted to OSBP by telephone or by on-line form. Letters
requesting a no-action position or interpretive advice also may be submitted to
OSBP. In addition, OSBP acts as the Division's liaison to the state securities
regulators on corporate finance issues and the Small Business Administration.
OSBP assists in and reviews rulemaking initiatives, as well as other Commission
actions, which may have small business implications.
OSBP also reaches out to smaller companies to facilitate capital formation. These
efforts include coordinating the annual SEC Government-Business Forum on Small
Business Capital Formation, which focuses on the current status of issues and
programs related to small business capital formation.

As required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, the Division undertakes some level
of review of each reporting company at least once every three years and reviews a
significant number of companies more frequently. In addition, the Division
selectively reviews transactional filings – documents companies file when they
engage in public offerings, business combination transactions, and proxy
solicitations.
In deciding how to allocate staff resources among filings, the Division undertakes a
substantive evaluation of each company’s disclosure in what it calls a preliminary
review. To preserve the integrity of the selective review process, the Division does
not publicly disclose its preliminary review criteria. Based on its preliminary
review, the Division decides whether to undertake any further review of the
company’s filings or whether the company’s disclosure appears to be substantially
in compliance with the applicable accounting principles and the federal securities
laws and regulations.
In addition, the CF Staff also reviews each Form 8-K filed on Items 4.01 and 4.02
for compliance with the disclosure requirements and issues comment letters as
necessary.

Types of Comments
Request for additional supplemental

No further comments letter

12

Levels of Review
If the Division selects a filing for further review, the level of further review may be:
•a full cover-to-cover review in which the CF Staff will examine the entire filing
for compliance with the applicable requirements of the federal securities laws and
regulations;
•a financial statement review in which the CF Staff will examine the financial
statements and related disclosure for compliance with the applicable accounting
standards and the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and
regulations; or
•a targeted issue review in which the CF Staff will examine the filing for one or
more specific items of disclosure for compliance with the applicable accounting
standards and/or the disclosure requirements of the federal securities laws and
regulations.
Staff Comments
The Division views the comment process as a dialogue with a company about its
disclosure. The Division’s comments are in response to a company’s disclosure and other
public information and are based on the CF Staff’s understanding of that company’s facts
and circumstances. In issuing comments to a company, the CF Staff may request that a
company provide additional supplemental information so we can better understand the
company’s disclosure, revise disclosure in a document on file with the SEC, provide
additional disclosure in a document on file with the SEC, or provide additional or
different disclosure in a future filing with the SEC.

12

Comment Letter Process

Best Practices for Resolving Issues
 Prepare a thorough response
• An invitation to dialogue
• Key response to initial comment
• Indicate specifically where revisions have been made
• Discuss supporting authoritative literature in detail

 Inform Staff if you are unable to respond by the 

requested date

 Document accounting decisions contemporaneously

 Furnish all correspondence with the Staff on EDGAR

13

A company generally responds to each comment in a letter to the CF Staff. A company’s
explanation or analysis of an issue will often satisfactorily resolve a comment. Depending on
the nature of the issue, the CF Staff’s concern, and the company’s response, the CF Staff may
issue additional comments following its review of the company’s response to its prior
comments. This comment and response process continues until the CF Staff and the company
resolve the comments. In some cases, the CF Staff an amendment to a previously filed report
may be necessary as the result of comments.
It is helpful when registrants take the time to prepare a thorough response. A good response
focuses on the specific questions asked by the CF Staff, yet is sufficiently robust to allow the
CF Staff to fully understand the accounting and/or disclosure at question. If the registrant has
revised its filing or plans on revising its filing in response to the CF Staff’s comments, it is
also very helpful to provide proposed disclosure or marked pages. If the CF Staff has asked a
question on the registrant’s basis for a particular accounting treatment, it is helpful for the
registrant to refer to any literature in GAAP that it relied upon to reach its conclusions.
Again, providing a detailed and complete explanation to the CF Staff in response to the initial
comment letter may lessen the likelihood of future comments or at least narrow the dialogue.
If you unable to respond by the date requested in the letter, you can contact the CF Staff and
discuss the date on which you expect to respond.
Finally, it may be easier to respond to comments if you have documented your significant
accounting decisions contemporaneously with the literature you relied upon, the alternatives
considered, and the basis for your conclusions.

XBRL – Registrants must include financial statements and any applicable financial 

statement schedules in XBRL format as an exhibit to both filings made on EDGAR and on 

the company’s website. This requirement to Securities Act registration statements (other

than IPOs), quarterly and annual reports, and transition reports, as well as reports on Forms 

8-K or 6-K that contain specified financial statements. The XBRL rules apply to domestic 

and foreign companies (US GAAP & IFRS) and were effective for the largest of accelerated 

filers this year (for calendar year-end companies). Smaller reporting companies are required 

to comply with the rules by latter half of 2011 at the latest. 

The Oil and Gas release is designed to modernize and update the oil and gas disclosure 

requirements to align them with current practices and changes in technology. 

Proposed Roadmap – lists seven milestones which, if achieved, could lead to the use of 

IFRS by U.S. issuers in their flings with the Commission. The comment period closed on

April 20, 2009 and comments are currently under consideration.

Technical Amendment – In April 2009, the Commission approved various technical

amendments throughout the SEC rules to conform to changes in US GAAP as the result of

the effectiveness of SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160.

On October 2, 2009, the Commission announced that nonaccelerated filers will need to 

begin complying with auditor attestation requirements of Sarbanes-Oxley Act Secion 404(b)

for all fiscal years ending on or after June 15, 2010. In this regard, on October 13, the 

Commission issued Release No. 33-9072 extending the fiscal period end compliance date 

from December 15, 2009 to June 15, 2010. This change effectively defers the requirement 

another year for calendar year-end companies that are nonaccelerated filers.

In December 2008, the Staff in the Division of Corporation Finance published its Financial
Reporting Manual. The Manual is designed to be an internal reference document for the CF Staff;
however, it has been published on the website in the interest of transparency. Due to its informal
nature, it does not necessarily contain a discussion of all material considerations necessary to reach a
conclusion. However, we believe that the Manual can be a helpful resource for registrants to
consider in their financial reporting. We plan to update the Manual on a periodic basis (generally
quarterly) for any changes.
The CF Staff has also begun publishing Compliance and Disclosure Interpretations (“C&DIs”) on the
Division of Corporation Finance page of the SEC website. These interpretations have replaced the
previously published Telephone Interpretations Manual. They are categorized by rule, regulation or
form and are updated on a regular basis. They cover a broad range of topics that may include
financial reporting in some circumstances. The CF Staff notifies the public of updates to the Manual
and C&DIs via a “What’s New?” link on the website.
In March 2008 and September 2008, the Division Staff sent letters to certain registrants with
suggested disclosures related to fair value measurements for consideration in preparing
Management’s Discussion and Analysis. For the benefit of all preparers, the letters have been made
publicly available on the Corporation Finance page of the SEC website. The March letter is focused
on disclosure related to the use of unobservable inputs in fair value measurements. The September
letter addresses the judgments and assumptions underlying fair value measurements, the sensitivity of
the measurements to those assumptions, and details about the methodology and inputs.
In August 2009, the Division Staff issued a letter to certain companies pertaining to disclosures
regarding provisions and allowances for loan losses which also included on the website. This letter
pertains to the reconsiderations of various judgments in light of the current economic crisis. It
primarily covers higher risk loans, changes in practices, and declines in collateral value.

17

The SEC Staff is a valuable resource for various regulatory and reporting questions.
Each of the Legal and Regulatory Policy offices within the Division responds to
telephone inquiries from the public seeking interpretive guidance. In order to
facilitate this process, the CF Staff created a web-based request form for the general
use of the public. The form (hyperlinked above) allows an individual to submit a
detailed questions with any supporting literature and direct it to a particular office
within the Division. The use of the form as opposed to the telephone should
expedite a complete response depending on the level of information provided.
In April 2009, June 2009, and October 2009, the Staff issued SABs 111, 112, and
113, respectively. The intent of each of these SABs was to align previously
published staff guidance with changes in GAAP and SEC rules, specifically FASB
Staff Position No. FAS 115-2 and FAS 124-2, SFAS 141(R) and SFAS 160, and the
SEC’s FR-78 related to oil and gas reporting.
Recently, the Staff has seen a growing number of principal stockholder and
executive officers of smaller companies enter into escrowed share arrangements on
behalf of the registrant in financing transactions. In the SEC Staff Announcement
from June 2009 (EITF Topic D-110), the Staff clarified SEC Staff views on
overcoming the presumption that for certain shareholders these arrangements
represent compensation.

On June 30, 2009, the FASB issued FASB Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 168,
The FASB Accounting Standards Codification and the Hierarchy of Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles – a replacement of FASB Statement No. 162 (Statement No. 168), to establish the FASB
Codification as the source of authoritative non-Commission accounting principles recognized by the
FASB to be applied by nongovernmental entities in the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (“U.S. GAAP”). Statement No. 168
was effective for financial statements issued for interim and annual periods ending after September
15, 2009. The FASB Codification reorganizes existing U.S. accounting and reporting standards
issued by the FASB and other related private-sector standard setters, and all guidance contained in
the FASB Codification carries an equal level of authority.
In conjunction with the Codification, the Commission issued an interpretive release (No. 33-9062A).
Since the Codification superseded all references to U.S. GAAP and SEC rules, regulations, and
forms have not yet been revised accordingly, the interpretive release advises preparers to look to the
appropriate codification reference as outlined in the cross-reference table when using GAAP
references in SEC rules, regulations, or forms.
In response to the Codification, Companies might also reconsider their accounting policy disclosures.
While legacy GAAP references are inappropriate within footnote disclosures with the release of the
codification, companies are encouraged to revisit their policy disclosures and ensure they are in plain
English. In many cases, references to accounting literature may not be necessary if your actual policy
is clearly disclosed. A similar rethinking may also apply to disclosures presented under SAB 74
pertaining to the adoption of new accounting pronouncements.
Certain SEC rules, regulations, SABs, and Staff Announcements from EITF meetings have been
included in the Codification for ease of reference and as a convenience. Only those requirements and
Staff positions that apply to preparing a set of GAAP financial statements have been included. Many
other SEC rules, regulations, SABs, and Staff Announcements have not been included, therefore,
when referring to SEC materials, registrants should continue to refer to the source material.

21

GAAP requires that companies consider whether an event has occurred that “would more
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.” In
reviewing disclosures, CF Staff may consider certain publicly available information in and out
of the company’s filings in assessing whether it seems likely that such an event has occurred.
It may be helpful for companies to consider the following events or indicators in considering
whether an interim impairment test is appropriate: (1) Other impairment charges (2) Cash or
operating losses at reporting unit level (3) Industry factors (4) Revisions to forecasts (5)
Restructuring plans
Generally, the assumptions used to value goodwill should be consistent with assumptions used
in valuing other assets allocated to the reporting unit such as long-lived assets, intangible
assets, and deferred tax assets. For example, if the reporting unit for a retail chain is a
particular store or geographic area, we would expect the estimated future cash flows and
discount rates related to acquired franchise rights, customer relationships, and in some cases,
PP&E to be impacted in a similar fashion as goodwill by current events.
CF Staff continues to focus on the measurement of certain investments that may be held by
any company regardless of size or industry in light of the current economic environment. The
FASB has provided additional guidance on how companies should consider whether an
investment trades in an active market for determining fair value as well as guidance on the
measurement and recognition of other than temporary impairment. Equity securities continue
to be evaluated based upon the ability and intent to hold to recovery. These judgments are
expected to be consistent with other disclosures throughout the filing including going concern,
liquidity in MD&A, etc. For debt securities, GAAP requires that companies consider whether
it intends to sell the debt security or it is more likely than not that it will be required to sell the
debt security prior to its recovery of amortized cost. These conclusions should also be
consistent with other disclosures throughout the filing.

Impact of the Financial Crisis on
the Financial Statements
 Accounts receivable
•	 Consider current events in estimating allowances for
uncollectible accounts (“historical experience” may
not be sufficient)

 Inventory
•	 Lower of cost or market valuations - Impact of price

•	 Obsolescence considerations

 Deferred tax asset (valuation allowances)
 Disclosure of Risks and Uncertainties (SOP 946) (ASC Topic 275)

22

Most companies have established policies for reserving and writing off accounts receivable based upon aging
or a standard percentage. In this current time, delinquencies are on the increase. While the market may recover
allowing companies to get back to their historical collection rates, companies should not ignore the current
environment’s impact on delinquencies on the receivables they currently have recorded in their financial
statements.
Consumer spending has been greatly affected as a result of the economic crisis. Inventory has been turning
over more slowly. As a result, companies need to carefully consider their inventory valuations. As inventory
turnover begins to decline each period, the CF Staff may raise questions about price and lower of cost or
market evaluations. Comments may seek to understand the price at which the company is currently selling its
product in comparison to cost and if the product is not selling whether the company has considered
obsolescence.
Companies should consider the impact of the current economic environment on the realizability of their
deferred tax assets. It is helpful disclosure to clearly explain the approach for determining whether a valuation
allowance is appropriate. It also may be helpful for readers to understand what new evidence the company has
obtained related to the realization of deferred tax assets and how it has evaluated that evidence in reaching its
conclusions. Due to changes in the economic environment and increased negative evidence, companies may
adjust their tax planning strategies to increase the likelihood of utilizing deferred tax assets. If deferred tax
assets are only realizable as the result of changes in tax planning strategies to overcome new negative evidence,
it is helpful for preparers to discuss those changes in addition to the impact that those changes may have on the
business other than as they relate to income taxes.
In all of the areas discussed above, the CF Staff encourages companies to consider the need for “early warning”
disclosures in the notes to the financial statements under FASB ASC Topic 275. To the extent an impairment
charge or valuation allowance was not recorded or to the extent that a partial valuation allowance was recorded,
it is helpful to put investors “on notice” if it is reasonably possible that a charge or additional charge could be
recorded in a future period.

Management’s Discussion &
Analysis (MD&A)
Release Nos. 33-6835 and 33-8350
Best Practices
 Executive-level overview (including discussion of impact
of current economic conditions)
 Critical accounting estimates
•	 Provide insight into the quality and variability of
financial information (including fair value
measurements)
•	 Discuss significant estimates and assumptions used
by management when evaluating assets for
recoverability
 Comparative results of operations that are thorough and
address the key drivers of change
 Early warning disclosures – Item 303(a)(3)(ii) of 

Regulation S-K

23

MD&A has three general objectives: to provide a narrative explanation of a company’s financial
statements through the eyes of management; to enhance the overall financial disclosure and provide the
context within which financial information should be analyzed; and to provide information about the
quality of, and potential variability of, a company's earnings and cash flow, so that investors can ascertain
the likelihood that past performance is indicative of the future.
In accomplishing these objectives, CF Staff generally recommends that companies provide an overview
highlighting BOTH financial and non-financial key performance indicators as background to
understanding the company’s overall performance for the periods.
Depending on the nature of a company’s operations, it may have certain estimates that have a material
impact on the underlying financial statements and are subject to significant judgment and uncertainty.
With the intent of providing insight in to the quality and variability of the financial statements,
management is encouraged to clearly identify those estimates, provide readers with an understanding of
the methodology and underlying assumptions to arrive at the estimate and analyze the impact that
reasonable changes in the assumptions could have on the financial statements.
The CF Staff often finds that registrants do not adequately discuss the factors contributing to fluctuations
in operating activities from period to period. The discussion of fluctuations should help readers
understand the factors that contributed to changes in underlying line items and the magnitude of their
impact.
Equally important as the disclosure of impairment losses may be the disclosure of “non-impairments” or
“non-events” in certain situations. MD&A requires companies to disclose known uncertainties that the
registrant reasonably expects will have a material impact on income from continuing operations. Using
goodwill as an example, registrants may want to consider, for example, providing appropriate disclosures
when they have triggered an impairment test and come close to failing Step 1. Similarly, in cases where
they have actually failed Step 1, but concluded that an impairment charge is not necessary under Step 2, it
could also be useful to put investors “on notice.” Finally, registrants may want to consider warning
investors in situations where they have not yet triggered an interim impairment test, but events that are
reasonably likely to occur may require it in the near future. The Staff may issue comments to companies
in situations where the events that trigger an impairment or other charge appear to have been predictable
in an earlier period but the circumstances were never addressed in disclosure previously.

Finally, companies tend to overlook the importance of a discussion of liquidity and capital resources. A good
discussion focuses on how the company has been able to meet its cash requirements in historical periods
through a thorough analysis of the statements of cash flows and how they expect to meet them in the future
through a discussion of commitments, debt covenants, and significant contractual obligations.
Specifically, companies should consider including a thorough discussion of the sources and uses of cash and
any trends and uncertainties pertaining to such sources and uses. This includes a discussion of operating cash
flows that addresses the actual drivers of operating cash flow rather than the line items in the reconciliation
from net income to operating cash flow. A discussion of actual cash inflows and outflows also facilitates a
discussion of known trends and uncertainties.
Additionally, companies should consider providing insight into their sources and uses of cash going beyond
saying that they will meet their needs in the future. In other words, how much of a line of credit will be drawn,
how much will be funded from operations, etc? To enhance disclosure, consider explaining the company’s use
of its facility, whether there is any excess availability during peak borrowing situations, any uncertainty
regarding access to the facility (whether due to market or company specific conditions), and the implications of
not being able to access it.
In the past year, an increasing number of companies have concluded that there is substantial doubt regarding
their ability to continue as a going concern. In such cases, it should explain the circumstances that have created
the issue and any expectations or plans to resolve the going concern issue or at least improve the situation.
If there is a reasonable likelihood that the company may default on material covenants, consider discussing that
likelihood (including disclosure of the metric and how the company currently compares) as well as whether the
company can avoid or cure the future default. The company also should consider addressing whether the
defaulted debt can be refinanced and identify any cross-default provisions or other significant implications.
Finally, to the extent that there are any contractual restrictions limiting the ability of any subsidiary to transfer
cash to its parent, you might explain how the restrictions limit the ability to transfer funds to its parent and the
impact the restrictions have had and are expected to have on the parent’s ability to meet its cash obligations.

Interpretation 215.02

25

“Back door” registration refers to a private operating company merging with a public shell, thereby gaining the ability to
issue public stock. This method of registration is reported on a Form 8-K rather than a 1933 Act registration statement.
There are several accounting and reporting complexities with these transactions. They can be more problematic in the
review process because they have already been reported and consummated, therefore amendments or changes can be
more complicated and burdensome compared to resolving comments on the review of a pre-effective registration
statement.
Unless the same audit firm audited both the registrant and the accounting acquirer, a reverse merger always results in
change of accountants for purposes of Item 4.01 of Form 8-K.
Item 9.01(c) of Form 8-K indicates that financial statements for reverse mergers with public shells must be filed within
four business days and the 71 day extension under Item 9.01 for Rule 3-05 financial statements does not apply. If these
are not filed within the four day deadline, registrant may not be considered current or timely for the purposes of using
certain forms. Additionally, that Form 8-K is required to include all the disclosures that the operating company or
accounting acquirer would be required to present in a registration statement on Form 10.
When the 8-K is filed shortly after year end or quarter end, the most recent year end or quarter end is generally not
included in the financial statements. Exchange Act Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 are designed to prevent a gap in reporting
after a conventional IPO by requiring the filing of an annual or quarterly report that includes the most recent year or
quarter end. Keep in mind that the basic requirement for the 8-K is to provide all the content required by a Form 10
registration statement. Similarly, an accounting acquirer should not have a gap in reporting after a merger with a shell
company. Therefore, CF Staff has advised registrants to file an amended 8-K within the same timing as the periodic
report would be due to provide updated financial statements.
While the historical financial reporting for pre-transaction periods may change to that of the operating company once the
transaction has occurred, the legal issuer has not changed in this transaction and therefore is not a newly public company
for purposes of Sarbanes-Oxley Act Section 404. However, CF Staff has issued a C&DI to provide guidance to
companies who find themselves in this situation. It acknowledges that it might not always be possible to conduct an
assessment of the private operating company or accounting acquirer’s internal control over financial reporting in the
period between the consummation date of a reverse acquisition and the date of management’s assessment of internal
control over financial reporting required by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K. It also recognizes that in many of these
transactions, such as those in which the legal acquirer is a non-operating public shell company, the internal controls of the
legal acquirer may no longer exist as of the assessment date or the assets, liabilities, and operations may be insignificant
when compared to the consolidated entity. Therefore, CF Staff does not object if the surviving issuer excludes
management’s assessment of ICFR in the Form 10-K covering the fiscal year in which the transaction was consummated.
However, we do not believe that companies should take advantage of this C&DI if they had to file an amended Form 8-K
under the 13a-1 interpretation discussed above.

 Audit Issues

27

Under current accounting literature, the acquisition of a private operating company by a nonoperating public shell is considered by the CF Staff to be a capital transaction in substance rather
than a business combination (it is outside the scope of FASB ASC Topic 805). That is, the
transaction may be viewed as a reverse recapitalization -- issuance of stock by the private company
for the net monetary assets of the shell corporation accompanied by a recapitalization.
As it relates to audit issues, the audit requirements will depend on whether the registrant is a public
shell or public operating company. In situations in which the registrant is a public shell requiring the
Form 10-level disclosure in the 8-K, the financial statements must be audited by a PCAOB
registered firm and audited in accordance with PCAOB standards. When the registrant is an
operating company, the accounting acquirer’s financial statements are being presented under Rule
3-05 which would not require a registered firm or an audit in accordance with PCAOB standards.
However, it is important to note that since those financial statements will become the financial
statements of the registrant they must be in accordance with PCAOB standards when included in the
next Form 10-K and any new audit work must be performed by a registered firm.
Finally, CF Staff has been seeing many situations in which the accounting acquirer is foreign
company; however, the audit has been performed by a domestic firm. The CF Staff may issue
comments on the ability of the domestic firm to perform fieldwork on the foreign company in light
of the distance and language barriers. To the extent that the domestic firm has relied on a firm
overseas, it may raise questions about the registration of the foreign firm if it has played a
substantial role in the audit as defined by the PCAOB and even whether the domestic firm is in fact
the principal auditor.

Predecessor Financial Statements

	 Common in SPAC mergers
28

The threshold question when reviewing disclosures related to a business combination is “Is
the transaction an acquisition of a business or assets?” Rule 11-01(d) of Regulation S-X
defines a business for determining when separate financial statements are required to be
filed with the SEC. The principle in the rule is whether there is sufficient continuity so that
pre-acquisition financial statements would be meaningful. The application of Rule 3-05
compared to Rule 8-04 depends on whether the registrant is a smaller reporting company,
not on whether the target would qualify as a smaller reporting company. Under Rule 8-04
there is no requirement to provide more than two years audited financial statements for the
target. Under Rule 3-05, a third year is required if the transaction was greater than 50%
significant and the target had revenues of at least $50 million in its most recent year. CF
Staff may request to see calculations of significance tests in its comments to verify that the
correct periods have been presented. Subsequent to the consummation of the merger, the
registrant continues to qualify as a smaller reporting company until the next determination
date
The assessment of whether predecessor financial statements are required is separate from the
assessment of the accounting acquirer. In certain cases, a newly formed entity may have a
predecessor or an entity with nominal operations that purchases a business for cash also may
have a predecessor. When a registrant succeeds to substantially all of the operations of
another entity, that entity is the registrant’s predecessor. In these situations, audited
financial statements of the predecessor and successor are expected to be presented for the
periods required in Rule 3-01 and 3-02 of S-X or Rules 8-02 with no lapse in audited
periods. In addition, there is also expected to be a management’s discussion and analysis
covering the financial statements of the predecessor. The CF Staff will request that
registrants include the predecessor’s financial statements not only at time the transaction is
consummated in a registration statement, but also in any subsequent periodic reports until
the predecessor periods are no longer covered by the periodic report.

The CF Staff may comment on the purchase price allocation, whether it is related to a probable acquisition and
included in the notes to pro forma financial information or a consummated acquisition and included in the notes
to the financial statements. In general, the CF Staff may request more information in situations where a
disproportionate amount of the purchase price is allocated to goodwill. This request is even more likely if
descriptions of the transaction indicate that other intangible assets may have been acquired, but no fair value is
assigned.
As it relates to any identified intangible assets, the CF Staff may raise questions if companies conclude that
acquired intangible assets have indefinite lives when some of the factors in FASB ASC paragraph 350-30-35-3
may be present. The CF Staff may also comment in situations in which a registrant appears to be defaulting to
the straight-line method of amortization when there appears to be clear evidence of another pattern in which the
economic benefits of the asset are consumed.
See the discussion on the next slide regarding equity transactions for an understanding of the CF Staff’s
approach to the fair value of the securities issued.
The determination of the accounting acquirer is an area of significant judgment depending on all the facts and
circumstances surrounding the transaction. In determining the accounting acquirer, the CF Staff considers all
the indicators in FASB ASC 805-10-55-11 through 15. Voting interests (including the impact of in-the-money
options) are not determinative. The CF Staff will also want to understand an evaluation of the board
representation, continuing management, whether any voting interests hold significant minority interests and
relative size among other factors in evaluating the acquirer. We do not consider the evaluation to be a
scorecard. We expect management to fully evaluate the indicators considering the disparity between the two
parties in each of the factors, the rights of management as compared to stockholders as compared to the board
of director, as appropriate, as well as how the individual factors interact with each other.
FASB ASC Section 805-10-50 highlights the required disclosures. The CF Staff will consider compliance with
the disclosure requirements during our reviews.

30

When smaller companies incorrectly determine fair value for equity issued to consummate
certain transactions, such as compensation arrangements and business combinations, it can
often lead to material misstatements. CF Staff will frequently comment if a registrant has
used a value different from quoted market price to value its equity if it is determined that the
stock trades in an active market. GAAP does not permit Blockage discounts if using quoted
market price. Discounts for trading restrictions may be appropriate in certain circumstances
provided they are characteristics of the security and can be supported with objective
evidence. If the stock does not trade in an active market, the CF Staff may look to cash
transactions with third parties for the same security in close proximity to support fair value
or otherwise may consider the fair value of the services and/or goods received if that
measure is more reliable. While quoted market price may not be the appropriate measure of
fair value in inactive markets, that price should not be ignored when determining fair value.
Absent market prices in an active market or other objective measures of fair value,
management should use its judgment considering the fair value hierarchy in determining a
fair value that is supportable.
Because of the significant impact that fair value determinations can have on the financial
statements, it is helpful for registrants provide disclosure surrounding how the fair value was
determined and the impact that reasonable changes in assumptions could have on the
measure and on the financial statements directly.

Embedded Conversion Options and

Is the instrument within scope of SFAS 150 (ASC 480-10-15)?



Analyze under SFAS 133 (ASC 815) – two routes
1.	 Freestanding
•

•

133 is available

•	

If scope exception met, account for as equity

•	

If no scope exception met, and the option meets the
definition of a derivative, account for as a derivative
liability (SFAS 133/ASC 815)

31

It is a complicated path to determine the appropriate accounting for such instruments. This
is necessarily an abbreviated outline of a common process for evaluating warrants and
conversion options that does not necessarily consider every step that may be required in all
facts and circumstances.
Generally, the first step is to determine whether the instrument is within the scope of FASB
ASC Topic 480. If the instrument is within the scope of that literature, the instrument
should be classified as an asset or liability and measured using the guidance in that literature.
If the financial instrument is a freestanding warrant and is not within the scope of FASB
ASC Topic 480, it may be within the scope of FASB ASC Topic 815. If the warrant is
indexed to a company’s own stock under FASB ASC Subtopic 815-40, companies should
evaluate that Subtopic to determine whether the instrument should be classified within
equity with no adjustments for changes in fair value or classified as a liability at fair value
with adjustments each period.

11a scope exception in 133 (ASC 815-10-15-74) is

•	 If scope exception is met, no bifurcation

and 00-27 (ASC 470-20)
•	 If no scope exception is met, and the
definition of a derivative is met, account for as
a derivative liability (all embedded derivatives
should be combined and accounted for as a
single compound embedded derivative)

32

As it relates to hybrid financial instruments, such as convertible debentures, embedded
features must be analyzed under FASB ASC 815-15-25-1 to determine whether they should
be bifurcated and accounted for separately under FASB ASC Topic 815 as an embedded
derivative. A key component in that analysis is determining whether the embedded feature
is clearly and closely related to the host contract. Clearly and closely related features are not
bifurcated. If a feature is not clearly and closely related, additional analysis is required to
determine whether the feature should be bifurcated. Companies should consider the staff’s
views in EITF Topic D-109 on determining the nature of the host contract when the hybrid
financial instrument is in the form of a share. Understanding the nature of the host contract
often is a key component in determining whether an embedded feature is clearly and closely
related to its host (for instance, a conversion option into equity shares would often be C&CR
to an equity host contract but not C&CT to a debt host contract).
If the embedded feature is not clearly and closely to the host instrument (par. 12a of FAS
133) and the entire hybrid instrument is not accounted for at fair value through earnings
(par. 12b of FAS 133), companies should analyze whether the embedded feature would be
considered a derivative if it were a a freestanding instrument (par. 12c of FAS 133). That
requires an evaluation of whether the feature has the characteristics of a derivative (par. 6 –
9 of FAS 133) and whether any scope exception to derivative accounting would be met (par.
10 – 11 of FAS 133).
If an embedded conversion feature is not bifurcated under FASB ASC Topic 815,
companies should consider whether there is a beneficial conversion feature to be accounted
for under FASB ASC Subtopic 470-20. Whether a feature is bifurcated or not, the company
should consider EITF Topic D-98 and ASR 268 if the instrument is redeemable in
determining the classification and measurement of the host contract.

Evaluate the provisions of your agreements (Debt, warrant, reg.
rights, anti-dilution provisions, etc.) carefully
33

As discussed on the previous slides, FASB ASC Subtopic 815-40 is instrumental to the
analysis of conversion features and other equity indexed share settled features. In the
situation of evaluating convertible debt instruments, companies must first determine whether
the instrument is a conventional convertible debt instrument, as explained in FASB ASC
paragraphs 815-40-25-41 and 25-42. If the instrument is a conventional convertible debt
instrument then Paragraphs 815-40-25-7 through 25-35 and 815-40-55-2 through 55-6 do
not apply and will not have to evaluated, but the remaining paragraphs should still be
considered.
It is important to note that agreements that contain clauses to adjust the conversion price
other than standard anti-dilution provisions that apply to all shareholders are not considered
conventional convertible. This frequently creates problems for smaller companies. Some
other common pitfalls that may lead to an embedded derivative needing to be bifurcated and
accounted for as a derivative liability are listed on the slide. That staff frequently finds that
restatements in this area are commonly the result of companies not carefully considering and
evaluating the accounting implications of provisions of their agreement at the time they are
negotiating them or when the transaction is completed.

34

In addition to the recognition and presentation issues addressed on the prior slides, the staff
may issue comments to understand how derivatives and bifurcated embedded features have
been measured. In many cases, there may be multiple embedded features or the features of
the bifurcated derivatives may be so complex that a Black-Sholes valuation does not
consider all of the terms of the instrument. Therefore, the fair value may not be
appropriately captured by simple models. The staff may consider the reasonableness of
assumptions and also whether the valuation technique used is appropriate. In some cases,
we have found that the issues related to valuation arise from the terms and features not being
properly defined or identified when considering the contractual agreements in their entirety.
Generally speaking, significant economic characteristics should not be lost or double
counted in the process of bifurcating an embedded feature. In other words, the features and
terms attributed to the bifurcated embedded feature plus the features and terms attributed to
the remaining host contract should “add up” to the total hybrid instrument that is ultimately
being accounted for.

35

The SEC adopted a new system of disclosure rules for smaller companies filing periodic reports and
registration statements effective February 4, 2008. They are scaled to reflect the characteristics and
needs of smaller companies and their investors. They replace the disclosure requirements formerly in
the SEC’s Regulation S-B, which applied to “small business issuers.” This slide highlights the tests
for transitioning in and out of smaller reporting company status. Some key items to highlight are as
follows:
•Unlike Regulation S-B, companies that have a public float need only consider that float in
their test. The revenue test only applies to companies with no public float.
•While the thresholds may align with the thresholds for filer status (i.e. nonaccelerated or
accelerated), the test is for different purposes and there may be circumstances where a
smaller reporting company is an accelerated filer or where a larger reporting company is a
nonaccelerated filer.
•The transition rules are structured to be most favorable for companies exiting or entering
smaller reporting companies. If a company is required to exit smaller reporting company
status, it may continue to report as a smaller reporting company through the filing of the
annual report on Form 10-K for that year. If it newly qualify as a smaller reporting company
based upon their second quarter public float, it may elect to provide scaled disclosure in its
next quarterly report on Form 10-Q.
The SB forms are no longer available for initial filings or amendments. Any company amending a
document previously filed on an SB form must now use the regular form. Likewise, any company
with delinquent reports that would have been filed on an SB form must now file those reports on a
regular form.

unqualified language – effective or not effective

•	 “Adequate” or “Effective except for…” are inappropriate
•	 “Effective” DC&P conclusion when ICFR conclusion is

 Incomplete definition of DC&P

36

CF Staff continues to issue comments on the evaluation of disclosure controls and
procedures in quarterly and annual reporting. Item 307 of Regulation S-K requires
companies to clearly disclose whether disclosure controls and procedures are effective or
ineffective. Registrants should be aware that the definition of disclosure controls and
procedures is more broader than the definition of internal control over financial reporting so
it is possible that disclosure controls and procedures can be ineffective even while internal
control over financial reporting is effective.
However, the CF Staff may be highly skeptical in situations where internal control over
financial reporting is ineffective but disclosure controls and procedures are effective. In such
situation, we may ask the company to support its conclusion.

“ineffective”)

37

As was mentioned on the prior slide (#36), the conclusions related to internal control over
financial reporting are separate and distinct (albeit they may be related) from the conclusions
regarding the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures. In this regard, the rules
require that registrants explicitly state whether internal control over financial reporting is
effective or ineffective with no qualifying language or scope limitations. The CF Staff
generally asks companies that do not appear to have completed an assessment and/or have
not disclosed their conclusion on effectiveness to amend their filings.
From a compliance perspective, companies subject to the auditor attestation requirement
must disclose all four elements required by Item 308(a) of Regulation S-K. Similarly,
companies not yet subject to that requirement, must disclose the four elements required by
temporary Item 308T(a) of Regulation S-K. As it relates to the framework, the Commission
specified the characteristics of a suitable control framework and identified the “Internal
Control – Integrated Framework(1992)” created by COSO as an example of a suitable
framework. The Commission Guidance Regarding Management's Report on Internal

Control Over Financial Reporting Under Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 or“ Management’s Guidance” highlighted two other frameworks
that met the characteristics outlined in the adopting release and encourages companies to
examine and select a framework that may be useful in their own circumstances. It is
important to note, however, that the Management’s Guidance itself is not a framework.

Regulation S-K)

 Disclosures should be detailed and specific for each 

material weakness identified


38

As they relate to both accelerated and nonaccelerated filers, CF Staff continues to comment on and observe
areas where disclosures of material weaknesses can be improved. Disclosures of material weaknesses are
most useful if they provide some transparency into the pervasiveness and impact a particular material
weaknesses could have on the financial statements. Such disclosures may indicate the individual line items
that may be impacted by the weakness, the potential magnitude of the impact as well as the likelihood. When
evaluating whether deficiencies are in fact material weakness, companies may consider more carefully
analyzing the likelihood that the deficiency could fail to prevent a material error.
The CF Staff also often sees material weaknesses that are narrowly focused on one particular financial
statement line item in which an error was discovered. For example, a company may disclose that it has
material weaknesses related to its accounts receivable. Not only does this disclosure not specifically address
the internal controls in which there are the weakness, it does not consider the impact that the weakness could
have on other financial statement line items. In other words, the disclosure should not be narrowly limited to
the line item in which the error was found. This very issue may also become evident through the remediation
disclosures. For example, the remediation disclosures may indicate that the registrant is improving internal
controls that go well beyond and impact more areas than the narrow material weakness disclosed.
It can be meaningful if registrants disclose current plans to remediate the weakness and provide disclosures of
any changes to internal control over financial reporting as the result of remediation efforts in conjunction with
the required disclosures under Item 308(c) of Regulation S-K.
Registrants are required to disclose all material weaknesses identified so companies might consider the above
guidance for each material weakness. Likewise, while the thoughts above discuss disclosures that are too
narrow, the CF Staff recommends that companies not group multiple material weaknesses into the description
of one general material weakness.

Appendix

42

The following slides were not presented at the forums but included in the materials
as a reference for participants. The following slides cover additional areas in which
the CF Staff frequently issues comments.

42

Financial Statement Classification

Registrants that qualify as smaller reporting companies
reporting under Article 8 of Regulation S-X
 Need not apply the other form and content requirements in
Regulation S-X except:
•	 Report and qualifications of the independent accountant (Article
2)
•	 Description of accounting policies (Rule 4–08(n))
•	 Companies engaged in oil and gas producing activities (Rule 4–
10)
 Guidance outside of Regulation S-X continues to apply that may
result in comments. For example:
•	 Equity vs. non-equity (EITF Topic D-98/ASC 480-10-S99 and
SFAS No. 150/ASC 480-10)
•	 Operating, investing, and financing cash flows (SFAS No.
95/ASC 230-10)
•	 Discontinued operations (SFAS No. 144/ASC 360-10)
•	 Stock-based compensation expense (SAB Topic 14F)
43

While smaller reporting companies are not required to adhere to Articles 5, 6, 6A, 7,
or 9 on financial statement presentation and classification for specific industries,
they must follow the presentation and disclosure requirements of US GAAP and
consider related SEC staff interpretations of those requirements.

43

Financial Statement Classification

Registrants that do not qualify to report under Article
8 of Regulation S-X
 Subject to more detailed classification rules (e.g., Article 5
of Regulation S-X for commercial and industrial companies)
• Rule 5-02 - balance sheets
• Rule 5-03 – income statements
 These additional rules most often result in comments 

relating to Rule 5-03

• Components of revenue
• Cost of sales
• Classification of share-based payments
• Operating vs. non-operating
44

Companies that do not qualify as smaller reporting companies must adhere to the classification
requirements within Article 5 or the appropriate Article for their industry. For these companies,
CF Staff may comment on certain classification issues such as:
•Product and service revenues should be appropriately disaggregated on the face of the
income statement if they meet the 10% threshold in Rule 5-03 of Regulation S-X. The
CF Staff recommends that Registrants also consider disaggregation if the margin on
individual components are so different that they skew the company's margins presented
on the income statement.
•Costs of sales should generally include the appropriate allocation of depreciation and all
other related costs. If deprecation is not included in costs of sales, companies should
clearly indicate that it has been excluded on the face of the income statement and refrain
from presenting a measure of gross profit.
•Share-based payments should be classified within the same line item in which cash
compensation is classified for a given employee. The CF Staff will not object if
companies disclose the amount of share-based compensation within a given line item
parenthetically on the face of the income statement or within the notes to the financial
statements.
•Finally, the CF Staff may question the appropriateness of certain items that are
classified as operating items rather than non-operating and vice versa. The
determination should usually be based upon the activity that generated the income or
expense. Litigation settlements are one example of an area requiring judgment since
they may be classified as operating or non-operating depending on the nature of the
litigation.

44

General Reporting Requirements

Registration Statements - Rule 8-08 of Regulation
S-X
 Financial statements must be current as of the date of the
filing and as of a date fewer than 135 days before the
registration statement in which they appear is declared
effective
 If the smaller reporting company registration statement’s 

effective date falls after 45 days but within 90 days of the 

fiscal year end, audited financial statements are not 

required provided the following:

•	 If a reporting company, all reports must have been filed
•	 Company expects to report income from continuing
operations before taxes for the most recent year
•	 Company has reported income from continuing
operations before taxes in at least one of the two before
the most recent year
45

It is important that registrants are mindful of the requirements pertaining to the age
of financial statements in a registration statement. Updating financial statements
can be time consuming and may slow down a registered transaction considerably if
the company does not plan for it appropriately.

45

Revenue Recognition

Common Areas of Comment
 Policy disclosures (i.e., SAB 104)
•	 Avoid “Boilerplate” disclosures
•	 Disclosure should be specific to company’s revenue
streams
 EITF 00-21 (ASC 605-25) – Multiple-Element Arrangements
•	 May also relate to separate agreements negotiated
together or in close proximity
 EITF 99-19 (ASC 605-45) – Gross versus Net Revenue 

Recognition

•	 Consider and weigh all indicators

46

CF Staff frequently requests clarification of how companies recognize revenue, including
how their revenue recognition is consistent with SAB 104, which provides guidance on how
to apply general accepted accounting principles to revenue recognition issues. We also ask
companies to expand their revenue recognition accounting policy disclosures. In many
cases, these comments are raised because of overly vague or “boilerplate” disclosures
provided by the company. Registrants should take care to fully disclose the timing and
method for recognizing revenue for each of their material revenue streams.
As it relates to revenue recognition under ASC Subtopic 605-25, the CF Staff frequently
comments in situations where it is not clear that deliverables qualify as separate units of
accounting or appears that they do not qualify as separate units. In such situations, the CF
Staff may ask the registrant how it evaluated each of the criteria to conclude that the
delivered item could be considered a separate unit of accounting. With the issuance of ASU
2009-13, we expect multiple deliverables to more frequently qualify as separate units;
however, we may be more likely to have comments on the allocation of revenue to the
deliverables because of the significant amount of judgment involved.
The CF Staff may comment when companies may recognize revenue on a gross basis and
the disclosures raise questions as to whether registrant is really acting as an agent and should
be reporting revenue on a net basis. The opposite may occur where revenue is presented on
a net basis, but the registrant’s business appears to be more in line with a principal. If there
is not transparent disclosure in MD&A or elsewhere as to how the registrant reached its
conclusions, the Staff may comment and ask how the registrant has evaluated each of the
indicators in ASC Subtopic 605-45, and which specific indicators carry the most weight in
their fact pattern.

46

Pro Forma Information

Consideration of Article 11 of Reg. S-X
Adjustments
Directly Attributable
Have a continuing impact (pro forma income
statement)
Factually supportable

Examples
MD&A

47

Article 8 recommends that smaller reporting companies look to Article 11 for guidance in preparing pro forma
information. Article 8 specifically requires pro forma information for business acquisitions. Other than acquisitions,
pro forma financial information may be appropriate considering the significance of the transaction, the type of filing in
which the pro forma financial information will be included, and the overall materiality to an investor. When prepared,
pro forma financial information should only reflect adjustments that are directly attributable to the transaction and
factually supportable. As it relates to the income statement, adjustments should only be reflected if they will have a
continuing impact on the entity.
Some examples are:
•	 Non-recurring gains or losses directly attributable to transaction – Consider including adjustments for pro
forma retained earnings on pro forma balance sheet, and describe in footnote to pro forma income statements,
but do not adjust on the face of the pro forma income statement since no continuing impact
•	 Pro forma statements that give effect to a business combination – Generally, the two adjustments are
1. The allocation of the purchase price, including adjusting assets and liabilities to fair value and
recognizing intangibles, with related changes in depreciation and amortization expense; and
2. The effects of additional financing necessary to complete the acquisition. However, other related
adjustments may be necessary.
NOTE: CF Staff recommends that registrants use the most recent stock price at the time of filing for
determining the value of stock to be issued in a transaction that has not yet consummated.
•	 Actions to be taken by management subsequent to a business combination may relate to the planned disposal or
termination of revenue producing activities, as well as other business integration activities. It may be appropriate
to present pro forma adjustments depicting the recurring effects of exiting revenue producing activities if
factually supportable.
•	 CF Staff would expect that contractual terms of the combination such as major new compensation contracts
with management be reflected in pro forma adjustments if the new contracts are entered into as part of the
acquisition agreement.
Pro Forma MD&A – if there has been a change in basis in the financial statements, such as a material acquisition or
predecessor/successor periods (e.g. from push-down accounting), and pro forma information would be meaningful to
investors, the CF Staff does not object if companies provide required analysis of results of operations on a historical
basis plus an additional analysis of results of operations based on pro forma financial information as long as the pro
forma adjustments are transparent. We do not believe it is appropriate to provide an analysis of results based on merely
combining the pre- and post-transaction periods in order to get results for a whole year.

47

Related Party Transactions
Examples of Common Related Party
Transactions:
Forgiveness of Debt
Contributed Services

Measurement
Disclosure

48

Because many smaller reporting companies are closely held, CF Staff often issues comments
pertaining to related party transactions including some of the examples of transactions mentioned on
this slide.
CF Staff may issue comments when a gain is recognized upon a related party liability being forgiven.
We will seek to understand how the company considered the guidance in FASB ASC paragraph 47050-40-2.
Normally the CF staff expects financial statements to reflect all costs of doing business (See SAB
Topics 1B and 5T), even if some of those costs were paid by related parties such as the parent
company.
Any equity issued to a related party for services performed should be reflected at the fair value of the
equity issued if readily determinable. See slide on “Equity Transactions” earlier in the presentation.
Related party transactions should be clearly described and impact quantified in footnotes (see FASB
ASC paragraph 850-10-50-5). Disclosures should not claim that transactions have been recorded at
an arm’s length unless the registrant has objective evidence to support that assertion. If you disclose
this, the CF Staff may ask what objective evidence you relied upon.

Form 8-K

Form 8-K interpretations updated on September 14,
2009 at
http://www.sec.gov/divisions/corpfin/guidance/8kinterp.htm
All Item 4.01 and Item 4.02 8-K filings reviewed for
strict compliance
Frequent Item 4.01 comments
 Failure to specify whether former accountants resigned,
declined to stand for re-election, or were dismissed and the
date
 Exhibit 16 letter

 Reverse acquisitions

 Accounting firm mergers

49

As mentioned in a prior slide, Form 8-Ks on Items 4.01 and 4.02 are reviewed by
the CF Staff.
As they relate to Item 4.01 Form 8-Ks, the CF Staff’s comments are generally
focused on compliance with the item requirements. They may ask for more
information about the facts and circumstances surrounding the change in
accountants. The CF Staff may also comment if the Exhibit 16 letter signed by the
former accountants has not been filed in a timely manner.
Finally, such Form 8-Ks will usually need to be filed upon the consummation of a
reverse merger or upon merger of the registrant’s accountants with another firm.

49

Form 8-K

Most Item 4.02 comments relate to Item
4.02(a)
 Triggering event other than non-reliance
conclusion (e.g., completion of restatement)
 Unclear statement regarding non-reliance
 Brief description of facts lacking or unclear
 “Stealth restatements”
•	

See Exchange Act Form 8-K Compliance and
Disclosure Interpretation 215.01

50

As they relate to Item 4.02 Form 8-Ks, again comments will generally be focused
on compliance with the item requirements. Companies should provide a description
of the facts and circumstances leading to the restatement, including the triggering
event that led to the conclusion. The triggering event should be the conclusion that
previously issued financial statements can no longer be relied upon rather than the
restatement of those financial statements. Finally, companies should clearly state
the periods for which the financial statements can no longer be relied upon and
quantify the impact of that determination to the extent known.
Form 8-K allows registrants to disclose reportable items in periodic reports coming
due if the event occurs within the four business days of the due date of the periodic
report. Therefore, certain companies have been disclosing the non-reliance on
previously issued financial statements in the same report (either 10-K or 10-Q) in
which they are restating their financial statements. The CF Staff expects registrants
to always report the need to restate financial statements under Item 4.02 on Form 8K rather than in another periodic report. (See Form 8-K interpretations referenced
on prior slide)

50

CEO/CFO Certifications

Certifications should not deviate from specific form
and content in Item 601(b)(31)(i) of Regulation S-K
Internal control over financial reporting (ICFR)
 SEC Release 33-8238 (June 2003) permitted exclusion of:
•	 Introductory language in paragraph 4 referring to
responsibility for establishing and maintaining ICFR
•	 Paragraph 4(b) (certifying officer has designed or
supervised the design of ICFR)
 Starting with first period in which management is required
to assess ICFR, these statements can no longer be
excluded
51

The certifications required by Section 302 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act and included
as an exhibit to the quarterly reports and annual report cannot deviate in form or
content from what is included in Item 601(b)(31)(i) of Regulation S-K.
In the past, changes to the certifications have gone overlooked by management for a
period of time. With that experience, the CF Staff would like to remind nonaccelerated filers that they should now be including the introductory language in
paragraph 4 and paragraph 4(b) in each periodic report since they are now required
to comply with Section 404(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act.

51

Audit Reports

	 Auditor must be PCAOB registered firm
that meets all of the requirements of
Article 2
	 Audit reports must be filed for all
financial statements required to be
audited
	 If audit report refers to the report(s) of
another auditor(s), the registrant must
include those reports in the filing

52

Audit reports that do not comply with Article 2 of Regulation S-X frequently stop
the review of a registration statement and will always generate CF Staff comment.
The financial statements of all issuers must be audited by accountants that are
registered with the PCAOB and meet the requirements of Article 2 of Regulation SX. In situations where another firm plays a “substantial role” (as defined in PCAOB
Rule 1001(p)(ii)) in the audit of an issuer (e.g. auditing a significant subsidiary),
that firm must also be registered with the PCAOB.
Regardless of whether financial statements for a given period was audited by the
current auditor or a predecessor auditor, each period for which audited financial
statements are included in the filing must have a related audit report included in the
filing. In addition, if the audit report refers to the report of another auditor in
expressing an opinion, the other auditor’s report must be included in the filing as
well.
For the purposes of any registration statement, each and every audit firm that has
issued an opinion in an audit report included in the registration statement must
consent to the inclusion of that report in the registration statement.
