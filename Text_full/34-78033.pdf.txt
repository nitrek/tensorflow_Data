ORDER DIRECTING
DISBURSEMENT OF FAIR FUND

On March 13, 2008, the Commission published a Notice of the Proposed Plan of
Distribution (“Plan”) proposed by the Division of Enforcement in connection with this
proceeding (Securities Exchange Act Rel. No. 57489). The Commission received no comments
and on May 15, 2008, the Plan was approved (Exchange Act Rel. No. 57825). On January 9,
2014, the Commission issued an Order Amending the Plan of Distribution (Exchange Act Rel.
No. 71274).
The Plan provides that a Fair Fund consisting of $321,230,003 in disgorgement and civil
penalties, plus any accrued interest, be transferred to Deutsche Bank to be distributed by the Fund
Administrator to injured investors according to the methodology set forth in the Plan.1 To date,
approximately $346 million has been disbursed in eight tranches, with a residual amount of
approximately $48.9 million, currently in the Final Settlement Account of the Fair Fund.2

The $321,230,003 in disgorgements and civil penalties is comprised of the $250 million from the Alliance
Settlement, the $70.38 million from the Daniel Calugar Settlement, and the total of $850,003 paid by
Alliance Officers Malone, Carifa and Laughlin, as described in the Order approving the Plan. See
Exchange Act Rel. No. 57825.

By Order Directing Disbursement of Fair Fund dated January 22, 2009, the Commission ordered the first
disbursement, composed of $46,166,264.96. See Exchange Act Rel. No. 59280. By Order Directing
Disbursement of Fair Fund dated February 11, 2009, the Commission ordered the second disbursement,
composed of $79,178,672.81. See Exchange Act Rel. No. 59389. By Order Directing Disbursement of
Fair Fund dated March 31, 2009, the Commission ordered the third disbursement, composed of
$63,141,852.24. See Exchange Act Rel. No. 59657. By Order Directing Disbursement of Fair Fund dated

Section 3.7.5 of the Plan provides that any residual amount in the Final Settlement
Account after all Fair Fund assets have been distributed will be remitted to the Alliance Funds,
based on the proportion of Adjusted Losses incurred in each Alliance Fund, after provisions for
any taxes have been made and prior to the termination of the Fair Fund. Paragraph H of the
Order Amending the Plan of Distribution states that: "Any amount remaining in the Final
Settlement Account, less the Reserve Amount [$605,000], after completion of the Enhanced
Measures shall be considered the Residual and shall be distributed to the Alliance Funds in
accordance with the Plan."3 Thus, of the approximately $48.9 million in residual, approximately
$48.3 million will be distributed to the Alliance Funds.
The Plan, as amended, further provides that the Commission staff will arrange for the
distribution of the residual after the Commission staff receives and accepts a validated payment
file listing the payees with the information required to make a residual distribution. The
validated payment file for the residual distribution in the amount of $48,294,481.40 is composed
of $3,350,461.97 of the Fair Fund’s assets at Treasury and $44,944,019.43 of the Fair Fund’s
assets at Deutsche Bank. Ten Alliance Funds will receive payments from the residual
distribution. The validated payment file has been received and accepted by the Commission
staff.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall transfer $3,350,461.97
from the Fair Fund’s assets at Treasury to Fair Fund’s account at Deutsche Bank and the Fund
Administrator shall distribute $48,294,481.40 to the Alliance Funds, as provided for in the Plan.

By the Commission.
