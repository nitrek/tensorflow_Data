Respondents.

On October 8, 2014, the Commission published a Notice of Proposed Plan of
Distribution and Opportunity for Comment1 (“Notice”) pursuant to Rule 1103 of the
Commission’s Rules on Fair Fund and Disgorgement Plans (“Rules”),

The Plan provides for distribution of the Distribution Fund,3 comprised of
$200,000 in disgorgement and $16,051 in prejudgment interest, to Eligible Customers
when the Fund Administrator, a Commission employee, has compiled the payee
information and prepared a payment file to make the disbursements through the U.S.
Treasury’s Bureau of the Fiscal Service. The Fund Administrator has submitted the
payment file. The Commission staff has reviewed the payment file and requests that,
pursuant to Rule 1101(b)(6) of the Commission’s Rules, 17 C.F.R. § 201.1101(b)(6),
the Commission direct the payment of $184,552 from the Distribution Fund for
distribution in accordance with the Plan.
Accordingly, it is ORDERED that the Commission staff shall direct the
disbursement of $184,552 from the Distribution Fund and that the Fund Administrator
shall distribute such monies to Eligible Customers as provided for in the Plan.
By the Commission.
