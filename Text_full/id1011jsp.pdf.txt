In the Matter of

INITIAL DECISION OF
DEFAULT
May 11, 2016

RINGS TO DINE FOR, INC.

APPEARANCES:

David S. Frye and Neil J. Welch, Jr., for the Division of Enforcement,
Securities and Exchange Commission

BEFORE:

Jason S. Patil, Administrative Law Judge
SUMMARY

This initial decision revokes the registration of the registered securities of Respondent
Rings to Dine For, Inc., due to its failure to timely file required periodic reports with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
INTRODUCTION
On March 29, 2016, the Commission initiated this proceeding with an order instituting
proceedings (OIP) pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The OIP
alleges that Respondent has securities registered with the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act
Section 12(g) and has repeatedly failed to file timely periodic reports with the Commission, in
violation of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 thereunder. Respondent
was served with the OIP by April 6 and its answer was due by April 19, 2016. Rings to Dine
For, Inc., Admin. Proc. Rulings Release No. 3807, 2016 SEC LEXIS 1513 (ALJ Apr. 25, 2016).
When Respondent failed to file an answer, I ordered it to show cause by May 9, 2016, why the
registration of its securities should not be revoked by default due to its failure to file an answer or
otherwise defend the proceeding. Id. To date, Respondent has not filed an answer, responded to
the show cause order, or otherwise defended this proceeding.
FINDINGS OF FACT
Respondent is in default for failing to file an answer or otherwise defend the proceeding.
See OIP at 2; 17 C.F.R. §§ 201.155(a)(2), .220(f). Accordingly, as authorized by Rule of
Practice 155(a), 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(a), I find the following allegations in the OIP to be true.

Rings to Dine For, Inc., Central Index Key No. 1069493, is a void Delaware corporation
located in Muntinlupa City, Metro Manila, Philippines, with a class of securities registered with
the Commission pursuant to Exchange Act Section 12(g). The company is delinquent in its
periodic filings with the Commission, having not filed any periodic reports since it filed a Form
10-QSB for the period ended March 31, 2007, which reported no revenue or expenses for the
prior nine months. As of March 28, 2016, the company’s common stock was not publicly quoted
or traded.
In addition to its repeated failures to file timely periodic reports, Respondent failed to
heed a delinquency letter sent to it by the Commission’s Division of Corporation Finance
requesting compliance with its periodic filing obligations.
CONCLUSIONS OF LAW
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13 require public corporations to
file annual and quarterly reports with the Commission. “Compliance with those requirements is
mandatory and may not be subject to conditions from the registrant.” America’s Sports Voice,
Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 55511, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1241, at *12 (Mar. 22, 2007), recons.
denied, Exchange Act Release No. 55867, 2007 SEC LEXIS 1239 (June 6, 2007). Scienter is
not required to establish violations of Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
See SEC v. McNulty, 137 F.3d 732, 740-41 (2d Cir. 1998); SEC v. Wills, 472 F. Supp. 1250,
1268 (D.D.C. 1978). Respondent failed to file timely periodic reports and as a result violated
Exchange Act Section 13(a) and Rules 13a-1 and 13a-13.
SANCTION
Under Exchange Act Section 12(j), the Commission is authorized, “as it deems necessary
or appropriate for the protection of investors,” to revoke the registration of a security or suspend
the registration for a period not exceeding twelve months if it finds, after notice and an
opportunity for hearing, that the issuer of the security has failed to comply with any provision of
the Exchange Act or rules thereunder. In determining what sanctions will adequately protect
investors, the Commission “consider[s], among other things, the seriousness of the issuer’s
violations, the isolated or recurrent nature of the violations, the degree of culpability involved,
the extent of the issuer’s efforts to remedy its past violations and ensure future compliance, and
the credibility of its assurances, if any, against further violations.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc.,
Exchange Act Release No. 53907, 2006 SEC LEXIS 1288, at *19-20 (May 31, 2006).
Respondent’s failure to file required periodic reports is serious because the failure
constitutes a violation of a central provision of the Exchange Act. The purpose of periodic
reporting is “to supply investors with current and accurate financial information about an issuer
so that they may make sound [investment] decisions.” Gateway Int’l Holdings, Inc., 2006 SEC
LEXIS 1288, at *26. The reporting requirements are the primary tool that Congress fashioned
for the protection of investors from negligent, careless, and deliberate misrepresentations in the
sale of securities. SEC v. Beisinger Indus. Corp., 552 F.2d 15, 18 (1st Cir. 1977). Respondent’s
violation is also recurrent in that it repeatedly failed to file periodic reports. See Nature’s
Sunshine Prods., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 59268, 2009 SEC LEXIS 81, at *20 (Jan. 21,
2

2009) (respondent failed to file seven required periodic reports due over a two-year period);
Impax Labs., Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 57864, 2008 SEC LEXIS 1197, at *25-26 (May
23, 2008) (respondent’s failure to make eight filings over an eighteen-month period considered
recurrent). Respondent is also culpable because it failed to heed a delinquency letter sent to it by
the Division of Corporation Finance and was therefore on notice, even before the OIP issued, of
its obligation to file periodic reports. See China-Biotics, Inc., Exchange Act Release No. 70800,
2013 SEC LEXIS 3451, at *37 & n.60 (Nov. 4, 2013) (holding that revocation may be warranted
even without proof that a respondent was aware of its reporting obligations). Finally,
Respondent has not answered the OIP, responded to the show cause order, or otherwise
participated in the proceeding to address whether it has made any efforts to remedy its past
violation. It has also made no assurances against further violations.
For these reasons, it is necessary and appropriate for the protection of investors to revoke
the registration of each class of Respondent’s registered securities.
ORDER
It is ORDERED that, pursuant to Section 12(j) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934,
the registration of each class of registered securities of Respondent Rings to Dine For, Inc., is
REVOKED.
This initial decision shall become effective in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of Rule 360, 17 C.F.R. § 201.360. Pursuant to that rule, a party may file a petition for
review of this initial decision within twenty-one days after service of the initial decision. A party
may also file a motion to correct a manifest error of fact within ten days of the initial decision,
pursuant to Rule 111, 17 C.F.R. § 201.111(h). If a motion to correct a manifest error of fact is
filed by a party, then a party shall have twenty-one days to file a petition for review from the date
of the undersigned’s order resolving such motion to correct a manifest error of fact.
This initial decision will not become final until the Commission enters an order of finality.
The Commission will enter an order of finality unless a party files a petition for review or a motion
to correct a manifest error of fact or the Commission determines on its own initiative to review the
initial decision as to a party. If any of these events occur, the initial decision shall not become
final as to that party.
A respondent may move to set aside a default. Rule 155(b) permits the Commission, at
any time, to set aside a default for good cause, in order to prevent injustice and on such
conditions as may be appropriate. 17 C.F.R. § 201.155(b). A motion to set aside a default shall
be made within a reasonable time, state the reasons for the failure to appear or defend, and
specify the nature of the proposed defense in the proceeding. Id.
