UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
Before the
SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION
May 3, 2016

In the Matter of
Solarbrook Water and Power Corp.

ORDER OF SUSPENSION OF
TRADING

File No. 500-1

It appears to the Securities and Exchange Commission that there is a lack of current and
accurate information concerning the securities of Solarbrook Water and Power Corp.
(“Solarbrook”) because of concerns regarding the accuracy and adequacy of information in the
marketplace and potentially manipulative transactions in Solarbrook common stock. Solarbrook
was a North Carolina corporation with its principal place of business located in Cary, NC, until
April 4, 2012, when it was administratively dissolved by the state for failure to file required
annual reports. Its stock is quoted on OTC Link (previously “Pink Sheets”), operated by OTC
Markets Group Inc. (“OTC Link”), under the ticker symbol SLRW.
The Commission is of the opinion that the public interest and the protection of investors
require a suspension of trading in the securities of the above-listed company.
THEREFORE, IT IS ORDERED, pursuant to Section 12(k) of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, that trading in the securities of the above-listed company is suspended for the
period from 9:30 a.m. EDT on May 3, 2016, through 11:59 p.m. EDT on May 16, 2016.
By the Commission.

Secretary
