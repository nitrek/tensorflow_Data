STATUTORY BASIS AND TEXT OF AMENDMENTS

I. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act creates a new class of regulated persons, “municipal
advisors,” and requires these advisors to register with the Commission. This new registration
requirement, which became effective on October 1, 2010, makes it unlawful for any municipal
advisor to provide certain advice to or on behalf of, or to solicit, municipal entities or certain other

5

persons without registering with the Commission. 1 A person is deemed under the Exchange Act to
have a statutory fiduciary duty to any municipal entity for whom such person acts as a municipal
advisor.
The new registration requirements and regulatory standards are intended to mitigate some of
the problems observed with the conduct of some municipal advisors, including “pay to play”
practices, undisclosed conflicts of interest, advice rendered by financial advisors without adequate
training or qualifications, and failure to place the duty of loyalty to their clients ahead of their own
interests. 2 According to a Senate Report related to the Dodd-Frank Act, “[t]he $3 trillion municipal
securities market is subject to less supervision than corporate securities markets, and market
participants generally have less information upon which to base investment decisions. During the
[financial] crisis, a number of municipalities suffered losses from complex derivatives products that
were marketed by unregulated financial intermediaries.” 3 Accordingly, in response to the financial
crisis that began in 2008, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to require “a range of
municipal financial advisors to register with the [Commission] and comply with regulations issued
by the [MSRB].” 4
In September 2010, the Commission adopted, and subsequently extended, an interim final
temporary rule establishing a temporary means for municipal advisors to satisfy the registration

requirement. 5 As of March 31, 2013, there were approximately 1,130 Form MA-T registrants,
including approximately 330 registrants that are also registered investment advisers and/or brokerdealers. In December 2010, the Commission proposed a permanent registration regime to govern
municipal advisor registration (“Proposal”). 6 The Commission has considered comments received
in connection with both the 2010 interim final temporary rules, as well as the Proposal, and is today
establishing a permanent registration regime for municipal advisors and imposing certain recordkeeping requirements on such advisors. Further, the Commission today, in a separate release, is
extending the expiration date of the temporary registration regime to December 31, 2014. 7 This
extension will enable municipal advisors that are required to register with the Commission on or
after the Effective Date but before the applicable compliance date to continue to register under the
temporary registration regime.
The statutory definition of a “municipal advisor” is broad and includes persons that may not
have been considered to be municipal financial advisors prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank
Act. Historically, municipal advisors have been largely unregulated. 8 The Commission believes
that the information disclosed pursuant to the rules and forms established by the permanent
registration regime for municipal advisors will enhance the Commission’s oversight of municipal
advisors and their activities in the municipal securities markets. The publicly-available online
information provided pursuant to these rules and forms should also aid municipal entities and
obligated persons in choosing municipal advisors and help provide greater transparency when

engaging in transactions or investments with municipal advisors.
The Exchange Act defines the term “municipal advisor” to mean a person (who is not a
municipal entity or an employee of a municipal entity) that: (1) provides advice to or on behalf of a
municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of
municipal securities, including advice with respect to the structure, timing, terms, and other similar
matters concerning such financial products or issues; or (2) undertakes a solicitation of a municipal
entity. 9 The definition of municipal advisor includes financial advisors, guaranteed investment
contract brokers, third-party marketers, placement agents, solicitors, finders, and swap advisors that
provide municipal advisory services, unless they are statutorily excluded. 10
The statutory definition of “municipal advisor” explicitly excludes: (1) a broker, dealer, or
municipal securities dealer serving as an underwriter (as defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the
Securities Act of 1933); (2) any investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of
1940, or persons associated with such investment advisers who are providing investment advice; (3)
any commodity trading advisor registered under the Commodity Exchange Act or persons
associated with a commodity trading advisor who are providing advice related to swaps; (4)
attorneys offering legal advice or providing services of a traditional legal nature; and (5) engineers
providing engineering advice. 11
The Exchange Act defines the term “municipal financial product” to mean municipal
derivatives, guaranteed investment contracts, and investment strategies. 12 “Investment strategies” is
defined to include plans or programs for the investment of proceeds of municipal securities that are

not municipal derivatives, guaranteed investment contracts, and the recommendation of and
brokerage of municipal escrow investments. 13
The Proposal reflected the Commission’s preliminary interpretation of the new statutory
requirements, based on its understanding at that time of Congressional objectives and intent in
adopting Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission requested comment generally on
the Proposal and also requested comment on over 175 specific issues. The Commission received
over 1,000 comment letters on the Proposal, representing a wide range of viewpoints, which are
discussed throughout this release. Commenters included municipal advisors, municipal entities,
broker-dealers, banks, accountants, lawyers, engineers, registered investment advisers,
organizations representing industry participants, investors, the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board, members of Congress, and others.
Commenters generally supported the goals of the Proposal, although many expressed
concerns about its breadth and recommended that the Proposal be amended or clarified in certain
respects. Major themes in the comments included: (1) concerns about the proposed treatment of
appointed board members and other public officials of municipal entities as advisors; (2) concerns
about the proposed application to advice on investments of all municipal funds (versus investments
associated with proceeds of municipal securities); and (3) potential effects on securities activities of
banks for which there are no statutory exclusions from the definition of “municipal advisor.” The
Commission staff discussed many issues with other U.S. financial regulators, commenters, and
interested market participants in devising a final rule that requires registration of parties engaging in
municipal advisory activities without unnecessarily imposing additional regulation.
One theme reflected in the statutory exclusions to the definition of a municipal advisor and

13

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(3).
9

in the Commission’s consideration of additional regulatory exemptions involves an approach that
focuses and limits the scope of these exclusions and exemptions based on identified activities
(“activities-based exemptions”) rather than on the basis of the status of particular categories of
market participants (“status-based exemptions”). This approach aims to ensure that exemptions
apply in targeted circumstances to appropriate identified activities. By comparison, a concern with
status-based exemptions is that they could provide inappropriate competitive advantages to covered
categories of market participants. 14
In consideration of the views expressed, suggestions for alternatives, and other information
provided by commenters, the Commission is adopting the rules with significant modifications from
the Proposal to narrow the scope of the registration requirement, including through certain activitybased exemptions from the definition of municipal advisor, and to provide additional guidance to
market participants about what constitutes municipal advice and who is required to register as a
municipal advisor. Some of the more significant changes made in this adopting release are
summarized as follows.
Broad Exemption for Public Officials and Employees of Municipal Entities and Obligated Persons
The Exchange Act excludes municipal entities and employees of municipal entities from the
definition of municipal advisor. 15 The Proposal did not extend the exclusion for “employees of a
municipal entity” to include appointed officials. The Commission received approximately 670
comment letters to the effect that the proposed exclusion for employees of municipal entities was
unduly narrow and that it failed to provide sufficient coverage for appointed board members and
other public officials associated with municipal entities. The final rule provides a broad exemption
14

See infra Sections VIII.D.5.b. (discussing alternatives to the exclusions from the definition
of municipal advisor) and VIII.D.6.b. (discussing alternatives to the exemptions from the
definition of municipal advisor).

15

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(A).
10

from municipal advisor registration for all employees, governing body members, and other officials
of municipal entities and obligated persons, to the extent that they act within the scope of their
employment or official capacity. 16 The Commission does not expect that the ordinary performance
of the duties of an appointed member of a governing body of a municipal entity – such as voting,
providing a statement or discussion of views, or asking questions at a public meeting – would cause
that individual to be a municipal advisor with respect to the municipal entity on whose board he or
she serves.
Limitation to Investments Related to Proceeds of Municipal Securities Instead of All Public Funds
The Exchange Act provides that the term “‘investment strategies’ includes plans or
programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities that are not municipal
derivatives, guaranteed investment contracts, and the recommendation of and brokerage of
municipal escrow investments” (emphasis added). 17 In the Proposal, the Commission proposed to
interpret the “investment strategies” definition broadly to cover not only the statutorily-identified
matters but also plans, programs, or pools of assets that invest any funds held by or on behalf of a
municipal entity.
The Commission received approximately 60 comment letters to the effect that the Proposal
interpreted the “investment strategies” definition too broadly to cover advice to municipal entities
regarding plans or programs for the investment of all public funds of municipal entities (rather than
investments more narrowly associated with proceeds of municipal securities and the
recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow arrangements). The Commission has
determined to adopt the statutory definition of “investment strategies,” but is also adopting an
exemption for certain persons that will result in a narrower application of “investment strategies”
16

See infra Section III.A.1.c.i.

17

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(3).
11

than originally proposed, limiting such strategies to matters relating to the investment of the
proceeds of municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow
investments, in lieu of all public funds of municipal entities. 18 This more circumscribed approach
to “investment strategies” has a narrowing effect throughout the municipal advisor registration
regime (e.g., many investment advisers and a significant portion of the bank activities identified by
commenters will not be subject to municipal advisor registration).
New Tailored Exemption for Banks
The Exchange Act does not exclude banks from the definition of municipal advisor. The
Commission received approximately 300 comment letters to the effect that the Proposal did not
provide needed exemptions for so-called “traditional banking” activities. Most of these comments
regarding the impact on banks related to the proposed broad interpretation of the “investment
strategies” definition. Many commercial banks and banking associations asserted that the
Commission’s interpretation of “investment strategies” was overly broad and would potentially
cover traditional banking products and services, such as deposit accounts, cash management
products, and loans to municipalities. As a result, according to commenters, banks or bank
employees that provide advice regarding such products and services could be considered municipal
advisors, adding “a new layer of regulation on bank products for no meaningful public purpose.” 19
The narrowing of the application of “investment strategies” in the final rule is designed to
address the main concerns raised by these commenters. 20 In addition, the final rule provides a new
tailored exemption from the definition of municipal advisor for a bank providing advice with

18

See infra Section III.A.1.b.viii.

19

See infra note 876 and accompanying text (discussing comments regarding an exemption for
banks from the municipal advisor registration rules).

20

See infra Section III.A.1.c.viii.
12

respect to the following: (1) any investments that are held in a deposit account, savings account,
certificate of deposit, or other deposit instrument issued by a bank; (2) any extension of credit by a
bank to a municipal entity or obligated person, including the issuance of a letter of credit, the
making of a direct loan, or the purchase of a municipal security by the bank for its own account; (3)
any funds held in a sweep account; or (4) any investment made by a bank acting in the capacity of
an indenture trustee or similar capacity (e.g., a bond indenture trustee, paying agent, or municipal
escrow agent).
The final rule preserves the municipal advisor registration requirement for banks that engage
in municipal advisory activities, such as banks that act as financial advisors to municipal entities in
structuring issues of municipal securities. Also, the final rule preserves the municipal advisor
registration requirement for banks that provide advice with respect to municipal derivatives.
Advice Standard in General
For purposes of the municipal advisor definition, the Dodd-Frank Act did not specifically
define or otherwise provide a general standard to determine what constitutes “advice” to a
municipal entity or obligated person. The Commission received comments requesting clarification
of “advice” and suggesting general parameters for defining advice that distinguish between
providing general information to a municipal entity and recommending a specific action to a
municipal entity. While the Commission believes that the determination of whether a person
provides advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person depends on all the relevant
facts and circumstances, the Commission also believes that additional guidance on the advice
standard for purposes of the municipal advisor definition will provide greater clarity regarding the
applicability of the municipal advisor registration requirement. Accordingly, the adopted rules
provide that advice excludes, among other things, the provision of general information that does not

13

involve a recommendation regarding municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities (including with respect to the structure, timing, terms and other similar matters
concerning such financial products or issues). 21
Exemption for Certain Swap Dealers
The Exchange Act does not exclude swap dealers from the definition of municipal advisor.
The Commission received comments suggesting that regulation of swap dealers under the municipal
advisor registration regime should be coordinated with other regulatory programs. The Commission
recognizes that swap dealers are also subject to the provisions of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, 22
which provide the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) with authority to register
and implement business conduct standards for swap dealers with respect to their interactions with
municipal entities and obligated persons that are “special entities,” as discussed further below in
Section III.A.1.c.vi. The final rules exempt any registered swap dealer to the extent that such dealer
recommends a municipal derivative or a trading strategy that involves a municipal derivative, so
long as such dealer or associated person is not “acting as an advisor” to the municipal entity or
obligated person, applying the standards applicable to the parties to such transactions under the
existing regulatory regime of the CFTC. 23
Exemption When There is an Independent Registered Municipal Advisor
Several commenters suggested that a person providing advice with respect to municipal

21

See infra Section III.A.1.b.i.

22

See Dodd-Frank Act sections 731 et seq., 764 et seq.

23

See infra Section III.A.1.c.vi. The Commission also received similar comments regarding
security-based swap dealers. As discussed herein, although the Commission is not
providing an exemption in the rules as adopted for security-based swap dealers, securitybased swap dealers may be eligible for exemption pursuant to another exemption, such as
when there is a separate registered municipal advisor, and the Commission may in the future
consider whether to provide a comparable exemption by rule. See id.
14

financial products or the issuance of municipal securities should not be regulated as a municipal
advisor if the municipal entity or obligated person is otherwise represented by a municipal advisor.
The Commission believes that if a municipal entity or obligated person is represented by a
registered municipal advisor, parties to the municipal securities transaction and others who are not
registered municipal advisors should be able to provide advice to such municipal entity or obligated
person, so long as the responsibilities of each of the parties are clear.
Accordingly, the final rules exempt persons providing advice with respect to municipal
financial products or the issuance of municipal securities from the definition of municipal advisor
so long as: (1) an independent registered municipal advisor is providing advice with respect to the
same aspects of the municipal financial product or issuance of municipal securities, is registered
pursuant to Section 15B of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder, and is not,
and within at least the past two years was not, associated with the person seeking to rely on this
exemption; (2) such person receives from the municipal entity or obligated person a representation
in writing that it is represented by, and will rely on the advice of, an independent registered
municipal advisor; and (3) such person provides written disclosure to the municipal entity or
obligated person that such person is not a municipal advisor and, with respect to a municipal entity,
is not subject to the statutory fiduciary duty applicable to municipal advisors under the Exchange
Act, and such person provides a copy of such disclosure to the municipal entity’s or the obligated
person’s independent registered municipal advisor. 24
Exclusion of Individuals from Registration
In the Proposal, the Commission proposed to require registration of all individuals
associated with municipal advisory firms who engage in municipal advisory activities, as contrasted

24

See infra Section III.A.1.c.iii.
15

with limiting registration to the municipal advisory firms themselves. For reasons further discussed
in Sections III.A.2.a. and III.A.3. of this adopting release, the Commission is limiting the
registration requirement to municipal advisory firms and sole proprietors.
II. INTRODUCTION
A. Background
On July 21, 2010, President Obama signed into law the Dodd-Frank Act. 25 The Dodd-Frank
Act was enacted, among other things, to promote the financial stability of the United States by
improving accountability and transparency in the financial system. 26 With Section 975 of Title IX
of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress amended Section 15B of the Exchange Act 27 to, among other
things, make it unlawful for municipal advisors 28 to provide certain advice to, or solicit, municipal
entities 29 or certain other persons without registering with the Commission. 30

Municipal Advisors

As discussed in the Proposal, 31 until the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act, the activities of
municipal advisors were largely unregulated, and municipal advisors were generally not required to
register with the Commission or any other federal, state, or self-regulatory entity with respect to
their municipal advisory activities. As discussed below in this section and in the Proposal, 32 some

entities that are now subject to registration as municipal advisors pursuant to Section 15B of the
Exchange Act and rules or regulations promulgated thereunder currently are subject to regulation by
various federal and state regulators in other capacities. These entities include brokers, dealers,
municipal securities dealers, investment advisers, and banks. Such regulations, however, generally
do not apply specifically to these entities’ municipal advisory activities.
Municipal advisors, commonly referred to as “financial advisors,” 33 engage in municipal
advisory activities in a variety of contexts. With respect to the issuance of municipal securities,
municipal advisors (which may include entities registered as brokers, dealers, municipal securities
dealers, or investment advisers acting as municipal advisors), among other things, may assist
municipal entities in developing a financing plan, assist municipal entities in evaluating different
financing options and structures, assist in the selection of other parties to the financing (such as
bond counsel and underwriters), coordinate the rating process, ensure adequate disclosure, and/or
evaluate and negotiate the financing terms. 34 According to the Municipal Securities Rulemaking
Board (“MSRB”), approximately $315 billion (70%) 35 of the municipal debt issued in 2008 was
issued with the participation of municipal advisors. 36 The MSRB also stated that participation by
municipal advisory firms in the issuance of municipal securities is rising, noting a 63% participation
rate in 2006, a 66% participation rate in 2007, and a 70% participation rate in 2008. 37 A study that

looked at historical involvement by “financial advisors” identified participation rates of
approximately 50% in the period from 1984 to 2002. 38
As discussed in the Proposal, 39 municipal advisors may also engage in municipal advisory
activities with respect to municipal financial products. 40 For example, as derivatives – which are
municipal financial products – developed in the municipal securities market, some municipal
advisory firms began marketing themselves as experts in derivatives. These municipal advisory
firms are generally referred to as “swap advisors.” 41 Swap advisors may provide advice solely with
respect to a municipal derivative transaction or may provide advice in other types of municipal
advisory capacities.
Further, municipal advisors may provide advice to municipal entities concerning guaranteed
investment contracts and investment strategies. 42 These advisory firms may assist in the investment
of proceeds from bond offerings as well as manage other public monies. Such public monies
include general and special funds of state and local governments, public pension plans, and other
funds dedicated to public programs, such as public transportation, police and fire protection, public
health, and public education. In addition, municipal advisors may help state and local governments
find and evaluate other advisors that manage public funds and provide other types of services. 43
Other persons that may be required to register as municipal advisors include those who

solicit municipal entities on behalf of brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, municipal
advisors, and investment advisers. Such solicitation activities are discussed herein. 44
b. Municipal Entities and Municipal Financial Products
The municipal securities market consists of approximately 44,000 issuers, 45 a diverse group
that includes states, their political subdivisions (such as cities, towns, counties, and school districts),
and their instrumentalities, authorities, agencies, and special districts. These public bodies are
governed by state and local laws, including state constitutions, statutes, city charters, and municipal
codes. 46 Such constitutions, statutes, charters, and codes impose on municipal issuers requirements
relating to governance, budgeting, accounting, and other financial matters. 47 The governing bodies
of municipal issuers are as varied as the types of issuers, ranging from state governments, cities,
towns, counties, and school districts, to authorities, agencies, and other special districts. 48
Municipal securities are issued by government entities to pay for a variety of public projects,
to obtain cash flow for other governmental needs, and to provide tax-exempt or taxable financing
for non-governmental private projects by acting as a conduit on behalf of private organizations. 49 In
2011, there were over one million different municipal bonds outstanding, totaling $3.7 trillion in

The Internal Revenue Code delineates the purposes for which tax-exempt municipal bonds

conduit borrowers. See 26 U.S.C. 142-145, 1394.

Further, in 2011, the average daily trading volume for the municipal bond market was $11.3
billion.52
Interests offered by college savings plans (“529 Savings Plans”) that comply with Section
529 of the Internal Revenue Code 53 are another type of municipal security. 529 Savings Plans
involve offerings of interests in state tuition programs and qualified savings plans that are public
instrumentalities of the particular state, and provide tax advantages designed to encourage saving
for future college costs. 54 529 Savings Plan assets have increased from approximately $9 billion in
2000 to approximately $190 billion in 2012, and the number of 529 Savings Plan accounts has
increased from approximately 1.3 million in 2000 to approximately 11 million in 2012. 55
A person that sells interests in 529 Savings Plans generally must be registered as a broker,
dealer, or municipal securities dealer and comply with applicable MSRB rules. 56 529 Savings Plans
are also relevant in the context of municipal advisor regulation, because an issuance of interests in

529 Savings Plans is an issuance of municipal securities. 57 Further, 529 Savings Plans may engage
in transactions involving municipal financial products and may also seek advice in connection with
such products or issuances. 58 Moreover, third parties seeking to advise 529 Savings Plans may
solicit such plans for that purpose. 59
Public pension plans may also engage in transactions in municipal financial products and
seek advice in connection with such transactions. Third parties may solicit these public pension
plans on behalf of firms seeking to provide advice to these plans. 60 According to the 2011 Census
Bureau survey, there were 3,418 state- and locally-administered pension systems in 2011. 61 As of
the first quarter of 2013, public pension plans had over $3 trillion of assets and represented
approximately 30 percent of all U.S. pension assets. 62
In addition to public pension plans and 529 Savings Plans, state and local government
agencies also maintain other pools of assets, including general funds and other special funds.
Governmental entities generally invest such funds in a combination of individualized investments,

investment agreements, and local government investment pools (“LGIPs”). 63
Historically, the over-the-counter derivatives markets have been relatively opaque because
of their privately negotiated, bilateral nature and the limited availability of transaction data such as
prices and volumes. 64 Accordingly, there is currently no comprehensive data on how many
municipal issuers are active in the $162 trillion interest-rate swap market, 65 although reported
estimates of the size of the municipal derivatives market range from $100 billion to $300 billion
annually in notional principal amount. 66 Further, estimates of the number of municipal issuers that
have engaged in derivative transactions also vary. Some anecdotal evidence suggests a relatively
wide use of municipal derivatives in recent years. For instance, a 2008 review of Pennsylvania
Department of Community and Economic Development records indicated that 185 school districts,
towns, and counties in Pennsylvania have entered into derivative transactions since 2003, when the
state’s law was explicitly changed to allow for such transactions. 67 Other estimates, however, have

63

According to a 2009 article, 45 states have LGIPs with assets totaling more than $250
billion. See Jeff Pentages, Local Government Investment Pools and the Financial Crisis:
Lessons Learned, October 2009, Government Finance Review 25. As of the first quarter of
2013, state and local governments had approximately $2.1 trillion dollars in total financial
assets. See Federal Reserve Board, Financial Accounts of the United States – Flow of
Funds, Balance Sheets, and Integrated Macroeconomic Accounts, Table L.104 (First Quarter
2013), available at http://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/z1/current/z1.pdf.

64

The Dodd-Frank Act, however, will require more public reporting of derivative transactions
in the future. For example, the CFTC has adopted rules to implement a framework for the
real-time public reporting of swap transactions and pricing data for swap transactions. See
77 FR 1182 (January 9, 2012). Moreover, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the Commission to
adopt, and the Commission has proposed, rules to provide for the reporting of security-based
swaps information to registered security-based swap data repositories or to the Commission
and the public dissemination of security-based swap transaction, volume, and pricing
information. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 63346 (November 19, 2010), 75 FR
75208 (December 2, 2010).

pointed to a less widespread use of derivatives among municipal issuers. For example, a 2007 study
by Standard & Poor’s identified 750 municipal issuers that engaged in interest rate swaps. 68 In
addition, in October 2009, Moody’s undertook a review of the state and local governments for
which Moody’s provides ratings and identified 500 entities with outstanding interest rate swaps. 69
Moody’s also estimated that Pennsylvania issuers accounted for 22% of all municipal derivative
transactions, suggesting that a broad participation in derivative transactions by municipal entities in
Pennsylvania did not necessarily translate into a broad participation by municipal entities
nationwide. 70 Since 2008, the use of derivatives by municipal entities has declined, and many
municipal entities have terminated existing interest rate swaps. 71

Exchange Act 74 were both enacted with exemptions for municipal securities, except for the
antifraud provisions of Section 17(a) of the Securities Act, Section 10(b) of the Exchange Act, and
Rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder. 75 In the early 1970s, the municipal securities market was still
relatively small. 76 Up until that time, the standard issue was usually a general obligation bond, with
fairly standard features, and the typical participants were banks, underwriters, and bond counsel. 77
In 1975, Congress granted new authority to regulate intermediaries in the market for
municipal securities. As part of the Securities Acts Amendments of 1975 (“1975 Amendments”),
Congress created a limited regulatory scheme for the municipal securities market at the federal
level. 78 That scheme included mandatory registration with the Commission for brokers, dealers,
and municipal securities dealers involved in effecting municipal securities transactions, 79 and gave

There were $235.4 billion of municipal bonds outstanding in 1975 after an issuance of $58
billion in that year. See The Bond Buyer’s Municipal Finance Statistics, 1975 (June 1976).
At the end of 1976, there were $323 billion of corporate bonds outstanding, which was about
one third more than state and local government securities and about half as much as U.S.
Treasury securities. See Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Market for Corporate
Bonds (Autumn 1977). As of the first quarter of 2013, there were approximately $3.7
trillion of municipal bonds outstanding, $13 trillion of corporate and foreign bonds
outstanding, and $12 trillion of Treasury securities outstanding. See Federal Reserve Board,

The Exchange Act defines a “municipal securities dealer” as any person (including a
separately identifiable department or division of a bank) engaged in the business of buying
and selling municipal securities for its own account other than in a fiduciary capacity,
24

the Commission broad rulemaking and enforcement authority over such persons. 80 In addition, the
1975 Amendments authorized the creation of the MSRB and granted it authority to promulgate
rules concerning transactions in municipal securities by brokers, dealers, and municipal securities
dealers. The 1975 Amendments, however, did not create a regulatory scheme for, or impose any
new requirements on, municipal issuers. Rather, the 1975 Amendments expressly prohibited the
Commission and the MSRB from requiring municipal securities issuers, either directly or indirectly,
to file any application, report, or document with the Commission or the MSRB prior to any sale by
the issuer. 81
As noted above and in the Proposal, pursuant to the 1975 Amendments, unless an exception
or exemption applies, all brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers that underwrite or trade
municipal securities are required to register with the Commission.82 All brokers, dealers, and
municipal securities dealers that engage in municipal securities transactions also must register with
the MSRB and comply with its rules. 83 Furthermore, unless it is a bank, each broker, dealer, and
municipal securities dealer that engages in municipal securities transactions must be a member of
through a broker or otherwise. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(30).
80

See supra note 78. Enforcement activities regarding municipal securities dealers must be
coordinated by the Commission, the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority (“FINRA”),
and the appropriate bank regulatory agency. See Exchange Act Sections 15B(c)(6)(A),
15B(c)(6)(B), and 17(c) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(6)(A), 78o-4(c)(6)(B), 78q(c)).

Section 15B(d)(1) of the Exchange Act (commonly known as the “Tower Amendment”)
provides that “[n]either the Commission nor the Board is authorized under this title, by rule
or regulation, to require any issuer of municipal securities, directly or indirectly through a
purchaser or prospective purchaser of securities from the issuer, to file with the Commission
or the Board prior to the sale of such securities by the issuer any application, report, or
document in connection with the issuance, sale, or distribution of such securities.” 15

FINRA. 84 FINRA is required to examine brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers for
compliance with the Exchange Act, rules and regulations thereunder, and MSRB rules. 85 Bank
municipal securities dealers are examined by their appropriate regulatory agencies. 86
Since 1975, the municipal securities market has grown and evolved significantly to
encompass a wide variety of bond structures 87 and credit enhancements. The variety of financing
options has led municipal entities to increasingly rely on external advisors to assist them in deciding
among the structural choices for their debt and to help them negotiate with a variety of specialized
intermediaries. 88 For example, municipal bond insurance was first introduced in 1971. 89 The
introduction of variable rate municipal bonds in the early 1980s increased the use of letter of creditsupported municipal bonds. 90 In 1988, auction rate securities were introduced into the municipal
market. 91 In addition, derivative products have been utilized by municipal securities issuers

See 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(8) and 78o-4(a).

85

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(7).

86

The term “appropriate regulatory agency,” when used with respect to a municipal securities
dealer, is defined in Section 3(a)(34)(A) of the Exchange Act. 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(34)(A).
The Commission also has the authority to examine all registered municipal securities
dealers. See 15 U.S.C. 78q(b)(1).

87

Although it is helpful to think of municipal securities as either (1) general obligation bonds
backed by the “full faith and credit,” or an unlimited taxing power of the issuing entity, or
(2) revenue bonds, these general categories mask a broad range of diversity and complexity
in the underlying security for municipal bonds. See Gary Gray and Patrick Cusatis,
Municipal Derivative Securities – Uses and Valuation 21 (1995) (discussion of revenue
bonds). See also Disclosure of Bond Counsel, supra note 46, at 54-55 (discussion of conduit
bonds).

bond insurance has declined since 2008, these forms of credit enhancement remain an option
for municipal entities to consider when issuing municipal securities. See 76 FR at 827, note

beginning generally with interest rate swap transactions in the mid-1980s. The derivatives utilized
since then have become more complex. 92
b.

Municipal Advisors

As discussed above and in the Proposal, 93 many market participants advise municipal
entities about the issuance of municipal securities and municipal financial products. Historically,
however, these participants have been largely unregulated with respect to their municipal advisory
activities. In addition, Commission staff has taken the position that financial advisors that limit
their advisory activities solely to advising municipal issuers as to the structuring of their financings
may not need to register as investment advisers. 94
Approximately fifteen states, however, as well as a number of municipalities, have rules
relating to the conduct of some municipal advisors (generally, financial advisors and swap
advisors). For example, these governmental entities have enacted pay-to-play prohibitions that
range from broad proscriptions relating to all state and local contracts to narrowly defined rules that
apply only to specific situations. 95 Some state and local entities also require certain types of

92

See id., at 49. Municipal derivatives must often be structured in accordance with the
provisions of the tax code and other laws that apply to the issuance of tax-exempt
financings. See David L. Taub, Understanding Municipal Derivatives, August 2005,
Government Finance Review 21. The most common use for derivatives in the municipal
securities market is the use of interest rate swaps for new, anticipated, or outstanding debt.

B.

Dodd-Frank Act and the Need for Oversight

As discussed in more detail below and in the Proposal, 97 the Dodd-Frank Act amended the
Exchange Act to require municipal advisors to register with the Commission. 98 In addition, the
Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, grants the MSRB regulatory authority over
municipal advisors 99 and imposes a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal
entities. 100
The Commission believes that regulation of municipal advisors is in the public interest and
will improve the protection of municipal entities, including the protection of municipal entities in
their capacities as investors, and those who invest in municipal securities. As noted above, 101
according to a Senate Report related to the Dodd-Frank Act, “[t]he $3 trillion municipal securities
market is subject to less supervision than corporate securities markets, and market participants
generally have less information upon which to base investment decisions. During the [financial]

99

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b).

100

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c). Specifically, Exchange Act Section 15B(c)(1) provides that: “A
municipal advisor and any person associated with such municipal advisor shall be deemed to
have a fiduciary duty to any municipal entity for whom such municipal advisor acts as a
municipal advisor, and no municipal advisor may engage in any act, practice, or course of
business which is not consistent with a municipal advisor’s fiduciary duty or that is in
contravention of any rule of the Board.” 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(1). The Commission notes that
a number of commenters discussed the applicability of fiduciary duty to municipal advisors.
This adopting release generally does not address those comments, as this release generally
concerns the registration of municipal advisors. The Commission notes, however, that the
fiduciary duty of a municipal advisor, as set forth in Exchange Act Section 15B(c)(1),
extends only to its municipal entity clients. The Exchange Act does not impose a fiduciary
duty with respect to advice to obligated persons. See infra note 202 and accompanying text
(discussing the definition of the term “obligated person”).

crisis, a number of municipalities suffered losses from complex derivatives products that were
marketed by unregulated financial intermediaries.” 102 Accordingly, in response to the financial
crisis that began in 2008, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to require “a range of
municipal financial advisors to register with the [Commission] and comply with regulations issued
by the [MSRB].” 103
A number of actions brought by the Commission against municipal market participants also
highlight the abuses in the municipal securities market. For example, the Commission brought a
number of actions alleging payments by J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. (now J.P. Morgan Securities
LLC) to local firms whose principals or employees were friends of public officials of Jefferson
County, Alabama in connection with a $5 billion bond underwriting and interest rate swap
agreement business. 104 In addition, the Commission has settled several actions against major
financial institutions for their role in a series of complex, wide-ranging bid-rigging schemes

102

See S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 38 (2010).

103

See id.

104

The Commission had alleged that J.P. Morgan Securities engaged in an improper payment
scheme in connection with obtaining municipal securities underwriting and interest swap
agreement business from Jefferson County, Alabama. The Commission had alleged that J.P.
Morgan Securities incorporated certain of the costs of these payments into higher swap
interest rates that it charged the County, directly increasing the swap transaction costs to the
County and its taxpayers. J.P. Morgan Securities was censured, paid a $25 million civil
penalty, made a $50 million payment to the County, and forfeited more than $647 million in
claimed termination fees under the swaps. See In the Matter of J.P. Morgan Securities Inc.,
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 60928 (Nov. 4, 2009) (order instituting administrative
and cease-and-desist proceedings, making findings, and imposing remedial sanctions and a
cease-and-desist order). See also SEC v. Larry P. Langford, et al., Litigation Release No.
20545 (Apr. 30, 2008) and SEC v. Charles E. LeCroy and Douglas W. MacFaddin,

official, a bond dealer and J.P. Morgan Securities employees with conducting undisclosed
payment schemes in connection with awarding Jefferson County municipal bond and swap
agreement business).

involving derivatives utilized by municipalities and underlying obligors as reinvestment products. 105
Further, in August 2011, the Commission filed a civil injunctive action against Stifel, Nicolaus &
Co., Inc. and its former Senior Vice President, David Noack, for allegedly violating federal
securities laws in connection with a $200 million sale of highly leveraged and unsuitably risky
derivatives to five Wisconsin school districts. 106 According to the complaint, Stifel and Noack
misrepresented the risks of the investments and failed to disclose material facts to the school
districts.

Interim Final Temporary Rule 15Ba2-6T and Form MA-T

The registration requirement for municipal advisors established by the Dodd-Frank Act
became effective on October 1, 2010. 107 To enable municipal advisors to temporarily satisfy the

Collectively, the five financial institutions, Banc of America Securities LLC, UBS Financial
Services Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Wachovia Bank, N.A., and GE Funding Capital
Market Services, Inc., paid $205 million to settle the Commission actions, all of which was
distributed to hundreds of harmed municipal entities or borrowers, located in 47 states, the

RBC Capital Markets, LLC for their involvement in these sales. According to the order
instituting administrative and cease-and-desist proceedings, RBC negligently recommended
and sold these investments, despite significant internal concerns about the suitability of the
investments for municipalities like the school districts. Moreover, RBC’s marketing
materials failed to explain adequately the risks associated with the investments. See In the

entities, the Commission adopted interim final temporary Rule 15Ba2-6T 108 on September 1,
2010. 109 Pursuant to Rule 15Ba2-6T, a municipal advisor may temporarily satisfy the statutory
registration requirement by submitting certain information electronically through the Commission’s
public website on Form MA-T. 110
Form MA-T requires a municipal advisor to indicate the purpose for which it is submitting
the form (i.e., initial application, amendment, or withdrawal), provide certain basic identifying and
contact information concerning its business, indicate the nature of its activities, and supply
information about its disciplinary history and the disciplinary history of its associated municipal
advisor professionals. 111
As originally adopted, the interim final temporary rule provided that, unless rescinded, a
municipal advisor’s temporary registration by means of Form MA-T would expire on the earlier of:
(1) the date that the municipal advisor’s registration is approved or disapproved by the Commission
pursuant to a final rule establishing a permanent registration regime; (2) the date on which the
municipal advisor’s temporary registration is rescinded by the Commission; or (3) December 31,
2011. 112 The temporary registration procedure was developed as a transitional step toward the
implementation of a permanent registration regime, which, as discussed below, the Commission is
adopting today. On December 21, 2011, the Commission extended the expiration date of the

17 CFR 240.15Ba2-6T.

109

See Temporary Registration Rule Release, supra note 5.

110

17 CFR 249.1300T. A municipal advisor that completes the temporary registration form
and receives confirmation from the Commission that the form was filed is temporarily
registered for purposes of Section 15B. As of March 31, 2013, there were approximately
1,130 Form MA-T registrants.

temporary registration regime to September 30, 2012, in order to continue to provide a method for
municipal advisors to temporarily satisfy the statutory registration requirement. 113 On September
21, 2012, the Commission further extended the expiration date of the temporary registration regime
to September 30, 2013. 114 Today, in a separate release, the Commission is extending the expiration
date of the temporary registration regime to December 31, 2014. 115 This extension will enable
municipal advisors that are required to register with the Commission on or after the Effective Date
but before the applicable compliance date to continue to register under the temporary registration
regime.
D. Proposal to Establish a Registration Regime for Municipal Advisors
In light of the requirements of Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act, and in anticipation of the
expiration of Rule 15Ba2-6T, on December 20, 2010, the Commission proposed Rules 15Ba1-1 to
15Ba1-7 under the Exchange Act and Forms MA, MA-I, MA-W, and MA-NR to establish a
permanent registration regime for all persons meeting the definition of municipal advisor, including
those persons currently registered on Form MA-T. 116 The Proposal was published for comment in
the Federal Register on January 6, 2011. 117
In response to the Proposal, the Commission received over 1,000 unique comment letters
113

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 66020 (December 21, 2012), 76 FR 80733
(December 27, 2011).

114

See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 67901 (September 21, 2012), 77 FR 59061
(September 26, 2012). As extended, all temporary municipal advisor registrations will
expire on the earlier of: (1) the date that the municipal advisor’s registration is approved or
disapproved by the Commission pursuant to a final rule adopted by the Commission
establishing another manner of registration of municipal advisors and prescribing a form for
such purpose; (2) the date on which the municipal advisor’s temporary registration is
rescinded by the Commission; or (3) on September 30, 2013. See 17 CFR 240.15Ba2-6T(e).

from broker-dealers, investment advisers, individuals, banks, municipal entities, attorneys,
engineers, and other market participants. 118 In general, commenters supported the Proposal’s
overarching goal to establish a permanent registration regime for municipal advisors. As discussed
further below, however, many commenters recommended that the Proposal be modified or clarified
in certain respects.
The Commission has carefully considered these comments and is adopting Rules 15Ba1-1 to
15Ba1-8 and 15Bc4-1 under the Exchange Act and Forms MA, MA-I, MA-W, and MA-NR, with
revisions as appropriate. In discussing these rules and forms, the Commission highlights and
addresses below commenters’ main issues, concerns, and suggestions.
The Commission believes that the information required to be disclosed pursuant to the new
rules and forms will enhance the Commission’s oversight of municipal advisors and their activities
in the municipal securities market. Moreover, the Commission believes the information provided
pursuant to these rules and forms will aid municipal entities and obligated persons in choosing
municipal advisors and engaging in transactions or investments with municipal advisors.
III. DISCUSSION
Section 15B(a)(1) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, makes it
unlawful for a municipal advisor 119 to provide advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or
obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities, or to undertake a solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person, unless the

118

See http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-45-10/s74510.shtml. The Commission has also
considered the comment letters that were submitted in response to the publication of the
Temporary Registration Rule Release. See http://sec.gov/comments/s7-19-10/s71910.shtml
(comments received on the Temporary Registration Rule Release).

119

See infra Section III.A.1. (discussing the term “municipal advisor”).
33

municipal advisor is registered with the Commission. 120 Section 15B(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, as
amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides that a municipal advisor may be registered by filing with
the Commission an application for registration in such form and containing such information and
documents concerning the municipal advisor and any person associated with the municipal advisor
as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for
the protection of investors. 121
Consistent with the requirements of the Dodd-Frank Act, as discussed in detail below, the
Commission is adopting new rules and forms that establish a Commission registration regime for
municipal advisors, which the Commission believes is necessary and appropriate in the public
interest and will improve the protection of municipal entities and investors in municipal securities.
A.

Rules for the Registration of Municipal Advisors
1. Rule 15Ba1-1: Definition of “Municipal Advisor” and Related Terms
a.

Statutory Definition of “Municipal Advisor”

Section 15B(e)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act, 122 as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines
the term “municipal advisor” to mean a person (who is not a municipal entity123 or an employee of a
municipal entity124) that (i) provides advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated
person 125 with respect to municipal financial products 126 or the issuance of municipal securities, 127
120

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(1)(B). For a discussion of the terms “municipal entity,” “obligated
person,” “municipal financial products,” and “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated
person,” see infra Section III.A.1.b.

121

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2).

122

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(A).

123

See infra Section III.A.1.b.ii. (discussing the term “municipal entity”).

124

See infra Section III.A.1.c.i. (discussing the Commission’s interpretation of the exclusion
for employees of a municipal entity from the definition of the term “municipal advisor” and
a parallel exemption for employees of obligated persons).

125

See infra Section III.A.1.b.iii. (discussing the term “obligated person”).
34

including advice with respect to the structure, timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning
such financial products or issues, or (ii) undertakes a solicitation of a municipal entity. 128 As
discussed in the Proposal, 129 the statutory definition of municipal advisor is broad and includes
persons that traditionally have not been considered to be municipal financial advisors. Specifically,
the definition of a municipal advisor includes “financial advisors, guaranteed investment contract
brokers, third-party marketers, placement agents, solicitors, finders, and swap advisors” 130 that
engage in municipal advisory activities. 131
The statutory definition of municipal advisor includes distinct groups of professionals that
offer different services and compete in distinct markets. As noted in the Proposal, the three
principal types of municipal advisors are: (1) financial advisors, including, but not limited to,
brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers already registered with the Commission, that
provide advice to municipal entities with respect to their issuance of municipal securities and their
use of municipal financial products; 132 (2) investment advisers that advise municipal entities on the
investment of public monies, including the proceeds of municipal securities; 133 and (3) third-party
marketers and solicitors.
126

See infra Section III.A.1.b.iv. (discussing the term “municipal financial products”).

127

See infra Section III.A.1.b.vii. (discussing the term “issuance of municipal securities”).

128

See infra Section III.A.1.b.x. (discussing the term “solicitation of a municipal entity or
obligated person”).

129

See Proposal, 76 FR at 828.

130

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4).

131

See infra note 143 and accompanying text (discussing the definition of “municipal advisory
activities”).

132

See Proposal, 76 FR at 829. For clarity, the Commission notes that financial advisors as
referred to herein also include swap advisors, including some that are registered with the
CFTC or the SEC in other capacities, that provide advice to municipal entities on their use
of municipal financial products.

133

See infra Section III.A.1.b.iv. (discussing the term “proceeds of municipal securities”).
35

Relevant exclusions from the definition of a municipal advisor also limit the scope of the
three types of municipal advisors. The statutory definition of municipal advisor explicitly excludes
“a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer serving as an underwriter…, attorneys offering
legal advice or providing services that are of a traditional legal nature, [and] engineers providing
engineering advice[.]” 134 Further, the statutory definition of municipal advisor excludes “any
investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [(“Investment Advisers
Act”)], or persons associated with such investment advisers who are providing investment advice”
and “any commodity trading advisor registered under the Commodity Exchange Act or persons
associated with a commodity trading advisor who are providing advice related to swaps[.]” 135 As
discussed more fully below in Section III.A.1.c., the Commission also proposed Rule 15Ba11(d)(2), and is adopting with modifications as Rules 15Ba1-1(d)(2) and 15Ba1-1(d)(3) a definition
of “municipal advisor” that interprets those exclusions and provides other activity-based (but not
status-based) exemptions.
The Commission also noted in the Proposal that, in defining the term municipal advisor in
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4), Congress did not distinguish between persons who are
compensated for providing advice and those who are not. Accordingly, as explained in the
Proposal, the Commission believes compensation for providing advice with respect to municipal
financial products or the issuance of municipal securities should not factor into the determination of
whether a person must register with the Commission as a municipal advisor. 136 However, as
clarified in this release, whether or not a person would have to register as a municipal advisor in
connection with solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person would depend upon whether

136

See Proposal, 76 FR at 832, note 113 and accompanying text.
36

such person receives compensation (direct or indirect). 137
b. Interpretation of the Term “Municipal Advisor”; Definition of
Related Terms
As noted above, Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4) defines the term “municipal advisor” to
mean, in part, a person (who is not a municipal entity or an employee of a municipal entity) that (i)
provides advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal
financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, or (ii) undertakes a solicitation of a
municipal entity or obligated person. 138 The Commission discusses below the terms “municipal
entity,” “obligated person,” “municipal financial products,” and “solicitation of a municipal entity
or obligated person” as well as other terms relating to the definition of municipal advisor. 139 Rule
15Ba1-1(d), as proposed 140 and adopted, provides that the term “municipal advisor” has the same
meaning as in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4), 141 and, as discussed in Section III.A.1.c., provides
certain exclusions and exemptions. For the purposes of clarity, however, Rule 15Ba1-1(d) as
adopted also includes several non-substantive and organizational changes. For example, it: (1)
137

See infra note 409 and accompanying text.

138

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4). As noted in the Proposal, the Commission interprets the
definition of “municipal advisor” to include the solicitation of a municipal entity or
obligated person, because, as noted in the Proposal, the definition of municipal advisor
under Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(A) means, in part, a person that “undertakes a
solicitation of a municipal entity,” and in defining the phrase “solicitation of a municipal
entity,” Exchange Act Section 15B includes within that phrase, “or obligated person.” Also,
Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(1)(B) includes solicitations of obligated persons. See
Proposal, 76 FR at 831, note 102 and accompanying text.
See also Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1)(i), which makes clear in the definition of “municipal advisor”
that the Commission interprets the term “municipal advisor” to include persons that
undertake solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.

139

The Commission discusses the statutory exclusion for “an employee of a municipal entity,”
along with other exclusions and exemptions from the definition of “municipal advisor,” in
Section III.A.1.c. below.

140

See proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1).

141

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4).
37

incorporates in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1) the language of the statutory definition, rather than cross
referencing the statute; (2) sets forth in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2) the statutory exclusions from the
definition, as interpreted by the Commission; and (3) sets forth in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3) certain
exemptions.142
In certain of the rules and forms that the Commission is adopting with respect to the
registration of municipal advisors, the Commission uses the term “municipal advisory activities” to
refer to the activities that would generally require a person to register as a municipal advisor. In this
regard, the Commission is adopting, substantially as proposed, a definition of the term “municipal
advisory activities” with minor clarifying modifications. As adopted, “municipal advisory
activities” means “(1) [p]roviding advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person
with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, including
advice with respect to the structure, timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning such
financial products or issues; or (2) [s]olicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.” 143 The
142

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d). To the extent the Commission’s exemptions or interpretations of the
exclusions differ substantively from the Proposal, those differences are discussed in detail
below.

143

In the Proposal, the Commission proposed to give “municipal advisory activities” the same
meaning as the term “municipal advisory services” in Rule 15Ba2-6T (the temporary rule
for the registration of municipal advisors). Thus, in proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(e), the
Commission proposed to define “municipal advisory activities” to mean “advice to or on
behalf of a municipal entity (as defined in Section 15B(e)(8) of the Securities Exchange Act
of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(8)) or obligated person (as defined in Section 15B(e)(10) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(10)) with respect to municipal
financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, including advice with respect to
the structure, timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning such financial products or
issues; or a solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.” See Proposal, 76 FR at
829, note 77 and proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(e).
While the Commission received a few comments that certain activities should not be
“municipal advisory activities,” these comments were in the context of whether certain
persons should be subject to registration as “municipal advisors” and are addressed below in
the context of the various exemptions and exclusions from the definition of “municipal
advisor.” See, e.g., notes 780, 807, 835 and accompanying text (citing the Gilmore & Bell
38

Commission notes, for example, that advice to a municipal entity about whether to issue municipal
securities would be “municipal advisor activity.”
Additionally, as discussed more fully below, in response to comments received on the
Proposal and to provide additional clarity, the Commission is adopting rule text to provide guidance
on the term “advice.” The Commission also notes, as mentioned above and explained in more
detail below, that the definitions of “municipal advisor” and related terms that it is adopting today
include several non-substantive, clarifying changes designed to reorganize and simplify the rule,
including using defined terms, where possible, and providing greater clarity as to which statutory
standards are being incorporated into the Commission’s rules, the Commission’s interpretation of
such standards, and any exemptions the Commission is providing with these rules.
i. Advice Standard in General
In the Proposal and as noted above, the Commission defined the term “municipal advisory
activities,” which includes certain advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated
person, 144 and addressed the scope of activities that would require a person to register as a

Letter, the Rose Letter, and the Brinckerhoff Letter, in the context of exclusions or
exemptions for accountants, attorneys, and engineers, respectively). These comments are
addressed in Section III.A.1.c.vii.
The Commission is adopting the definition of “municipal advisory activities” substantially
as proposed, but with minor non-substantive modifications to provide greater clarity and
consistency with other organizational changes the Commission is making to the definitions.
Specifically, the Commission is defining “municipal advisory activities” to mean “the
following activities specified in section 15B(e)(4)(A) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(A))
and paragraph (d)(1) of this section that, absent the availability of an exclusion under
paragraph (d)(2) of this section or an exemption under paragraph (d)(3) of this section,
would cause a person to be a municipal advisor: (1) [p]roviding advice to or on behalf of a
municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the
issuance of municipal securities, including advice with respect to the structure, timing,
terms, and other similar matters concerning such financial products or issues; or (2)
[s]olicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.” See Rule 15Ba1-1(e).
144

See Proposal, 76 FR at 829, note 77. See also supra note 143 and accompanying text
(discussing the term “municipal advisory activities”).
39

municipal advisor. The Commission discussed the scope of such activities through its proposed
interpretation of the definition of “municipal advisor,” which included guidance on the particular
statutory exclusions and exemptions therefrom. 145
In the Proposal, the Commission requested comment on its interpretation of the definition of
“municipal advisor” and related terms, and particularly sought comment on whether any of its
interpretations should be in any way modified or clarified. 146 The Commission also requested
comment on whether its interpretation of certain exclusions from the definition of “municipal
advisor” should be narrowed or expanded to exclude or include various activities. 147 More
specifically, the Commission requested comment on whether it should exclude the following
persons from the definition of municipal advisor: (1) an entity that provides to clients investment
advice, such as research information and generic trade ideas or commentary that does not purport to
meet the needs or objectives of specific clients, and is provided to a municipal entity as part of its
ongoing ordinary communications; and (2) a broker-dealer that provides to a municipal entity a list
of securities meeting specified criteria that are readily available in the marketplace, but without
making a recommendation as to the merits of any investment particularized to the municipal entity’s
145

See, e.g., Proposal 76 FR at 832, text accompanying note 113 (discussing whether
compensation for providing advice factors into the determination of whether a person must
register as a municipal advisor), 833, note 118 and accompanying text (discussing the
provision of certain kinds of advice by investment advisers), 833 (discussing whether a
commodity trading advisor would be required to register as a municipal advisor if the
advisor provides certain kinds of advice), and 833-834 (discussing with respect to
accountants, attorneys and engineers whether certain kinds of advice and activities are
“advice” within the meaning of the Exchange Act or would otherwise cause such persons to
meet the definition of “municipal advisor”).

146

See Proposal, 76 FR at 835.

147

See id., at 836-838 (requesting comment on, among other things: whether there are other
services or activities engaged in by accountants, engineers, attorneys or other professionals
that should qualify such persons for exclusion from the definition of “municipal advisor;”
and whether there are other specific types of persons that should be excluded and the
circumstances under which they should be excluded).
40

specific circumstances or investment objectives. 148
In response to these requests for comment, commenters recommended additional guidance
on the meaning and scope of the term “advice” both in general and, as addressed in more detail in
subsequent sections on particular exclusions and exemptions, in the context of specific activities. A
number of commenters requested that the Commission clarify the meaning of providing “advice to a
municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of
municipal securities.” 149 One commenter noted that “the concept of ‘advice’ is central to the
application of Section 975,” 150 while another commenter stated that “[a]bsent a clear understanding
of the scope of ‘advice,’ there will be substantial uncertainty as to which communications with
municipal entity clients would be deemed ‘advice.’” 151 The Commission also received comments
suggesting general parameters for defining advice. For example, one commenter suggested that the

Commission “distinguish between situations in which information is provided to a municipal entity
or obligated person as opposed to a recommendation as to a specific course of action.” 152 Similarly,
another commenter suggested that “advice” is generally understood to contain a recommendation
component as distinguished from the mere giving of factual, objectively-determinable
information. 153
Regarding the provision of general information, commenters made general and specific
suggestions regarding the types of information that should not require registration as a municipal
advisor. For example, one commenter suggested that the provision of general information should
not be defined, in any instance, as municipal advisory activities that would give rise to a fiduciary
duty. 154 More specifically, other commenters suggested that broker-dealers be permitted to provide
general market, transactional or financial information, 155 attorneys be permitted to provide general
educational information to clients and non-clients, 156 and insurance companies be permitted to
provide certain general information of an educational nature regarding retirement plans without
being required to register as a municipal advisor. 157 With respect to municipal derivatives, one
commenter asked for clarification that the following activities do not constitute advice for purposes

of the municipal advisor definition: (i) the provision of research, general market information, and
product information that is not specific to a particular client and is provided to the bank’s customers
as part of its ordinary communications with clients or the public; and (ii) the provision of
information describing product alternatives that may meet the needs of a client without giving a
recommendation that the client engage in any specific transaction. 158
Additionally, several commenters recommended that advice be defined in accordance with
its commonly understood meaning – a recommendation to act. 159 One of these commenters further
recommended that the Commission clarify that a communication constitutes advice only when “it is
provided with respect to and directly relates to an enumerated municipal financial product or the
issuance of municipal securities, and it is a recommendation that is particularized to the needs and
circumstances of the recipient such that, under the prevailing facts and circumstances, a municipal
entity or obligated person would reasonably expect that it could rely and take action, without further
input, based upon such communication.” 160 Another commenter suggested that registration be
required only if a communication constitutes a recommendation that the municipal entity take an
action and the recommendation is particularized to the entity’s needs and is distinct from normal
sales efforts. 161
The Commission agrees with commenters that clarifying guidance on what constitutes
advice solely for the purposes of the municipal advisor definition will provide greater clarity
regarding the applicability of the municipal advisor registration requirement. The Commission does
not however believe that the term “advice” is susceptible to a bright-line definition. Instead, the

Commission believes that “advice” can be construed broadly and that, therefore, the determination
of whether a person provides advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or an obligated person
regarding municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities depends on all the
relevant facts and circumstances. 162 Accordingly, to address comments, the Commission is adopting
Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1)(ii), which provides that advice excludes, among other things, the provision of
general information that does not involve a recommendation regarding municipal financial products
or the issuance of municipal securities, including with respect to the structure, timing, terms, and
other similar matters concerning such financial products or issues. 163

162

In contexts outside of the municipal advisor definition, whether certain activities constitute
advice also is dependent on the facts and circumstances.
For example, in the context of broker-dealer regulation, Commission staff has described
that, although not a bright-line test, “[t]he more individually tailored the communication is
to a particular customer or targeted group of customers, the more likely it will be viewed as
a recommendation.” Study on Investment Advisers and Broker-Dealers (January 2011),
available at http://www.sec.gov/news/studies/2011/913studyfinal.pdf (“Study on Investment
Advisers and Broker-Dealers”) at 124.
In the context of investment adviser regulation, the determination of whether a particular
communication rises to the level of investment advice depends on the facts and
circumstances and is construed broadly. For example, Commission staff has interpreted the
definition of investment adviser to include persons who advise clients concerning the
relative advantages and disadvantages of investing in securities in general as compared to
other investments. See, e.g., Applicability of the Investment Advisers Act to Financial
Planners, Pension Consultants, and Other Persons Who Provide Investment Advisory
Services as a Component of Other Financial Services, Investment Advisers Act Release No.
1092 (October 8, 1987).
The Commission discusses below, with respect to its interpretation of the term “municipal
advisor” and the various exclusions and exemptions therefrom, whether certain activities
would be advice in the context of the municipal advisor registration regime.

163

The Commission is providing this clarifying guidance regarding “advice” only with respect
to municipal advisors and solely for purposes of the municipal advisor definition. The
Commission further notes that, by establishing certain parameters for advice, Rule 15Ba11(d)(1)(ii) clarifies not only the type of information or communications that may constitute
advice, but also the persons who may be subject to the municipal advisor definition in
Section 15B(e)(4) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)). For example, the
Commission believes that an individual performing by contract clerical or ministerial
services for a municipal entity or obligated person as part of performing these services
44

The Commission agrees with commenters that the provision of certain general information
does not constitute advice for purposes of the municipal advisor definition. For example, the
Commission believes that advice does not include provision of the following general information:
•

Information of a factual nature without subjective assumptions, opinions, or views;

•

Information that is not particularized to a specific municipal entity or type of
municipal entity;

•

Information that is widely disseminated for use by the public, clients, or market
participants other than municipal entities or obligated persons; or

•

General information in the nature of educational materials.

The Commission believes that educational materials constitute general information if the content is
limited to instructional or explanatory information, such as materials that describe the general
nature of financial products or strategies, do not include past or projected performance figures
(including annualized rate of return), do not include a recommendation to purchase or sell any
product or utilize any particular strategy, and to the extent additional disclosure is available about a
product (such as a prospectus), the materials contain information about how to obtain such
additional information. 164
Conversely, the definition of advice under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1)(ii), as adopted, does not
exclude information that involves a recommendation 165 regarding municipal financial products or

would generally not be providing advice, as defined in adopted Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1)(ii).
Accordingly, such person would not be required to register as a municipal advisor.
164

The Commission has similarly interpreted “educational materials” in other contexts. See,
e.g., Securities Act Release No. 6426 (September 16, 1982), 47 FR 41950 (September 23,
1982) (adopting Rule 134a under the Securities Act to permit the preparation and
dissemination of certain educational materials concerning options and options trading
without deeming such materials to be a prospectus).

165

Whether a “recommendation” has taken place is not susceptible to a bright line definition,
45

the issuance of municipal securities. Further and more precisely, the Commission believes that, for
purposes of the municipal advisor definition, advice includes, without limitation, a recommendation
that is particularized to the specific needs, objectives, or circumstances of a municipal entity or
obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities, including with respect to the structure, timing, terms, and other similar matters
concerning such financial products or issues, based on all the facts and circumstances. As discussed
above and consistent with the FINRA approach to what constitutes a recommendation, for purposes
of the municipal advisor definition, the Commission believes that the determination of whether a
but turns on the facts and circumstances of the particular situation. See Securities Exchange
Act Release No. 64766 (June 29, 2011), 76 FR 42396, 42415 (July 18, 2011) (“Business
Conduct Standards Proposal for Security-Based Swaps”). “This is consistent with the
FINRA approach to what constitutes a recommendation. In the context of the FINRA
suitability standard, factors considered in determining whether a recommendation has taken
place include whether the communication ‘reasonably could be viewed as a ‘call to action’’
and ‘reasonably would influence an investor to trade a particular security or group of
securities.’ The more individually tailored the communication to a specific customer or a
targeted group of customers about a security or group of securities, the greater the likelihood
that the communication may be viewed as a ‘recommendation.’” Business Conduct
Standards Proposal for Security-Based Swaps, 76 FR at 42415, note 133 and accompanying
text (citing FINRA Notice to Members 01-23 (March 19, 2001), and Notice of Filing of
Proposed Rule Change to Adopt FINRA Rules 2090 (Know Your Customer) and 2111
(Suitability) in the Consolidated FINRA Rulebook, Securities Exchange Act Release No.
62718A (August 20, 2010), 75 FR 52562 (August 26, 2010)).
FINRA suitability guidance has long provided that the determination of whether a
“recommendation” has been made is an objective rather subjective inquiry. See FINRA
Notice to Members 01-23 (March 19, 2001). In guidance relating to FINRA rules 2090 and
2011, FINRA reiterated this prior guidance, stating that an important factor in this inquiry
“is whether – given its content, context and manner of presentation – a particular
communication from a firm or associated person to a customer reasonably would be viewed
as a suggestion that the customer take action or refrain from taking action regarding a
security or investment strategy.” See FINRA Regulatory Notice 11-02 (Know Your
Customer and Suitability), January 2011, available at
http://www.finra.org/web/groups/industry/@ip/@reg/@notice/documents/notices/p122778.p

recommendation has been made is an objective rather than a subjective inquiry. 166 An important
factor in this inquiry is whether, considering its content, context and manner of presentation, the
information communicated to the municipal entity or obligated person reasonably would be viewed
as a suggestion that the municipal entity or obligated person take action or refrain from taking
action regarding municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities. 167
While the determination of whether a person provides advice depends on all the relevant
facts and circumstances, the more individually tailored the information to a specific municipal
entity or obligated person or a targeted group of municipal entities or obligated persons that share
common characteristics, such as school districts or hospitals, with respect to municipal financial
products or the issuance of municipal securities, the more likely it will be a recommendation that
constitutes advice under the municipal advisor definition, which would require registration as a
municipal advisor, absent the application of an exemption or exclusion from registration. 168 For
example, whether information describing municipal financial product alternatives constitutes advice
under the municipal advisor definition generally depends on how individually tailored the
information is to a particular municipal entity, obligated person, or targeted group of municipal
entities or obligated persons that share common characteristics, as well as the content, context, and
manner of presentation of the information communicated.

would influence an investor to trade a particular security or group of securities).

ii. Municipal Entity
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(8) provides that the term “municipal entity” means “any State,
political subdivision of a State, or municipal corporate instrumentality of a State, including – (A)
any agency, authority, or instrumentality of the State, political subdivision, or municipal corporate
instrumentality; (B) any plan, program, or pool of assets sponsored or established by the State,
political subdivision, or municipal corporate instrumentality or any agency, authority, or
instrumentality thereof; and (C) any other issuer of municipal securities.” 169 In the Proposal, the
Commission proposed to clarify that, with respect to clause (B) of the definition of “municipal
entity,” the definition includes, but is not limited to, public pension funds, LGIPs, and other state
and local governmental entities or funds, as well as participant-directed investment programs or
plans such as 529, 403(b), and 457 plans. 170
In the Proposal, the Commission requested comment on whether the proposed interpretation
of municipal entity for purposes of the proposed definition of municipal advisor is appropriate, and
whether additional clarification is necessary. 171 The Commission received approximately 20
comment letters regarding the scope of the Commission’s interpretation of the term “municipal
entity.” Based on consideration of the comments received, as further discussed below, the
Commission is making one change to its interpretation.
Several commenters suggested that the definition of “municipal entity” should be limited to
issuers of municipal securities 172 because the phrase “any other issuer of municipal securities” in

48

Section 15B(e)(8)(C) would otherwise be unnecessary. 173 In connection with these comments, one
commenter stated that the text and legislative history of the Dodd-Frank Act “are devoid of any
indication that its provisions addressing municipal securities were intended to grant the
[Commission] general prudential authority over State and local fiscal matters.” 174 This commenter
further stated that the “Dodd-Frank Act references to municipal securities were intended to address
securities (primarily municipal bonds) issued by ‘municipal entities’ to the class of
nongovernmental investors that the [Commission] is charged with protecting.” 175 Another
commenter, however, suggested that the definition, as proposed, should extend to public pension
funds, LGIPs, other government asset pools, and investor-directed governmental plans only to the
extent that they are political subdivisions of a state, or corporate instrumentalities of a state, that
issue municipal securities in the public market. 176 This commenter also stated that LGIPs, taxsheltered annuities, and deferred compensation plans should not be deemed to be municipal entities,
because they do not issue securities in the public municipal securities market. 177 Finally, another
commenter suggested that the definition of municipal entity should include obligated persons,
because the definition includes issuers of municipal securities, and obligated persons can be issuers

975 was not intended to address advice to an entity based on a mere possibility that it would

the extent that such affairs relate directly to its issuance or administration of municipal
securities).

of municipal securities pursuant to other provisions of the federal securities laws. 178
One commenter stated that, although Congress specifically referred to states, counties, cities,
and other political subdivisions, Congress did not refer to their pension or retirement plans when it
enacted Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act. This commenter further argued that governmental
retirement plans are separate legal entities from the municipal entities and are not ordinarily funded
by, or involved in, the types of transactions contemplated by Section 975 or the proposed rules. 179
178

According to this commenter, “municipal entity” is defined under the Dodd-Frank Act to
include “any other issuer of municipal securities,” and “issuer of municipal securities” is
defined under Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12 to mean “the governmental issuer specified in
section 3(a)(29) of the Act and the issuer of any separate security.” See letter from
Chapman and Cutler, dated February 22, 2011 (“Chapman and Cutler Letter”). Further, this
commenter stated that “municipal securities” is defined in the Exchange Act to include both
governmental bonds and tax-exempt “industrial development bonds.” This commenter
stated that, since the Commission has interpreted the term “obligated person” to have the
same meaning as in Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12, conduit borrowers under tax exempt bond
issues would be “issuers of separate securities” that are also “issuers of municipal
securities.” As a result, the commenter suggested that obligated persons under tax-exempt
bond issues are “municipal entities.”
The Commission does not agree. Although the Commission believes that the definition of
obligated person for purposes of municipal advisor registration should be consistent with the
definition of obligated person for purposes of Rule 15c2-12, the Commission is not applying
the definition of “issuer of municipal securities” in Rule 15c2-12 for purposes of interpreting
the definition of “municipal entity” in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(8). The Commission
does not believe that the definition of “municipal entity” should be interpreted to include
obligated persons, because the Dodd-Frank Act amended Exchange Act Section 15B to
separately define “municipal entity” (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(8)) and “obligated person” (15
U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(10)).

179

See letter from Daniel J. Wintz, Fraser Stryker, dated February 21, 2011 (“Fraser Stryker
Letter”). For example, this commenter stated that assets of plans qualified under Internal
Revenue Code Section 401(a) must be held in trust for the benefit of employees and their
beneficiaries, and qualified plan trusts maintained by governmental employers are prohibited
from engaging in transactions such as self-dealing with the plan sponsor. The commenter
also provided that 403(b) plans are typically funded with employee and employer
contributions, which are used to purchase annuity contracts or are deposited in custodial
accounts, the assets of which are invested in mutual funds. Finally, the commenter stated
that 457 plans allow employees of political subdivisions to defer compensation. All
amounts deferred under the plan, all property and rights purchased with the amounts, and all
income attributable to such amounts, property, or rights, must be held in trust for the
exclusive benefit of the participants and their beneficiaries. See also letter from Clifford E.
50

Another commenter questioned whether a public retirement system would be a municipal entity, a
municipal financial product, or both. 180
Other commenters suggested that the definition of municipal entity should exclude public
pension plans or participant-directed plans. 181 One commenter stated that these plans have nothing
to do with raising funds for a municipal entity or investing proceeds from an offering of municipal
securities. 182 This commenter also stated that once the funds are contributed to a governmental
retirement plan, they are no longer the property or held for the benefit of the municipal entity that
established the plan. 183 Further, this commenter stated that the definition of municipal entity should
not include individual participants in a governmental retirement plan. 184
One commenter stated that the Commission should clarify that municipal entity only
includes entities that are controlled by, or established for the benefit and enjoyment of, a state or

180

See letter from Richard K. Matta, Groom Law Group, on behalf of the State Board of
Administration of Florida, dated February 28, 2011 (“State Board of Administration of

employee exclusion from the definition of municipal advisor would apply to public
retirement systems.

181

See, e.g., Alaska Retirement Management Board Letter; Committee of Annuity Insurers
Letter I; Fraser Stryker Letter.

182

See Committee of Annuity Insurers Letter I. This commenter stated that, if the Commission
were to modify the definition of “municipal entity” so it did not include 457 plans and
403(b) plans, its concerns regarding the impact of the proposed rules on separate accounts,
broker-dealers and investment advisers for insurance contracts would be mooted. See infra
notes 386 and 405 and accompanying text.

183

See Committee of Annuity Insurers Letter I.

See id. As such, this commenter asked the Commission to clarify that the municipal advisor
registration regime does not apply to persons providing investment advice to individual plan
participants or investment education provided to plan participants.
51

any of its constituent political subdivisions or municipal corporations. 185 This commenter noted
that some public pension plans, “sponsored or established” by states or their political subdivisions
or municipal corporations, are not controlled by the sponsoring governmental unit but are instead
controlled by trustees with plenary authority. 186 This commenter also suggested that private
pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies recognized under state law as such entities
as a result of a filing with a state official and issuance of a certificate of formation should not be
included within clause (B) of the definition of municipal entity as a “plan, program or pool of assets
sponsored or established by the State….” 187
The Commission has carefully evaluated comments received on its proposed definition of
“municipal entity” and continues to believe that the definition of “municipal entity” should not be
limited to issuers of municipal securities. 188 The Commission believes that the phrase “any other
issuer of municipal securities” does not limit clauses (A) and (B) of the definition to entities that can
issue municipal securities. Many of the plans, programs and pools of assets included in clause (B)
of Section 15B(e)(8) do not issue municipal securities. Further, the definition of municipal entity
does not otherwise limit itself to those entities that issue municipal securities. To limit the entities
listed in clause (A) and (B) of Section 15B(e)(8) to issuers of municipal securities would also limit
the definitions of “municipal financial products” (and therefore “municipal derivatives”) and
“solicitation of a municipal entity” to encompass only those entities that issue municipal securities.
Under such a limited definition, advice with respect to municipal derivatives, for example, would

See id. The commenter expressed concern that the Commission’s proposed interpretation
that the definition of municipal entity includes “participant-directed investment programs or
pools” could be interpreted to include private plans established by an entity chartered by a
state.

52

not subject advisors to registration unless the municipal entity entering into a swap 189 was also an
issuer of municipal securities. This limited definition would also allow third parties to solicit
various public pension funds and LGIPs on behalf of brokers, dealers, investment advisers, and
municipal advisors without registering as municipal advisors. The Commission believes that such
entities should have the protections provided by municipal advisor registration. 190
The Commission believes public employee retirement systems and public employee benefit
plans or public pension plans (including participant-directed plans, 403(b), and 457 plans) 191 fall
189

Unless the context otherwise requires, for purposes of the discussion in this release, swap
refers to swaps and security-based swaps.

190

The Commission notes that Section 15B(b) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the DoddFrank Act, requires, among other things, that the MSRB adopt rules to effect the purposes of
the Exchange Act with respect to, among other things, “advice provided to or on behalf of
municipal entities or obligated persons by … municipal advisors with respect to municipal
financial products, the issuance of municipal securities, and solicitations of municipal
entities or obligated persons undertaken by brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers,
and municipal advisors.” See Section 15B(b)(2) of the Exchange Act. At a minimum, the
rules of the MSRB, with respect to municipal advisors, must, among other things: “(i)
prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent acts, practices, and courses of business as
are not consistent with a municipal advisor’s fiduciary duty to its clients; (ii) provide
continuing education requirements for municipal advisors; [and] (iii) provide professional
standards.” See Section 15B(b)(2)(L) of the Exchange Act.

191

In this release, the Commission uses the term “public employee benefit plan” to refer to a
“pension plan” that is a “governmental plan” (as such terms are described below). Such
plans include “participant-directed plans,” “403(b) plans,” and “457 plans” (as such terms
are described below), and may be plans, funds, or programs (also described below). The
Commission also uses the term “public employee retirement system.” As described below, a
public employee retirement system is a special purpose government, and therefore, a public
employee pension plan or a public employee retirement system may itself be a municipal
entity. The Commission uses the term “private employee benefit plan” to refer to a pension
plan that is not a governmental plan.
The term “governmental plan” includes a plan established or maintained for its employees
by the Government of the United States, by the government of any state or political
subdivision thereof, or by any agency or instrumentality of any of the foregoing. See
Section 3(32) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1002(32).
The term “employee benefit plan” or “plan” means an employee pension benefit plan or a
plan which is both an employee welfare benefit plan and an employee pension benefit plan.
See Section 3(3) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C. 1002(3).

within the statutory definition of municipal entity. The Commission believes that each of these
plans constitutes a “plan, program, or pool of assets sponsored or established by the State, political
subdivision, or municipal corporate instrumentality or any agency, authority, or instrumentality
thereof.” 192
Further, the Commission believes that such plans should be afforded the protection granted
to municipal entities by the statute. The Commission notes that the solicitation of public pension

The terms “employee pension benefit plan” and “pension plan” mean any plan, fund, or
program which was heretofore or is hereafter established or maintained by an employer or
by an employee organization, or by both, to the extent that by its express terms or as a result
of surrounding circumstances such plan, fund, or program – (i) provides retirement income
to employees, or (ii) results in a deferral of income by employees for periods extending to
the termination of covered employment or beyond, regardless of the method of calculating
the contributions made to the plan, the method of calculating the benefits under the plan or
the method of distributing benefits from the plan. See Section 3(2) of ERISA, 29 U.S.C.
1002(2).
Pursuant to the Governmental Accounting Standards Board (“GASB”), “public employee
retirement system” means a special-purpose government that administers one or more
pension plans. Public employee retirement systems also may administer other types of
employee benefit plans, including postemployment healthcare plans and deferred
compensation plans. See GASB Statement No. 28: Accounting and Financial Reporting for
Pensions.
A “participant-directed plan” is a plan that provides for the allocation of investment
responsibilities to participants or beneficiaries. See U.S. Department of Labor, Fact Sheet:
Final Rule to Improve Transparency of Fees and Expenses to Workers in 401(k)-Type
Retirement Plans (February 2012), available at
http://www.dol.gov/ebsa/pdf/fsparticipantfeerule.pdf.
A “403(b) plan” is a tax-sheltered retirement plan, similar to a 401(k) plan, offered by public
schools and certain 501(c)(3) tax-exempt organizations. See Internal Revenue Service, IRC
403(b) Tax-Sheltered Annuity Plans, available at http://www.irs.gov/Retirement-Plans/IRC403(b)-Tax-Sheltered-Annuity-Plans.
A “457 plan” is a deferred compensation plan as described in IRC section 457, which is
available for certain state and local governments and non-governmental entities tax exempt
under IRC section 501. See Internal Revenue Service, IRC 457(b) Deferred Compensation
Plans, available at http://www.irs.gov/retirement/article/0,,id=172437,00.html.

plans 193 in connection with investment advisory services has been subject to multiple Commission
enforcement actions. For example, in 2009, the Commission charged a former New York State
official and top political advisor with allegedly defrauding the New York State Common Retirement
Fund by causing the fund to invest billions of dollars with private equity funds and hedge fund
managers who paid millions of dollars in the form of sham “finder” or “placement agent” fees. 194
The Commission notes, however, that individual natural person participants in a public
employee benefit plan do not fall within the definition of municipal entity, because such persons
would not be a state, political subdivision of a state, or municipal corporate instrumentality.
Similarly, private employee benefit plans, mutual funds, and insurance companies that are not
sponsored or established by a state, political subdivision, or municipal corporate instrumentality or
any agency, authority, or instrumentality thereof, do not fall within the statutory definition of
municipal entity. 195 Such funds and entities are not “established or sponsored by” a state merely
because they file with a state official or are issued a certificate of formation by a state.
As noted above, three commenters 196 stated that funds contributed to a governmental plan
are no longer the property of, or held for the benefit of or controlled by, the municipal entity that

person”).

Employees’ Retirement System and his close personal friend with allegedly scheming to
defraud an investment firm into paying $20 million in fees to the friend’s placement agent
firms. See SEC Charges Former CalPERS CEO and Friend With Falsifying Letters in $20

established the plan, and that such plans are not ordinarily funded by or involved in the types of
transactions contemplated by Congress. These commenters argued that, as a result, these plans
should be excluded from the definition of municipal entity. The Commission does not agree. Such
a plan is “sponsored or established” by the municipal entity and, therefore, falls within the statutory
definition of municipal entity.
One commenter suggested that the phrase “any State, political subdivision of a State, or
municipal corporate instrumentality of a State” in the interpretation of the definition of “municipal
entity” would be clearer if it were revised to read “any State, political subdivision of a State, or
municipal corporate instrumentality of a State or of a political subdivision of a State.” 197 The
commenter noted, for example, that a charter school may be organized as an “instrumentality of a
political subdivision of a State.”
Because states delegate powers to their political subdivisions and one of the powers that
may be delegated to political subdivisions is the ability of political subdivisions to create corporate
instrumentalities, 198 the Commission believes that a municipal entity organized as a municipal
corporate instrumentality of a political subdivision of a state is properly considered a municipal
corporate instrumentality of a state. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(g) to
reflect such interpretation and define municipal entity to include municipal corporate
instrumentalities of political subdivisions of states. 199

See Rule 15Ba1-1(g), which defines municipal entity to mean “any State, political

iii. Obligated Person
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(10) provides that the term “obligated person” means “any
person, including an issuer of municipal securities, who is either generally or through an enterprise,
fund, or account of such person, committed by contract or other arrangement to support the payment
of all or part of the obligations on the municipal securities to be sold in an offering of municipal
securities.” 200 In the Proposal, in response to a commenter’s request for clarification, 201 the
Commission stated its belief that the definition of obligated person for purposes of the definition of
municipal advisor should be consistent with the definition of obligated person for purposes of Rule
15c2-12. 202 The Commission therefore proposed to exempt from the definition of obligated person
providers of municipal bond insurance, letters of credit, or other liquidity facilities. 203 In the
Proposal, the Commission stated its belief that this interpretation would not conflict with the goals
of the Dodd-Frank Act to provide further protections for certain entities that participate in
borrowings in the municipal securities market and would help ensure uniformity among rules

Rule 15c2-12 defines the term “obligated person” to mean “any person, including an issuer
of municipal securities, who is either generally or through an enterprise, fund, or account of
such person committed by contract or other arrangement to support payment of all, or part of
the obligations on the municipal securities to be sold in the Offering (other than providers of
municipal bond insurance, letters of credit, or other liquidity facilities).” See 17 CFR
240.15c2-12(f)(10). “Offering” as used in this definition is defined in Rule 15c2-12(a). See
17 CFR 240.15c2-12(a). See also Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34961 (November
10, 1994), 59 FR 59590 (November 17, 1994).

relating to such market, including uniformity relating to the definition of obligated persons. 204 The
Commission noted that providers of municipal bond insurance, letters of credit, or other liquidity
facilities are generally non-governmental providers of credit enhancements. 205 As providers of
credit enhancements, these entities are not borrowing funds through a municipal entity. Therefore,
the Commission stated in the Proposal its belief that they do not require the type of protection that
should be provided to those who, in municipal securities transactions, borrow funds through
municipal entities.
The Commission received approximately ten comment letters with regard to the definition
of “obligated person” and the application of the proposed rules to such persons.
Definition of “Obligated Person”
Generally, most commenters agreed that the definition of “obligated person” should be
consistent with the definition of that term in Rule 15c2-12, 206 or otherwise expressed support for the
proposed definition of obligated person. 207 Consequently, the Commission is adopting the
definition substantially as proposed, but with modifications for general consistency with the
application of the term in Rule 15c2-12 208 and certain clarifying modifications to address concerns
raised by commenters. Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-1(k) provides that obligated person “has the same
meaning as in section 15B(e)(10) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(10)); provided, however, the term
obligated person shall not include: (1) a person who provides municipal bond insurance, letters of
credit, or other liquidity facilities; (2) a person whose financial information or operating data is not

material to a municipal securities offering, without reference to any municipal bond insurance, letter
of credit, liquidity facility, or other credit enhancement; or (3) the federal government.”
The Commission believes that there is no reason to differentiate the definition of obligated
person for purposes of municipal advisor registration from the definition of obligated person for
other Exchange Act purposes. As discussed in the Proposal and herein, the Commission believes
that such definition will provide further protections for certain entities that participate in borrowings
in, and help ensure uniformity among rules relating to, the municipal securities market. The
continued use of a consistent definition will also provide clearer guidance to market participants.
Although most commenters supported the proposed definition, some commenters asked for
clarification. One commenter suggested that the definition should exclude persons who might
otherwise be deemed to be an obligated person solely on the basis of a commitment to support
payment of the underlying assets that secure such issue, other than a borrower, lessee, or installment
purchaser who is contractually responsible for payments that exceed a specified and substantial
materiality standard, or a guarantor of such a payment obligation, who is not otherwise excluded
from the definition of obligated person. 209 One commenter specifically stated that guaranty

209

See NABL Letter. The commenter stated that the interpretive guidance with respect to Rule
15c2-12 leaves open the possibility that some persons who are not directly committed to
support payment of a municipal securities issue may nonetheless be deemed to be obligated
persons by reason of their commitment to support payment of the underlying assets securing
the issue, based upon a factual analysis of their relationship to the issue. See id. See also
letter from Brett E. Lief, President, National Council of Higher Education Loan Programs,
dated February 16, 2011 (“National Council of Higher Education Loan Programs Letter”).
Another commenter stated that, according to the proposed rules, while some of its members
would fall within the definition of obligated person in each of its capital market financings,
under the materiality standard of Rule 15c2-12 under the Exchange Act, the commenter only
designates as obligated persons those members participating in the projects being financed
that have a significant percentage of the financial obligation that supports the debt service on
the commenter’s bonds. See letter from Robert W. Trippe, Senior Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer, American Municipal Power, Inc., dated February 21, 2011 (“American
Municipal Power Letter”).
59

agencies for loans under the Federal Family Education Loan Program (“FFELP”) should not be
deemed obligated persons. 210 Another commenter stated that companies registered under the
Exchange Act, the federal government and its instrumentalities, foreign governments and their
instrumentalities, religious organizations, and entities already subject to substantial oversight and
regulation, such as banks, credit unions, regulated investment companies, and insurance companies,
should be exempt from the definition of obligated person. 211
The Commission has carefully considered these comments. The Commission continues to
believe that there is no reason to differentiate the definition of obligated person for purposes of
municipal advisor registration from the definition of obligated person for purposes of Rule 15c2-12.
The Commission, however, is modifying the rule text of Rule 15Ba1-1(k) to clarify that the
definition of obligated person excludes persons whose financial information or operating data is not
material to a municipal securities offering, without reference to any municipal bond insurance, letter
of credit, liquidity facility, or other credit enhancement.
The continuing disclosure requirements of Rule 15c2-12 exclude certain obligated persons
whose financial information or operating data is not material to the issuance of municipal
securities. 212 Therefore, consistent with Rule 15c2-12, the Commission is clarifying that an entity

210

See National Council of Higher Education Loan Programs Letter.

211

See Kutak Rock Letter.

212

For example, Rule 15c2-12 requires a written agreement or contract to provide ongoing
information (1) with respect to any obligated person for whom financial information or
operating data is presented in the final official statement or (2) for each obligated person
meeting the objective criteria specified in the undertaking and used to select the obligated
persons for whom financial information or operating data is presented in the final official
statement, except that in the case of pooled obligations the undertaking shall specify such
objective criteria. See Rule 15c2-12(b)(5)(i)(A). The issuer and the other participants
determine at the time of preparation of the official statement which obligated persons are
material to the offering. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 34961 (November 10,
1994), 59 FR 59590, 59596 (November 17, 1994).
60

whose financial information or operating data is not material to an issuance of municipal securities
would not be an obligated person under Rule 15Ba1-1(k). Any advisor to such entity would not be
required to register as a municipal advisor, because such person would not be a municipal advisor
within the meaning of Rule 15Ba1-1(d). 213 In addition to promoting consistency, the Commission
believes that the materiality standard for secondary market disclosure in Rule 15c2-12 also serves as
an appropriate standard to identify those obligated persons that should have the protections afforded
by Section 15B of the Exchange Act. Using a similar approach ensures uniformity, provides
municipal market participants with existing guidance about how the rules should be applied, and
limits the application of the definition to only those persons whose financial information or
operating data is material to a municipal securities offering and for whom registration provides
significant benefits to the municipal marketplace.
While the definition of obligated person in the Proposal excluded only providers of
municipal bond insurance, letters of credit, or other liquidity facilities, the Commission understands
that credit enhancement for municipal securities is not necessarily limited to those three categories
and that many municipal securities may be credit enhanced indirectly. Prior guidance from
Commission staff provides that “[e]ntities that insure or guarantee performance of assets that have
been pledged to secure the repayment of the municipal obligation may fall within the definition of
‘obligated person’ . . . unless such insurance or guarantee has been obtained prior to and not in
contemplation of any offering of municipal securities, the insurance or guarantee relates only to the
individual pledged assets, and the insurance or guarantee exists independent of the existence of a

must separately determine whether its advice to that municipal entity would trigger the
municipal advisor registration requirement.
61

municipal obligation.” 214 Consistent with this prior guidance from Commission staff, the
Commission is adopting a definition of “obligated person” for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(k), which
provides that the ultimate determination as to whether an insurer or guarantor is an obligated person
under Rule 15c2-12 depends on the relationship to the financing itself, which is a factual
analysis. 215 Similarly, a determination of whether a guarantor or insurer falls within the exclusion
from the definition of obligated person for the purposes of the municipal advisor registration regime
also depends on the particular facts and circumstances. 216
In addition, the Commission notes that although the federal government and its
instrumentalities, as providers of credit enhancement, could fall within the definition of obligated
person under Rule 15c2-12, the federal government does not require the type of protection that
should be applicable generally to those who borrow funds through municipal entities in municipal
securities transactions. 217 Accordingly, for purposes of the municipal advisor registration regime,
the Commission is interpreting the definition of obligated person to exclude the federal government.
Therefore, advisors to the federal government and its instrumentalities providing credit
enhancements in connection with issuances of municipal securities are not required to register as
municipal advisors.
Another commenter stated that buyers of municipal securities rely on the letter of credit and

217

The federal government, as a credit enhancer, would not be borrowing any funds through a
municipal entity, and would therefore be in a position similar to that of providers of
municipal bond insurance, letters of credit, or other liquidity facilities that are excluded from
the definition of “obligated person” in Rule 15c2-12. In addition – unlike for the definition
of special entity – Congress did not include the federal government in the definition of
municipal entity. See infra note 275 (noting differences in the two definitions).
62

the credit rating of the lender issuing the bonds rather than the “ultimate borrower,” and the security
or collateral provided by a borrower goes to the lender or letter of credit issuer, not bondholders. 218
The commenter stated that the real borrower-lender relationship is between the borrower and the
bank issuing the letter of credit. 219 This commenter noted that these and other factors distance
conduit borrowers 220 from direct obligations to bondholders, but they nonetheless would be
obligated persons under the Proposal.
The Commission understands this commenter to be suggesting that such conduit borrowers
should not be considered obligated persons, such that their advisors would not have to register as
municipal advisors. The Commission, however, has taken the position that, regardless of whether
an obligated person obtains a letter of credit from a bank to guarantee the payment of municipal
securities, an obligated person has an obligation to investors. 221 The Commission has long been of
the view that the presence of credit enhancements generally would not be a substitute for material
disclosure concerning the primary obligor on municipal bonds. 222 Thus, an advisor to an obligated
person that has obtained a letter of credit from a bank to guarantee the payment of municipal
securities should not be treated differently from an advisor to an obligated person that has not

220

Many commenters used the term “conduit borrower” in their letters. Although the term
“conduit borrower” and “obligated person” do not have identical meanings, for purposes of
this release, the Commission is treating the comments regarding “conduit borrowers” as
applying to “obligated persons.”

obtained such credit enhancements, and would therefore have to register as a municipal advisor. 223
Application of Rules to Advisors to Obligated Persons
One commenter suggested generally that the proposed rules should be more strictly applied
to advisors dealing with municipal entities than to advisors dealing with obligated persons. The
commenter asserted that there is less public interest in regulating advice to private entities, and such
regulation is better handled outside of municipal markets regulation. 224 As stated above, obligated
persons assume the same role as municipal entities in an issuance of municipal securities, because
obligated persons are committed by contract or other arrangement to support the payment of all or
part of the obligations on the municipal securities. Further, defaults by private entity obligated
persons with respect to municipal securities can have negative consequences for municipal
entities. 225 Section 15B of Exchange Act (as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act), moreover, provides

223

The text of Rule 15Ba1-1(k) has also been clarified to provide that the definition of
obligated person excludes persons whose financial information or operating data is not
material to a municipal securities offering, without reference to any municipal bond
insurance, letter of credit, liquidity facility, or other credit enhancement.

224

See letter from Kendra York, Public Finance Director, State of Indiana, dated February 22,
2011 (“State of Indiana Letter”). This commenter stated that it is unrealistic to expect board
members, attorneys, and accountants of obligated persons to be aware that their activities
would be subject to Commission regulation. The commenter stated that it seems more
appropriate to regulate improvident and risky usage of derivatives by unsophisticated
borrowers by focusing on suitability rules applicable to the providers of these services,
rather than focusing on their use in the municipal market.

225

According to a Standard and Poor’s study of municipal bond defaults in the 1990s, bonds for
the three major types of conduit bond issues (healthcare, multi-family housing, and
industrial development) accounted for more than 70% of defaulted principal. More recent
reports have also indicated that non-governmental conduit borrowers account for more than
70% of municipal bond defaults. For example, a 2011 report stated that the largest share of
modern era defaults consists of industrial development revenue bonds, followed by bonds
supporting healthcare and housing. The report states that these three sectors accounted for
67% of all defaulting issues during the period of 1980 to 2011. See 2012 Report on the
Municipal Securities Market, supra note 45, at 24.
64

for the protection of both municipal entities and obligated persons. 226 Accordingly, the
Commission believes that the municipal advisor registration regime should generally apply in the
same manner to advisors of obligated persons as to advisors of municipal entities. 227
As described more fully below, however, the Commission is providing an exemption from
the definition of municipal advisor for persons providing advice with respect to certain “investment
strategies,” which will narrow the range of activities that would cause an advisor to an obligated
person to meet the definition of municipal advisor. 228 Also as described more fully below, the
Commission is limiting the scope of its definition of the term “municipal derivative” and its
interpretation of the term “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” as each applies to
obligated persons, such that an obligated person must be acting in its capacity as such and the
relevant activity is in connection with municipal securities (or, in the case of a solicitation,
municipal financial products). 229
When Does a Person Become an Obligated Person?
One commenter asked when a client would become an obligated person. 230 Specifically, the
commenter asked whether it would be rendering advice as a municipal advisor if it was engaged to
consider a client’s options regarding conventional versus conduit financing, but the client

226

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(C).

227

The Commission notes, however, that the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank
Act, imposes a fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities. See
15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(1). The statute does not impose a fiduciary duty with respect to advice
to obligated persons. See also supra note 100.

65

subsequently chose not to engage in conduit financing. 231 In addition, the commenter asked
whether only registered municipal advisors can solicit clients that are eligible to use conduit
financing. 232 Lastly, the same commenter asked whether a financial advisor would be required to
register as a municipal advisor if a client is examining its debt alternatives, among which is conduit
financing. 233
Whether a financial advisor that advises clients about conduit financing or other financing
options would be required to register as a municipal advisor would depend on the facts and
circumstances. A person will not be a municipal advisor to an obligated person until the obligated
person has begun the process of applying to, or negotiating with, a municipal entity to issue conduit
bonds on behalf of the obligated person. Activity that never results in solicitation of or actual
contact with a municipal entity does not have a sufficient nexus to municipal financial products or
the issuance of municipal securities to require registration as municipal advisor. Merely advising a
client on debt financing alternatives that include conduit financing is not a municipal advisory
activity, because the client would not be sufficiently close to being an obligated person with respect
to an issuance of municipal securities. 234 If a client is only considering conduit financing, the client
is not an obligated person. However, if the client applies to, or negotiates with, the municipal entity
to issue conduit bonds, the person advising the conduit borrower would be required to be registered
as a municipal advisor, regardless of whether or not the financing successfully closes.
One commenter argued that a person that is an obligated person does not remain an

Conversely, providing advice to a client who is a municipal entity regarding debt financing

obligated person indefinitely and is not an obligated person with respect to unrelated matters. 235
The Commission agrees and has limited the scope of the rules as applied to advice concerning
municipal financial products used by, and third-party solicitations of, obligated persons as described
herein. 236
The same commenter also argued that a person should not be deemed an obligated person if
it is not the initial obligor, but rather comes to support the payment of obligations on municipal
securities after the offering, through an assumption or other arrangement, and asked the
Commission to clarify that any relationship between an obligated person and its advisor will only be
considered a municipal advisory relationship to the extent that it directly involves a transaction in
which the person is an obligated person. 237 The Commission does not agree. It is the
Commission’s view that such a person would be an obligated person if the municipal securities
remain outstanding after the substitution of the obligated person, and such a person is an obligated
person for purposes of Rule 15c2-12. The obligated person’s responsibilities and need for
protection would be similar regardless of whether it was an initial obligor or a subsequent obligor.
The Commission notes that, as discussed, a person is only a municipal advisor to an obligated
person if it provides advice to, or on behalf of, the obligated person “with respect to municipal

See SIFMA Letter I.

236

See infra Section III.A.1.b.v. (discussing the definition of “municipal derivatives” and its

obligated persons).

237

See SIFMA Letter I. Further, another commenter stated that if an entity related to a
borrower agrees to guarantee, or be jointly obligated, on a borrowing, it should be treated as
the primary borrower and not as a municipal advisor. See letter from Kasey Kesselring,
President, South Lake County Hospital District, dated February 16, 2011 (“South Lake
County Hospital Letter”). The Commission notes that such an entity is not acting as an
advisor to its affiliated borrower merely by agreeing to guarantee or be jointly obligated on a
borrowing.
67

financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, including advice with respect to the
structure, timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning such financial products or issues” or
that meets the definition for “solicitation” of such obligated person. 238 The Commission also notes
that Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(10) defines obligated person to mean, among other things, “any
person… who is either generally or through an enterprise, fund, or account of such person,
committed by contract or other arrangement to support the payment of all or part of the obligations
on the municipal securities to be sold in an offering of municipal securities.” 239
Charter Schools
In the Proposal, the Commission noted that a charter school would generally fall under the
definition of municipal entity, but may, in certain circumstances, fall under the definition of
obligated person. 240 With respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities, the Commission asked in what circumstances should charter schools be considered
municipal entities or obligated persons. 241 Further, the Commission asked how the treatment of
charter schools under different state laws affects their classification as municipal entities or

238

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4).

239

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(10).

240

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(8). See also infra note 241.

241

See Proposal, 76 FR at 835.
In the Proposal, the Commission clarified, in response to a commenter, that charter schools
are considered to be public schools and generally derive their charter from a political
subdivision of a state (for example, local school boards, state universities, community
colleges, or state boards of education) and, therefore, would fall under the definition of
municipal entity. See id., at 829, notes 83-85 and accompanying text.
Charter schools, or persons that operate charter schools, such as charter school management
organizations that are organized as non-profit corporations, may issue municipal securities
through a municipal entity for capital needs, such as facilities that are not provided for by
state funding. In that instance, the charter school, or charter school management
organization, would be an obligated person with respect to the issuance of municipal
securities and any related municipal financial products. See id., at 829, note 85.
68

obligated persons. 242
One commenter stated that charter schools that have bonds issued on their behalf by a local
financing governmental entity are classic examples of obligated persons. 243 This commenter
suggested that, if a charter school receives tax money from a state or school district, the school
should be treated as a municipal entity. 244 Otherwise, the school should be treated as an obligated
person. 245 Another commenter stated that a charter school should be considered a municipal entity
if it is organized as a political subdivision of a state or an instrumentality of a political subdivision
of a state. 246 This commenter stated that, in other circumstances when providing for payment of
municipal securities, a charter school should be considered an obligated person. 247
As stated in the Proposal, the Commission continues to believe that charter schools are
generally municipal entities, because they are public schools and derive their charter from a political
subdivision of a state. While charter schools generally receive a portion of their funds from the
state, they may also raise funds through conduit borrowing, and may pledge funds other than state
money for the payment on the conduit borrowing. Thus, a charter school is an obligated person
under Section 15B(e)(10) and Rule 15Ba1-1(k) when it engages in conduit borrowing using and/or
pledging solely monies derived from sources other than the state or political subdivision of a
state. 248 A municipal entity that is an obligated person on bonds issued by another municipal entity

is still a municipal entity for purposes of this rule, and advisors to such municipal entities are
subject to a statutory fiduciary duty. 249
iv. Municipal Financial Products
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(5) defines “municipal financial product” to mean “municipal
derivatives, guaranteed investment contracts, and investment strategies.” 250 The Commission
proposed to incorporate into the rule the statutory definition of municipal financial product. 251 The
Commission received approximately ten comment letters regarding the proposed definition. The
issues raised by these commenters are discussed below in the “Municipal Derivatives,” “Guaranteed
Investment Contracts,” and “Investment Strategies” sections. The Commission is adopting the
definition of “municipal financial product” as proposed. 252
v. Municipal Derivatives
As discussed in the Proposal, Exchange Act Section 15B does not define the term
“municipal derivatives.” Accordingly, the Commission proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(f) to define the
term to mean any swap 253 or security-based swap 254 to which a municipal entity is a counterparty or
to which an obligated person, acting in its capacity as an obligated person, is a counterparty. 255
Thus, as stated in the Proposal, the Commission included in the definition of municipal derivatives
249

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c).

250

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(5).

meaning as in Section 15B(e)(5) of the Exchange Act).

252

See Rule 15Ba1-1(i).

253

As proposed and adopted, the definition specifies that “swap” is as defined in Section 1a(47)
of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a(47)) and Section 3(a)(69) of the Exchange
Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(69)), including any rules and regulations thereunder.

254

As proposed and adopted, the definition specifies that “security-based swap” is as defined in
Section 3(a)(68) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68)), including any rules and
regulations thereunder.

255

See proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(f).
70

the definitions of “swap” and “security-based swap,” as those terms are defined by statute (and any
rules and regulations thereunder). In the Proposal, the Commission asked whether the proposed
definition of municipal derivatives should be modified or clarified in any way. 256
One commenter stated that the proposed definition of municipal derivatives is too broad,
because it encompasses too many types of advisory entities and transactions and the definition goes
beyond securities. 257 The commenter expressed concern that a person must register as a municipal
advisor regardless of the type of swap advice contemplated or the relationship between the
municipal entity and the person seeking to offer the advice. 258
Another commenter stated that there is no statutory basis or legislative history for the
proposed expansion of the industry’s common usage of the term “municipal derivatives,” which is
limited to derivatives of a municipal security. 259 The commenter stated that the proposed definition
would mean that any public plan (if not exempted from the definition of municipal entity) using
swaps in the management of its overall portfolio would be dealing in municipal financial products,
merely by virtue of being a counterparty to the swap. 260
Additionally, one commenter stated that many municipal entities enter into commodity
hedging transactions in connection with their operations to avoid mid-year operating budget
disruptions and rate hikes. Accordingly, this commenter asked the Commission to confirm that
hedging transactions by municipal entities related to their operations (rather than municipal

securities) do not constitute municipal derivatives. 261
One commenter asked the Commission to clarify how a person engaging in a transaction or
assignment with respect to a municipal derivative would determine that the person it is advising is
“an obligated person, acting in its capacity as an obligated person.” 262 The commenter stated that
the Commission should clarify that a person (presumably acting as a dealer or counterparty) must
have actual knowledge that the counterparty is an obligated person acting as such and have actual
knowledge that the municipal derivative implicates or is related to the underlying transactions or
funds that make such person an obligated person. 263 Further, the commenter stated that a person
should not need to affirmatively inquire as to the counterparty’s or the funds’ status. 264
Another commenter suggested narrowing the definition of municipal derivatives to only
include debt-related derivatives entered into (a) by a municipal entity in connection with an issue of
municipal securities or (b) by an obligated person as a pledged security or a source of payment for
municipal securities. 265 This commenter also stated that the phrase “in its capacity as an obligated
person” is not sufficiently tailored, because it would include any derivative entered into by the
obligated person to hedge a conduit borrowing, not merely those that “by contract or other

265

See NABL Letter. This commenter stated that by narrowing the definition of municipal
derivatives accordingly, “swaps that are entered into by a municipal entity to hedge the
interest rate on variable rate securities, or to hedge the value of municipal securities to be
issued in the future, as well as swaps that are part of a structured municipal securities
financing (e.g., a structured student loan or mortgage revenue bond issue) would be covered,
but derivatives that are unrelated to municipal securities issues (e.g., swaps to hedge bank
loans or fuel costs) or are entered into by a conduit borrower and [not] pledged as security or
a source of payment for, the municipal securities issue would be excluded.”
72

arrangement… support the payment” of municipal securities. 266 In addition, this commenter stated
that, given the use of the term “municipal financial product,” Congress did not intend to regulate
transactions with non-municipal entities that do not affect municipal entities or investors, simply
because they result from a municipal securities transaction. 267
In contrast, one commenter agreed with the Commission that municipal derivatives includes
both swaps and security-based swaps to which a municipal entity or obligated person is a
counterparty, but stated that this definition is too narrow. 268 This commenter stated that, because
the term “municipal derivatives” (rather than the term “swap”) was used in the definition of
municipal financial products, Congress intended to “provide flexibility to address problems that
may arise in the future in connection with the use of other existing or yet-to-be-developed forms of
derivatives by municipal entities.” 269
The Commission has carefully considered these comments and is adopting the definition of
municipal derivatives substantially as proposed. The Commission, however, is clarifying herein the
scope of application of the definition to obligated persons, in response to issues raised by
commenters. 270 Specifically, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(f), which now provides
that the term “municipal derivatives” means “any swap (as defined in Section 1a(47) of the

The Commission also notes that on July 18, 2012, it adopted rules jointly with the CFTC to,
among other things, further define the terms swap, security-based swap, and security-based
swap agreement. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 67453 (July 18, 2012), 77 FR
48208 (August 13, 2012) (Further Definition of “Swap,” “Security-Based Swap,” and
“Security-Based Swap Agreement;” Mixed Swaps; Security-Based Swap Agreement
Recordkeeping).

Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a(47)) and section 3(a)(69) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(69)),
including any rules and regulations thereunder) or security-based swap (as defined in section
3(a)(68) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68)), including any rules and regulations thereunder) to
which: (1) [a] municipal entity is a counterparty; or (2) [a]n obligated person, acting in such
capacity, is a counterparty.” 271
As proposed and adopted, with respect to municipal entities, the Commission has
determined not to qualify the definition of municipal derivatives as being limited to those entered
into in connection with, or pledged as security or a source of payment for, existing or contemplated
municipal securities. Municipal entities seeking advice with respect to municipal derivative
transactions (including commodity hedging transactions in connection with their operations, which
fall within the definition of municipal derivatives) are subject to risks, regardless of whether the
municipal derivatives are entered into in connection with or pledged as security or a source of
payment for existing or contemplated municipal securities, and should have the protections
provided by municipal advisor registration. 272
As proposed and adopted, with respect to obligated persons, the coverage of the registration
requirement is limited to advice relating to derivatives entered into by an obligated person in its
capacity as an obligated person with respect to municipal securities. Thus, with respect to obligated
persons, municipal derivatives include those derivatives entered into by obligated persons in
271

See id. The Commission notes that the definitions of swap and security-based swap are
quite broad and that Section 712(d) of the Dodd-Frank Act gives the Commission and CFTC
joint authority to further define such terms. Under the Commodity Exchange Act, as
amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, the term “swap” is defined to mean, in part, any
agreement, contract, or transaction that is, or in the future becomes, commonly known to the
trade as a swap. See 7 U.S.C. 1a(47). In addition, under the Exchange Act, as amended by
the Dodd-Frank Act, the term “security-based swap” incorporates the definition of “swap”
under the Commodity Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(68).

272

See supra note 190 and accompanying text.
74

connection with, or pledged as security or a source of payment for, existing municipal securities or
municipal securities to be issued in the future. 273 By contrast, advice with respect to other types of
derivative transactions entered into by obligated persons outside of their capacity as obligated
persons will not trigger the municipal advisor registration requirement. For example, a person
advising a nonprofit hospital to hedge an interest rate swap entered into in connection with a
variable rate conduit borrowing (by such hospital) would be a municipal advisor. However, a
person would not be required to register as a municipal advisor if it is advising an airline company
that is an obligated person with respect to airport revenue bonds about whether the airline company
should hedge its exposure on aviation fuel costs with a derivatives transaction that is unrelated to
any particular issuance of municipal securities and that is outside of its capacity as an obligated
person. The Commission believes that this clarification with respect to obligated persons addresses
the concerns of commenters regarding scope of the advisors’ responsibilities to conduit borrowers
and the ability to identify situations where advising obligated persons triggers a registration
requirement.
The Commission notes that the Exchange Act and the Commodity Exchange Act, as
amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provide heightened protection to special entities, in connection
with swaps and security-based swaps. The Commission interprets the term special entity to
generally include municipal entities, because the definition of municipal entity is substantially

273

The Commission believes it is appropriate to refer to “existing or contemplated” municipal
securities because an obligated person could enter into a swap or security-based swap before
or after an issuance of municipal securities (e.g., a forward-starting interest rate swap as part
of a synthetic advanced refunding). See also supra note 265 (discussing the comment in the
NABL Letter that the definition of municipal derivatives should be narrowed in a way that
would still cover, among other things, swaps entered into to hedge the value of municipal
securities to be issued in the future).
75

similar to the definition of special entity in the Exchange Act and the Commodity Exchange Act. 274
The heightened protection afforded by the Acts to special entities applies to all swaps and securitybased swaps, irrespective of whether the swaps and security-based swaps are entered into in
connection with or pledged as security or a source of payment for existing or contemplated
securities. 275 Accordingly, the Commission’s determination not to qualify its interpretation of the

274

The Commission notes that there are some differences between the statutory definitions of
municipal entity and special entity. In particular, the statutory definitions of special entity
do not explicitly include authorities, instrumentalities or corporate instrumentalities of a
state. The definition of municipal entity includes plans, programs, or pools of assets
established by a state, political subdivision, or municipal corporate instrumentality (or any
agency, authority, or instrumentality thereof), and therefore includes 529 Savings Plans and
LGIPs, while the statutory definitions of special entity do not explicitly include such entities.
Also, the statutory definitions of special entity include governmental plans as defined by
ERISA. The Commission notes that the CFTC, in adopting rules to implement business
conduct standards for swap dealers, included in the definition of “special entity” (for
purposes of Commodity Exchange Act Section 4s): “A State, State agency, city, county,
municipality, other political subdivision of a State, or any instrumentality, department, or a
corporation of or established by a State or political subdivision of a State.” See Standards
for Swap Dealers and Major Swap Participants with Counterparties (January 11, 2012), 77
FR 9734 (February 17, 2012) (adopting rules proposed by the CFTC prescribing external
business conduct standards for swap dealers and major swap participants) (“Business
Conduct Standards for Swaps”).
The CFTC’s final rules state that all State and municipal special entities are municipal
entities. See Business Conduct Standards for Swaps, 77 FR at 9739.

275

As discussed herein, with Title IX of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress provided certain
protections for municipal entities and obligated persons with respect to their interaction with
certain advisors, including persons providing advice with respect to, among other things,
municipal derivatives.
Moreover, with Section 764 of Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act, by adding new Section 15F
to the Exchange Act, Congress provided certain protections for special entities with respect
to their interaction with security-based swap dealers and major security-based swap
participants. See Pub. L. 111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1789-1792, section 764(a) (adding
Exchange Act Section 15F).
Among other things, Section 15F(h)(4) of the Exchange Act establishes that a security-based
swap dealer that “acts as an advisor to a special entity shall have a duty to act in the best
interests of the special entity” and “shall make reasonable efforts to obtain such information
as is necessary to make a reasonable determination” that any security-based swap
recommended by the security-based swap dealer is in the best interests of the special
entity….” Section 15F(h)(5) requires that security-based swap entities that offer to, or enter
76

term “municipal derivatives” with respect to municipal entities is designed to provide a level of
protection to such entities with respect to swaps and security-based swaps that is consistent with the
protection afforded to special entities and the Commission’s interpretation of that term with respect
to obligated persons is intended to reflect the scope of the role of obligated persons with respect to
municipal securities.
vi. Guaranteed Investment Contracts
Section 15B(e)(2) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, defines
“guaranteed investment contract” to include “any investment that has specified withdrawal or
reinvestment provisions and a specifically negotiated or bid interest rate, and also includes any
agreement to supply investments on two or more future dates, such as a forward supply contract.” 276
In the Proposal, the Commission proposed to include the statutory definition of guaranteed

into a security-based swap with, a special entity comply with any duty established by the
Commission that requires a security-based swap entity to have a “reasonable basis” for
believing that the special entity has an “independent representative” that meets certain
criteria and undertakes a duty to act in the “best interests” of the special entity. See Pub. L.
111-203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1791 (to be codified at 15 U.S.C. 78o-10(h)(5)). This provision is
intended to operate together with the municipal advisor regulatory scheme, which would
apply to such an “independent representative” unless the representative is an employee of
the municipal entity. Similarly, Section 731 of the Dodd-Frank Act amends the Commodity
Exchange Act by adding Section 4s, which contains language parallel to Section 15F of the
Exchange Act that applies to swap dealers and major swap participants. See Pub. L. 111203, 124 Stat. 1376, 1789-1792, section 731 (adding Commodity Exchange Act Section 4s).
The term “special entity” is defined to include a “State, State agency, city, county,
municipality, or other political subdivision of a State.” This definition is consistent with, but
not identical to, the statutory definition of “municipal entity” in Section 15B(e)(8). (“[T]he
term ‘municipal entity’ means any State, political subdivision of a State, or municipal
corporate instrumentality of a State, including – (A) any agency, authority or instrumentality
of the State, political subdivision, or municipal corporate instrumentality; (B) any plan,
program, or pool of assets sponsored or established by the State, political subdivision, or
municipal corporate instrumentality or any agency, authority or instrumentality thereof; and
(C) any other issuer of municipal securities[.]”).
276

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(2).
77

investment contract in Rule 15Ba1-1(a). 277
The Commission received one comment supporting the proposed definition. 278 Another
commenter, however, suggested that the definition does not include all guaranteed investment
contracts entered into by municipal entities. 279 Instead, this commenter stated that the statutory
definition of guaranteed investment contracts refers only to those contracts related to issues of
bonds and similar municipal securities. 280 Another commenter stated that it is “cognizant of special
issues arising in the investment of bond proceeds in guaranteed investment contracts, particularly in
the tax area, but [is] unclear how the situation is improved … by additional regulation of
[guaranteed investment contract] providers by the SEC.” 281
The Commission has carefully considered these comments and is adopting a definition of
guaranteed investment contract substantially as proposed but with changes designed to respond to
commenters. 282 Specifically, the Commission is interpreting the statutory definition of guaranteed
investment contract so that it “has the same meaning as in section 15B(e)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C.
78o-4(e)(2)); provided, however, that the contract relates to investments of proceeds of municipal
securities or municipal escrow investments.” 283
For the same reasons that the Commission is narrowing the application of the term
investment strategies as discussed further herein, 284 the Commission is persuaded by commenters

277

See proposed rule 15Ba1-1(a).

278

See MSRB Letter. This commenter did not suggest any changes to the proposed definition.

78

that, at this time, it is appropriate to apply the definition of guaranteed investment contract more
narrowly. Guaranteed investment contracts are investment products, 285 and this more limited
interpretation is consistent with the approach the Commission is adopting with respect to the
application of “investment strategies,” which will be limited to plans or programs for the investment
of proceeds of municipal securities and the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow
investments. 286 A municipal entity could invest any funds held by or on behalf of such municipal
entity, as opposed to just proceeds of municipal securities, in a guaranteed investment contract.
Under the rule as adopted, a provider of a guaranteed investment contract is generally not a
municipal advisor as long as such provider does not engage in municipal advisory activities, such as
providing advice to the municipal entity or obligated person about the purchase of a guaranteed
investment contract that relates to investments of proceeds of municipal securities or municipal
escrow investments. 287 The Commission, therefore, believes it is in the public interest and
285

The Commission notes that, by comparison, swaps and security-based swaps are not
investment products, but instead are often used to hedge the risk from other financial
transactions. Also, the Commission notes that the protections established by the DoddFrank Act with respect to swap and security-based swap transactions discussed above, are
not applicable to guaranteed investment contracts or other investment strategies. See supra
note 275 and accompanying text.

286

See infra Section III.A.1.b.viii. (discussing the term “investment strategies” and the
exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii)).

287

The Commission also notes that it has brought several enforcement actions involving
investment of proceeds in guaranteed investment contracts. See, e.g., In the Matter of Banc
of America Securities, now known as Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated,
successor by merger, AP File No. 3-14153, Securities Exchange Act Release No. 63451
(December 7, 2010) (Banc of America Securities LLC agreed to settle Commission charges
of securities fraud for allegedly engaging in improper practices in connection with the
bidding of reinvestment instruments used by municipal entities) (“Banc of America
Settlement”); Securities and Exchange Commission v. UBS Financial Services Inc., Civil
Action No. 11-CV-2885 (D.N.J. May 4, 2011) (UBS agreed to settle Commission charges of
securities fraud for allegedly fraudulently rigging over 100 municipal bond reinvestment
transactions) (“UBS Settlement”); Securities and Exchange Commission v. J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC., Civil Action No. 11-CV-3877 (D.N.J. July 7, 2011) (J.P. Morgan agreed to
settle Commission charges of allegedly fraudulently rigging at least 93 municipal bond
79

consistent with the purposes of Section 15B to interpret the definition of guaranteed investment
contract as described herein.
vii. Issuance of Municipal Securities
Section 15B(e)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act provides in relevant part that a municipal advisor
includes a person that provides advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with
respect to the “issuance of municipal securities,” including advice with respect to “the structure,
timing, terms, and other similar matters” concerning such issues. Section 3(a)(29) of the Exchange
Act defines the term “municipal securities.” 288 The broad statutory language in Section
15B(e)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act regarding advice on “the structure, timing, terms and other
similar matters” concerning such issues suggests that advice on a broad range of activities
potentially may be included within advice with respect to the issuance of municipal securities.
The scope of the concept of an “issuance of municipal securities” is particularly relevant to

reinvestment transactions) (“JP Morgan Settlement”); Securities and Exchange Commission
v. Wachovia Bank N.A, now known as Wells Fargo bank, N.A., successor by merger., Civil
Action No. 2:11-cv-07135-WJM-MF (D.N.J. December 8, 2011) (Wachovia Bank N.A.
agreed to settle Commission charges of allegedly fraudulently rigging at least 58 municipal
bond reinvestment transactions) (“Wachovia Settlement”); and Securities and Exchange
Commission v. GE Funding Capital Market Services, Inc., Civil Action No. 2:11-cv-07465WJM-MF (D.N.J. December 23, 2011). The reinvestment transactions in these cases
involved the reinvestment of municipal bond proceeds in reinvestment instruments,
including guaranteed investment contracts, forward purchase contracts, and repurchase
agreements.
288

Specifically, Section 3(a)(29) of the Exchange Act defines the term “municipal securities” to
mean “securities which are direct obligations of, or obligations guaranteed as to principal or
interest by, a State or any political subdivision thereof, or any agency or instrumentality of a
State or any political subdivision thereof, or any municipal corporate instrumentality of one
or more States, or any security which is an industrial development bond (as defined in
section 103(c)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1954) the interest on which is excludable
from gross income under section 103(a)(1) of such Code if, by reason of the application of
paragraph (4) or (6) of section 103(c) of such Code (determined as if paragraphs 4(A), (5),
and (7) were not included in such section 103(c)), paragraph (1) of such section 103(c) does
not apply to such security.” See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(29) (emphasis added). Section 3(a)(10)
of the Exchange Act defines the term “security.” See 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(10).
80

the “advice” aspect of the municipal advisor definition, as discussed previously herein, 289 because a
person’s provision of advice to a municipal entity or obligated person only results in municipal
advisor status if the subject of that advice involves either the “issuance of municipal securities” or
“municipal financial products.” 290 Several commenters recommended that the Commission provide
guidance on the extent to which activities would be considered “advice with respect to the issuance
of municipal securities.” 291 One commenter suggested that the municipal advisor registration
provision in Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act is intended to cover advice on certain listed
activities within broad categories, including certain “strategic services,” “transaction-related
services, and “post-issuance related services.” 292 One commenter recommended that such advice
should be construed broadly, from a timing perspective, to include “any advice provided in
connection with a municipal securities issue ... at any point during the pre-issuance planning process
as well as throughout the life of the issuance through final payment of principal and interest on the
securities (by reason of maturity, earlier redemption, or otherwise, or for such longer period due to
delayed payment such as the case of a payment default)…” 293 Another commenter recommended
that such advice should not extend to advice after the closing of a specific bond issue. 294
The Commission generally agrees that activities covered by the subject of the “issuance of
municipal securities” should be construed broadly as a matter of statutory construction and policy to
ensure appropriate protection of municipal entities with respect to advice received relating in some
289

See supra Section III.A.1.b.i. (discussing the advice standard in general).

See supra Section III.A.1.b.iv. (discussing the term “municipal financial products”).

291

See, e.g., MSRB Letter I and NAIPFA Letter I.

described by the MSRB should be narrower or broader in the context of the underwriter
exclusion. See NAIPFA Letter II and Baum Letter.

81

way to the issuance of municipal securities and to limit the potential for circumvention of the
municipal advisor registration provision. As discussed previously herein, however, the
determination of whether any particular activity constitutes “advice” in the first instance for
purposes of the municipal advisor definition depends on all the facts and circumstances. 295 The
Commission also agrees that “advice with respect to the issuance of municipal securities” should be
construed broadly from a timing perspective to include advice throughout the life of an issuance of
municipal securities, from the pre-issuance planning stage for a debt transaction involving the
issuance of municipal securities to the repayment stage for those municipal securities. This
interpretation would afford municipal entities and investors with the protections of the municipal
advisor registration provision during a time frame that may involve advice on significant matters
affecting issues of municipal securities. In this regard, municipal issuers may make significant
decisions affecting the structure, timing, terms, or other similar matters concerning an issue of
municipal securities early in the planning stages of a transaction and may make significant decisions
affecting ongoing compliance, repayment, or refinancing throughout the term of an outstanding
bond issue.
In addition, the scope of the concept of the issuance of municipal securities also is
particularly relevant to the statutory exclusion to the municipal advisor definition for broker-dealers
serving as underwriters, because the underwriting function involves certain activities that relate to
the issuance of municipal securities. The exclusion for underwriters from the definition of
municipal advisor is limited to activities that are within the scope of an underwriting of a particular
issuance of municipal securities. For purposes of the underwriting exclusion to the municipal
advisor definition, the function of serving as underwriter on a particular issuance of municipal

295

See supra Section III.A.1.b.i. (discussing the advice standard in general).
82

securities is more circumscribed and encompasses services on a particular transaction during a
narrower time frame than the overall focus of the municipal advisor definition with respect to
advice on the issuance of municipal securities (which involves a broader focus and longer time
frame), as discussed further herein. 296
viii. Investment Strategies
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(3) provides that the term “investment strategies” “includes”
plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities that are not municipal
derivatives, guaranteed investment contracts, and the recommendation of and brokerage of
municipal escrow investments. 297 The Commission proposed to interpret the term to mean that it
includes, without limitation, the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities and plans,
programs, or pools of assets that invest any other funds held by, or on behalf of, a municipal
entity. 298 As such, under the proposed interpretation of the statutory definition, any person that
provides advice with respect to such funds would have to register as a municipal advisor unless the
person was covered by an exclusion or exemption. 299
Plans or Programs for the Investment of the Proceeds of Municipal Securities
In the Proposal, the Commission asked whether its interpretation of the term “investment
strategies” should be modified or clarified in any way. 300 Specifically, the Commission asked
whether it should exclude plans, programs, or pools of assets that invest funds that are not proceeds
296

See generally infra Section III.A.1.c.iv. (discussing the underwriter exclusion). The time
frame for the underwriter role generally begins upon the municipal issuer’s engagement of
the underwriter for a particular issuance of municipal securities and ends at the end of the
underwriting period for that issuance. See infra notes 589-591 and accompanying text.

of the issuance of municipal securities. 301 The Commission also asked how it would determine
when funds should no longer be considered “proceeds of municipal securities” if it were to limit
investment strategies to “plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal
securities (other than municipal derivatives and guaranteed investment contracts) or the
recommendation of or brokerage of municipal escrow investments.” 302
Commenters generally opposed the proposed interpretation of investment strategies. Many
commenters stated that the proposed interpretation was too broad, because it covers any fund held
by a municipal entity, regardless of its source. 303 Some commenters asserted that the proposed
interpretation is contrary to the language and intent of the Dodd-Frank Act 304 and suggested that the
definition be restricted so that it applies only to the statutorily-identified categories of investments

of proceeds of municipal securities and recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow
investments. 305 One commenter stated that the “expanded definition” of investment strategies is not
required or even implied by the Dodd-Frank Act and would subject a “vast swath of activity –
which was not intended to be, and need not be, further regulated – to additional regulation.” 306
On the other hand, one commenter agreed with the Commission that the use of the word
“includes” in the statutory definition of investment strategies suggests that the term is not limited to
plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities. 307 This commenter
stated its belief, however, that Congress intended the definition to be limited to investment activities
that relate to the securities and securities-like vehicles of a municipal entity, rather than all
investment activities of municipal entities. 308
In a similar vein, commenters suggested that the definition should encompass only plans or
programs for investments in financial instruments, as opposed to investments in, for example,
infrastructure, real estate, social welfare, and other non-financial investments. 309 Another
commenter stated that, with respect to the funds held by or on behalf of a municipal entity, whether
a person is providing advice regarding the “investment of” those funds, not other expenditure or use
of the funds for non-investment purposes, is the determining factor for deciding that a person is a

One commenter stated that a “plan or program,” as used in the statutory definition of
investment strategies, is a series of investment related actions that would be generally akin to a
financial plan, not merely advice incidental to a particular trade or investment. 311 Another
commenter urged the Commission to limit investment strategies to advice articulated as a part of the
investment plan for the proceeds of a municipal securities offering at or before the time the
proceeds are received. 312
Some commenters asserted that public pension plans, participant directed investment
programs or plans such as 529 Savings Plans and 403(b) and 457 plans were not intended to be
regulated under the Exchange Act or the Dodd-Frank Act and should not be covered under the
definition of investment strategies. 313 According to these commenters, the Dodd-Frank Act was
intended to regulate those who provide advice regarding the issuance of municipal bonds and the
investment of offering proceeds. 314 Therefore, these commenters argue, all governmental

retirement plans should be excluded from the definition of investment strategies. Alternatively, one
commenter suggested that, at the very least, governmental retirement and savings plans that are
funded exclusively through the contribution of the employees as participants should be excluded. 315
Another commenter stated that the phrase “plans or programs for the investment of proceeds of
municipal securities” implies that the purpose of the plan or program is to invest proceeds of
municipal securities, whereas the purpose of public pension plans is to provide retirement
benefits. 316 Another commenter suggested that municipal securities regulation was originally
intended to regulate the issuance of investment instruments by a municipal entity under which the
municipal entity is required to pay the investor in accordance with the terms of the investment. 317
The commenter stated that state employee pension plans, 529 Savings Plans, and assets invested by
the state are not investment instruments issued by the state to investors. 318 As such, the commenter
stated that they were never intended to be, nor should they now be, regulated under the Exchange
Act or the Dodd-Frank Act. 319

One commenter stated that governmental retirement plans should not be considered
investment strategies unless the employer funds such plans with proceeds from the issuance
of pension obligation bonds. See Fraser Stryker Letter.

See id. This commenter pointed out that the terms “securities” and “municipal securities”
were not changed by the Dodd-Frank Act. As such, this commenter stated that, “[w]ith
respect to the grant of authority to the [Commission] over the ‘issuance of municipal
securities,’ there has been no change under the Dodd-Frank Act to justify the expansion of
the [Commission’s] authority.” Further, the commenter noted that the statutory definition of
investment strategies indicates that plans and programs that are intended to be covered must
relate to the proceeds of municipal securities. The commenter argued that the definition of
municipal entity was not intended to expand the types of assets regulated by the
Commission and stated that “[t]he underlying notion that the [Commission] is still
regulating ‘municipal securities’ should not be disregarded without a clear Congressional
87

On the other hand, one commenter stated that the term “investment strategies” should
include any type of investment strategy or advice relating to the investment of funds of investors or
other vested persons held in any plan, program, or pool of assets sponsored or established by a state,
political subdivision, or municipal corporate instrumentality, or any agency, authority, or
instrumentality thereof, such as those created in connection with municipal fund securities,
including but not limited to 529 Savings Plans and state and local government investment pools. 320
This commenter further stated that public defined contribution pension plans should also fall within
the definition, because these plans share many of the same potential impacts on third-party
beneficiaries and are generally exempt from the protections afforded by ERISA to private pension
funds. 321
The same commenter stated that funds should cease to be subject to the definition of
investment strategies once their investment is no longer governed by legal documents or covenants
governing the use of such funds. 322 Similarly, another commenter stated that proceeds should mean
proceeds raised in securities offerings, until they are used for the purposes described in the use of
proceeds section in the offering document, or otherwise commingled with the general funds of the

mandate, which must necessarily include a change to the definition of ‘municipal security.’”
Additionally, this commenter stated that, since government plans are specifically exempt
from ERISA, “[t]he proposed rule seems to be an end-run around ERISA, now subjecting
the fiduciaries of these state plans to federal oversight without a Congressional directive to
do so.” But see infra note 320 and accompanying text (discussing the MSRB Letter, which
argues that some 529 Savings Plans are municipal fund securities).

municipal entity. 323 Additionally, one commenter suggested that “proceeds” should not extend to
“replacement proceeds” such as pledge funds. 324
The Commission has carefully considered the issues raised by commenters on the Proposal.
As noted above, Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(3) defines investment strategies to include plans or
programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities that are not municipal
derivatives, guaranteed investment contracts, and the recommendation of and brokerage of
municipal escrow investments. 325 In response to comments on the proposed definition of
“investment strategies,” the Commission is adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(b), which defines “investment
strategies” as having “the same meaning as in section 15B(e)(3) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(3)),
and includes plans or programs for the investment of proceeds of municipal securities that are not
municipal derivatives or guaranteed investment contracts, and the recommendation of and
brokerage of municipal escrow investments.” 326
While the Commission continues to believe that the term “includes” is not limiting, 327 the
Commission is adopting a definition of “investment strategies” that, as compared to the definition in

323

See ABA Letter.

324

See NABL Letter.

325

The application of the term “municipal financial products” to “municipal derivatives” and
“guaranteed investment contracts” is discussed above. See supra Sections II.A.1.b.v. and
vi., respectively. The term “municipal escrow investments” is described in more detail
below in this Section III.A.1.b.viii.

326

While the definition of “investment strategies” in Rule 15Ba1-1(b), as adopted, is consistent
with the definition of “investment strategies” in Section 15B(e)(3) of the Act, this definition,
as adopted, clarifies the Commission’s interpretation that investment strategies specifically
excludes municipal derivatives and guaranteed investment contracts, as these products are
expressly included in the definition of municipal financial product, as defined by Section
15B(e)(5) of the Act and Rule 15Ba1-1(i), as adopted. This interpretation is consistent with
the Commission’s interpretation in the Proposal. See Proposal, 76 FR at 830-831.

327

Section 15B(e)(3) of the Exchange Act uses the word “including” as expanding or
illustrative, not as exclusive or limiting.
89

the Proposal, focuses more narrowly on the statutorily-identified categories of “proceeds of
municipal securities” and “municipal escrow investments.” In this regard, the Commission is
adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii), which will effectively narrow the focus of the term “investment
strategies” to investments of proceeds of municipal securities and the recommendation of and
brokerage of municipal escrow investments. Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii), as adopted,
exempts from the definition of municipal advisor any person that provides advice to a municipal
entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products to the extent that such person
provides advice with respect to investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the
investment of the proceeds of municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of
municipal escrow investments.
Pursuant to Section 15B(a)(4) of the Exchange Act, the Commission may exempt any class
of municipal advisors from any provision of Section 15B or the rules and regulations thereunder, if
it finds that such an exemption is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and
the purposes of Section 15B. 328 The Commission believes that providing the exemption described
above is consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of Section
15B of the Exchange Act. The exemption tailors protection of municipal entities to those activities
related to the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities and related municipal escrow
investments, which are the specific categories of activities that Congress identified in the statutory
definition of the term “investment strategies” and that the Commission believes have the most direct
nexus to municipal securities and the protection of investors and municipal issuers in furtherance of
the purposes of Section 15B.
In the Proposal, the Commission asked how it should determine when funds should no

328

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(4).
90

longer be considered proceeds of municipal securities, if it were to limit investment strategies to
proceeds of municipal securities or the recommendation of or brokerage of municipal escrow
investments. 329 While the Exchange Act does not define the term “proceeds of municipal
securities,” the Federal tax laws provide a longstanding, known definition of “proceeds” of taxexempt bonds issued by State and local governments, including related definitions of various types
of proceeds (including “gross proceeds,” “sale proceeds,” “investment proceeds,” and “transferred
proceeds”) under Section 148 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, 330 and Section
1.148-1 through 1.148-11 of the Regulations 331 for the purpose of the arbitrage 332 investment
restrictions applicable to investments of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities. The arbitrage

332

Arbitrage, in the municipal securities context, is the profit earned by the municipal entity
from borrowing funds in the tax-exempt market and investing them in the taxable market.
The arbitrage rules have two main branches. The yield restriction branch of the rules
generally limit the yield permitted on investments of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal
securities to a yield that is not materially higher than the yield on the municipal securities;
provided, however, specific exceptions permit unrestricted investment during certain
temporary periods. The second branch of the arbitrage rules, the rebate branch, requires that
any arbitrage that the municipal entity earns, including during a temporary period, must be
rebated to the federal government, unless one of the several specific exceptions to the rebate
requirement applies to the issue of municipal securities. Any issue of tax-exempt municipal
securities can be subject to yield restriction, rebate, or both. The arbitrage rules and the
various exceptions are important factors in the structuring of any tax-exempt issue of
municipal securities. Under the arbitrage rules, gross proceeds include amounts covered by
the following interrelated definitions. Sale proceeds are the gross cash amount paid by the
purchasers for the securities at the initial sale of the issue. Investment proceeds are the
amounts received from investing the proceeds of the issue. If proceeds of a refunding issue
are used to pay off a prior issue, any remaining proceeds of the prior issue become, for tax
purposes, transferred proceeds of the refunding issue. Proceeds, then, are sales proceeds
plus investment proceeds plus transferred proceeds. Replacement proceeds are amounts that
may be used to pay debt service. Gross proceeds are defined as proceeds plus replacement
proceeds. See Frederic L. Ballard, Jr., ABCs of Arbitrage: Tax Rules for Investment of
Bond Proceeds by Municipalities (Section of State and Local Government Law, American
Bar Association, 2007) (“Ballard, ABCs of Arbitrage”).
91

rules apply as long as the tax-exempt municipal securities are outstanding, and non-compliance with
the arbitrage rules can result in the loss of the tax-exempt status of the interest on the municipal
securities retroactively to the date of issuance. The Commission believes that the well-developed
concept of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities under the arbitrage rules is well-known to
issuers and to the professional participants in the municipal marketplace.
Some commenters that discussed “proceeds of municipal securities” did so by reference to
Federal tax regulations and terms defined therein. 333 Because the arbitrage rules governing the
investment of bond proceeds are central to an issue of tax-exempt municipal securities and wellknown in the municipal market, the Commission has determined to define proceeds of municipal
securities in a similar manner and to apply the term to tax-exempt municipal securities and also to
taxable 334 municipal securities. Therefore, for purposes of the application of the definition of
investment strategies and in response to comments raised on this issue, 335 the Commission is
adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(m)(1), which defines “proceeds of municipal securities” as (i) monies
derived by a municipal entity from the sale of municipal securities, (ii) investment income derived

333

See, e.g., NABL Letter. In addition, as discussed below, some commenters suggested that a
municipal entity should have the responsibility for tracking and characterizing proceeds
because it is already required to do so under certain tax laws, implying that the definition of
proceeds of municipal securities should be consistent with such definition under tax laws.
See infra notes 361-362 and accompanying text.

334

Municipal issuers sometimes issue small amounts of taxable bonds in combination with taxexempt bonds in the same offerings to finance costs that are ineligible for tax-exempt bond
financing. The most significant recent type of taxable municipal securities was the
temporary stimulus “Build America Bond” program, with respect to which approximately
$181 billion were issued in 2009-2010 and the arbitrage rules on bond proceeds notably
applied directly to those taxable municipal securities due to a Federal subsidy. The taxable
bond sector of the municipal securities market represents a relatively small portion of the
overall municipal securities market. For example, less than 9% of new issues in the
municipal securities market in 2012 were taxable bonds, according to Thomson-Reuters
data.

See supra note 333 and accompanying text.

from the investment or reinvestment of such monies, (iii) any monies of a municipal entity or
obligated person held in funds under legal documents for the municipal securities that are
reasonably expected to be used as security or a source of payment for the payment of the debt
service on the municipal securities, including reserves, sinking funds, and pledged funds created for
such purpose, 336 and (iv) the investment income derived from the investment or reinvestment of
monies in such funds. 337 Further, consistent with the general definition of proceeds under the
arbitrage rules, Rule 15Ba1-1(m)(1) also provides that when such monies are spent to carry out the
authorized purposes of municipal securities, they cease to be proceeds of municipal securities.
Rule 15Ba1-1(m), however, establishes an exception from the definition of proceeds of
municipal securities. The exception provides that, solely for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(m), monies
derived from a municipal security issued by an education trust established by a State under Section
529(b) of the Internal Revenue Code are not proceeds of municipal securities. 338 Although interests
in 529 Savings Plans may be municipal fund securities, and therefore municipal securities, monies
derived from a municipal security issued by an education trust established under Section 529(b)
come from individuals making investments for the purpose of prepaying or accumulating savings
for higher education costs, and do not come from municipal entities. Because these monies are
derived from individuals primarily for the benefit of these individuals and not municipal entities, the
Commission does not believe persons engaged in activities with respect to these monies are

336

Such applicable legal documents include, for example, the indentures, ordinances, or
resolutions of the issuer of the municipal securities, and the resolutions, leases, loan
agreements, or other agreements of an obligated person.

appropriately governed by this registration regime. 339
Rule 15Ba1-1(m) also states that in determining whether or not funds to be invested
constitute proceeds of municipal securities for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(m), a person may rely on
representations in writing made by a knowledgeable official of the municipal entity or obligated
person whose funds are to be invested regarding the nature of such funds, provided that the person
has a reasonable basis for such reliance. 340 This exemption is discussed in more detail below.
The Commission notes that the exemption from the definition of “municipal advisor” in
Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii) does not permit a person to avoid registering as a municipal advisor by
stating that its advice is isolated or incidental and thus not within the meaning of “plan or program”
in the definition of investment strategies. The Commission is not persuaded by commenters who
have stated that “plan or program” means a series of investment decisions 341 and does not agree that
this would be an appropriate interpretation of the statute. Any advice or recommendation with
respect to the investment of proceeds not otherwise subject to an exclusion or exemption 342 would
be a municipal advisory activity, even if such advice or recommendation is not part of a series of
investment-related actions or articulated as part of the investment plan for the proceeds at or before
339

Because monies in accounts of 529 Savings Plans are not included in the definition of
proceeds of municipal securities for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(m), persons providing advice
with respect to the investment of monies in 529 Savings Plans will not be required to
register as municipal advisors based on this prong of the municipal advisor definition to the
extent their municipal advisory activities are limited to such advice. See note 338 and
accompanying text. However, a person that advises a municipal entity with respect to how
to structure a 529 Savings Plan may be required to register as a municipal advisor. Interests
in 529 Savings Plans are municipal securities, and such a person would be engaging in
municipal advisory activities to the extent he or she provides advice with respect to the
structure, timing, terms, or other similar matters concerning such an issuance unless an
exclusion or exemption applies.

the time the proceeds are received. 343 For example, advice or a recommendation with respect to a
single trade or investment not otherwise subject to an exemption would be a municipal advisory
activity, and the person providing such advice would not be exempt from the definition of
municipal advisor pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii).
Commingling of Proceeds of Municipal Securities with Other Funds and Proceeds Determinations
Generally
In the Proposal, the Commission provided that commingled proceeds, regardless of when
they lose their character as proceeds, would still constitute “funds held by or on behalf of a
municipal entity,” but asked whether that interpretation was too broad. 344 Additionally, the
Commission asked what obligations parties other than a municipal entity should have in
determining whether funds held by or on behalf of the municipal entity are proceeds of municipal
securities. 345
The Commission received a number of comments in response to these questions. One
commenter stated “[t]he Commission’s proposed definition effectively reads out the statutory
requirement to trace assets to the proceeds of municipal securities[,]” and “[t]hus, an adviser
providing advice to a municipal entity with respect to any plan, program or pool of assets – even if
the plan, program or pool of assets did not consist of the proceeds of municipal securities (such as,
for example, 529 Savings Plans and public pension plans) – would be required to register with the
Commission if no exclusion is available.” 346 Some commenters stated that once the proceeds of a

municipal offering are commingled with other funds, they lose their character as proceeds. 347
Commenters also stated that subsequent investments of proceeds are not proceeds of municipal
securities, unless the subsequent investment is part of the plan or program that was developed at the
time of, and in connection with, the initial investment. 348
One commenter stated that a person should not be considered to be providing advice with
respect to an investment strategy if he reasonably believes that the relevant funds are not from an
account specifically for the proceeds of municipal securities issuances, unless the municipal entity
or obligated person communicated otherwise. 349 This commenter also stated that, depending on the
Commission’s interpretation of investment strategies, the adviser should only be considered a
municipal advisor if the funds invested are proceeds of municipal securities, the adviser is aware of
this fact, and there is no evidence of a sham. 350 Another commenter further suggested that a
municipal entity should have the responsibility for tracking and characterizing municipal
proceeds. 351 This commenter suggested that advisors should be entitled to reasonably rely on the
municipal entity’s representation since it is already required to track proceeds under certain state

the authority granted under the Dodd-Frank Act).

account specifically for the proceeds of municipal securities or escrow funds that contains
[sic] funds from multiple sources other than the initial proceeds of a municipal security”).

and Federal tax laws. 352
One commenter stated that, in the context of obligated persons, only the investment of the
proceeds of municipal securities, and not all monies of the obligated person, could be considered
proceeds of municipal securities, even if the proceeds may be commingled with other monies for
investment purposes. 353 Further, another commenter urged the Commission to exclude investments
of bond proceeds for the accounts of obligated persons when the investment is not pledged as
security for a municipal securities issue. 354 On the other hand, a different commenter stated that in
no event should the definition of investment strategies apply to engagements with obligated
persons, because obligated persons’ funds are not held in plans, programs, or pools of assets that
invest funds held by or on behalf of a municipal entity. 355
As discussed above, in response to comments, the Commission is adopting a definition of
“proceeds of municipal securities” for purposes of the term “investment strategies,” which is
consistent with Federal tax laws and regulations related to the definition of proceeds. This
definition provides that when monies are spent to carry out the authorized purposes of the municipal

352

See Kutak Rock Letter (stating that commingled proceeds are required by federal tax laws
(applicable to tax-exempt bonds) and state laws to be traced for use and investment
purposes). Another commenter suggested that municipal entities, and not their municipal
advisors, should have the responsibility for identifying any assets in accounts maintained at
banks or broker-dealers that should be deemed proceeds. See Financial Services Roundtable
Letter.

353

See Kutak Rock Letter.

354

See NABL Letter. This commenter argued that, “[s]ince only a small portion of an
obligated person’s investible assets may represent unspent proceeds of a municipal securities
issue, and since it would not be apparent to investment advisors whether private entities are
obligated persons unless the Commission limits municipal financial products to those
pledged as security for a municipal securities issue, any more expansive reading of the term
would impose an impossible diligence burden on corporate investment advisors.” Id.

355

See SIFMA Letter I.
97

securities, they cease to be proceeds of municipal securities. 356 Under this definition and except as
otherwise noted below, the mere fact that proceeds are commingled with other funds generally does
not cause such monies to lose their character as proceeds. However, once the proceeds are spent to
carry out an authorized purpose of the issuance of municipal securities, and the applicable legal
documents or any other agreement pertaining to the investment of proceeds of municipal securities
are no longer in effect, such funds will no longer constitute proceeds of municipal securities.
The Commission does not agree with those commenters who argued that once the proceeds
of a municipal offering are commingled with other funds, they lose their character as proceeds. 357
The adopted definition of “proceeds of municipal securities” and the treatment of commingled
proceeds are familiar concepts to market participants because they are consistent with Federal tax
laws and regulations related to the definition of proceeds. The Commission believes this treatment
of commingled proceeds will help to ensure that municipal advisors are registered and regulated as
such until commingled proceeds are spent to carry out the authorized purposes of the municipal
securities. Further, as discussed above, to assist a person in determining whether or not funds to be
invested constitute proceeds of municipal securities, such person may rely on representations in
writing made by a knowledgeable official of the municipal entity or obligated person whose funds
are to be invested regarding the nature of such funds, provided that the person seeking to rely on
such representations has a reasonable basis for such reliance. 358 As noted below, municipal entities
and obligated persons generally already track investments and ultimate expenditures of proceeds of
tax-exempt municipal securities for authorized purposes in order to comply with certain state and
tax Federal laws and governing legal documents pertaining to the investment of proceeds of
356

See Rule 15Ba1-1(m)(1).

98

municipal securities. 359
With respect to the tracing of proceeds after commingling, Federal tax arbitrage rules
provide that if amounts of proceeds constituting investment earnings (excluding those of municipal
escrow investments) on certain tax-exempt municipal securities (particularly governmental bonds
and certain governmentally-owned private activity bonds) are deposited in a commingled fund with
substantial tax or other revenues from governmental operations of the municipal issuer and the
amounts are reasonably expected to be spent for governmental purposes within six months from the
date of the commingling, those proceeds are treated as spent at the time of commingling. 360 This
Federal tax arbitrage rule mainly benefits general purpose municipal entities (e.g., States, cities, and
counties) with respect to very short-term investment practices involving their general fund accounts.
The Commission likewise considers proceeds as spent at the time of such commingling in the
context of municipal advisors because, as noted above, arbitrage rules governing the investment of
bond proceeds are central to an issue of tax exempt municipal securities and are well-known in the
municipal market. Because the approach the Commission is taking today is consistent with Federal
tax arbitrage rules, it should be consistent with the current practice of municipal entities and
obligated persons related to tracing proceeds of municipal securities. Further, because such
proceeds are reasonably expected to be spent for governmental purposes within six months from the
date of commingling, the Commission believes these proceeds involve shorter term investments and
therefore are subject to lower risk. As a result, they raise less concern.
The Commission believes that any person that does not satisfy the conditions for an
exclusion or exemption from the definition of municipal advisor should know whether the person it
is advising is a municipal entity or obligated person and whether the relevant funds constitute
359

See infra note 361 and accompanying text.

360

See Treas. Reg. § 1.148-6(d)(6).
99

proceeds of municipal securities. As commenters stated, municipal entities and obligated persons
generally already track investments and ultimate expenditures of proceeds of tax-exempt municipal
securities for authorized purposes in order to comply with certain state and Federal tax laws and
governing legal documents pertaining to the investment of proceeds of municipal securities. 361
Thus, with respect to the tracing of proceeds of municipal securities to investments and
expenditures for authorized purposes, the Commission does not believe that the municipal advisor
registration regime will impose any significant additional burden on municipal entities, obligated
persons, or municipal advisors. 362
Reasonable Reliance on Representations for Proceeds Determinations
As set forth in Rule 15Ba1-1(m)(3), in determining whether or not relevant funds constitute
proceeds of municipal securities for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(m), a person may rely on
representations in writing made by a knowledgeable official of the municipal entity or obligated
person whose funds are to be invested regarding the nature of such funds, provided the person has a
reasonable basis for such reliance. 363 Under Rule 15Ba1-1(m)(3), a person need not obtain a
separate written representation each time an investment is made, and can instead rely on a prior
written representation if the person has a reasonable basis for reliance. The Commission believes
that a determination of whether or not a person has a reasonable basis to rely on a written
representation requires reasonable diligence, based on all the facts and circumstances, including
review of the written representation and other relevant information reasonably available to the

361

See Kutak Rock Letter. See also Financial Services Roundtable Letter.

person. For example, a person should not ignore information 364 in the person’s possession as a
result of which such person would know that the representation is inaccurate. In such a
circumstance, the person seeking to rely on the representation should make further inquiry to verify
the accuracy of the representation in order to show a reasonable basis for the reliance. However, a
person relying on a written representation generally need not independently verify all the
information underlying the representation. Depending on the particular facts and circumstances,
however, a person seeking to rely on such representations should take into account other
information, including, but not limited to, information that is reasonably available to such person
either as a result of the person’s relationship with the municipal entity or obligated person or that is
provided by other parties to the relevant transaction. 365
Municipal Escrow Investments
Section 15B(e)(3) of the Exchange Act provides that the term investment strategies includes,
in part, “the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments.” 366 However,
Section 15B(e) of the Exchange Act does not define the term “municipal escrow investments.”
Several commenters discussed the term “municipal escrow investments” as used in the
364

For example, such person may have acquired other information as a result of its interaction
with the municipal entity or obligated person, either in connection with the transaction with
respect to which it received the written representation or otherwise.

365

The Commission notes that it has in other contexts expressed similar views on whether a
person’s reliance on information is reasonable. For example, under Regulation R, a bank or
a broker-dealer satisfies its customer eligibility requirements if the bank or broker-dealer
“has a reasonable basis to believe that the customer” is an institutional customer or high net
worth customer before the time specified in the rule. See 17 CFR 247.701. When adopting
Regulation R, the Commission stated that a bank or broker-dealer would have a “reasonable
basis to believe” if it obtains a signed acknowledgment that the customer met the applicable
standards, unless it had information that would cause it to believe that the information
provided by the customer was or was likely to be false. See Definitions of Terms and
Exemptions Relating to the “Broker” Exceptions for Banks, Securities Exchange Act

context of investment strategies and some asked for further Commission guidance on the meaning
of this term. 367 For example, one commenter stated that Congress intended the term to be limited to
accounts holding the proceeds of municipal securities pending deployment. 368 Another commenter
stated that municipal escrow investments means investments deposited in an escrow account to
“defease” 369 municipal securities. 370 Another commenter stated that municipal escrow investments
are investments of funds in a segregated escrow account established by the municipal entity or
obligated person to hold funds that have been allocated for satisfying a specific and identified
obligation of the municipal entity or obligated person and maintained by an escrow agent for the
municipal entity or obligated person. 371 One commenter stated that the Commission should
recognize that the term “municipal escrow investments” has a different and narrower meaning than

The MSRB provides the following definition for “defeasance” or “defeased” – “Termination
of certain of the rights and interests of the bondholders and of their lien on the pledged
revenues or other security in accordance with the terms of the bond contract for an issue of
securities. This is sometimes referred to as a ‘legal defeasance.’ Defeasance usually occurs
in connection with the refunding of an outstanding issue after provision has been made for
future payment of all obligations related to the outstanding bonds, sometimes from funds
provided by the issuance of a new series of bonds. In some cases, particularly where the
bond contract does not provide a procedure for termination of these rights, interests and lien
other than through payment of all outstanding debt in full, funds deposited for future
payment of the debt may make the pledged revenues available for other purposes without
effecting a legal defeasance. This is sometimes referred to as an ‘economic defeasance’ or
‘financial defeasance.’ If for some reason the funds deposited in an economic or financial
defeasance prove insufficient to make future payment of the outstanding debt, the issuer
would continue to be legally obligated to make payment on such debt from the pledged
revenues.” See definition of “Defeasance” or “Defeased” in Glossary of Municipal
Securities Terms, MSRB (3d ed. 2013), available at http://msrb.org/glossary.aspx (“MSRB

“proceeds of municipal securities” and is limited to investments held in an escrow account. 372 This
commenter also suggested that the Commission should clarify that merely providing brokerage of
municipal escrow investments does not make a person a municipal advisor. 373
The Commission has carefully considered the issues raised by commenters on the Proposal
and has determined to provide a definition for “municipal escrow investments.” 374 For purposes of
the definition of investment strategies, the Commission is defining “municipal escrow investments”
as proceeds of municipal securities and any other funds of a municipal entity that are deposited in
an escrow account to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on one or more issues of
municipal securities. 375 Because it is a separate component of the statutory definition of investment
strategies, the Commission agrees with the comments that “municipal escrow investments” does not
necessarily have the same meaning as “proceeds.” 376 At the same time, however, municipal escrow
investments generally are funded with proceeds raised from the issuance of municipal securities in
refunding or refinancing transactions to be used to provide for repayment of prior outstanding issues
of municipal securities and these escrows also may include certain other funds, such as an issuer’s
cash contribution derived from revenues. 377 In addition, municipal escrow investments may be

See id. Rather, the commenter asserted that providing advice with respect to the
recommendation of, and brokerage of, municipal escrow investments makes a person a
municipal advisor.

375

See Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(1).

376

See Rule 15Ba1-1(m) (defining proceeds of municipal securities).

377

See, e.g., Ballard, ABCs of Arbitrage at 169 (“A refunding escrow is any fund that contains
proceeds of a refunding issue for use in paying principal or interest on a prior issue.
Normally, an issuer will contribute either revenues or unspent prior issue proceeds to a
refunding escrow in addition to proceeds of the refunding issue.). See also Treas. Reg. §
1.148-1(b), which defines a “refunding escrow” generally to mean “one or more funds
established as part of a single transaction or a series of related transactions, containing
103

funded in part from equity-type funds which may be viewed as equity or as a broad category of
proceeds as a result of their escrow pledge to secure the outstanding municipal securities to be
refinanced and their attendant close nexus to those municipal securities. 378 The definition of
municipal escrow investments provided herein, consistent with Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii), protects
funds that are used for payment of the municipal securities issue, whether or not they are derived
from the sale of municipal securities.
The Commission believes that this definition of municipal escrow investments is appropriate
in order to protect both investors in municipal securities and municipal entities for reasons
discussed further below. These municipal escrow investments typically involve investments of
significant amounts of proceeds of municipal securities for long periods of time linked to call
restrictions or maturities of refunded debt. These features make municipal escrow investments
particularly vulnerable to abuse, and in fact significant investment pricing abuses have occurred in
the area of municipal escrow investments in the past and the potential for future pricing abuses
continues to exist in this area. 379 In one particularly notable historic example, pricing abuses
involving municipal escrow investments were the subject of a major joint enforcement initiative
involving the Commission, the Internal Revenue Service, and the U.S. Attorney for the Southern
District of New York that affected a large number of major broker-dealers with respect to
artificially high prices on U.S. Treasury securities charged by such dealers in sales of such securities

proceeds of a refunding issue and any other amounts to provide for payment of principal or
interest on one or more prior issues.”)

to municipal entities to fund municipal escrow investments. 380
The Commission notes that a person merely providing brokerage of municipal escrow
investments would not be a municipal advisor if such person does not provide advice with respect to
such investments. 381 The purchase and sale of escrow investments upon the direction of an
obligated person or its financial advisor without rendering advice is merely a provision of brokerage
services and does not render such person a municipal advisor. It is the provision of advice to or on
behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal escrow investments that
renders a person a municipal advisor. 382
Also, consistent with the definition of proceeds of municipal securities that the Commission
is adopting, the Commission is including a written representation component in the definition of
municipal escrow investments. Accordingly, Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2) states that, in determining
whether or not funds to be invested or reinvested constitute municipal escrow investments for
purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(h), a person may rely on representations in writing made by a
knowledgeable official of the municipal entity or obligated person whose funds are to be invested or
reinvested regarding the nature of such investments, provided that the person seeking to rely on
such representations has a reasonable basis for such reliance. 383 As with the written representation
component under the definition of proceeds of municipal securities, under Rule 15Ba1-1(h), a

settlement is known as the “global yield-burning settlement.”

instead rely on a prior written representation if the person has a reasonable basis for reliance. For
this purpose, the same standard and principles apply in determining whether a person has a
reasonable basis for such reliance as discussed previously with respect to reliance on representations
regarding proceeds determinations. 384
Other Comments on the Scope of the Proposed Interpretation of “Investment Strategies”
In addition to responses to specific requests for comment, the Commission received a
number of other comments regarding its proposed interpretation of the statutory definition of
investment strategies. For example, one commenter requested that the Commission clarify that the
term “investment strategies” does not include separate accounts supporting insurance contracts or
their underlying investment vehicles. 385 The commenter reasoned that the funds invested in such
insurance contracts are not proceeds of municipal securities, but are employer and employee
contributions. 386 Another commenter argued that the term “municipal financial product” should not
include “an insurance product tailored to a municipal entity,” because “such products . . . are
384

See supra notes 364-365 and accompanying text.

385

See Committee of Annuity Insurers Letter I.

386

See id. The commenter explained that variable annuity contracts issued by its members are
supported by insurance company separate accounts. Insurance company separate accounts
could be limited to insurance contracts issued only to governmental retirement plans. The
commenter noted that, if the Commission adopts its proposal to define municipal entity as
including 457 plans and 403(b) plans, these insurance company separate accounts could then
be viewed as pooled investment vehicles limited to municipal entity investors (i.e., 457
plans and 403(b) plans). The commenter noted that the definition of investment strategies
could be read to imply that an insurance company separate account, whose assets are limited
to contributions from insurance contracts held by governmental retirement plans, is an
investment strategy. The commenter stated that it has found no indication in the legislative
history that Congress intended this result. The commenter noted that the funds invested in
these insurance contracts are not proceeds of municipal securities, but rather employer and
employee contributions. In the case of employee contributions from salary deduction
arrangements, such salary funds are equity funds of the employees upon receipt, regardless
of the source of those salaries, and thus are not proceeds of municipal securities.
106

already quite well regulated.” 387
The Commission agrees that employee contributions are not proceeds of municipal
securities because these funds are derived from salary deduction arrangements with individual
employees and not from the issuance of a municipal security. Therefore, a person providing advice
with respect to such contributions would be exempt from the definition of municipal advisor to the
extent their municipal advisory activities are limited to such advice. Whether a person providing
advice with respect to employer contributions will be exempt, however, will depend upon whether
such funds are proceeds of municipal securities. In general, public pension plans do not include
proceeds of municipal securities because proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities generally
cannot be spent to fund investments for pension liabilities. 388 Further, the Commission agrees that a
person providing advice with respect to other insurance products tailored to a municipal entity
would not be engaged in municipal advisory activities if the insurance products do not involve the
investment of proceeds of municipal securities because the final rules narrow the focus of the term
“investment strategies” to those involving investments of proceeds of municipal securities and
municipal escrow investments with a new exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii).
ix. Pooled Investment Vehicles
As discussed above, the Commission proposed to interpret the statutory definition of the
term “investment strategies” to include “pools of assets that invest funds held by or on behalf of a
municipal entity.” 389 Further, as part of the discussion of the term “investment strategies,” the
Commission noted in the Proposal that, to the extent a person is providing advice to certain pooled
investment vehicles in which a municipal entity has invested funds along with other investors, such

See supra Section III.A.1.b.viii. See also proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(b).
107

pooled investment vehicles would not be considered funds “held by or on behalf of a municipal
entity.” 390 Consequently, a person providing advice to such vehicle would not have to register as a
municipal advisor. However, the Commission noted that, to the extent that the pooled investment
vehicle is a LGIP, the pooled investment vehicle would be considered to be funds “held by or on
behalf of” a municipal entity and a person providing advice with respect to a LGIP would have to
register as a municipal advisor, absent eligibility for some other exclusion or exemption. 391
The Commission requested comment on whether it should modify or clarify its proposed
interpretation of the circumstances under which a pooled investment vehicle would be considered to
involve funds “held by or on behalf of a municipal entity,” including whether the proposed
interpretation should no longer apply if municipal entities are not considered to be the “primary
investors” in the pooled investment vehicle or if funds of municipal entities exceed a certain
threshold in the pooled investment vehicle. 392 The Commission received several comment letters
addressing the interpretation.
One commenter supported the Commission’s proposed interpretation, without further
request for modification. 393 Two commenters opposed any approach to determine municipal

See id., at note 98.

392

See id., at 835.

393

See American Bankers Association Letter I. This commenter urged the Commission to
reiterate its position in the final rules and clarify that the interpretation applies to collective
investment funds. A collective investment fund (“CIF”) is a bank-administered trust that
holds commingled assets that meet specific criteria established by 12 CFR 9.18. The bank
acts as a fiduciary for the CIF and holds legal title to the fund’s assets. CIFs allow banks to
avoid costly purchases of small lot investments for their smaller fiduciary accounts. See
Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, Collective Investment Funds, available at
http://www.occ.treas.gov/topics/capital-markets/asset-management/collective-investmentfunds/index-collective-investment-funds.html. The Commission notes that a CIF would
have to contain no proceeds of municipal securities or fall within an exclusion or exemption
108

advisory status based on whether municipal entities were the “primary investors” in the pooled
vehicle, citing the difficulty of making such a determination on an ongoing basis. 394 Another
commenter urged the Commission to reiterate that an adviser to a pooled investment vehicle in
which a municipal entity or obligated person invests is not a municipal advisor by virtue of
providing advice to such a vehicle, and that purchasing an interest in a vehicle does not create an
advisory engagement between the investor and the vehicle’s adviser. 395 This commenter suggested
that, “so long as there is at least one bona fide investor that is not a municipal entity or obligated
person, the adviser to the vehicle should not be a municipal advisor.” 396 The commenter also stated
that not exempting advisors to pooled vehicles would particularly limit investment choices for
public pension funds. 397
The Commission has carefully considered these comments and is not adopting its proposed
to not require municipal advisor registration. See infra Section III.A.1.c.viii. (discussing the
bank exemption).
394

See letter from Stuart J. Kaswell, Executive Vice President and Managing Director, General
Counsel, Managed Funds Association, dated February 22, 2011 (“MFA Letter”) (stating that
“imposing such an artificial threshold would create uncertainty for private fund managers,
require burdensome, ongoing monitoring of the level of municipal entity investments, and
limit or even prevent municipal entities from investing in private funds”). See also Kutak
Rock Letter (suggesting that terminology involving the concept of “municipal entities are
the primary investors” not be utilized, because “it is too difficult to determine just what
‘primary’ means[,]” and that too many difficult questions regarding an objective, numbersbased approach used to determine primary investorship would arise).

395

See SIFMA Letter I.

396

Id.

397

See id. Specifically, the commenter stated that absent the suggested exemptions, fewer
pooled investment vehicles would be offered to municipal entities (particularly public
pension plans) and obligated persons, which would disserve municipal entities and obligated
persons by limiting their access to important vehicles for the long-term investment of their
funds. The commenter also stated that local government investment pools are often the only
available option for the short-term investment of operating funds and are subject to state
laws, which often include a fiduciary duty. The commenter stated that the Proposal likely
would reduce the number of local government investment pool options available to
municipalities.
109

interpretation of when a pooled investment vehicle will be considered to be funds held by or on
behalf of a municipal entity. It is also not adopting an interpretation that would tie the
determination of whether a person providing advice to a pooled investment vehicle is a municipal
advisor, to whether municipal entities are the primary investors in the pooled investment vehicle.
Instead, consistent with the narrowed approach that the Commission is adopting for “investment
strategies,” the Commission is interpreting a pooled investment vehicle to be an investment
strategy, and an advisor to such a pool to be a municipal advisor, when the pooled investment
vehicle contains proceeds of an issuance of municipal securities, regardless of whether all funds
invested in the vehicle are funds of municipal entities. 398 In such a case, an advisor to such a pooled
investment vehicle will be required to register as a municipal advisor, unless an exclusion or
exemption applies.
The Commission recognizes commenters’ concerns that requiring advisors to pooled
investment vehicles that include funds of municipal entities to register as municipal advisors could
have the effect of limiting investment choices for municipal entities, including investment choices
for public pension funds. As noted above, however, the Commission is exempting from the
definition of municipal advisor persons that provide advice with respect to investment strategies that
are not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities or the
recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments. 399 Contrary to the

398

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1) (defining “municipal advisor”) and Rule 15Ba1-1(b) (defining
“investment strategies” as including the statutorily identified items: “plans or programs for
the investment of proceeds of municipal securities that are not municipal derivatives or
guaranteed investment contracts, and the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal
escrow investments”).

399

See supra Section III.A.1.b.viii. (discussing the exemption as it relates to the application of
the statutory definition of “investment strategies”).
110

construction under the proposed definition of “investment strategies,” 400 under the definition of
“investment strategies” as adopted and the exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii), whether or not the
funds invested in a pooled investment vehicle are considered to be “funds held by or on behalf of a
municipal entity” does not determine whether a person providing advice to such a vehicle is
required to register as a municipal advisor. Rather, under the rule as adopted, the determination of
whether a person providing advice to a pooled investment vehicle is required to register as a
municipal advisor depends upon the narrower inquiry of whether the funds in the pooled investment
vehicle constitute “proceeds of municipal securities that are not municipal derivatives or guaranteed
investment contracts, and the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow
investments.” 401 Also, the Commission notes that many advisors to pooled investment vehicles will
be registered investment advisers or employees of municipal entities. Therefore, many advisors
would or could be either exempted or excluded from registration as municipal advisors. 402
Moreover, the Commission believes that this approach to pooled investment vehicles appropriately
focuses protection on those activities related to investment of the proceeds of municipal securities
and related escrow investments, with respect to which there has been significant enforcement
activity. 403
One commenter expressed concern that pooled investment vehicles whose investors are
limited to one or more municipal entities (e.g., a government retirement pension plan) would be

111

considered investment strategies under the Proposal. 404 This commenter suggested that the term
“investment strategies” should not include insurance company’s separate accounts supporting
variable annuity contracts (and their underlying investment vehicles) offered to or held by
municipal entities, even if the assets of the separate account are limited only to contributions from
municipal entities. 405
To the extent that an insurance company’s separate accounts supporting variable annuity
contracts offered to or held by municipal entities do not include “proceeds of municipal securities,”
persons providing advice with respect to such accounts would not be required to register as
municipal advisors because they would be exempt with respect to such municipal advisory
activity. 406 Specifically, the Commission notes that, as a result of the exemption in Rule 15Ba11(d)(3)(vii) adopted today, a person providing advice with respect to investment strategies that are
not “plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities or the
recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments” will be exempt from the
definition of municipal advisor with respect to such activities. Further, the definition of “proceeds
of municipal securities” is limited to the monies derived by a municipal entity from the sale of
municipal securities, investment income derived from such monies, and other monies of a municipal
entity (or obligated person) held in funds under legal documents for the municipal securities that
are reasonably expected to be used as security or a source of payment for the debt service on the
municipal securities, and investment income from the investment or reinvestment of such funds. 407
If, however, such separate accounts supporting variable annuity contracts offered to or held by

municipal entities do include “proceeds of municipal securities,” advice with respect to such
accounts would not be eligible for the exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii) and such activity could
be municipal advisory activity triggering the registration requirement.
x. Solicitation of a Municipal Entity or Obligated Person
The definition of municipal advisor in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4) includes a person
that undertakes a solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person on behalf of specified
persons. 408 Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(9) provides that the term “solicitation of a municipal
entity or obligated person” means “a direct or indirect communication with a municipal entity or
obligated person made by a person, for direct or indirect compensation, on behalf of a broker,
dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser (as defined in section
202 of the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 [15 U.S.C. 80b-2]) that does not control, is not
controlled by, or is not under common control with the person undertaking such solicitation for the
purpose of obtaining or retaining an engagement by a municipal entity or obligated person of a
broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or municipal advisor for or in connection with municipal
financial products, the issuance of municipal securities, or of an investment adviser to provide
investment advisory services to or on behalf of a municipal entity.” 409

408

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(A)(ii). The Commission notes that the definition of municipal
advisor under Section 15B(e)(4)(A) means, in part, a person that “undertakes a solicitation
of a municipal entity.” Also, Section 15B(a)(1)(B), which establishes the registration
requirement, specifically refers to solicitations of obligated persons. Notwithstanding the
omission of the term “obligated person” in the definition of municipal advisor, the
Commission interprets the definition of municipal advisor to include a person who engages
in the solicitation of an obligated person acting in the capacity of an obligated person for the
reasons discussed above. See supra note 138 and accompanying text.
See also supra note 178 (citing Chapman and Cutler Letter and discussing that an obligated
person does not become a municipal entity by virtue of issuing securities with respect to
which it is an obligated person).

409

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(9).
113

In connection with the statutory definition, the Commission discussed in the Proposal its
interpretation of “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” and stated in the Proposal
that, unless an exclusion applies, any third-party solicitor that seeks business on behalf of a broker,
dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser from a municipal entity
must register as a municipal advisor. 410 The Commission noted that the determination of whether a
solicitation of a municipal entity requires registration is not based on the number, or size, of
investments that are solicited. 411 The Commission also specifically stated that the exclusion from
the definition of municipal advisor for a broker-dealer serving as an underwriter would not apply to
a broker-dealer acting as a placement agent for a private equity fund that solicits a municipal entity

The Commission notes that Rule 15Ba1-1(n) (which, as adopted, provides that the term
“solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” has the same meaning as Section
15B(e)(9) of the Exchange Act, with certain exemptions) is only applicable with respect to
whether or not a person meets the definition of municipal advisor and therefore will be
required to register with the Commission (unless an exemption or exclusion applies). The
Commission is not otherwise altering its interpretation of “solicitation” as used in other
contexts.
As the Commission has explained, the Commission generally views solicitation, in the
context of broker-dealers, as including any affirmative effort intended to induce
transactional business. See Registration Requirements for Foreign Broker-Dealers,
Securities Exchange Act Release No. 27017 (July 11, 1989), 54 FR 30013, 30017-18 (July
18, 1989) (explaining that solicitation includes, among other things, calls encouraging use of
a party to effect transactions).
410

See Proposal, 76 FR at 831. Thus, as stated in the Proposal, a third-party solicitor seeking
business on behalf of an investment adviser from a municipal pension fund or LGIP would
be required to register as a municipal advisor.
In addition, depending on the facts and circumstances, the third-party solicitor may also
need to register as a broker-dealer pursuant to Section 15(a) of the Exchange Act. See 15
U.S.C. 78o(a)(1). See also supra note 409 (discussing solicitation in the context of brokerdealer regulation).

411

See Proposal, 76 FR at 831. As discussed in the Proposal, a solicitation of a single
investment of any amount from a municipal entity would require the person soliciting the
municipal entity to register as a municipal advisor.
114

or obligated person to invest in the fund. 412
The Commission received approximately 14 comment letters regarding the definition of
“solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.” As discussed in more detail below, a
number of commenters requested further clarification regarding the statutory definition of, and the
Commission’s proposed interpretations of, that term. The Commission has carefully considered
issues raised by commenters on its proposed interpretation and is adopting a rule 413 to define
“solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.” The Commission’s interpretation of
“solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” in Rule 15Ba1-1(n) is substantially the same
as its proposed interpretation, and includes certain clarifications discussed below designed to
address commenters’ concerns. 414 In addition, the Commission notes that, both in its proposed
interpretation and adopted rule, a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or
investment adviser, soliciting on its own behalf, as explained below 415 – or an affiliate of a broker,
dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser soliciting on behalf of
such entity – would not fall within the definition of “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated
person.” Accordingly, such person would not need to register as a municipal advisor.
412

See id., at 832, note 108 and accompanying text.
The Commission also noted that including such activities within the scope of municipal
advisory activities is consistent with the Exchange Act. See id. (citing Exchange Act
Sections 15B(e)(4)(A) and (B) (including placement agents and solicitors that undertake a
solicitation of a municipal entity in the definition of municipal advisor); S. Rep. No. 176 at
148, 111th Cong., 2d. Sess. 148 (2010) (noting that Section 975 would not prohibit
solicitation of a municipal entity, but would subject solicitors to the registration requirement
and MSRB regulation); and letter from Senator Christopher J. Dodd, U.S. Senate Committee
on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs, to Elizabeth M. Murphy, Secretary, Commission,

Commenters stated that the Commission should explicitly exclude certain activities from the
definition of solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person. For example, one commenter
recommended that “generic ‘mass mailing’ solicitations, or institutional advertising” should not be
considered solicitation under the proposed rules, especially if such mass mailings are not targeted to
a small group of particular municipal entities or obligated persons. 416 This commenter noted that
the same argument would apply with respect to newspaper or periodical ads, brochures, TV, radio,
or Internet ads. 417
The Commission agrees with commenters that advertisements 418 or solicitations do not
trigger an obligation for a third-party to register as a municipal advisor, provided such activity is
undertaken by a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment
adviser on behalf of itself as opposed to on behalf of a third party. Accordingly, the Commission is
adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(n) with a clarification to address advertising and the scope of the rule with
respect to solicitation of obligated persons. 419 Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-1(n), as adopted, clarifies
that “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” does not include “advertising by a
broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser.” 420

The Commission notes, however, that while such communications would not trigger the

such communications, such activity may be considered to be advice for purposes of the

Assistance with Requests for Proposals
It is a relatively common industry practice for municipal entities to request that a financial
advisor, bond counsel, or other market professional assist in the review of requests for proposals
(“RFP”) for underwriter, financial advisory, or investment advisory services. 421 A person assisting
a municipal entity or obligated person in selecting a broker-dealer, investment adviser, or financial
advisor as part of an RFP process established by the municipal entity or obligated person would not
be considered to be undertaking a solicitation for purposes of the definition of municipal advisor in
Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1), because such person would not be soliciting “on behalf of” such broker-dealer,
investment adviser, or financial advisor. 422 Such person could, however, be engaging in other
municipal advisory activities with respect to assistance in the selection process. 423
Endorsement of Financial Products and Services by Associations
The Commission received approximately nine comment letters from various associations
that endorse third parties offering products and services to the associations’ members
(“endorsement arrangements”). 424 According to commenters, in these endorsement arrangements,

general).
421

For example, one commenter expressed concern that an investment adviser providing advice
to a client regarding the selection or retention of another investment manager could
constitute a solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person under Section 15B(e)(9) of
the Exchange Act. See infra note 705 and accompanying text.

for clients meets the Investment Advisers Act’s definition of “investment adviser”).

the third parties, which typically include investment advisers, broker-dealers, and mutual fund
companies, compensate the associations or their for-profit subsidiaries through a royalty
arrangement or through a marketing or sponsorship fee, depending on the association’s level of
involvement in providing information to its members. 425 The commenters expressed concern that
the associations’ compensated endorsement of investment advisory, municipal advisory, or brokerdealer businesses to their members, some of whom are municipal entities, could potentially be
interpreted as solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person. 426 Many of these commenters
believed that the Proposal did not provide sufficient guidance about the statutory definition of
“solicitation.” The statutory definition of solicitation includes “direct or indirect communication
with a municipal entity or obligated person,” thus creating uncertainty regarding the possible
inclusion of such endorsements. 427 One commenter noted that investment advisory, municipal
advisory, or broker-dealer businesses that are endorsed by associations are not directed specifically
at municipal entities, but rather are prepared and circulated without regard to whether the audience
may include municipal entities. 428

brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, or similar persons engaged in the financial advisory
service industry.” 429 One stated that compliance with the registration rules would create a
significant administrative burden and would not create any material public benefits. 430 The other
commenter requested that the Commission clarify the meaning of “indirect communication” within
the definition of solicitation. 431 Similarly, other commenters stated that the Commission should
exempt national and state associations representing state and local governments from municipal
advisor registration. 432 These commenters argued that their staffs do not directly contact public
employees or offer advice to public agencies or public employees. 433
At this time, the Commission is not providing a general exemption for national and state
associations that engage in endorsement arrangements. An organization that receives compensation
for endorsing a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser

These commenters stated that they do not directly or indirectly engage in the offer or sale of
particular products or services to government employees, do not make any product or
investment recommendations to existing or prospective clients, give any investment advice
on their own behalf or on behalf of any third party supplier, or accept any clients on behalf
of any third party supplier. These commenters also stated that the cost of registration and
compliance, along with unknown consequences of state required registration due to the rules
promulgated by the Commission, would unfairly disadvantage associations representing
public agencies.
One of the commenters stated that such associations should receive an exemption in order to
offer their membership access to value-added education and services through publicly
solicited contracts. The commenter noted that associations representing non-governmental
organizations are not required to register under the proposed rule and yet are able to endorse
programs for their memberships that meet their standards of approval. See Virginia

is soliciting a municipal entity or obligated person within the meaning of the statute. However, the
Commission notes that its interpretation in Rule 15Ba1-1(n) with respect to excluding advertising
from “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” may apply to some of these
associations. For example, if an association’s “endorsement” qualifies as “advertising” by a broker,
dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser, pursuant to Rule
15Ba1-1(n), it would not be required to register as a municipal advisor. Such a determination,
however, would be based on the particular facts and circumstances.
The Commission does not believe at this time that it is appropriate to provide a blanket
exemption to associations that are not able to take advantage of Rule 15Ba1-1(n), because these
associations are being directly or indirectly compensated for recommending a broker, dealer,
municipal advisor, or investment adviser to municipal entities or obligated persons. In addition,
these associations may, in certain cases, be compensated in direct relation to the number of
municipal entities that engage the endorsed product or service provider.
Uncompensated Recommendations
Some commenters stated that the Exchange Act and the Proposal are unclear about when
uncompensated recommendations might be deemed to be solicitations for purposes of the rule. 434
Several commenters stated that uncompensated recommendations should not be considered to be
solicitations because the statutory text only refers to “direct or indirect compensation.” 435 One
commenter stated further that, if uncompensated recommendations are interpreted to be

solicitations, it “will chill significantly the provision of information to municipal entities….” 436
Other commenters suggested that the solicitation prong should not apply if the municipal entity or
obligated person requests an introduction. 437
The Commission notes that an introduction is not necessarily a solicitation. Moreover,
whether an introduction is a solicitation does not depend on whether a municipal entity or obligated
person requests an introduction or the introduction is provided without request. Rather, for
purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(n), the solicitation determination is based on whether the person
providing the introduction receives direct or indirect compensation for providing the introduction.438
For example, a person could respond to a request from a municipal entity with a particular
recommendation and then subsequently receive payment from the recommended entity. In this
example, the solicitation would trigger the registration requirement.
The statutory definition of “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” provides
that the solicitation must be performed for “direct or indirect compensation.” 439 Thus, persons that
are not compensated for soliciting a municipal entity or obligated person would not be required to
register as municipal advisors. The Commission notes, however, that Commission staff has broadly
construed the term “direct or indirect compensation” in other contexts. 440 In addition, as noted in

436

See NAESCO Letter.

See, e.g., letter from Deron S. Kintner, Executive Director, Indianapolis Local Public
Improvement Bond Bank, dated February 22, 2011 (“Indianapolis Local Public
Improvement Bond Bank Letter”) (stating that a person who solicits advice from individuals
should be free to solicit advice and recommendations without having to either engage those
individuals and compensate them or subject them to fiduciary duties).

438

See Rule 15Ba1-1(n) and 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(9) (which defines “solicitation of a municipal

certain specified entities).

For example, under the Investment Advisers Act, Commission staff has taken the position

Solicitation of Obligated Persons
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(9) provides, in part, that the term “solicitation of a municipal
entity or obligated person” is “for the purpose of obtaining or retaining an engagement… of a
broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or municipal advisor for or in connection with municipal
financial products….” 442 One commenter asked the Commission to clarify that the meaning of
“municipal financial products” with respect to the “solicitation of an obligated person” includes
municipal derivatives, guaranteed investment contracts, and investment strategies of the municipal
entity only, and not of the obligated person. 443 The commenter stated that obligated persons may
include large entities with numerous and varied funds and investments, many of which may have
nothing to do with the transactions pursuant to which they have become obligated persons. 444 In
addition, the commenter stated that if the municipal advisor definition includes persons who advise
obligated persons or solicit obligated persons with respect to the funds, securities, or investment
strategies of the obligated person, “the reach of the registration requirement would expand in
potentially unpredictable ways.” 445

that compensation generally includes the receipt of any economic benefit, whether in the
form of an advisory fee, some other fee relating to services rendered, a commission, or some
combination of the foregoing. See Applicability of the Investment Advisers Act to Financial
Planners, Pension Consultants, and Other Persons Who Provide Investment Advisory
Services as a Component of Other Financial Services, Investment Advisers Act Release No.

The Commission agrees with the comment that solicitation with respect to an obligated
person applies only when an obligated person is acting in its capacity as an obligated person. 446 The
Commission is, therefore, adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(n), which clarifies that, in the case of solicitation
of an obligated person, the definition of “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” does
not include solicitation of an obligated person “if such obligated person is not acting in the capacity
of an obligated person or the solicitation of the obligated person is not in connection with the
issuance of municipal securities or with respect to municipal financial products.” 447
As discussed above, with respect to the definition of obligated person, the Commission
believes that the municipal advisor registration regime should apply in the same manner to advisors
of obligated persons as to advisors of municipal entities. 448 The Commission further notes that,
because they are committed by contract or other arrangement to support the payment of all or part
of the obligations on municipal securities, obligated persons serve the same role as municipal
entities with regard to municipal securities. 449 Therefore, pursuant to the Commission’s
clarification in Rule 15Ba1-1(n), a person soliciting an obligated person with respect to the issuance
of municipal securities or municipal financial products will not meet the definition of municipal
advisor as a result of such activity unless the obligated person is acting in its capacity as such. 450
One commenter asked when a person should know whether he or she is soliciting an
obligated person. Specifically, with respect to the application of the proposed rules to persons who

The Commission also discusses above when a person is an “obligated person.” See supra

undertake a solicitation of an obligated person, the commenter stated that a person should be
considered to have engaged in such activities only when it has actual knowledge that it is (a)
soliciting an obligated person, acting in its capacity as an obligated person, and (b) engaging in
solicitation with respect to the issuance of municipal securities or proceeds of municipal
securities. 451 Further, this commenter stated that a person must be rendering services with respect
to the types of activities or instruments that make a person a municipal advisor. 452 Lastly, the
commenter suggested that a person need not affirmatively inquire as to the potential obligated
person’s status or the funds’ status. 453
The Commission believes that the commenter’s suggestion, if adopted, would allow the
municipal advisor registration regime to be too easily circumvented. An advisor could always argue
that it did not have “actual knowledge” that it was soliciting an obligated person and therefore is not
subject to regulation. The Commission instead believes that a person that is soliciting an obligated
person should make a reasonable inquiry to a person in a position to know as to whether it is
soliciting for services related to the issuance of municipal securities or municipal financial products,
and whether the person being solicited is an obligated person. For example, a person may rely on
the written representation of the obligated person, unless such person has information that would
cause a reasonable person to question the accuracy of the representation. 454 In such a case, a person
could not ignore the information and would need to make further reasonable inquiry to verify the

accuracy of the representation. 455
Other Exclusions and Exemptions from the Definition of “Solicitation of a Municipal Entity or
Obligated Person”
Some commenters stated that the Commission should explicitly exclude certain entities from
the solicitation definition altogether. For example, several commenters stated that placement agents
for pooled investment vehicles should not be considered solicitors. 456 Another commenter
recommended that an investment adviser’s employees who solicit municipal entities as part of their
regular responsibilities should not be considered solicitors. 457 The Commission has carefully
considered issues raised by commenters and has determined not to provide specific exemptions
from the definition of “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.” 458
Section 15B(e)(4)(A) of the Exchange Act states that the definition of municipal advisor
includes a person that undertakes a solicitation of a municipal entity. 459 Section 15B(e)(4)(B) of the
Exchange Act states that the definition of municipal advisor includes a number of listed types of

See also supra Section III.A.1.b.viii. at note 363 and accompanying text (discussing the
requirement to know when advice relates to the proceeds of municipal securities).

456

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter I (stating that Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act does not define
“solicitation” to include solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person by a placement
agent for a pooled investment vehicle, such as a private equity fund, hedge fund, LGIP, or
mutual fund, all of which involve the sale of securities by registered broker-dealers); ICI
Letter (stating that a “placement agent soliciting a municipal entity to invest in a pooled
investment vehicle acts on behalf of the pooled investment vehicle only, not on behalf of the
adviser to the vehicle nor on behalf of any of the other four enumerated categories of
persons contained in the definition”).

an affiliate of an investment adviser and its employees soliciting on behalf of its affiliated
adviser, but not for the same analysis to apply to an investment adviser and its own
employees soliciting on their employer’s behalf”).

market participants (specifically financial advisors, guaranteed investment contract brokers, thirdparty marketers, placement agents, solicitors, finders, and swap advisors) if such persons otherwise
meet the definition of a municipal advisor under Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(A). In relevant
part, Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(A)(ii) provides that a municipal advisor includes a person
that, on behalf of certain types of third-parties, undertakes a solicitation of a municipal entity to
engage such parties to perform certain specified activities. 460 In the case of placement agents, the
Commission agrees with commenters that a placement agent for a pooled investment vehicle that is
not a municipal entity (e.g., a hedge fund or mutual fund) and that “solicits” a municipal entity to
invest in the fund does not, with respect to such activity, meet the statutory definition of the term
“solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(9). Such a
placement agent does not meet the statutory definition of the term because it is not soliciting on
behalf of a third-party broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment
adviser to obtain or retain an engagement by a municipal entity or obligated person of such thirdparty broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser. Whether
the placement agent otherwise meets the definition of “municipal advisor” with respect to any
activity related to or in connection with its “solicitation” activity (that does not, as discussed above,
meet the statutory definition of solicitation in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(9)) would depend on
the facts and circumstances. 461 By contrast, a placement agent that undertakes a solicitation of a
municipal entity for the purpose of obtaining an engagement by the municipal entity of an
unaffiliated investment adviser to provide investment advisory services to the municipal entity is a

municipal advisor because it is soliciting on behalf of an unaffiliated adviser to provide investment
advisory services. 462 The Commission also agrees with commenters that employees of a broker,
dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser that solicit municipal
entities as part of their regular duties on behalf of their employer or an affiliate of such employer are
not municipal advisors, if they are acting within the scope of their employment. Specifically, as
provided in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(9), the term “solicitation of a municipal entity or
obligated person” means, in part, “a direct or indirect communication with a municipal entity or
obligated person made by a person… on behalf of a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer,
municipal advisor, or investment adviser … that does not control, is not controlled by, or is not
under common control with the person undertaking such solicitation… .” 463 As such, the term
applies only to third-party solicitors, and not to an entity acting on its own behalf or on behalf of its
affiliate. Employees acting in their capacity as such on behalf of their employer are acting as the
agent of their employer and, consequently, are not third-party solicitors that fall within the
definition of municipal advisor as a result of their solicitation activity.
Pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(viii) and consistent with the exemption from the definition
of municipal advisor under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii) for a person that provides advice with respect to
investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal
462

With respect to solicitations on behalf of investment advisers, the relevant portion of the
definition of a “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” in Exchange Act
Section 15B(e) limits the scope of covered solicitations to those involving solicitations for
the purpose of obtaining or retaining an engagement by a municipal entity or by an obligated
person “of an investment adviser to provide investment advisory services to or on behalf of a
municipal entity.” See also S. Rep. No. 111-176 at 148 (2010) (“Rather than effectively
prohibiting such third-party solicitation for investment advisory services, this section would
provide that activities of a municipal advisor, broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer
to solicit a municipal entity to engage an unrelated investment adviser to provide investment
advisory services to a municipal entity... would be subject to regulation by the MSRB.”)

securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments, 464 the
Commission is exempting from the definition of municipal advisor under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1) any
person that undertakes a “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” (as defined in Rule
15Ba1-1(n) (17 CFR 240.15Ba1-1(n)) for the purpose of obtaining or retaining an engagement by a
municipal entity or by an obligated person of a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, or
municipal advisor for or in connection with municipal financial products that are investment
strategies, to the extent that such investment strategies are not plans or programs for the investment
of the proceeds of municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal
escrow investments. 465 As with respect to the exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii), the
Commission believes that the exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(viii) is consistent with the public
interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act, because
the exemption tailors protection of municipal entities to those activities related to the investment of
the proceeds of municipal securities and related escrow investments. 466
Marketing of Insurance Contracts
One commenter stated that solicitation should not include the marketing of insurance
contracts by broker-dealers to retirement plans established by municipal entities. 467 The
Commission agrees that the marketing of insurance contracts by broker-dealers is not solicitation
for purposes of the municipal advisor definition if it is not performed on behalf of a third-party
broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, or municipal advisor. As described
above, the definition of “solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person” only applies to third-

Exclusions and Exemptions from the Definition of “Municipal
Advisor”

In addition to the exemption described above for persons providing advice or soliciting
engagements with respect to certain financial products, the Commission discusses below its
interpretations of certain statutory exclusions, as well as specific activities-based exemptions it is
granting from the definition of “municipal advisor.” 469 Also, the Commission discusses below
exemptions of general applicability to the extent a person is responding to an RFP or a request for
qualifications (“RFQ”) or to the extent a municipal entity or obligated person is otherwise
represented by a registered municipal advisor, subject to certain conditions.
i. Public Officials and Employees of Municipal Entities and
Obligated Persons
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(A) provides that the term “municipal advisor” excludes
employees of a municipal entity. 470 As noted in the Proposal, one commenter suggested that the
Commission clarify that this exclusion would include any person serving as an appointed or elected
member of the governing body of a municipal entity, such as a board member, county commissioner
or city councilman. 471 This commenter stated that, because these persons are not technically
“employees” of the municipal entity (but rather “unpaid volunteers”), they would not fall within the

468

See supra note 463 and accompanying text. See also Rule 15Ba1-1(n).

469

For the exclusions and exemptions that were discussed in the Proposal and that the
Commission is adopting today, the Commission has made minor, non-substantive changes to
provide greater clarity and consistency throughout the rules related to exclusions and
exemptions.

exclusion from the definition of municipal advisor for “employees of a municipal entity.” 472
The Commission stated in the Proposal that the exclusion from the definition of municipal
advisor for “employees of a municipal entity” should include any person serving as an elected
member of the municipal entity’s governing body to the extent that the person is acting within the
scope of his or her role as an elected member. The Commission also stated that “employees of a
municipal entity” should include a governing body’s appointed members to the extent such
appointed members are ex officio members by virtue of holding an elective office. 473 The
Commission stated its concern that appointed members are not directly accountable for their
performance to the citizens of the municipal entity. 474
In the Proposal, the Commission requested comment on: (1) whether there are any persons
who engage in uncompensated municipal advisory activities, or municipal advisory activities for
indirect compensation, that the Commission should exclude from the definition of municipal
advisor; (2) whether “employees of a municipal entity” should include elected members of a
governing body of a municipal entity, and appointed members of a municipal entity’s governing
body to the extent such appointed members are ex officio members of the governing body by virtue
of holding an elective office, is appropriate; and (3) whether there are other persons associated with
a municipal entity who might not be “employees” of a municipal entity but that the Commission
should exclude from the definition of municipal advisor. 475
The Commission received over 600 comment letters on its interpretation of “employee of a
municipal entity.” Commenters represented a wide array of individuals and entities, including

members of a municipal entity’s governing board.
The majority of commenters stated, in particular, that appointed board members should not
be treated differently from elected board members or officials and disagreed with the Commission’s
statement that appointed board members are not directly accountable. Many of the commenters
asserted that state and local laws applicable to officials of a municipal entity do not distinguish
between appointed or elected members and that all members are subject to the same legal
obligations, including fiduciary duties, codes of conduct, open meeting laws, and conflicts of
interest and ethics laws. 485 For example, commenters asserted that appointed officials of municipal
non-profit corporations, trusts, and pension funds have a duty to act in the interests of the
corporation, trust, or the fund. 486 Many commenters also asserted that appointed board members
are accountable to the elected officials that appointed them or for whom they work. 487 Many also

boards are the intended beneficiaries of the proposed regulation. 492 Further, some commenters
asserted that the Proposal would usurp state laws governing duties and responsibilities of appointed
board members of municipal entities. 493 Many commenters also stated that, in its current form, the
Proposal would deter much needed citizen volunteers from serving on governing boards of
municipal entities or would chill the deliberative process of such boards. These commenters
reasoned that volunteers would fear that their participation in votes on, or discussions of, financial
matters will be deemed “advice” that would subject them to registration. 494
Commenters also stated that the Proposal is unclear with respect to whether: (1) appointed,
rather than elected, officials (such as city controllers, managers, and commissioners) would be
“employees;” 495 (2) the employee of one municipal entity (such as an employee of a municipal entity

committees of the agency and to fulfill the duties of offices of the agency; and commenting
that employees of its members that are seconded to the agency should have the same
exemption when they perform services for the agency as when the employees are acting
within the scope of their employment responsibilities providing services for the benefit of
the member entity); letter from Hawkins Delafield & Wood LLP, dated February 16, 2011
(commenting that “an employee of municipal entity A who provides services to, but is not
an employee of, municipal entity B, should be exempt under Section 15B(e)(4)(A) if both
entities operate for the benefit of the same governmental unit, whether at the state, county, or
municipal level”); letter from Susan Combs, Texas Comptroller of Public Accounts, dated
February 22, 2011 (describing that employees of Texas’s Office of the Comptroller may
provide advice to other municipal entities within the state in connection with their duties to
the Office of the Comptroller); and letter from Amadeo Saenz, Texas Department of
Transportation, dated February 22, 2011 (commenting that employees of the Texas
Department of Transportation that are appointed to the non-profit entity that issues bonds on
behalf of the Texas Transportation Commission should be excluded because they are
employees assuming a decision-making responsibility based on the duties of their
employment).
One commenter also stated that the Proposal is unclear, in the case of a non-profit entity
formed for the benefit of a municipal entity, whether employees of the municipal entity that
sit on the board of such non-profit would be excluded from the definition of “municipal
advisor” as “employees” of the municipal entity. See, e.g., letter from Angela I. Carmon,
City Attorney on behalf of North Carolina Municipal Leasing Corporation, dated February
22, 2011.
The term “municipal entity” means, in part, “any State, political subdivision of a State, or
corporate instrumentality.” See Rule 15Ba1-1(g). The Commission notes that such
employees would be “employees of a municipal entity,” and therefore excluded from the
definition of municipal advisor, to the extent the non-profit entity is itself a municipal entity
(e.g., if the non-profit entity is a corporate instrumentality of a State).

497

See, e.g., Pennsylvania Local Government Investment Trust Letter.

members should also be covered by the exclusion. 498 One commenter suggested that “employees
and board members of a municipal entity should be excluded [from the definition of municipal
advisor] to the extent they provide advice to an obligated person (and acting in the purview of their
duties).” 499
Many commenters also stated that boards of municipal entities are legally inseparable from
the municipal entity. 500 One commenter stated that if the governing body of a municipal entity, as a
whole, is not a part of the “municipal entity,” then any third party soliciting or providing advice to
the governing body with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities would not be subject to the registration requirements. 501
Additionally, some commenters asserted that the Proposal would restrict municipal entities
from soliciting advice from citizens, and would subject to the registration requirements members of
the general public submitting written comments or giving oral statements to the board of a
municipal entity. 502 Another commenter stated that the Proposal would require registration of a
former board member, if the Chairman of the current board contacts that former board member with
questions about a prior issuance. 503

After considering the comments, the Commission has determined to exempt from the
definition of municipal advisor, pursuant to its authority under Section 15B(a)(4), all members of a
municipal entity’s governing body, its advisory boards and its committees, as well as persons
serving in a similar official capacity with respect to the municipal entity, to the extent they are
acting within the scope of their official capacity, regardless of whether such members or officials
are employees of the municipal entity. Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii) exempts from the
definition of municipal advisor “[a]ny person serving as a member of a governing body, an advisory
board, or a committee of, or acting in a similar official capacity with respect to, or as an official of,
a municipal entity or obligated person 504 to the extent that such person is acting within the scope of
such person’s official capacity” 505 and “any employee of a municipal entity or obligated person to
the extent that such person is acting within the scope of such person’s employment.” 506
The Commission agrees with commenters that like employees, a municipal entity’s officials,
as well as members of a municipal entity’s governing body and other officials serving in a similar
capacity (including members of advisory boards and committees), whether or not employed by a
municipal entity, typically act on behalf of the municipal entity. The Commission also believes that
if a local government official or appointed board member of a municipal entity, in the scope of his
or her duties to that municipal entity, provides advice to another municipal entity, such advice
would not require the person to register as a municipal advisor because such person would be acting
within the scope of his or her duties to the municipal entity. Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii) also clarifies
the Commission’s interpretation of the statutory exclusion from the definition of “municipal

persons, and how this exemption addresses such comments, are separately discussed further

advisor” for employees of municipal entities by providing that such employees are exempt “to the
extent that such person is acting within the scope of such person’s employment.” 507 Consequently,
as described above with respect to governing board members and officials, an employee of one
municipal entity that provides advice, within the scope of his or her employment as such, to another
municipal entity or obligated person would be exempt from the definition of “municipal advisor.”
The exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii) would extend to all designees of public officials or
members of a municipal entity’s governing body, to the extent such designation is made pursuant to
existing rules of the municipal entity for designating or delegating authority. The Commission
believes that under such scenario, the designee would be serving “in a similar official capacity” 508
as the person for whom they are acting. Further, the Commission notes that the exemption from
registration includes members of advisory boards 509 and committees, 510 acting within the scope of
their capacity as such 511 because, as with respect to members of the governing body or other
507

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii).

509

Commenters provided some examples of advisory board composition and activities. See,
e.g., Combs Letter (describing that the “Comptroller’s Investment Advisory Board,” which
advises the state’s trust company which in turn manages state funds, is unlike an investment
adviser in that it doesn’t assist with the selection of specific investments or investment
professionals; that it provides general guidance but has no control over what purchases and
sales are made with state funds; and that although the board members have no fiduciary
duty, they also have no decision-making power); and letter from Gregg Abbott, State of
Texas, dated February 22, 2011 (“State of Texas Letter”) (noting that distinguishing
between governing boards and advisory boards is unworkable as some advisory boards are
subcommittees of governing boards, some are made up of a combination of governing board
members and other citizen volunteers, and some have no governing board members).

510

Some municipal entity boards also have committees that may or may not be comprised of
members of the board. See, e.g., letter from Jerome Cochrane, University of Pittsburgh,
dated February 22, 2011 (certain committees of the boards of certain Pennsylvania State
universities include “non-voting committee members, representing members of the public,
alumni, faculty, staff and student bodies”).

511

The Commission notes that the exemption for advisory board and committee members
includes volunteer members of such boards and committees.
139

government officials, when acting within the scope of their official capacity such persons are acting
on behalf of the municipal entity.
The Commission does not intend to impede the deliberative process that municipal entities
engage in with their citizens. Accordingly, the registration requirement for municipal advisors does
not apply to persons who comment on municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities by making use of public comment forums provided by municipal entities or other public
forums. Additionally, responding to factual questions about a past issuance by a former board
member would not constitute municipal advisory activities, because providing such information in
response to questions under such circumstances is factual and therefore does not constitute advice
with respect to such issuance. 512
The Commission agrees with commenters that individuals who engage in deliberative and
decision-making functions with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities as part of their duties as members of a governing body should not have to register as
municipal advisors. Such individuals represent the municipal entity that is the intended recipient of
the protections of the municipal advisor registration regime, and the Commission does not consider
such deliberative and decision-making functions to be advice. Additionally, board members and
other officials (appointed and elected alike, as well as their duly appointed designees) may be
subject to state and local law, including fiduciary duties and ethics laws, and the statutory
qualifications for such members’ board positions may be significant to the mission of the municipal
entity. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that imposing an additional layer of
regulation, including the fiduciary duty imposed upon municipal advisors, 513 would provide a

512

See supra Section III.A.1.b.1. (discussing the advice standard in general).

Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act (as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act) imposes a
fiduciary duty on municipal advisors when advising municipal entities. See Proposal, 76 FR

significant additional benefit. The Commission agrees with commenters that whether a public
official or other member of a governing body of a municipal entity is appointed or elected is not the
sole factor in determining whether such individual is accountable to the municipal entity he or she
serves. Board members, officials, and employees would be required to register, however, if they are
engaged by other municipal entities or obligated persons to provide services as compensated
advisors in addition to their normal duties as an employee, official, or board member of the
municipal entity. 514
For the reasons described above, the Commission finds it consistent with the public interest,
the protection of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act, to use its
authority pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(4) to exempt any person serving as a member of
a governing body, an advisory board, or a committee of, or acting in a similar official capacity with
respect to, or as an official of, a municipal entity to the extent that such person is acting within the
scope of such person’s official capacity. 515 Accordingly, such persons are not required to register as
municipal advisors.
Employees and Officials of Obligated Persons
Section 15B(e)(4) of the Exchange Act excludes from the definition of municipal advisor
persons who are employees of a municipal entity, but does not extend such exclusion to employees
of obligated persons. In the Proposal, the Commission asked whether employees of obligated
persons should be excluded, to the extent they are providing advice to the obligated person, acting
in its capacity as an obligated person, in connection with municipal financial products or the

issuance of municipal securities. 516 In addition, the Commission asked whether there are types of
persons, other than employees of obligated persons, who should be excluded from the definition of
municipal advisor. 517 In response, the Commission received several comments.
Some commenters stated that employees, officers, and directors of obligated persons should
be excluded from the definition of municipal advisor when they provide advice to the obligated
person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities. 518 More
specifically, some commenters stated that board members of obligated persons acting within the
scope of their duties do not give “advice” and that it is the obligation of board members to
communicate with fellow board members and staff. 519 For example, one commenter stated that
municipal advisors typically have multiple clients, hold themselves out as advisors, and generally
do not exercise decision making authority for the municipal entity or obligated person. 520 On the
other hand, according to this commenter, directors and employees of obligated persons act on behalf
of and in the interest of entities with which they are affiliated and do not hold themselves out as

governing non-profit entities, conflict of interest laws, ethics laws, and open meeting laws. 523
Commenters also made similar statements with respect to employees of obligated persons. 524
Further, some commenters stated that officers, directors, and employees of obligated persons are no
different from those of municipal entities, 525 and an obligated person can only act through its board
and employees. 526 One commenter suggested, however, that individual board members and
employees should not be exempt from registration if they are engaged to provide services for a
nonprofit organization as compensated advisors. 527

In April 2009, the MSRB issued a study titled “Unregulated Municipal Market Participants:
A Case for Reform,” in which the MSRB advocated for the regulation of intermediaries in
143

Frank Act, and the Proposal indicate that the term “municipal advisor” is meant to capture
professionals that offer advisory services in a financial marketplace. 529 One commenter stated that
for decades, in regulating the market for financial advice, Congress and the Commission have
expressly declined to regulate internal advice provided by employee to employer. 530 The
commenter stated that a departure from this established practice should not be inferred, absent a
clear indication from Congress, and nothing in the language or history of the Dodd-Frank Act
signals that Congress intended to affect a fundamental shift in policy. 531
Some commenters stated that the proposed rules would make it difficult for obligated
persons to recruit and retain board members and employees, 532 discourage officers and board

the municipal securities market (such as swap advisors and financial advisors). This study
was referenced by the Commission in the Proposal. See Proposal, 76 FR at 825, n.8.

members from engaging in matters that are traditionally within their purview, 533 and disrupt the
process of borrowing and operations of borrowers and issuers. 534 Other commenters stated that the
proposed rules could substantially increase the cost of financing 535 and could cause a potential
borrower to forego projects using the economic development options offered by states and avoid the
issuance of municipal bonds. 536
As discussed above, one commenter suggested that “employees and board members of a
municipal entity should be excluded from regulation to the extent they provide advice to an
obligated person (and acting in the purview of their duties).” 537 Likewise, employees and board
members of an obligated person should be excluded from regulation to the extent they provide
advice to a municipal entity. 538 On the other hand, another commenter stated that employees,
officers, and directors of an obligated person should be exempt to the extent they provide advice
solely to the obligated person and not to a municipal entity. 539 One other commenter stated that
when an obligated person solicits conduit issuers to issue bonds on behalf of the obligated person,
such solicitation should not require the obligated person or its board members or employees to
register as municipal advisors. 540

After considering the comments, the Commission agrees with commenters that board
members, officers, and employees of obligated persons should be treated in the same manner as
board members, officers, and employees of municipal entities and is using its statutory authority to
provide an exemption for such persons that is parallel to the exemption with respect to municipal
entities described above. 541 The Commission believes that this exemption is appropriate, because
such individuals, when acting in the scope of their duty to the obligated person, are accountable to
the obligated person. Further, board members, officers, and employees of obligated persons serve
similar functions as board members, officers, and employees of municipal entities. Consequently,
the Commission is exempting from the definition of municipal advisor any employee of an
obligated person acting within the scope of such person’s employment, as well as any person
serving as a member of a governing body, an advisory board, or a committee of, or acting in a
similar official capacity with respect to, or as an official of, an obligated person to the extent they
are acting within the scope of their duties. 542 The Commission believes that, like municipal entities,
obligated persons and persons who perform decision-making functions for, or otherwise act on
behalf of, obligated persons, when fulfilling their duty to the obligated person, are also the intended
beneficiaries of the protections afforded by the municipal advisor registration requirement. As with
respect to municipal entities, board members, officials, and employees of obligated persons would
be required to register, however, if they are engaged by other municipal entities or obligated persons

President of Finance, Treasury/Accounting and Chief Financial Officer, Orlando Health,

to provide services as compensated advisors in addition to their normal duties as an employee,
official, or board member of the obligated person. 543
For the reasons described above, the Commission finds it consistent with the public interest,
the protection of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act, to use its
authority pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(4) to exempt any: (1) person serving as a
member of a governing body, an advisory board, or a committee of, or acting in a similar official
capacity with respect to, or as an official of, an obligated person to the extent that such person is
acting within the scope of such person’s official capacity; and (2) employee of an obligated person
to the extent that such person is acting within the scope of such person’s employment. 544
Accordingly, such persons are not required to register as municipal advisors.
With regard to the application of the rules to employees or governing body members of an
obligated person who solicit conduit issuers to issue bonds on behalf of the obligated person, the
Commission notes that these persons are not acting as advisors. 545 Instead, they act as principals
seeking an issuance of municipal securities by a municipal entity on behalf of the obligated person
pursuant to an arm’s-length loan (or similar) agreement under which the obligated person will be
required to pay debt service and other costs upon bond issuance. The Commission notes that these
individuals would not be required to register as municipal advisors, because they are not advising a
municipal entity with respect to the issuance of municipal securities or soliciting a municipal entity

543

As described above, a local government official or appointed board member of a municipal
entity would not be required to register as a municipal advisor if he or she provides advice,
in the scope of his or her duties to that municipal entity employer, to another municipal
entity. See supra notes and 496 and 507 accompanying text. In contrast, if such a person is
engaged and compensated outside the scope of such duties, he or she would not be eligible
for the exemption and would be required to register.

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii).

See supra note 540 and accompanying text.
147

on behalf of a broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser
for the purpose of obtaining or retaining an engagement for such person. However, an employee,
governing board member or other official of an obligated person could still be deemed to be
engaged in municipal advisory activities (which include solicitation activities) if his or her
recommendations cannot be properly characterized as negotiations of the terms by which the
obligated person is agreeing to engage in the borrowing through the municipal entity. 546
Regardless of an individual’s title as a member of a governing body, an employee, or other
official (appointed or elected) of a municipal entity or obligated person, the Commission notes that
the exemptions described above do not apply to the extent such individual acts outside of the scope
of authority of his or her position. 547
ii. Responses to Requests for Proposals or Requests for
Qualifications
In the Proposal, the Commission requested comment about banks that respond to municipal
entities’ RFPs regarding investment products offered, such as money market mutual funds or other
exempt securities. 548 The Commission received a number of comments regarding responses to
RFPs or RFQs by banks and other entities. 549
Several commenters stated that responses to RFPs and RFQs should not require a person to

546

See supra Section III.A.b.i. (discussing the advice standard in general) and Section III.A.b.x.
(discussing solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person).

547

The exemption only applies “to the extent such person is acting within the scope of such
person’s official capacity” or “employment,” as applicable. See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii).

See also supra notes 421-423 and accompanying text (discussing RFPs and RFQs in the
context of the solicitation prong, including whether a market professional’s activities

professional as part of an RFP process constitute municipal advisory activities); and infra
Section III.A.1.c.vii. (discussing the treatment of responses by attorneys to RFPs from
municipal entities and obligated persons).
148

register as a municipal advisor. For example, one commenter suggested that, with respect to
municipal derivatives, responding to RFPs or RFQs from a municipal entity or obligated person
does not constitute “advice.” 550 Similarly, another commenter stated generally that certain activities
should be expressly excluded from the definition of “advice,” including responding to RFPs or
RFQs and providing terms on which a financial institution would be prepared to enter into a
transaction or purchase securities issued by a municipal entity. 551 This commenter also stated that
bid documents submitted in response to a municipal entity’s request for private financing proposals
should not constitute advice. 552 Another commenter concurred that responses to RFPs should not
be treated as advice. 553
The Commission has carefully considered the issues raised by commenters on the Proposal
and agrees that responses to RFPs or RFQs alone do not constitute municipal advisory activities. 554
Therefore, the Commission is adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(iv), which exempts from the definition
of municipal advisor “[a]ny person providing a response in writing or orally to a request for
proposals or qualifications from a municipal entity or obligated person for services in connection
with a municipal financial product or the issuance of municipal securities; provided however, that
such person does not receive separate direct or indirect compensation for advice provided as part of

a competitive basis, and many municipalities are required by statute to issue RFPs to banks

149

such response.” 555
Responses to RFPs or RFQs are provided at the request of, and established by, a municipal
entity or obligated person as part of a competitive process. Therefore, it is reasonable to believe
that the municipal entity or obligated person would understand that service providers respond to
RFPs and RFQs in order to obtain business and would not rely on such responses as it would on
advice from its advisor. Further, persons who respond to RFPs or RFQs are likely to be already
regulated entities, such as registered municipal advisors, brokers, dealers, or investment advisers.
Accordingly, their responses may be subject to fair dealing, suitability, or other standards.
Moreover, if a person is selected by a municipal entity or obligated person as a result of an RFP or
RFQ, such person could be required to register as a municipal advisor for its subsequent activities.
For the same reasons discussed above for other RFPs, the exemption pursuant to Rule
15Ba1-1(d)(3)(iv) also includes responses to so-called “mini-RFPs” that might only be distributed
to service providers that have been pre-screened or pre-qualified by the municipal entity or
obligated person. For the exemption to apply, a person providing advice in response to an RFP or
RFQ may not be separately compensated for advice given as part of the RFP or RFQ process.
Further, the compensation such person receives, if hired as a result of the RFP or RFQ, is not direct
or indirect compensation for the advice provided as part of the RFP or RFQ. However, assisting

555

The Commission notes that FINRA applies a similar approach in connection with the
application of its suitability rule to broker-dealers. See FINRA Rule 2111. In a recent
Regulatory Notice, FINRA explained that, where a registered representative makes a
recommendation to purchase a security to a potential investor, the suitability rule would
apply to the recommendation if that individual executes the transaction through the brokerdealer with which the registered representative is associated or the broker-dealer receives or
will receive, directly or indirectly, compensation as a result of the recommended
transaction. See FINRA Regulatory Notice 12-55. For purposes of the municipal advisor
registration rules, if a person is selected as a result of an RFP or RFQ, any applicable law or
rule (e.g., fair dealing, suitability, fiduciary duty) will apply to that person’s activities in the
role for which the person was selected.
150

with the preparation of an RFP or RFQ on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person, or
assisting in the selection of a broker-dealer, investment adviser, or financial advisor as part of an
RFP process, could constitute municipal advisory activity. Specifically, in assisting in the
preparation of an RFP or RFQ, a person could provide advice with respect to the parameters of such
RFP or RFQ, such as the potential use of municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities. Further, in assisting in the selection of a broker-dealer, investment adviser, or municipal
advisor as part of an RFP process, a person could provide advice with respect to the responses to the
RFP, including responses related to the use of municipal financial products or the issuance of
municipal securities. 556
For the foregoing reasons, the Commission finds it consistent with the public interest, the
protection of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act, to use its authority
pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(4) 557 to exempt persons responding to RFPs and RFQs
from the definition of municipal advisor, subject to the limitations described above.
iii. Municipal Entity or Obligated Person Represented by an
Independent Municipal Advisor
In the Proposal, the Commission sought comment on whether it should provide other

556

A person assisting a municipal entity or obligated person in selecting a broker-dealer,
investment adviser, or financial advisor as part of an RFP process established by the
municipal entity or obligated person would not, however, be considered to be undertaking a
solicitation for purposes of the definition of municipal advisor in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(1),
because such person would not be soliciting “on behalf of” such broker-dealer, investment
adviser, or financial advisor. See supra Section III.A.1.b.x. (discussing generally solicitation
of a municipal entity or obligated person). See also Rule 15Ba1-1(n) (defining solicitation
of a municipal entity or obligated person).

557

Pursuant to Section 15B of the Exchange Act, the Commission may exempt any class of
municipal advisors from any provision of Section 15B or the rules and regulations
thereunder, if it “finds that such exemption is consistent with the public interest, the
protection of investors, and the purpose of [Section 15B].” See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(4).
151

exclusions from the definition of municipal advisor. 558 Several commenters suggested that a person
providing advice with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities
should not be regulated as a municipal advisor if the municipal entity or obligated person is
otherwise represented by a municipal advisor with respect to the transaction. 559 One commenter
argued that the Commission should provide that a person will not be regulated as a municipal
advisor to a municipal entity or obligated person if such municipal entity or obligated person is or
will be represented by an “independent advisor” that is a registered municipal advisor (or that is
eligible for an exception) and any relevant documentation states that: (1) the person is not acting as
an “advisor;” and (2) the municipal entity or obligated person is not relying on any advisory
communications from such person. 560 According to another commenter, “when a municipality has
engaged an independent financial advisor in connection with a proposed transaction, unaffiliated
counterparties or potential counterparties to the transaction should not be deemed to be providing
advice to the municipality as it has already elected an entity to fulfill that role.” 561 Another
commenter stated that, in most cases where a bank is “providing a municipal derivative or other
bank products and services to a municipal entity or obligated person, a third party advisor is
providing advice on the transaction to the municipal entity or obligated person.” 562 This commenter
suggested that the existence of such a third party relationship should be viewed as evidence that the

municipal entity or obligated person is not relying on the bank for advice. 563
The Commission has carefully considered these comments and is adopting Rule 15Ba11(d)(3)(vi), which exempts from the municipal advisor definition any person engaging in municipal
advisory activities in a circumstance in which a municipal entity or obligated person is otherwise
represented by an independent registered municipal advisor with respect to the same aspects of a
municipal financial product or an issuance of municipal securities, provided that the following
requirements are met. 564 First, an independent registered municipal advisor must be providing
advice with respect to the same aspects of the municipal financial product or issuance of municipal
securities as the person seeking to rely on Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi). 565 For purposes of Rule 15Ba11(d)(3)(vi), the term “independent registered municipal advisor” means a municipal advisor
registered pursuant to Section 15B of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder
and that is not, and within at least the past two years was not, associated 566 with the person seeking
to rely on Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi). The Commission believes that a two year cooling-off period
represents an appropriate period of time to help remove any actual or perceived influence over a
municipal advisor’s ability to exercise independent judgment when engaging in municipal advisory
activities. 567 Second, a person seeking to rely on this exemption must receive from the municipal

564

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi).

565

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(A).

For purposes of the definition of “independent registered municipal advisor” in Rule 15Ba11(d)(3)(vi), the criteria for association set forth in Section 15B(e)(7) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(7))
will apply. See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(A).

567

A two-year period is also used to determine whether an individual is a “public
representative” for purposes of MSRB Board membership. Specifically, for purposes of
determining whether an individual is a public representative, the MSRB defined the term
“no material business relationship” to mean that, at a minimum, the individual is not and,
within the last two years, was not associated with a municipal securities broker, municipal
securities dealer, or municipal advisor, and that the individual does not have a relationship
153

entity or obligated person a representation in writing that it is represented by, and will rely on the
advice of, an independent registered municipal advisor, and such person has a reasonable basis for
relying on the representation. 568 Third, such person must provide the required disclosures to the
municipal entity or obligated person, and provide a copy of such disclosures to the municipal
entity’s or obligated person’s independent registered municipal advisor. With respect to a
municipal entity, such person must disclose in writing to the municipal entity that, by obtaining
such representation from the municipal entity, such person is not a municipal advisor and is not
subject to the fiduciary duty established in Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act with respect to
the municipal financial product or issuance of municipal securities. 569 With respect to an obligated
person, such person must disclose in writing to the obligated person that, by obtaining such
representation from the obligated person, such person is not a municipal advisor with respect to the
municipal financial product or issuance of municipal securities. 570 The rule also requires that each
such disclosure must be made at a time and in a manner reasonably designed to allow the municipal

with any municipal securities broker, municipal securities dealer, or municipal advisor,
whether compensatory or otherwise, that reasonably could affect the independent judgment
or decision making of the individual. See Securities Exchange Act Release No. 63025
(September 30, 2010), 75 FR 61806, 61808 (October 6, 2010) (SR-MSRB-2010-08).
Further, Rule 206(4)-5(a)(1) under the Investment Advisers Act prohibits investment
advisers from receiving compensation for providing advice to a “government entity” within
two years after a “contribution” to an “official” of the government entity has been made by
the investment adviser or by any of its “covered associates.” See 17 CFR 275.206(4)5(a)(1). In adopting this rule, the Commission stated that the two-year time out is intended
to discourage advisers from participating in pay-to-play practices by requiring a cooling off
period during which the effects of a political contribution on the selection process can be
expected to dissipate. See Political Contributions Final Rule, 75 FR at 41026.
568

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(B). The same standards and principles apply in determining
whether a person has a reasonable basis for reliance as discussed previously with respect to
reliance on representations regarding proceeds determinations. See supra notes 364-365 and
accompanying text.

entity or obligated person to assess the material incentives and conflicts of interest that such person
may have in connection with the municipal advisory activities. 571 The level and timing of
disclosure required may vary according to the issuer’s knowledge or experience. 572
The requirement that a copy of the disclosure be provided to the independent registered
municipal advisor is not intended to alter the nature of the duty owed by the municipal advisor to its
municipal entity or obligated person client or the nature of such municipal advisor’s engagement.
The Commission believes that exempting persons advising a municipal entity or obligated
person from the definition of municipal advisor when the municipal entity or obligated person is
represented by an independent registered municipal advisor is consistent with the public interest, the
protection of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act. The Commission
believes that Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi) will allow parties to a municipal securities transaction and
571

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(C)(3). The CFTC’s business conduct standards for swap
dealers and major swap participants contain similar standards for disclosure to
counterparties. Specifically, CFTC Rule 23.431(a) states that: “At a reasonably sufficient
time prior to entering into a swap, a swap dealer or major swap participant shall disclose to
any counterparty to the swap (other than a swap dealer, major swap participant, securitybased swap dealer, or major security-based swap participant) material information
concerning the swap in a manner reasonably designed to allow the counterparty to assess
[risks, characteristics, and conflicts of interest related to the swap.]” 17 CFR 23.431(a).

572

The Commission believes that some municipal advisors are already familiar with this
disclosure level and timing standard. See Interpretive Notice Concerning the Application of
MSRB Rule G-17 to Underwriters of Municipal Securities (August 2, 2012), available at
http://www.msrb.org/Rules-and-Interpretations/MSRB-Rules/General/Rule-G17.aspx?tab=2 (stating that “[t]he level of disclosure required may vary according to the
issuer’s knowledge or experience with the proposed financing structure or similar structures,
capability of evaluating the risks of the recommended financing, and financial ability to bear
the risks of the recommended financing, in each case based on the reasonable belief of the
underwriter”); MSRB Notice 2013-08 (March 25, 2013) MSRB Answers Frequently Asked
Questions (FAQS) Regarding an Underwriter’s Disclosure Obligations to State and Local
Government Issuer Under Rule G-17, available at http://www.msrb.org/Rules-andInterpretations/Regulatory-Notices/2013/2013-08.aspx (referencing the requirement under
the Interpretive Notice Concerning the Application of MSRB Rule G-17 that the arm’s

155

others who are not registered municipal advisors to share advice with municipal entities and
obligated persons so long as the municipal entity or obligated person is represented by an
independent registered municipal advisor. A municipal entity represented by an independent
registered municipal advisor will have the benefits associated with the regulation of municipal
advisors. Such benefits include, but are not limited to, standards of conduct, training, and testing
for municipal advisors that may be required by the Commission or the MSRB, other requirements
unique to municipal advisors that may be imposed by the MSRB, 573 and fiduciary duty. While
independent registered municipal advisors do not owe a fiduciary duty to obligated persons, the
Commission notes that they have a duty to deal fairly with obligated persons under MSRB Rule G17. 574 Also, as noted by commenters, the engagement by a municipal entity or obligated person of
an independent registered municipal advisor indicates that the municipal entity or obligated person
intends to rely on the advice of that advisor. Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi) requires that this intention be
further evidenced by a written representation that the municipal entity or obligated person will rely
on the advice of an independent registered municipal advisor. Further, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)
requires the person receiving such representation to have a reasonable basis for relying on the
representation.
So long as a municipal entity or obligated person is represented by and relies on an
independent registered municipal advisor, the Commission believes it is appropriate to allow
municipal entities and obligated persons to receive as much advice and information as possible from
a variety of sources, even if the providers of such advice are not subject to a fiduciary duty. The
Commission does not seek to curtail the receipt of important advice and information so long as the
municipal entities and obligated persons are represented by and rely on independent registered
573

See supra note 190.

574

See MSRB Rule G-17.
156

municipal advisors who are subject to a fiduciary or other duties and who can help the municipal
entities and obligated persons evaluate the advice and identify potential conflicts of interest.
Further, the requirement that a person seeking to rely on this rule provide a copy of the disclosures
under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(C) to the independent registered municipal advisor will help timely
inform the independent registered municipal advisor that the municipal entity or obligated person is
receiving advice from a person seeking to rely on Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi).
In addition, certain persons that may engage in municipal advisory activities could also be
counterparties to a municipal entity or obligated person, such as swap dealers and security-based
swap dealers. The requirement for such persons to register as municipal advisors could be
inconsistent with their roles as counterparties to the municipal entity or obligated person. While the
Commission is separately providing certain exemptions for counterparties of municipal entities and
obligated persons, 575 such persons may also consider whether they can rely on this exemption.
iv. Broker, Dealer, or Municipal Securities Dealer Serving as an
Underwriter
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(C) provides that the term “municipal advisor” does not
include a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer serving as an underwriter (as defined in
Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act) (the “underwriter exclusion”). 576 In the Proposal, the
Commission proposed to interpret this statutory underwriter exclusion to apply solely to a broker,
dealer, or municipal securities dealer serving as an underwriter in connection with the issuance of
municipal securities. 577 Further, the Commission proposed that this exclusion would not apply

575

See, e.g., infra Section III.A.1.c.vi. (discussing an exemption for swap dealers).

576

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(C).

577

See Proposal, 76 FR at 832 and proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii). See also Temporary
Registration Rule Release, 75 FR at 54467, note 19. In the Proposal, the Commission stated
its belief that Congress excluded from the definition of municipal advisor a broker, dealer,
or municipal securities dealer acting as an underwriter on behalf of a municipal entity or
157

when such persons are acting in a capacity other than as an underwriter, and that, for example, this
exclusion would not apply to advice with respect to the investment of bond proceeds or municipal
derivatives. 578
In the Proposal, the Commission requested comment on whether its interpretation of the
statutory exclusion from the definition of municipal advisor for a broker, dealer, or municipal
securities dealer serving as an underwriter was appropriate. 579 The Commission received
approximately 20 comment letters addressing the scope of this underwriter exclusion. Most
commenters suggested that this exclusion should cover broker-dealer activities already subject to
regulation, 580 and some commenters suggested that it should cover broker-dealer activities that are
solely incidental to underwriting an issuance of municipal securities. 581 By contrast, other
commenters supported a more limited scope for the underwriter exclusion, stating, for example, that
“[u]nless the Commission recognizes and implements in an appropriate manner the narrow
character of the underwriter definition referenced in the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission will be
diminishing otherwise important protections for municipal entities and obligated persons provided
obligated person in connection with the issuance of municipal securities because such
activity is already subject to MSRB rules. See Proposal, 76 FR at 832, note 107.

See, e.g., letter from JoAnn Bourne, Senior Executive Vice President, Global Treasury
Management, Union Bank, N.A., dated February 18, 2011 (“Union Bank Letter”) (stating
the belief that, while the Dodd-Frank Act only provided an exclusion for brokers and dealers
when they are serving as underwriters, Congress did not intend to impose an additional level
of regulation on broker-dealers when they are providing advice that is already subject to
regulation); SIFMA Letter I; and letter from Noreen Roche-Carter, Chair, Tax & Finance
Task Force, Large Public Power Council, dated February 22, 2011 (“Large Public Power
Council Letter”) (stating that “[b]y limiting that exemption to instances where the brokerdealer is acting as an underwriter, we are concerned this will limit the types of services
provided to our members by broker-dealers compared to what has traditionally been
provided to our members”).

in that Act.” 582 Another commenter suggested that the Commission clarify that an underwriter is
not permitted to provide “advice” with respect to the structure, timing, or terms of the bond issue it
seeks to purchase and distribute. 583
The Commission has carefully considered comments submitted about the underwriter
exclusion in the Proposal, as discussed further below, and is adopting its proposed interpretation of
the statutory underwriter exclusion, with modifications and clarifications designed to address
commenters’ concerns. Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(i) provides that the term “municipal
advisor” shall not include a “broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer serving as an underwriter
of a particular issuance of municipal securities to the extent that the broker, dealer, or municipal
securities dealer engages in activities that are within the scope of an underwriting of such issuance
of municipal securities.”
Under the Commission’s modified interpretation of the underwriter exclusion, if a broker,
dealer, or municipal securities dealer is serving as an underwriter of a particular issuance of
municipal securities, the underwriter exclusion would include advice provided by that underwriter
within the scope of underwriting and would generally include advice with respect to the structure,
timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning that issuance of municipal securities.
It is important to note that the following advice would be outside the scope of an
underwriting for purposes of this exclusion: (1) advice on investment strategies; (2) advice on
municipal derivatives; and (3) advice otherwise identified by the Commission to be outside the
scope of an underwriting. 584 Such advice generally is not within the scope of serving as an

underwriter on an issuance of municipal securities and can raise issues that implicate the policy
objectives of municipal advisor registration. For example, municipal entities suffered significant
losses in the financial crisis related to advice on complex municipal derivatives, 585 and advice on
investments, 586 such as refunding escrow investments provided by underwriters 587 and investments
involving fraud in investment bidding procedures, 588 has been the subject of significant enforcement
activity. In other circumstances, such advice may create conflicts of interest for an underwriter,
such as when the advice addresses whether to issue debt or whether to conduct a competitive sale
instead of a negotiated underwriting. In addition, as discussed further below, the underwriter
exclusion does not include all activities that may be solely incidental to an underwriting, such as
advice on investment strategies or advice on municipal derivatives, because these activities are not
within the scope of an underwriting and are activities for which municipal entities and obligated
persons require the protections afforded by municipal advisors.
Although, as noted above, “issuance of municipal securities” should be construed broadly, 589
the Commission believes that, in order for a person to be “serving as an underwriter” 590 with respect
to an issuance of municipal securities, there must be a relationship to a particular transaction. 591 For

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(i).

See, e.g., In re Laser Arms Corp. Sec. Litig., 794 F.Supp. 475, 484 (S.D.N.Y. 1989) (citing
L. LOSS, THE FUNDAMENTALS OF SECURITIES REGULATION 278 (1983)). As set
forth in Section 2(11) of the Securities Act, the definition of a statutory underwriter turns on
the relationship of the party and the offering. Professor Loss has observed that “[t]he term
‘underwriter’ is defined not with reference to the particular person’s general business but on
the basis of his relationship to the particular offering.”
160

example, a contractual engagement by a municipal entity of a broker-dealer to serve as underwriter
on a specific planned transaction for the issuance of municipal securities would constitute the
requisite engagement on a particular issuance of municipal securities. By contrast, an engagement
by a municipal entity of a broker-dealer to serve as underwriter for some period of time or to serve
as a member of an underwriting “pool” without specifying the broker-dealer’s assignment expressly
to serve as underwriter on one or more particular planned transactions would not constitute serving
as an underwriter on a particular issuance of municipal securities. Further, an underwriter providing
advice with respect to related transactions or tranches on which it is not engaged would be acting
within the scope of the underwriter exclusion only if such advice is also related to the tranche or
transaction on which the underwriter is engaged. For example, an underwriter may give advice
about the timing of a sale of a related transaction on which it is not engaged by noting that shifting
the timing of such sale will have a positive impact on market demand for the transaction on which it
is engaged. Such advice would fall within the underwriter exclusion because such advice concerns
the timing of the particular issuance of municipal securities for which it is acting as underwriter and
is not regarded by the Commission as being outside the scope of an underwriting.
The Commission recognizes, however, that a municipal entity issuer may wish to request
advice on an issuance of municipal securities from a broker-dealer serving as a member of its
underwriting “pool” that does not yet have a specific assignment or from a broker-dealer engaged
on related transactions or tranches. In such circumstances, the broker-dealer could respond within
the requirements of one of the other exemptions of general applicability discussed above. For
example, if the municipal entity issuer was seeking the advice in response to a “mini-RFP” sent to
members of the underwriting pool, the broker-dealer could respond and provide advice within the

161

limitations of the exemption for responses to RFPs and RFQs. 592 In addition, if the municipal entity
is represented by an independent registered municipal advisor with respect to such issuance of
municipal securities, the broker-dealer could respond and provide advice if the requirements of the
exemption available when a municipal entity is otherwise represented by an independent registered
municipal advisor with respect to the same aspects of the issuance of municipal securities were
satisfied. 593 Finally, depending on the nature of the requested information and the response, it
might be considered a communication or effort to win business that is not municipal advisory
activity. 594
In response to commenters that suggested that underwriters should not be permitted to
provide “advice” with respect to the structure, timing and terms of the bond issue it seeks to
purchase and distribute, 595 the Commission points out that, subsequent to the Proposal, the MSRB
provided additional interpretive guidance under MSRB Rule G-17, which requires that brokers,
dealers, and municipal securities dealers acting as underwriters make certain disclosures to
municipal issuers about the roles of underwriters in negotiated sales of municipal securities,
including disclosures about their duty of fair dealing with a municipal issuer (but not a fiduciary
duty to a municipal issuer) and their actual or potential, material conflicts of interest. The
Commission continues to believe that allowing underwriters to give advice within the scope of an
underwriting with respect to the structure, timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning an
issuance is consistent with the aim of improving the quality of advice that municipal entities and
obligated persons receive, because these Rule G-17 disclosure requirements should assist them in

162

clarifying the duties of underwriters to municipal issuers, identifying conflicts of interest, and
appropriately evaluating the advice they receive from underwriters with that informed
perspective. 596
The Commission continues to believe that a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer
engaging in municipal advisory activities outside the scope of underwriting a particular issuance of
municipal securities should be subject to municipal advisor registration, absent the availability of
another exemption or exclusion. With respect to the treatment of advice on municipal derivatives as
outside the underwriter exclusion, the Commission notes that one purpose of the municipal advisor
provision in the Dodd-Frank Act was to address concerns about advice to municipalities on
complex municipal derivatives in which municipalities suffered significant losses in the financial
crisis. 597
Several commenters requested additional guidance from the Commission regarding the
types of activities that would fall within the Commission’s interpretation of the statutory
underwriter exclusion for activity within the scope of an underwriting of an issuance of municipal
securities. For example, one commenter stated that the exclusion should clearly extend to a full
range of activities “closely related” to the underwriting. 598 Another commenter asserted that certain
596

See MSRB Notice 2012-25 (May 7, 2012) (Securities and Exchange Commission Approves
Interpretive Notice on the Duties of Underwriters to State and Local Government Issuers).
In response to comments on this Rule G-17 interpretive guidance, the MSRB also indicated
that it would continue to study whether to impose a suitability standard on the types of
financial products (including types of bond structures) that may be sold to municipal
entities. See letter from Margaret Henry, General Counsel, Market Regulation, MSRB,
dated February 13, 2012, available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/sr-msrb-201109/msrb201109-24.pdf.

597

See S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 38 (2010).

598

See SIFMA Letter I. This commenter recommended that covered activities for the
underwriter exclusion should include: (1) advice regarding the issuance of municipal
securities, municipal financial products, or any other securities in the context of an
underwriting; (2) advice on the advisability of a municipal derivative (including entering
163

municipal advisory activities and, in particular, certain “transaction-related services” provided by
underwriters are integral to fulfilling the function of an underwriter in a professional manner but did
not specify which activities were integral. 599 A few commenters stated that the Proposal did not
provide sufficient guidance regarding the scope of the underwriter exclusion and requested further
clarification. 600
Set forth below are non-exclusive examples of activities that the Commission considers to
be within or outside the scope of the underwriter exclusion to the municipal advisor definition,

an underwriting; (3) advice in the capacity of a member of the municipal entity or obligated
person’s underwriting pool, even if not in the context of a particular deal, or other services
after the closing of an issuance of municipal securities but which relate to the issuance for
which the underwriter acted as an underwriter; (4) communications and analyses that are
part of an effort or presentation to obtain business from the municipal entity or obligated
person, or otherwise part of seeking to serve as an underwriter on future transactions; (5)
assistance on related transactions and related tranches of the offering; and (6) service as a
dealer-manager on a related tender or exchange offer for outstanding securities.

See letter from Alan Polsky, Chair, MSRB, dated November 9, 2011 (“MSRB Letter II”)

some may be appropriately performed by a broker-dealer as part of an underwriting). See
also letter from Robert K. Dalton, Vice Chairman, George K. Baum & Company, dated
December 20, 2011 (the “Baum Letter”) (noting that in the text of their November 9, 2011
letter the MSRB noted that not only transaction-related services are integral to an
underwriting). But see NAIPFA Letter and letter from Colette Irwin-Knott, President,
NAIPFA, dated November 30, 2011 (“NAIPFA Letter II”) (stating its belief that certain of
such transaction-related services listed in the MSRB’s letter are not so “integrally related” to
an underwriter’s duties to warrant exclusion from regulation as a municipal advisor).

600

See, e.g., letter from Robert J. Stracks, Counsel, BMO Capital Markets GKST Inc., dated
February 22, 2011 (“BMO Capital Markets Letter”) (stating that the Commission has made
no attempt to clarify the myriad of confusing issues it has raised with respect to the
exclusion for underwriters); Joy Howard WM Financial Strategies Letter (stating that “it is
unclear what trigger event would create an underwriting relationship as opposed to a
municipal advisory relationship”); Bond Dealers of America Letter (noting that the
underwriter exclusion is not clearly defined).
164

The Commission agrees with those commenters 601 that stated that it is not possible to
provide an exhaustive list of all activities that would be considered to be within the scope of an
underwriting. As a general matter, the Commission considers activities that are integral to the
purchase and distribution of a particular issuance of municipal securities on which a broker, dealer,
or municipal securities dealer is engaged to serve in the capacity as underwriter to be within the
scope of the underwriter exclusion. The Commission also considers activities that are integral to
fulfilling the role of an underwriter, such as the obligations of underwriters under the antifraud
provisions of the federal securities laws and obligations of underwriters under MSRB rules, to be
within the scope of an underwriting. 602
The Commission considers the following activities, identified by commenters, 603 to be
within the scope of the underwriting exclusion: 604 (1) advice regarding the structure, timing, terms,
and other similar matters concerning a particular issuance of municipal securities (except as
otherwise provided herein with respect to advice on investment strategies, municipal derivatives, or
other activities identified by the Commission as outside the scope of an underwriting); (2)
preparation of rating strategies and presentations related to the issuance being underwritten; (3)
preparations for and assistance with investor “road shows” and investor discussions related to the
issuance being underwritten; (4) advice regarding retail order periods and institutional marketing if

165

the municipal entity has determined to engage in a negotiated sale; (5) assistance in the preparation
of the preliminary and final official statements for the municipal securities; (6) assistance with the
closing of the issuance of municipal securities, including negotiation and discussion with respect to
all documents, certificates, and opinions needed for such closing; (7) coordination with respect to
obtaining CUSIP numbers and the registration of the issue of municipal securities with the bookentry only system of the Depository Trust Company; (8) preparation of post-sale reports for such
municipal securities; and (9) structuring of refunding escrow cash flow requirements necessary to
provide for the refunding and defeasance of an issue of municipal securities (provided, however,
that the recommendation of and brokerage of particular municipal escrow investments is outside the
scope of the underwriting exclusion).
Examples of Activities Outside the Scope of Serving as an Underwriter of a Particular Issuance of
Municipal Securities for Purposes of the Underwriter Exclusion
Several commenters 605 also requested clarification as to whether certain strategic,
transaction-related, and post-issuance activities would be considered acting within the scope of the
underwriter exclusion. The Commission notes that an underwriter providing certain advice outside
the scope of the underwriter exclusion would not be required to be registered as a municipal advisor
in order to provide that advice if: (a) the advice does not relate to a municipal financial product 606
or the issuance of municipal securities, 607 (b) the advice is given in response to a request for
proposal 608 or is otherwise permitted when seeking to obtain business, 609 or (c) the advice is given

when the municipal entity has engaged an independent registered municipal advisor. 610
The Commission considers the following activities, identified by commenters, 611 to be
outside the scope of the underwriter exclusion: 612 (1) advice on investment strategies; (2) advice on
municipal derivatives (including derivative valuation services); (3) advice on what method of sale
(competitive sale 613 or negotiated sale 614) a municipal entity should use for an issuance of municipal
securities; (4) advice on whether a governing body of a municipal entity or obligated person should
approve or authorize an issuance of municipal securities; (5) advice on a bond election campaign;
(6) advice that is not specific to a particular issuance of municipal securities on which a person is
serving as underwriter and that involves analysis or strategic services with respect to overall
financing options, debt capacity constraints, debt portfolio impacts, analysis of effects of debt or
expenditures under various economic assumptions, or other impacts of funding or financing capital
projects or working capital; (7) assisting issuers with competitive sales, including bid verification,

See supra Section III.A.1.c.iii. (discussing the exemption when the municipal entity or
obligated person is represented by an independent municipal advisor).

611

See, e.g., MSRB Letter II; NAIPFA Letter; NAIPFA Letter II; SIFMA Letter I; and Baum
Letter.

612

For broker-dealers serving as underwriters for a particular issuance of municipal securities,
these activities would not be excluded from the definition of municipal advisor because they
are not within the scope of an underwriting of such issuance of municipal securities. This
list of activities includes examples of activities that the Commission considers to be outside
the scope of the underwriter exclusion; the list does not purport to cover all possible
activities not qualifying for the underwriter exclusion.

613

Competitive sale is a method of sale chosen by an issuer, requesting underwriters to submit
a firm offer to purchase a new issue of municipal securities. The issuer awards the
municipal securities to the “winning” underwriter or syndicate presenting a bid complying
with the terms of a Notice of Sale that provides the lowest interest rate cost according to
stipulated criteria set forth in the Notice of Sale. See definition of “Competitive Sale” in
MSRB Glossary.

614

Negotiated sale is the sale of a new issue of municipal securities by an issuer directly to an
underwriter or underwriting syndicate selected by the issuer. See definition of “Negotiated
Sale” in MSRB Glossary.
167

true interest cost (TIC) calculations and reconciliations, verifications of bidding platform
calculations, and preparation of notices of sale; (8) preparation of financial feasibility analyses with
respect to new projects; (9) budget planning and analyses and budget implementation issues with
respect to debt issuance and collateral budgetary impacts; (10) advice on an overall rating strategy
that is not related to a particular issuance of municipal securities on which a person is serving as an
underwriter, including advice and actions taken on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person
between financing transactions; (11) advice on overall financial controls that are not related to a
particular issuance of municipal securities on which a person is serving as an underwriter; or (12)
advice regarding the terms of requests for proposals or requests for qualification for the selection of
underwriters or other professionals for a project financing and advice regarding review of responses
to such requests, including matters regarding compensation of such underwriters or other
professionals.
The Commission believes the above-listed activities are not within the scope of the
underwriter exclusion because the activities are either not specific to a particular issuance of
municipal securities for which a broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer could be serving as an
underwriter or the activities are not integral to fulfilling the role of an underwriter.
Communications or Efforts to Win Business
A few commenters asked whether communications and analyses that are part of an effort to
win business would be considered municipal advisory activity. 615 The Commission notes that not
all communications with a municipal entity or obligated person constitute municipal advisory

615

See SIFMA Letter I. See also letter from Nathan R. Howard, Esq., Municipal Advisor, WM
Financial Strategies, dated February 22, 2011 (“Nathan R. Howard WM Financial Strategies
Letter”) (stating that when the services provided by a broker-dealer are merely informational
non-municipal advisory services, the broker-dealer should be excluded from the definition
of municipal advisor).
168

activities. If the person has identified himself or herself as seeking to obtain business, such as
serving as an underwriter on future transactions, whether such communications and analyses
constitute municipal advisory activities or the provision of general information (as discussed further
above 616) will depend on the specific facts and circumstances. For example, pursuant to the
Commission’s interpretation of the treatment of the provision of general information, the
Commission believes that a broker-dealer who provides information to a municipal entity regarding
its underwriting capabilities and experience or general market or financial information that might
indicate favorable conditions to issue or refinance debt likely would not be treated as engaging in
municipal advisory activity.
On the other hand, for purposes of this rule and in response to comments, 617 the Commission
does not consider advice rendered by a broker-dealer in its capacity as a member of an
“underwriting pool” for a municipal entity or obligated person (and in the absence of a designation
of that broker-dealer to serve as underwriter on the particular issuance of municipal securities on
which the advice is given) to be advice within the scope of the underwriting exclusion. An
underwriting pool generally includes a group of underwriters selected by a municipal entity
pursuant to an RFP or other process 618 from which the municipal entity may select one or more
firms to underwrite a specific transaction. As noted above, a broker-dealer that is merely a part of
an underwriting pool is not engaged to underwrite any particular issuance, and therefore, is not
acting as an underwriter. As described above, however, depending on the particular facts and
circumstances, the broker-dealer’s activities as part of an underwriting pool may be within the

616

See supra Section III.A.1.b.i. (discussing, among other things, the provision of general
information).

169

requirements of one of the exemptions of general applicability, 619 may be considered to be an effort
to obtain underwriting business on its own behalf, or may be otherwise exempt, which would not
require municipal advisor registration.
Post-Offering Services
Commenters asked whether post-offering work performed by an underwriter would qualify
for the underwriter exclusion or whether it would constitute municipal advisory activity requiring
registration. 620 For purposes of this rule, the Commission considers post-offering work performed
by an underwriter to be municipal advisory activity unless it is a request for information or services
that would have been provided as part of the underwriting (such as resending cash flow and other
similar information related to the offering) or is required for an underwriter to fulfill its regulatory
obligations as underwriter. 621 If an issuance has closed and the underwriting period 622 has
terminated, the broker-dealer cannot be considered to be acting as an underwriter with respect to the
issuance of municipal securities. Therefore, any advice or recommendation with respect to the
issuance of municipal securities or a municipal financial product given after the termination of the
underwriting period generally would be municipal advisory activities. Accordingly, broker-dealers
should consider whether particular post-offering work they provide would constitute advice with
respect to the issuance of municipal securities or a municipal financial product.
The Commission notes that assisting a municipal entity or obligated person with filing

For purposes of MSRB rules and Exchange Act Rule 15c2-12, the underwriting period is the
period in connection with a primary offering of municipal securities ending on the later of
the closing of the underwriting or the sale of the last of the securities by the syndicate. See
definition of “Underwriting Period” in MSRB Glossary.
170

annual financial information, audited financial statements, or material event notices, as required by
Rule 15c2-12, 623 after an issuance has closed and after the underwriting period has terminated,
would generally be outside the scope of the underwriting exclusion. A determination as to whether
or not these activities would constitute advice would be based on all the facts and circumstances. 624
Broker-Dealers Acting as Placement Agents, Dealer-Managers, and Remarketing Agents
A few commenters emphasized the similarity between private placement agents and
underwriters, and suggested that private placement agents should be included in the underwriter
exclusion. 625 One commenter stated that a private placement agent offering securities of a
municipal entity or obligated person in a private placement under the Securities Act, even if the
agent is not serving as an underwriter within the strict meaning of Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities
Act, serves almost exactly the same role underwriters play in assisting issuers. 626 This commenter
also noted that “[a]ny uncertainty with respect to a private placement agent’s role can be adequately
clarified to municipal issuers or obligors through mandatory disclosures.” 627
The Commission believes that any registered broker-dealer who participates in a particular
issuance of municipal securities, whether the broker-dealer is acting as agent (such as in a bestefforts offering) or is acting as principal (such as in a firm commitment offering) would not have to
register as a municipal advisor if facts and circumstances indicate that the registered broker-dealer
is performing municipal advisory activities that otherwise would be considered within the scope of

623

the underwriting of a particular issuance of municipal securities as discussed above. 628 Registered
broker-dealers are subject to regulation under the Exchange Act, regardless of whether they act as
principal or agent in a municipal securities offering. The Commission does not believe that the
underwriter exclusion should be limited to a particular type of underwriting or particular type of
offering. 629 Therefore, if a registered broker-dealer, acting as a placement agent, performs
municipal advisory activities that otherwise would be considered within the scope of the
underwriting of a particular issuance of municipal securities as discussed above, the broker-dealer
would not have to register as a municipal advisor.
In addition, the Commission has determined that a broker-dealer acting as a dealer-manager
for a tender offer, without more, 630 would not be municipal advisory activity because tender offers
typically involve only the purchase of municipal securities and the purchase is not itself an advisory
activity. Similarly, a broker-dealer acting as a dealer-manager for an exchange offer would
generally involve only two transactions – the purchase of one security in the tender offer and the
underwriting of a particular issuance of municipal securities in exchange for such tendered

628

A registered broker-dealer acting as a placement agent in the issuance of non-municipal
securities, however, would not be able to rely on the underwriter exclusion and, based on the
facts and circumstances, might be engaged in solicitation activity. See supra note 462 and
accompanying text (discussing when a placement agent for an investment adviser to a
pooled-investment vehicle would be considered a third-party solicitor that falls within the
definition of municipal advisor). In addition, a placement agent may have other duties,
including a fiduciary duty to its client, that arise as a matter of common law or another
statutory or regulatory regime.

629

Whether or not a particular offering would be a distribution for purposes of Section 2(a)(11)
of the Securities Act is a facts and circumstances determination. Whether there is a
“distribution” does not affect the role of a registered broker-dealer in a municipal securities
offering for purposes of this underwriter exclusion.

630

However, if, for example, the registered broker-dealer provides advice as to the benefits of a
tender offer in comparison to the alternative of issuing refunding bonds, then, depending on
the facts and circumstances, they might be engaged in municipal advisory activity outside
the scope of an underwriting.
172

securities. Since the purchase itself is not advisory activity and the underwriting of the new issue of
municipal securities would be excluded under the underwriter exclusion, neither component of the
exchange offer would be considered municipal advisory activity. 631
A few commenters also suggested that remarketing agents should be included in the
underwriter exclusion. 632 Generally, the Commission also would not consider a remarketing
agent 633 acting only in its capacity as a remarketing agent to be a municipal advisor because the
mere remarketing of bonds likely would not constitute an issuance of municipal securities. If,
however, the remarketing constitutes a primary offering, 634 then the remarketing agent would need

631

Any advice or recommendations to undertake such a tender or exchange offer, or regarding
the timing or terms of such tender or exchange offer, would have to be evaluated in the
context of that issuance or the issuance of other securities to determine if the advice was
advice with respect to the structure, timing, terms, or other similar matters concerning an
issuance being underwritten, and thus within the underwriter exclusion.

632

See SIFMA Letter I (stating that activities in which a remarketing agent engages when it
resells an issuance in the secondary market are similar to those of an underwriter of a
primary issuance by a municipal entity or obligated person); Chapman & Cutler Letter
(concurring with SIFMA that the duties of remarketing agents with respect to the sale and
pricing of municipal securities are similar to the duties of underwriters).

633

A remarketing agent is a municipal securities dealer responsible for reselling to investors
securities (such as variable rate demand obligations and other tender option bonds) that have
been tendered for purchase by their owner. The remarketing agent also typically is
responsible for resetting the interest rate for a variable rate issue and may act as tender
agent. See definition of “Remarketing Agent” in MSRB Glossary.

634

Whether a remarketing is a “primary offering” of the municipal securities and whether the
remarketing agent is an underwriter for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933 will depend
on, among other matters, the level of issuer involvement in the remarketing. Whether a
particular remarketing is a primary offering by the issuer of the securities requires an
evaluation of relevant provisions of the governing documents, the relationship of the issuer
to the other parties involved in the remarketing transaction, and other facts and
circumstances pertaining to such remarketing, particularly with respect to the extent of
issuer involvement. See, e.g., Securities Exchange Act Release No. 62184A (May 27,
2010), 75 FR 33100, 33103 (June 10, 2010). Although not applicable in determining
whether an offering is a primary offering for purposes of the Securities Act of 1933, the
Commission also notes that for purposes of Rule 15c2-12, a “primary offering” is defined to
mean “an offering of municipal securities directly or indirectly by or on behalf of an issuer
of such securities, including any remarketing of municipal securities” that meets certain
173

to evaluate its activities to determine if an exemption or exclusion from registration (such as the
underwriter exclusion) applies. A primary offering is an issuance of municipal securities for
purposes of the municipal advisor registration regime. 635 Similarly, if the activities of a remarketing
agent include providing advice (such as advice with respect to the investment of proceeds) beyond
merely determining a remarketing price for bonds that have already been issued and that are not
being reoffered, the remarketing agent would need to evaluate its activities to determine if an
exception to registration (such as the investment adviser exclusion) applies.
Solely Incidental Services
Many commenters recommended that the municipal advisor registration rules include an
exclusion for broker-dealers that is similar in scope to the broker-dealer exclusion under Section
202(a)(11)(C) of the Investment Advisers Act. 636 Specifically, these commenters stated that the
Commission should exclude from registration broker-dealers that provide advice that is solely
incidental to a transaction. 637 These commenters generally noted that broker-dealers are already

specified conditions. See 17 CFR 240.15c2-12(f)(7). See also Securities Exchange Act
Release No. 34961 (November 10, 1994), 59 FR 59590 (November 17, 1994).
635

See supra Section III.A.1.b.vii. (discussing the term “issuance of municipal securities”).
The Commission notes that, although it is likely in such a circumstance for the underwriter
exemption to apply, if the agent is engaging in municipal advisory activity that is outside of
the scope of underwriting activity and no other exemption or exclusion applies, such agent
would be required to register as a municipal advisor.

636

Section 202(a)(11)(C) of the Investment Advisers Act excludes from the definition of
“investment adviser” a broker or dealer “whose performance of [advisory] services is solely
incidental to the conduct of his business as a broker or dealer who receives no special
compensation therefor.” 15 U.S.C. 80b-2(a)(11)(C).

637

See, e.g., Union Bank Letter (stating that advice supplied that is “solely incidental to the
conduct of his business as a broker or dealer and who receives no special compensation
therefor” (Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act) should be excluded from the
definition of “advice”); SIFMA Letter I (stating that “broker-dealers providing advice that is
solely incidental to a transaction should be excluded from the definition of municipal
advisor for the same reason that registered investment advisers are excluded (in some
instances): they are already regulated”); Financial Services Institute Letter (stating that
174

regulated by the Commission and should not be subject to additional or duplicative regulation. 638
The Commission is not adopting an exemption from the definition of municipal advisor for a
broker-dealer that engages in municipal advisory activities that are solely incidental to the conduct
of its business as a broker-dealer because the Commission believes that it has otherwise addressed
commenters’ concerns regarding duplicative regulation. As discussed above, the Commission is
exempting from the definition of municipal advisor persons that provide advice with respect to
investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal
securities and the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments. 639 As
discussed below, based on the application of the adopted rules, broker-dealers that sell securities to
municipal entities and obligated persons would generally not be engaging in municipal advisory
activity. 640 The application of the adopted rules limits the range of municipal financial products to
which duplicative regulation could apply. As noted above, the Commission believes that registered
broker-dealers that engage in municipal advisory activities by advising on the investment of
proceeds of municipal securities or municipal escrow investments should not be exempt from
municipal advisor registration. 641

broker-dealers should be treated as in the Investment Advisers Act, i.e., where a municipal
entity enters into an ordinary brokerage transaction, any incidental advice provided in the
scope of that relationship should not require the broker-dealer to register as a municipal
advisor).
638

See, e.g., Union Bank Letter (stating that Congress did not intend for broker-dealers and
registered investment advisers that already engage in regulated activities for their municipal
clients to be subject to the additional layer of regulation that would accompany municipal
advisor registration); ICI Letter (noting that broker-dealers that are underwriters are already
subject to MSRB Rule G-37 and are also regulated by the Commission as broker-dealers);

Broker-Dealers Selling Securities to Municipal Entities and Obligated Persons
Several commenters suggested that, based on the Proposal, the Commission appears to
conclude that “a broker-dealer that sells a security to a municipal entity where it is not serving as an
underwriter” is engaged in municipal advisory activity, because advice is integral to the sale of
securities. 642 That is not the conclusion of the Commission. The municipal advisor registration
requirement does not apply in the absence of advice (or solicitation). As noted above, for purposes
of the municipal advisor definition, “advice” includes, without limitation, a recommendation that is
particularized to the needs and circumstances of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect
to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, based on all the facts and
circumstances. 643 Thus, a broker-dealer that effects a transaction that it has not recommended will
not be a “municipal advisor” with respect to such activity. 644 However, the sale of a security to a

advisor registration notwithstanding the existence of other regulatory regimes). See also
infra Section III.A.1.c.v. (discussing, among other things, the Commission’s position that
registered investment advisers engaging in municipal advisory activities are only excluded
from registration to the extent their activities are investment advice). Likewise, the
Commission believes that broker-dealers that engage in municipal advisory activities that
are outside of the scope of the underwriting of a particular issuance of municipal securities
should be regulated and registered as municipal advisors.
642

See Insurance Companies Letter (stating that the Commission appears to conclude that every
time a broker-dealer sells a security to a municipal entity where it is not serving as an
underwriter, it must register as a municipal advisor, and that such an approach seems
inconsistent with Congressional intent due to pre-existing broker-dealer regulation). See
also ICI Letter (stating that the Commission proposed that the broker-dealer exclusion
means that a broker, dealer or municipal securities dealer would be eligible for the exclusion
only when acting in its capacity as an underwriter; and suggesting that the broker-dealer
exclusion should include brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers who engage in
additional activities while serving as underwriters to municipal entities or obligated
persons); and Large Public Power Council Letter (expressing concern that the Commission
is limiting the broker-dealer exemption to situations in which the broker-dealer is acting as
an underwriter).

See supra Section III.A.1.b.i. (discussing the advice standard in general).

See supra note 162 (discussing the term “advice” in contexts outside of the municipal
advisor definition).
176

municipal entity or obligated person constitutes a municipal advisory activity if: (1) the monies
used to purchase such security are proceeds of municipal securities; 645 and (2) in executing such
transaction, the broker-dealer also recommends the investment or otherwise offers advice to the
municipal entity or obligated person about which securities to purchase or sell.
Another commenter urged the Commission to exclude broker-dealers affiliated with life
insurance companies from municipal advisor registration, because such “limited service” brokerdealers are substantively different from “full service” broker-dealers. 646 The Commission notes that
broker-dealers affiliated with insurance companies are only required to register as municipal
advisors to the extent their activities constitute advice to (or solicitation of) a municipal entity or
obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities. The mere fact that a broker-dealer is affiliated with a life insurance company and may
not sell as wide a range of securities as other broker-dealers is not determinative as to whether such
broker-dealer must register as a municipal advisor. As noted in the paragraph above, such brokerdealers may sell securities to a municipal entity without triggering municipal advisor registration.
Broker-Dealers Providing Advice to Individual Plan Participants in a Public Employee Benefit Plan
One commenter expressed concern that broker-dealers that provide investment advice (such
as asset allocation) to individual plan participants in the context of a 403(b) retirement plan or a
similar defined contribution plan might trigger municipal advisor registration. This commenter
recommended that such broker-dealers be specifically excluded from registration. 647

645

See supra notes 330-343 and accompanying text (discussing the definition of “proceeds of
municipal securities”).

646

See ACLI Letter (stating that the range of products offered by these limited purpose brokerdealers is typically narrow and focuses upon the distribution of variable insurance contracts
and mutual funds; and that such broker-dealers primarily elicit orders from variable contract
and mutual fund purchasers).

647

See letter from Adym W. Rygmyr, Associate General Counsel, TIAA-CREF Individual &
177

The definition of municipal advisor states that a municipal advisor is a person that provides
advice “to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person.” As described above, advice
related to investment strategies that would require registration is limited to advice with respect to
“the investment of proceeds of municipal securities . . . and the recommendation of and brokerage
of municipal escrow investments.” 648 Thus, the provision of investment advice to individual plan
participants in a public employee benefit plan is not a municipal advisory activity, as long as the
individual plan participant is not a municipal entity. 649
v. Registered Investment Advisers
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(C) excludes from the definition of municipal advisor “any
investment adviser registered under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, or persons associated
with such investment advisers who are providing investment advice.” 650 The Commission proposed
in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii) to interpret the statutory exclusion for registered investment advisers from
the definition of municipal advisor. 651 Specifically, the Commission proposed that the term
“municipal advisor” shall not include “[a]n investment adviser registered under the Investment
Advisers Act of 1940… or a person associated with such registered investment adviser, unless the
registered investment adviser or person associated with the investment adviser engages in municipal
advisory activities other than providing investment advice that would subject such adviser or person
associated with such adviser to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940.” 652

In the Proposal, the Commission stated that a registered investment adviser or an associated
person of a registered investment adviser would fall within the definition of municipal advisor and
be required to register with the Commission as a municipal advisor if the adviser or associated
person engages in any municipal advisory activities (including solicitation) that would not be
investment advice subject to the Investment Advisers Act. 653 In the Proposal, the Commission
stated its belief that this interpretation is in furtherance of the goals of the Dodd-Frank Act to
regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities. 654
As discussed further below, the Commission received several comments in response to its
proposed interpretation of the statutory exclusion relating to investment advisers. After careful
consideration, to address commenters’ concerns, the Commission is modifying proposed Rule
15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii) to provide certain clarifications. Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii), as adopted,
provides that the definition of municipal advisor excludes “[a]ny investment adviser registered
under the Investment Advisers Act of 1940 . . . or any person associated with such registered
investment adviser to the extent that such registered investment adviser or such person is providing
investment advice in such capacity.” Moreover, the Commission clarifies in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii)
that “investment advice,” solely for purposes of this rule, “does not include advice concerning
whether and how to issue municipal securities, advice concerning the structure, timing, and terms of
an issuance of municipal securities and other similar matters, advice concerning municipal
derivatives, or a solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.” 655

Several commenters stated that the Commission’s proposed interpretation is contrary to the plain
meaning of the statute and exceeds its intended scope. 656 One commenter stated that the statute
excludes “any” registered investment adviser – without limitation. 657 Similarly, another commenter
stated that the phrase “who are providing investment advice” refers only to the immediately
previous phrase, “persons associated with such investment advisers” – not to “such registered
advisers” themselves. 658 As such, this commenter also encouraged the Commission to interpret the
exclusion for investment advisers to apply to all registered investment advisers, not just those who
are providing investment advice. 659 Yet another commenter stated that the statute’s exclusion of
investment advisers “who are providing investment advice” cannot be interpreted to only exclude
advisers providing “investment advice” subject to the Investment Advisers Act, because not all
“investment advice” requires registration under the Investment Advisers Act (e.g., advice with
respect to instruments that are not securities). 660 This commenter stated that the Commission’s
interpretation would mean that “[a Commission]-registered investment adviser would be excepted
from municipal advisor registration for only some, but not all, of its investment activities.” 661 The
commenter described the Commission’s interpretation as “without an apparent reason or policy
justification.” 662

municipal advisor registration, one commenter stated that the municipal advisor registration
requirement established by the Dodd-Frank Act was “primarily aimed at registering unregulated
persons.” 663 Registered investment advisers, in the view of some commenters, are “already subject
to the fiduciary duties and comprehensive registration and disclosure requirements mandated by the
Investment Advisers Act.” 664 The proposal would therefore subject them to “duplicative and
overlapping regulation.” 665
Some commenters stated that the Commission’s proposed interpretation of the exclusion
“interjects ambiguity” on how to determine whether registered investment advisers must also
register as municipal advisors. 666 These commenters stated that the Commission’s interpretation
would create “widespread uncertainty” 667 among investment advisers regarding whether certain of
their activities are subject to regulation as municipal advisory activities. One commenter stated that
the uncertainty would be compounded by the lack of a definition concerning the kind of investment
advice that would exempt a registered investment adviser from the municipal advisor registration
requirement. 668
One commenter requested that the Commission include a non-exclusive interpretation that
“any advice provided by a registered investment adviser pursuant to a written agreement with a
municipal entity to whom the adviser owes a fiduciary duty as an investment adviser constitutes the
rendering of investment advice.” 669 The requested interpretation would thereby exempt the

investment adviser from registration as a municipal advisor. 670
As stated above, the Commission is adopting a revised Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii). Under the
rule the Commission is adopting today, a registered investment adviser could provide advice
concerning the investment of proceeds in securities without registering as a municipal advisor
because it would be “providing investment advice” in its capacity as a registered investment
adviser. Further, if the advice is provided pursuant to an advisory agreement that extends to
investments in both securities and non-security financial instruments, such advice would still be
excluded, because investment advice provided pursuant to the advisory agreement would be
investment advice for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii). 671
However, the Commission notes that, solely for purposes of the municipal advisor
registration rules, pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii), “investment advice” does not include advice
concerning whether and how to issue municipal securities, advice concerning the structure, timing,
and terms of an issuance of municipal securities and other similar matters, advice concerning
municipal derivatives, or a solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person. Notwithstanding
that these activities may constitute advice under the Investment Advisers Act, the Commission
believes that this approach is appropriate given that Section 15B(e) of the Exchange Act expressly
670

See id.

671

As discussed below, solely for purposes of the municipal advisor registration rules,
“investment advice” does not include advice concerning whether and how to issue municipal
securities, advice concerning the structure, timing, and terms of an issuance of municipal
securities and other similar matters, advice concerning municipal derivatives, or a
solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person, even if such activities are under an
advisory agreement. Also, investment advice provided pursuant to the advisory agreement
would be subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act. See 15 U.S.C.
80b-6(1) and 80b-6(2). The Supreme Court has construed Investment Advisers Act Sections
206(1) and (2) as establishing a fiduciary standard for investment advisers that imposes the
“affirmative duty of ‘utmost good faith, and full and fair disclosure of all material facts,’ as
well as an affirmative obligation to ‘employ reasonable care to avoid misleading”’ their
clients. SEC v. Capital Gains Research Bureau, Inc., 375 U.S. 180, 194 (1963).
182

designates these activities as requiring municipal advisor registration. 672 Accordingly, a registered
investment adviser that provides these types of advice to municipal entities or obligated persons
would need to register as a municipal advisor.
The Commission interprets the statutory language, which provides an exclusion for
registered investment advisers and associated persons “who are providing investment advice,” as
evidence that Congress did not intend to grant a blanket exemption from municipal advisor
registration for all registered investment advisers and their associated persons regardless of the
activities in which they are engaged. The Commission believes the phrase “who are providing
investment advice” limits the exclusion. Under this interpretation, if an associated person or a
registered investment adviser engages in municipal advisory activities that do not constitute
“investment advice” for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii), both the registered investment adviser
and the associated person of such adviser engaging in the municipal advisory activities would be
“municipal advisors” unless eligible for another exclusion or exemption. 673
The Commission further notes that the municipal advisor registration and regulatory regime
relates to issues that are unique to municipal advisory activities – particularly the advice concerning
utilization of municipal derivatives, whether and how to issue municipal securities, and the
structure, timing, and terms of issuances of municipal securities and other similar matters. The
registration of registered investment advisers as municipal advisors, to the extent they engage in
these activities, whether or not already subject to the Investment Advisers Act, is necessary to
provide the benefits associated with the regulation of persons who engage in municipal advisory
672

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4). The Commission notes that this interpretation of the term
investment advice relates solely to whether a registered investment adviser, or an associated
person of such adviser, would need to register as a municipal advisor.

673

Consequently, both the registered investment adviser and the associated person would be
required to register, unless the associated person meets the requirements of the exemption
from registration in Rule 15Bc4-1 discussed below. See infra Section III.A.7.
183

activities. Such benefits include, but are not limited to, standards of conduct, training, and testing
for municipal advisors that may be required by the Commission or the MSRB, and other
requirements unique to municipal advisors that may be imposed by the MSRB. 674
The Commission believes that the clarifications described above address the comments that
the Commission’s interpretation introduces “ambiguity” and will lead to “widespread uncertainty”
among registered investment advisers. In particular, permitting a Commission-registered
investment adviser to rely on the exclusion when providing any advice under an investment
advisory agreement that is subject to the Investment Advisers Act, as long as such advice is not
specifically excluded from the definition of “investment advice” under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii), will
allow registered investment advisers to achieve greater certainty about the scope of the exclusion at
the time they enter into an advisory agreement. 675 If an investment adviser firm engages in a
municipal advisory activity that is not within the registered investment adviser exclusion, such as
advice concerning the issuance of municipal securities or the utilization of swaps by municipalities,
the mere fact that the firm is registered under the Investment Advisers Act would not exempt that
firm from registration as a municipal advisor. 676
As discussed above in Section III.A.1.b.viii., the Commission is narrowing the application
of the term “investment strategies” from all plans, programs, or pools of assets that invest funds
held by or on behalf of a municipal entity to plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of
674

See supra note 190.

675

See also Ancillary or Additional Advisory Services Provided by Investment Advisers
section below.

676

The Commission acknowledges commenters’ concerns that there will be overlapping
requirements for registered investment advisers that engage in municipal advisory activities,
just as there are for investment advisers that engage in broker-dealer activities. The
Commission notes that it is permitting investment advisers that have already filed a Form
ADV with the Commission to incorporate by reference in their Form MA certain
information that they have already supplied in Form ADV. See infra Sections II.A.2.
184

municipal securities and the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments.
Accordingly, the municipal advisor registration regime, as adopted, will provide appropriate
protection for advice with respect to proceeds of municipal securities while mitigating many of the
commenters’ concerns with respect to funds of municipal entities other than proceeds of municipal
securities. Moreover, because advice provided to fewer types of plans, programs, or pools of assets
would require municipal advisor registration, the Commission’s exemption for persons providing
advice with respect to certain investment strategies will result in fewer registered investment
advisers having to register as municipal advisors compared to Rule 15Ba1-1(b) as originally
proposed. 677 For example, under the narrow scope of investment strategies, investment advisers
who provide advice to public employee benefit plans, participant-directed investment plans such as
529, 403(b) or 457 plans that do not include proceeds of municipal securities would not be required
to register as municipal advisors.
As noted above, one commenter suggested that any advice pursuant to a written agreement
between an investment adviser and a municipal entity to whom the adviser owes a fiduciary duty
should be considered investment advice and thus exclude the adviser from registration as a
municipal advisor. 678 In the Commission’s view, this approach fails to recognize that the regulatory
regime for municipal advisors set forth in the Dodd-Frank Act includes more than a fiduciary
duty. 679 Accordingly, unless an exclusion or exemption applies, a municipal advisor must register

exemption pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii)).

Commission or the MSRB, and other requirements unique to municipal advisors that may be

Ancillary or Additional Advisory Services Provided by Investment Advisers
Several commenters urged the Commission to carve out from the definition of municipal
advisor certain investment advisers that provide various specific kinds of advice to municipal
entities. For example, some commenters noted that a registered investment adviser may provide
clients with services ancillary to its investment advice in “the normal course of its advisory
services.” 681 Such ancillary service includes advice regarding investments other than securities
(e.g., bank deposits, currencies, real estate, futures, and forward contracts), 682 research, and
reports. 683 One commenter stated that such services may not subject the adviser providing such
services to the Investment Advisers Act but would require the provider to register as a municipal
advisor. According to the commenter, an adviser would have to “segregate its activities into those
that are exempt and those which require registration as a municipal advisor and follow potentially
conflicting rules.” 684
Another commenter stated that managers at investment adviser firms “would need to
regularly monitor each service they provide to municipal entities,” which would be “burdensome
for a private fund manager or other investment manager” and “would divert resources from the
performance of [their] core advisory services.” 685 The commenter stated that the proposed rules
could also cause some managers to “choose to reduce the types of services they provide,” which

could “harm fund managers and their municipal entity clients.” 686
Another commenter suggested an exemption for a “particularized recommendation
regarding the structuring or issuance of municipal securities” when such advice is provided in the
context of the investment adviser providing investment advisory services. 687 For example,
according to this commenter, an investment adviser would be exempt if it recommends changes to
the terms of a municipal entity’s proposed bond offering so that the municipal entity can pay a
lower interest rate on the securities and invest the proceeds in less risky investment vehicles. 688
The Commission carefully considered the comments received, including comments
regarding the burden for firm managers to monitor each service provided by the firm to determine
whether it would require municipal advisor registration. The Commission, however, is not
exempting from the definition of municipal advisor a registered investment adviser that engages in
municipal advisory activities that are “in the ordinary course of” investment advice or “ancillary” to
such investment advice. The determination of whether a particular activity is “in the ordinary
course of” or “ancillary” is very much based on facts and circumstances. Thus, the Commission is
concerned that such a standard could be easily circumvented and could create a pretext for abuse. 689
The Commission interprets the registered investment adviser exclusion to include any advice
provided pursuant to an advisory agreement. However, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii) excludes from
“investment advice” advice concerning: (1) whether and how to issue municipal securities; (2) the
structure, timing, and terms of issuances of municipal securities and other similar matters; and (3)
municipal derivatives. Additionally, the registered investment adviser exclusion does not cover

solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person, as defined in Rule 15Ba1-1(n). The
Commission does not believe that it is necessary to adopt most of the interpretations or carve-outs
from the municipal advisor definition that commenters suggested because it anticipates that most of
these additional services would be covered by advisory agreements. For example, as discussed
above, a registered investment adviser that advises a municipal entity to invest the proceeds of an
issuance of municipal securities in an asset class other than securities will not be required to register
as a municipal advisor, if that advice is provided pursuant to an advisory agreement between the
registered investment adviser and the municipal entity. Similarly, if ancillary services are provided
pursuant to an advisory agreement and these services are not of the type specifically excluded from
“investment advice” under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii), the investment adviser exclusion would apply.
The Commission believes that its interpretation of the investment adviser exclusion should mitigate
commenters’ concerns regarding segregating activities into those that are exempt and those that are
not and following potentially conflicting rules. 690 The Commission also believes that its
interpretation should mitigate commenters’ concerns regarding the burden for a firm to monitor its
activities 691 because a firm would only need to monitor for the specific types of activities that are
excluded from “investment advice” under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii) and the activities that are not
covered by advisory agreements.
The Commission is also not adopting a commenter’s suggestion to create a specific
exemption for “a particularized recommendation regarding the structuring or issuance of municipal
securities.” 692 The Commission believes that an adviser offering advice regarding the issuance of
municipal securities, including advice with respect to the structuring, timing, terms, and other

similar matters, clearly is a municipal advisor because the statutory definition of municipal advisor
expressly includes such activities.
Affiliates of Investment Advisers Providing Municipal Advisory Services
As discussed above, Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(A)(ii) includes in the definition of
municipal advisor a person that “undertakes a solicitation of a municipal entity.” 693 Section
15B(e)(9), however, excludes a person that controls, is controlled by, or is under common control
with a registered investment adviser 694 from the requirement to register as a municipal advisor when
it solicits municipal entities or obligated persons on behalf of the affiliated investment adviser. 695
Thus, an affiliate of a registered investment adviser may engage in such solicitation without
registering as a municipal advisor. Neither the statute nor the rules, as proposed, otherwise exclude
an affiliate of a registered investment adviser from the definition of municipal advisor.
One commenter stated that registered investment advisers “often assign or delegate
management of a portion of their client’s assets to an affiliated entity … when they seek specialized
expertise for particular regions, strategies, or products.” 696 The commenter stated that such
affiliated entities “are typically part of the same organization as the registered adviser and are
subject to the same or similar compliance and management structures.” 697 Further, they are usually
“organized as separate legal entities rather than branch offices” for “tax or other purposes.” 698 The
commenter stated that, because the registered investment advisers themselves are exempt from

694

For purposes of this discussion, the term “affiliate of a registered investment adviser” means

registration as municipal advisors when they provide investment advice, it would be incongruous to
require their affiliates to register as municipal advisors. 699 The commenter further stated that
registration would “simply add costs to the industry and regulators without additional public policy
benefits.” 700
The Commission disagrees that there should be a general exemption for affiliates of
registered investment advisers that engage in municipal advisory activities. The Commission notes
that Congress explicitly exempted affiliates from the solicitation prong of the municipal advisor
definition, but not from the prong relating to advisory and other activities. Accordingly, the
Commission believes that the statute does not contemplate exempting affiliates from municipal
advisor registration, except when an affiliate specifically solicits business for its affiliated entity.
Further, as discussed below, the Commission does not believe that any additional exemption
is necessary or appropriate. In the case of solicitations, the Commission notes that, although the
statute excludes solicitation by an affiliate from the definition of municipal advisor, 701 the
Commission would still have regulatory authority over the entity on whose behalf the affiliate is
soliciting, as a municipal advisor, if it engages in municipal advisory activities. If the entity is also
a registered investment adviser and falls under the investment adviser exclusion in Rule 15Ba11(d)(2)(ii), the Commission would continue to have regulatory authority over that entity as a
registered investment adviser. In a case where an affiliate of a registered investment adviser is
engaged in municipal advisory activities as a municipal advisor, however, the Commission would
not necessarily have regulatory authority outside of the municipal advisor registration regime.
Also, as discussed more fully above, the Commission’s exemption for persons that provide advice

with respect to investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the
proceeds of municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of escrow investments 702
should reduce the likelihood that specialized expertise from affiliates, such as foreign affiliates, will
require registration.
Investment Adviser Solicitations and Referrals
Some commenters requested clarification on the exclusion for investment advisers from the
solicitation prong of the municipal advisor definition. One commenter requested that the
Commission confirm that the exclusion for investment advisers applies to the investment adviser
and its employees “who may solicit municipal entities as part of their regular responsibilities to
market the adviser’s investment advisory services or who may incidentally discuss the adviser’s
advisory services with municipal entities.” 703
The Commission agrees with this comment and notes that a registered investment adviser
that solicits on its own behalf does not fall within the “solicitation” prong of the municipal advisor
definition. Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(9) provides that the term “solicitation of a municipal
entity or obligated person” means a communication “on behalf of a broker, dealer, municipal
securities dealer, municipal advisor, or investment adviser … that does not control, is not controlled
by, or is not under common control with the person undertaking such solicitation.” 704 Thus, Section
15B(e)(9) permits a registered investment adviser and its employees, who market the adviser’s
investment advisory services, to solicit municipal entities or obligated persons, including discussing
the adviser’s advisory services, without triggering regulatory obligations, to the extent such

“investment strategies”).

704

191

solicitation is on behalf of the registered investment adviser. As discussed above, the same is true
for affiliates of registered investment advisers.
One commenter expressed concern that an investment adviser providing advice to a client
regarding the selection or retention of another investment manager could constitute a solicitation of
a municipal entity or obligated person under Section 15B(e)(9) of the Exchange Act. 705 The
Commission confirms that a registered investment adviser will not be required to register as a
municipal advisor in this scenario, unless it receives direct or indirect compensation and acts on
behalf of the recommended investment adviser. Absent such facts, the registered investment
adviser is not soliciting on behalf of another broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal
advisor, or investment adviser, and thus would not be engaging in solicitation requiring municipal
advisor registration. 706
State-Registered Investment Advisers
As a result of changes in the threshold for registration as an investment adviser with the
Commission, 707 certain entities are not required to register as investment advisers under the
Investment Advisers Act and instead are subject to state registration requirements. 708 In the
Proposal, the Commission sought comment on whether state-registered investment advisers should
be exempt from the municipal advisor definition to the extent they are providing advice that
otherwise would be subject to the Investment Advisers Act, but for the operation of a prohibition
705

See Insurance Companies Letter.

However, such advice may be considered investment advice under the Investment Advisers
Act. See supra note 423.

management). Approximately 2,400 Commission-registered investment advisers withdrew
their registrations and registered with state securities authorities in 2012 and 2013.
192

on, or exemption from, Commission registration. 709
Several commenters supported an exemption for state-registered investment advisers. 710
One commenter, for example, stated that “Congress has recognized the efficacy of state regulation
of investment advisers.” 711 Therefore, “the Commission should similarly recognize the efficacy of
state regulation of investment advisers, particularly since the provision of advice to municipal
entities is a matter of special interest to state authorities.” 712 Another commenter stated that stateregistered investment advisers are already subject to significant regulation by state regulators,
including fiduciary obligations with respect to investment management activities. Consequently,
the commenter stated that “imposing an additional layer of regulation on these persons would not
provide an appreciable regulatory benefit or increase the protection of municipal entities or
obligated persons.” 713
After considering the commenters’ views, the Commission is not adopting an exemption for
state-registered investment advisers at this time. The Commission notes that the statutory definition
of municipal advisor excludes only federally-registered investment advisers. The Commission also
notes that state regulation of investment advisers is not always similar to regulation under the
Investment Advisers Act. For example, state-registered investment advisers are not subject to the
Commission’s pay-to-play rule. 714 Furthermore, because the Commission is limiting the kinds of

advice with respect to “investment strategies” that would require a person to register as a municipal
advisor, 715 the Commission believes that fewer state-registered investment advisers will be required
to register as municipal advisors than as originally proposed. 716
Exempt Reporting Advisers
Finally, the Commission is not adopting the suggestion of one commenter to exempt the
category of “Exempt Reporting Advisers” from registration as municipal advisors. 717 The
commenter stated that the Exempt Reporting Advisers exemption from registration under the
Investment Advisers Act indicates that policy makers have determined that “such investment
advisers are not of the type that must register with the [Commission] and be subject to Commission
oversight as a registered investment adviser.” 718 The commenter stated that it would be “consistent
with these policy determinations to similarly exempt these advisers from the definition of municipal
advisor in connection with providing investment advice to a municipal entity.” 719
The Commission does not agree. The Commission believes that, if Exempt Reporting
Advisers engage in municipal advisory activities, consistent with the protection of municipal
715

See supra Section III.A.1.b.viii.

716

For example, under the exemption pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii), state-registered
investment advisers who provide advice to public employee benefit plans (including
participant directed plans or plans such as 529 Savings Plans, 403(b) plans, and 457 plans)
that do not include proceeds of municipal securities would not be required to register as
municipal advisors.

717

See MFA Letter (citing Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3111 (November 19, 2010),
75 FR 77190 (December 10, 2010) (Proposed Exemptions for Advisers to Venture Capital
Funds, Private Fund Advisers with Less Than $150 Million in Assets Under Management,
and Foreign Private Advisers)). The Commission subsequently adopted the exemption from
registration under the Investment Advisers Act for Exempt Reporting Advisers. See
Investment Advisers Act Release No. 3222 (June 22, 2011), 76 FR 39646 (July 6, 2011)

$150 Million in Assets Under Management, and Foreign Private Advisers).

entities and obligated persons, and consistent with the policy objectives of Congress and this
rulemaking, they should not be exempt from the municipal advisor registration requirement based
on status. Specifically, while Congress determined that Exempt Reporting Advisers do not need to
be registered in connection with their investment advisory activities, that does not suggest that
Exempt Reporting Advisers should similarly be exempt from regulation as municipal advisors.
Therefore, Exempt Reporting Advisers who are exempt from registration as investment advisers
must register as municipal advisors if they engage in municipal advisory activities, unless they
qualify for an exclusion or exemption. However, as discussed above, the Commission is exempting
from the definition of municipal advisor persons that provide advice with respect to investment
strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities
or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments. 720 Accordingly, the
Commission believes that fewer Exempt Reporting Advisers will be required to register as
municipal advisors than as originally proposed. For example, under the narrow scope of investment
strategies, Exempt Reporting Advisers who provide advice to private funds that do not include
proceeds of municipal securities would not be required to register as municipal advisors.
vi. Registered Commodity Trading Advisors; Swap Dealers
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4)(C) excludes from the definition of municipal advisor any
commodity trading advisor registered under the Commodity Exchange Act or persons associated
with a commodity trading advisor who are providing advice related to swaps. In the Proposal, the
Commission interpreted the statutory exclusion for registered commodity trading advisors and their
associated persons to apply only to such persons when they are providing advice related to swaps,
as that term is defined in Section 1a(47) of the Commodity Exchange Act and Section 3(a)(69) of

720

See supra Section III.A.1.b.viii.
195

the Exchange Act, 721 and any rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. 722 As proposed in Rule
15Ba1-1(d)(2)(iii), a commodity trading advisor, or an associated person of a commodity trading
advisor, would be required to register with the Commission as a municipal advisor if the commodity
trading advisor, or an associated person of the commodity trading advisor, engages in any municipal
advisory activities that are not advice related to swaps. 723 Further, a commodity trading advisor
would be required to register with the Commission if the advisor provides advice with respect to
swaps on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person, but is not registered as a commodity
trading advisor under the Commodity Exchange Act or is not a person associated with a registered
commodity trading advisor providing advice related to swaps. 724
The Commission requested comment on, and received several comments regarding, its
interpretation of the exclusion for commodity trading advisors. 725 One commenter agreed that the
exclusion should only be available when the registered commodity trading advisor is providing
advice related to swaps. 726 This commenter believed that Congress intended a single
comprehensive municipal advisor regulatory structure to govern advice to municipal entities,

721

7 U.S.C. 1a(47) and 15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(69). Consistent with the statutory exclusion, the
Commission’s proposed interpretation of the statutory exclusion would not apply when such
persons are providing advice with respect to security-based swaps.

722

See Proposal, 76 FR at 833. See also Temporary Registration Rule Release, 75 FR at
54467.

723

See Proposal, 76 FR at 833. As an example, the Commission noted that if an advisor is
providing advice to a municipal entity with respect to engaging in a swap transaction and
provides advice to the municipal entity with respect to the structure of a municipal securities
offering, the advisor would have to register with the Commission as a municipal advisor and
would be subject to regulation by the MSRB as a municipal advisor. See id.

725

See id., at 837.

726

See MSRB Letter.
196

particularly in, but not necessarily limited to, the context of a municipal securities offering. 727
Another commenter expressed concern that the Commission’s proposed interpretation of the
exclusion could have the unintended consequence of requiring commodity trading advisors to
register as municipal advisors if, “in connection with providing advice about swaps, [a commodity
trading advisor] provide[s] clients or prospective clients with research or advice about instruments
other than swaps.” 728 The commenter expressed concern that a registered commodity trading
advisor would need to register as a municipal advisor if these ancillary services fall within the scope
of municipal advisory activities and are not deemed to be the type of advice described in the
exclusion. According to the commenter, the types of ancillary services that a commodity trading
advisor may provide to a municipal entity would be subject to “regular oversight by the
[Commission] and CFTC.” 729 In addition, the commenter stated that the rules would create
widespread uncertainty among registered commodity trading advisors regarding whether the
services they perform would require registration as municipal advisors. 730 According to the
commenter, in order to comply with the proposed rules, managers would need to regularly monitor
each service they provide to municipal entities, determine which of the services are municipal
advisory activities, and further determine which of the services, if any, may not be deemed to be

727

728

729

Id. According to the commenter, such ancillary services include providing clients or
prospective clients with research or advice about instruments other than swaps in connection
with providing advice about swaps.
The Commission notes that providing certain general information to clients or prospective
clients, such as research and general information about products, would not be municipal
advisory activity. See supra Section III.A.1.b.i.

730

See MFA Letter.
197

advice related to swaps. 731
Another commenter urged the Commission to “honor a waiver, no-action letters or other
remedy from the CFTC regarding the requirement to register as a commodity trading advisor.” 732
The same commenter stated that “the CFTC has established a ‘private advisor’ limited exemption
from commodity trading advisor registration.” 733 Under this exemption, a person does not have to
register as a commodity trading advisor if it has not provided commodity trading advice to more
than fifteen persons during the preceding twelve months and does not hold itself out to the public as
a commodity trading advisor. 734 The commenter suggested that the Commission should implement
a similar exemption for purposes of determining when a person must register as a municipal
advisor. 735 In addition, the commenter stated that creating an exemption for providing advice to a
de minimis number of entities would help distinguish between entities whose principal business is
to be a municipal advisor and others. 736
This commenter also expressed concern that a person must register, regardless of the type of
swap advice that may be contemplated and irrespective of the relationship between the municipal
entity and the person seeking to offer advice. 737 The commenter urged the Commission to consider
exclusions based on both: (1) the types of swaps (specifically, limiting municipal derivatives to
securities-based swaps); and (2) the types of relationships between the municipal entity and the
person who is providing the advice (specifically, providing an exclusion where the advisor acts as

Exclusion for Commodity Trading Advisors
The Commission is adopting the interpretation of the statutory exclusion for commodity
trading advisors substantially as proposed, with some modifications to provide additional clarity on
the scope of advice that would be excluded, in response to commenters’ concerns. As adopted,
Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(iii) provides that the term “municipal advisor” shall not include any commodity
trading advisor registered under the Commodity Exchange Act or person associated with a
registered commodity trading advisor, 738 to the extent that such registered commodity trading
advisor or such person is providing advice that is related to swaps (as defined in Section 1a(47) of
the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 1a(47)) and Section 3(a)(69) of the Exchange Act (15
U.S.C. 78c(a)(69)), and any rules and regulations thereunder). 739 The final rule reflects minor, nonsubstantive modifications to provide greater clarity and consistency with other organizational
changes the Commission is making to the exclusions and exemptions. Accordingly, the exclusion
from the municipal advisor definition will not be available to a registered commodity trading
advisor, or an associated person of a registered commodity trading advisor, to the extent it engages
in municipal advisory activities that are not providing advice related to swaps. 740 As noted in the
738

The Commission notes that Section 15B(e)(4)(C) excludes from the definition of municipal
advisor “any commodity trading advisor registered under the Commodity Exchange Act or
persons associated with a commodity trading advisor who are providing advice related to
swaps.” The Commission believes it is reasonable to interpret this exclusion to apply to
registered commodity trading advisors and persons associated with a registered commodity
trading advisor, as opposed to persons associated with any registered or unregistered
commodity trading advisor. The Commission notes that a commenter also suggested this
change. See MSRB Letter.

739

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(iii).

740

The Commission notes, however, that to the extent a registered commodity trading advisor
registers as a municipal advisor, its associated persons that are natural person municipal
advisors would be exempt from registration if he or she is an associated person of an advisor
that is registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 15B(a)(2) of the Act and the rules
199

Proposal, while a registered commodity trading advisor generally could provide advice related to
swaps without registering as a municipal advisor, a commodity trading advisor that is not a
registered commodity trading advisor would be required to register as a municipal advisor if it
provides advice related to swaps to a municipal entity. 741 Similarly, as noted in the Proposal, if a
registered commodity trading advisor provides advice with respect to an issuance of municipal
securities or any municipal financial product other than the swap, the advisor must register as a
municipal advisor. 742
The Commission is not exempting from municipal advisor registration persons that have
received no-action letters from the CFTC or are otherwise exempt from registration as commodity
trading advisors. 743 For example, a person may be exempted from registration as a commodity
trading advisor precisely because it engages in the types of activities that are more akin to activities
in which municipal advisors engage. Thus, the Commission does not believe that a blanket
exemption is appropriate at this time. The Commission notes, however, that such entities could
apply for no-action or exemptive relief. 744

and regulations thereunder and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of a
registered municipal advisor. See supra Section III.A.7. (discussing Rule 15Bc4-1).
741

See Proposal, 76 FR at 833.

742

See id. The commodity trading advisor must also consider whether its activities constitute
“solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person.” See supra Section III.A.1.b.x.
(discussing solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person).

743

See supra notes 732-735 and accompanying text (discussing comments related to CFTC no
action letters and exemptions related to commodity trading advisor registration).

744

Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(4) provides that the Commission, by rule or order, upon its
own motion or upon application, may conditionally or unconditionally exempt any
municipal advisor or class of municipal advisors from any provision of Section 15B or the
rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commission finds that such exemption is consistent
with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B. See 15
U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(4). When requesting exemptive relief pursuant to Section 15B(a)(4), a
person may follow the procedures for requesting exemptive relief pursuant to Section 36 of
the Exchange Act, as set forth in Rule 0-12 under the Exchange Act. See 17 CFR 240.0-12.
200

The Commission is also not adopting an exemption for services provided by a commodity
trading advisor that are solely incidental or ancillary to the commodity trading advisor’s advice
related to swaps. 745 To the extent the commodity trading advisor is providing general information,
however, such activities would not be municipal advisory activities that would subject the advisor to
registration as a municipal advisor. 746
Swap Dealers
Section 15B(e)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act does not include an exclusion from the definition
of municipal advisor for swap dealers or security-based swap dealers. In its Proposal, the
Commission requested comment generally as to whether there are exclusions from the definition of
“municipal advisor,” other than those proposed, that the Commission should consider. 747
Some commenters suggested that the exclusion should be extended to swap dealers and
security-based swap dealers because, otherwise, registration as a municipal advisor would be
duplicative. 748 One such commenter noted that Sections 731 and 764 of the Dodd-Frank Act have
provisions requiring registration by swap dealers and security-based swap dealers with the CFTC
and the Commission, respectively, and provisions specifically covering such dealers’ activities
when acting as advisors to “special entities,” which include state and local governments. 749 Another
commenter stated that persons that will be considered municipal advisors will often be engaged in
business activities other than providing advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated

person. 750 The commenter expressed concern that regulated persons, such as swap dealers, that may
also provide advice to a municipal entity or obligated person in connection with their business as
swap dealers, may be required to register as municipal advisors. 751 The commenter stated that it
would be best to avoid dual or multiple regulations by exempting any advice that is related to, or
given in connection with, another regulated activity. The commenter also provided that, in the
alternative, the Commission should coordinate the definition of “advice” with that of other
regulatory regimes. 752
In its Business Conduct Standards for Swaps, the CFTC adopted certain standards for swap
dealers in their dealings with counterparties to swap transactions, as well as for any swap dealer that
acts an advisor to a special entity. 753 The CFTC’s adopted standards also include a safe harbor from
the heightened protections that would otherwise apply when a swap dealer acts as an advisor to a
special entity, if: such swap dealer does not express an opinion as to whether the special entity
should enter into a recommended swap or trading strategy involving a swap that is tailored to the
particular needs or characteristics of the special entity; the special entity represents in writing that it
will not rely on recommendations provided by the swap dealer, and will rely on advice from an
independent representative; and the swap dealer discloses to the special entity that it is not
undertaking to act in the best interests of the special entity as otherwise required under the CFTC’s

750

See SIFMA Letter I. The commenter stated that a swap dealer that provides advice in
connection with its other business activity may be subject to CFTC regulation and, absent an
exemption, would become subject to additional regulation as a municipal advisor. See id.

See id.

752

See id. In this context, this commenter cited as an example the proposed CFTC business
conduct standards for swaps.

753

CFTC Rule 23.440(c)(1) provides that a swap dealer that acts as an advisor to a special
entity has “a duty to make a reasonable determination that any swap or trading strategy
involving a swap recommended by the swap dealer is in the best interests of the Special
Entity [as defined in CFTC Rule 23.401(c)].”
202

standards. 754 Consistent with this approach and for the reasons described below, the Commission
believes that it is appropriate to provide an exemption for certain swap dealers.
Specifically, to address commenters’ concerns, the Commission is exempting any swap
dealer registered under the Commodity Exchange Act or associated person of the swap dealer
recommending a municipal derivative or a trading strategy that involves a municipal derivative, so
long as the registered swap dealer or associated person is not “acting as an advisor” to the municipal
entity or obligated person with respect to the municipal derivative or trading strategy pursuant to
Section 4s(h)(4) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. 755 For
purposes of determining whether a swap dealer is “acting as an advisor” under Rule 15Ba11(d)(3)(v), the municipal entity or obligated person involved in the transaction will be treated as a
“special entity” 756 under Section 4s(h)(2) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder (regardless of whether such municipal entity or obligated person is otherwise
a “special entity”). 757
The Commission believes an exemption for swap dealers is appropriate because, as
discussed below, the exemption will apply the standards that are applicable under the CFTC’s
existing regulatory regime. As under such regime, the exemption will also preserve consistent and
comparable protections for municipal entities and obligated persons. For example, for the
exemption for registered swap dealers to apply, a municipal entity or obligated person must have an

CFR 23.440).

Special entity is defined in Section 4s(h)(2)(C) of the Commodity Exchange Act and the
rules and regulations thereunder. See 17 CFR 23.401(c) (defining “special entity,” for
purposes of business conduct requirements for swap dealers and major swap participants)
and supra note 275 (discussing the protections provided by the Dodd-Frank Act for special
entities with respect to derivative transactions).

independent representative who is subject to a duty to act in the best interests of its client. 758 The
Commission notes that independent representatives would likely be commodity trading advisors,
municipal advisors, investment advisers, or ERISA fiduciaries 759 that are also subject to, or may
become subject to, 760 a fiduciary duty to their clients. 761 Moreover, regardless of whether a
municipal entity or obligated person is a special entity, the swap dealer will need to comply with
any applicable suitability standards and disclosure requirements, which should offer another
measure of protection for municipal entities and obligated persons in addition to those noted above.
Further, in the context of interactions between swap dealers and municipal entities and obligated
persons, the exemptions will incorporate the standards provided by the CFTC’s Business Conduct
Standards for Swaps, which include a requirement that the swap dealer disclose that it is not
undertaking to act in the best interest of the special entity. 762 Therefore, municipal entities and
certain obligated persons may already be familiar with the notion that exempt swap dealers are not
undertaking to act in their best interest when recommending a swap or a trading strategy involving a
swap and could more appropriately evaluate such recommendation. In addition, the Commission
believes the standards provided by the CFTC’s Business Conduct Standards for Swaps are
appropriate for the swap dealer exemption from the definition of municipal advisor, because they

This is consistent with the blanket exemption where a municipal entity or obligated person is
represented by an independent registered municipal advisor. See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi).

The Commission notes that the CFTC has indicated that it is “considering developing rules
for [commodity trading advisors] that are comparable to rules adopted by the [Commission]
or the MSRB for municipal advisors.” See Business Conduct Standards for Swaps, 77 FR at
9739. Additionally, the CFTC has stated that it believes it has harmonized its rules with the
regulatory regime for municipal advisors and will continue to work with the Commission as
the Commission’s proposed rules for the registration of municipal advisors are finalized. Id.

will help provide clarity about: (1) when a swap dealer must register as a municipal advisor; and
(2) its relationship with municipal entities and obligated persons.
For these reasons, the Commission finds it consistent with the public interest, the protection
of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act, to use its authority pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(4) to exempt swap dealers from the definition of municipal advisor,
subject to the limitations described above, and therefore not require such dealers to register as
municipal advisors.
The Commission is not adopting, at this time, an exemption for security-based swap dealers.
As a general matter, the Commission understands that municipal entities currently do not typically
enter into security-based swap transactions. 763 The Commission also notes security-based swap
dealers may, to the extent they would otherwise meet the definition of “municipal advisor,” qualify
for a different exemption, such as the exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi) when the municipal
entity or obligated person is otherwise represented by an independent registered municipal advisor.
Further, the Commission notes that such entities could apply for no-action or exemptive relief. 764
When the Commission considers adopting external business conduct rules for security-based swap
dealers, the Commission may also consider amending the municipal advisor definition to include an
exemption for security-based swap dealers that is similar to the exemption for swap dealers. 765

offering legal advice or providing services of a traditional legal nature and engineers providing
engineering advice. 766 As discussed more fully below, the Commission proposed interpretations of
the attorney and engineer exclusions and also proposed a limited exemption for accountants. 767
Accountants Providing Attest Services
Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4) does not explicitly exclude accountants from the definition
of municipal advisor. In the Proposal, however, the Commission proposed to interpret the statutory
definition of municipal advisor to exempt any accountant, unless the accountant engages in
municipal advisory activities other than preparing or auditing financial statements or issuing letters
for underwriters. In other words, the Commission proposed to exempt from the municipal advisor
definition accountants preparing financial statements, auditing financial statements, or issuing
letters for underwriters for, or on behalf of, a municipal entity or obligated person. 768 In the
Proposal, the Commission noted that it was not appropriate to exempt accountants entirely, because
accountants may provide advice to municipal entities that includes advice about the structure,
timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning the issuance of municipal securities. 769
The Commission requested comment on its proposed exemption for accountants. In
particular, the Commission requested comment on whether the Commission should provide this
exemption and whether there are additional types of accounting services that should fall under the

See Proposal, 76 FR at 833. The Commission noted that accountants may also be engaged
by municipal entities to provide other services, such as conducting feasibility studies or
preparing financial projections and that, in defining municipal advisor in Exchange Act
Section 15B(e)(4), Congress only excluded attorneys offering legal advice or services of a
traditional legal nature or engineers providing engineering advice. See id., at 833, notes

exemption. 770
The Commission received approximately 11 comment letters that addressed the proposed
accountant exemption. Two commenters expressed support for the accountant exemption as
proposed and did not suggest any changes. 771 Several commenters, however, believed that the
proposed accountant exemption was too narrow and recommended including additional services
under the exemption. 772
Several commenters recommended that attest, not just audit, services should be part of the
accountant exemption. 773 The performance of attest services is generally limited to certified public

See, e.g., Deloitte Letter (stating that “[a]udit services are a subset of the broader category of
attest services... and we see no reason for the final rule to distinguish between the two”);

calculations on behalf of issuers) do not appear to fit the “municipal advisor” definition);
letter from KPMG LLP, dated February 22, 2011 (“KPMG Letter”) (recommending that the
Commission include, at a minimum, specific exemptions for attest services in the accountant
exemption).
Commenters referred to the definition of the term “attest engagements” by the AICPA as
“engagements… in which a certified public accountant in the practice of public
accounting… is engaged to issue or does issue an examination, a review, or an agreed-upon
procedures report on subject matter, or an assertion about the subject matter… that is the
responsibility of another party.” See Deloitte Letter (citing AICPA Attestation Standards
AT §101.01). The Uniform Accountancy Act, which has been used as a basis for state
207

accountants by state regulation and professional standards. 774 One commenter noted that audit
services are a subset of the broader category of attest services and both are subject to similar
professional standards, including an “independence” requirement. 775 Another commenter also
provided examples of services in this broader category of attest services, all of which it believed
would be subject to professional standards: (1) examinations, compilations, or agreed-upon
procedures engagements on projections or forecasts using AICPA Statements on Standards for
Attestation Engagements (“SSAEs”); (2) performance of other types of agreed-upon procedures
engagements; (3) compliance audits (e.g., opinions on compliance with federal, state, or local
compliance requirements); and (4) review of debt coverage requirements on outstanding bonds and
verification of calculations of escrow account requirements for advance refunding of bonds. 776
Further, one commenter asked if the following services would be included or excluded from
the accountant exemption: (1) the preparation of unaudited annual financial statements; (2) the
provision of annual independent audits of a municipal entity; (3) the review and preparation of pro
forma maturity schedules of principal and interest on proposed bond issues; (4) the provision of
budget, audit, and other information to credit rating agencies; and (5) the preparation of the “front

regulation of certified public accountants, incorporates similar concepts. (See, e.g., Section
14(a) of The Uniform Accountancy Act (5th ed. 2007), available at

end” of offering statements and financial and demographic information. 777
Several commenters also recommended extending the exemption to services that noncertified public accountants can provide but are subject to regulation and professional standards.
For example, two commenters stated that advice related to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles (“GAAP”) and tax advice related to municipal securities and derivatives should also fall
under the accountant exemption. 778
In addition to these services, another commenter recommended, more generally, that the
Commission extend the accountant exemption to the provision of non-attest services, such as certain
tax and actuarial services. 779 Two other commenters stated that accountants and other consultants
who provide feasibility studies should not be considered municipal advisors. 780
One commenter suggested that accountants of conduit borrowers should be exempt as
municipal advisors. 781
The Commission has carefully considered issues raised by commenters on the Proposal and
is expanding the accountant exemption to include accountants providing audit or other attest
services. Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(i), as adopted, provides that the term “municipal
advisor” shall not include any accountant to the extent that the accountant is providing audit or
other attest services, preparing financial statements, or issuing letters for underwriters for, or on
behalf of, a municipal entity or obligated person. 782 To the extent commenters requested

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(i). In addition to adopting an expanded accountant exemption, as
compared to the Proposal, the Commission is also making minor, non-substantive
209

clarification regarding whether specific activities would be exempted, such activities would be
exempted if they constitute audit or other attest services, 783 the preparation of financial statements,
or the issuance of letters for underwriters for, or on behalf of, a municipal entity or obligated
person.
The Commission believes that it is appropriate to include attest services in general, and not
just audit services in particular, among the services that fall under the exemption. Both audit and
other attest services are generally subject to regulation and professional standards, 784 including
independence requirements. Such independence requirements could potentially conflict with
municipal advisors’ fiduciary duty to the municipal entities they advise. 785 Accountants providing
attest services are also required to meet general standards related to adequate technical training and
proficiency, adequate knowledge of subject matter, suitability and availability of criteria, and the
exercise of due professional care. 786 Accordingly, the Commission believes that attest services, and
not just audit services, exemplify the types of services typically performed by accountants that
should not constitute the provision of advice within the meaning of Exchange Act Section

modifications to provide greater clarity and consistency with other organizational changes
the Commission is making to the exclusions and exemptions.

15B(e)(4)(A)(i). 787
The Commission has considered whether various non-attest services should also be included
in the accountant exemption, such as tax services (including arbitrage rebate services 788) and advice
relating to GAAP. While the Commission acknowledges that such non-attest services may
represent activities provided by accountants, such services are neither necessarily provided by
certified public accountants, nor necessarily subject to similar regulation and professional standards
as attest services. The Commission does not believe it is appropriate to expand the exemption to
cover activities or services that non-accountants could perform. Accordingly, the Commission is
not including non-attest services in the accountant exemption. Nevertheless, a person providing
non-attest services would only be required to register as a municipal advisor if such services are
within the scope of the municipal advisory activities definition.
Several commenters noted that non-attest services should be included because accountants
are already subject to other regulatory regimes, including those of state boards of accountancy, the
Commission, and the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board. 789 The Commission does not
believe those regimes, which are principally focused on the certified public accountant’s provision
of attest services, 790 are sufficient to warrant further expansion of the accountant exemption.
As stated above and in the Proposal, accountants may provide advice to municipal entities,
including advice about the structure, timing, terms, and other similar matters, and such advice may
be the basis for an issuance of municipal securities. Therefore, the Commission does not believe

that it is appropriate to exempt accountants from the definition of municipal advisor entirely. In
addition, although attest services are often included as part of larger engagements, such as the
examination of prospective financial information that is included as part of a feasibility study or
acquisition study, 791 the accountant exemption includes only the attest portion of these engagements
and does not cover all services that comprise such engagements. 792
The Commission also notes that, according to the exemption provided by Rule 15Ba11(d)(3)(i), feasibility studies concerning the issuance of municipal securities or municipal financial
products for which an accountant provides only audit or attest services would not require the
accountant to register as a municipal advisor. 793
Lastly, with respect to accountants of obligated persons, the Commission notes that such
accountants will be treated consistently with accountants of municipal entities. 794
For these reasons, the Commission finds it consistent with the public interest, the protection
of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act, to use its authority pursuant to
Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(4) to exempt accountants from the definition of municipal advisor,
subject to the limitations described above.

791

See AICPA Attestation Standards AT §101.05.

792

For example, the exemption would not apply to accountants that provide consulting services
to municipal entities, including advice with respect to the structure, timing, terms, or other
similar matters concerning an issuance of municipal securities or a municipal financial
product, modeling future debt service coverage, suggesting future rate schedules, tax advice
related to municipal securities and derivatives, and other non-attest services that constitute
municipal advisory activities. The scope of the accountant exemption is different from the
scope of the investment adviser exclusion because, unlike accountant engagements that
include attest as well as other services, investment advice provided pursuant to an advisory
agreement would be subject to the anti-fraud provisions of the Investment Advisers Act and
a fiduciary duty. See supra note 671.

793

This is consistent with the approach for engineers that provide feasibility studies discussed
below in this section.

Attorneys Offering Legal Advice or Providing Services of a Traditional Legal Nature
Section 15B(e)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act excludes from the municipal advisor definition
attorneys offering legal advice or providing services that are of a traditional legal nature. In the
Proposal, the Commission proposed to interpret the exclusion to mean that the term “municipal
advisor” shall not include any attorney, unless the attorney engages in municipal advisory activities
other than offering legal advice or providing services that are of a traditional legal nature to a client
of the attorney that is a municipal entity or obligated person. 795 In addition, the Commission
proposed to interpret advice from an attorney to his or her client with respect to the structure,
timing, terms, and other similar matters concerning the issuance of municipal securities or
municipal financial products to be services of a traditional legal nature, if such advice is provided
within an attorney-client relationship specifically related to the issuance of municipal securities or
such municipal financial products in conjunction with related legal advice. 796 Further, in the
Proposal, the Commission indicated that, for example, the following advice would be considered to
be services of a traditional legal nature: (1) advice comparing the structures, terms, or associated
costs of issuance of different types of securities or financial instruments (such as fixed rate bonds or
variable rate demand obligations) given by an attorney hired to advise a municipal entity client
embarking on a bond offering; (2) advice concerning the tax consequences of alternative financing
structures; or (3) advice recommending a particular financing structure due to legal considerations,
795

See Proposal, 76 FR at 833-834. See also proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(iv).

796

As an example, the Commission stated that advice comparing the structures, terms, or
associated costs of the issuance of different types of securities or financial instruments (such
as fixed rate bonds or variable rate demand obligations) given by an attorney hired to advise
a municipal entity client embarking on a bond offering, would be considered to be services
of a traditional legal nature, as would advice concerning the tax consequences of alternative
financing structures or advice recommending a particular financing structure due to legal
considerations such as the limitations included in existing contracts and indentures to which
the issuer is a party. See Proposal, 76 FR at 834.
213

such as the limitations included in existing contracts and indentures to which the issuer is a party. 797
The Commission, however, also stated in the Proposal that the following advice would not be
services of a traditional legal nature: (1) advice concerning the financial feasibility of a project or a
financing; (2) advice estimating or comparing the relative cost to maturity of an issuance, depending
on various interest rate assumptions, or (3) advice recommending a particular structure as being
financially advantageous under prevailing market conditions. 798
The Commission requested comment on numerous aspects of the attorney exclusion,
including whether the exclusion should only apply to legal services to an attorney’s municipal or
obligated person client; whether the Commission should provide an exclusion for all an attorney’s
activities as long as that attorney has an attorney-client relationship with the municipal entity or
obligated person; and whether the meaning of the term “services of a traditional legal nature” is
sufficiently clear. 799
The Commission received approximately 20 comment letters regarding the attorney
exclusion. Two commenters generally supported the proposed interpretation of the exclusion, 800
although one of these commenters recommended that the Commission continue to refine the
attorney exemption. The commenter suggested that exempted activity “consists of advice on legal
matters such as the legal ramifications of such structure, timing, terms and other matters, the

person”); letter from Robert Doty, AGFS, dated March 1, 2011 (“Doty Letter II”) (stating
that: “[i]n the municipal securities market… it has long been recognized that attorneys
providing other services are stepping beyond their recognized roles”).
214

appropriate documentation thereof, and matters of a similar legal nature.” 801 Meanwhile, two other
commenters stated that they did not support the exclusion because advice provided by attorneys to
financing teams is generally financial in nature and represents municipal advisory activity. 802
The majority of commenters did not support the proposed interpretation of the statutory
exclusion, stating that the interpretation is too limited in scope. 803 One commenter sought
clarification that the statutory exclusion for attorneys covers all “legal advice” and that the

See letter from John J. Haas, President, Ranson Financial Consultants, LLC, dated February
17, 2011 (“Ranson Financial Consultants Letter”) (“How an attorney can give advice on
whether an entity should be rated or not, and/or to walk and [sic] entity through the rating
process without being a registered Municipal Advisor is not understandable.... The
Commission, in principal [sic], is allowing bond attorney and local attorneys to continue to
act as Municipal Advisors without the requirement to be registered as one.”); Acacia
Financial Group Letter (stating that attorney advice comparing the structures, terms or
associated costs of issuance of different types of securities or financial instruments (such as
fixed rate bonds or variable rate demand obligations) is not service that should be included
in the definition of traditional legal services as it is at the heart of the advice that a municipal
advisor provides and is directly financial in nature).

803

See, e.g., NABL Letter (“[A]ttorneys have an obligation to give frank advice to their clients
and…not to limit their advice to strictly legal issues if their clients otherwise would be
prejudiced…. The attorney should be free to discuss the possible pros and cons of different
transaction structures if more than one is legally authorized, including practical
consequences that are financial in nature…. [T]he exclusion for attorneys should not be
afforded only for advice given to clients, but should apply to all advice that one must be
licensed as an attorney to give or that is given as part of a traditional legal nature, or that is
incidental to such services.”); letter from Wm. Raymond Manning, President & CEO,
Manning Architects, dated February 21, 2011 (“Manning Architects Letter”) (“[B]y
requiring attorneys for the government entity to register if they stray beyond pure legal
advice . . . the SEC will be chilling some of the most effective advice that a lawyer can

fully and ably represent their clients. The Commission should consider carefully if chilling
a lawyer’s advice to a client serves the interests it seeks to protect.”); Sherman & Howard
Letter (“We believe that in so limiting the exemption for attorneys, the Commission is going
beyond what Congress intended, as shown by the language of the Act, and beyond what
Congress has authorized.”).
215

“traditional legal nature” limitation applies only to “services” provided by attorneys. 804 Some
commenters noted the difficulty of separating “services of a traditional legal nature” from advice
that could be considered “financial” in nature. 805 These commenters also noted that roles of outside
counsel are not neatly compartmentalized, and that municipal clients benefit from attorneys’
“financial” advice. 806 Other commenters indicated that attorneys should feel free to provide advice
to municipal entities and obligated persons without fear of falling subject to municipal advisor
registration. 807 Some commenters questioned whether registration of attorneys was necessary, even
if they provided financial advice. These commenters reasoned that attorneys already have a
fiduciary duty to their clients, in addition to state ethics laws and well-established disciplinary
processes for those who breach their fiduciary duties. 808
Several commenters stated that the attorney exclusion should not depend on a pre-existing

product, or providing information concerning developments in the municipal marketplace.”);

attorney-client relationship. 809 Some commenters generally noted that attorneys are often expected
to provide counsel to all financing team members, and not only to the attorney’s clients that are
municipal entities and obligated persons. 810 One commenter stated that “others in the bond issue
clearly rely upon the legal advice of bond counsel, including the . . . obligated person in a conduit
financing. The very role of bond counsel is to provide advice to the entire group relative to the state
law authority for the issuance of the bonds (the approving legal opinion) and the federal and state
tax status of the interest on the bonds.” 811 Similarly, another commenter noted that bond counsel
has at times been described as representing “the transaction” rather than any particular party to an
offering. 812 Accordingly, the commenter asked the Commission to clarify if in such instance the
bond counsel would be viewed as having a municipal entity or obligated person as a client. Finally,
commenters also stated that attorneys representing parties other than municipal entities and
obligated persons, such as underwriter’s counsel, are called upon to provide their views or advice to
the entire team, yet the attorney exclusion, as proposed, would not pertain to these attorneys. 813
809

See, e.g., State of Indiana Letter (“Not all attorneys who are integrally involved in a typical
municipal finance transaction have an attorney/client relationship with the municipal entity
issuing the bonds…. The responsibilities of these counsel are relatively standard at the core,
but can be varied in accordance with the agreements of the various parties to the transaction
to produce the most efficient and effective final product for the municipal entity.... All these
attorneys need absolute comfort that their contributions will not be considered municipal
advisory services which are outside the scope of the exemption simply because they are not
engaged by the municipal entity.”); Squire Sanders & Dempsey Letter (stating that imposing
a federal fiduciary duty upon an attorney with respect to a non-client municipal entity or
obligated person will create potential ethical dilemmas regarding conflicts of interest rules
under state professional conduct rules that already impose a prior competing fiduciary duty
in favor of the attorney’s client); Chapman and Cutler Letter; Gilmore & Bell Letter;

Some commenters noted that, if an attorney is required to register as a municipal advisor in
order to provide advice to non-clients on the financing team, the resulting municipal advisory
relationship would create a fiduciary duty for the attorney to the non-client. According to these
commenters, such a fiduciary duty would directly conflict with the attorney’s pre-existing fiduciary
duties to its clients, and thus potentially infringe upon state rules of professional responsibility. 814
Other commenters indicated that many law firms provide to both clients and non-clients
educational material about municipal bond financings through newsletters and emails and expressed
concern that such activity would not be covered under the proposed interpretation of the attorney
exclusion. 815 Moreover, some commenters indicated that attorneys typically provide legal advice to
a client, both before a formal attorney-client relationship is formed and after the attorney-client
relationship has ended (e.g., upon the closing of a bond transaction). 816 One commenter noted that
it is often asked to provide its view or advice on matters relating to prior transactions for which it
served as bond counsel or in another legal capacity. 817
The Commission has carefully considered issues raised by commenters on the Proposal and
is modifying its interpretation of the statutory attorney exclusion to provide that attorneys are
excluded from the definition of municipal advisor to the extent that the attorney is offering legal
advice or providing services that are of a traditional legal nature with respect to the issuance of
municipal securities or municipal financial products to a client of such attorney that is a municipal
entity, obligated person, or other participant in the transaction. The Commission recognizes that

lawyers under their state professional conduct rules); Sherman & Howard Letter; Squire

legal advice and services of a traditional legal nature in the area of municipal finance inherently
involves a financial advice component. By contrast, to the extent an attorney represents himself or
herself as a financial advisor or financial expert regarding the issuance of municipal securities or
municipal financial products, the attorney is not excluded with respect to such financial activities
under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(iv) as this type of advice and services would be outside the statutory
exclusion. 818
By revising its interpretation of the exclusion in this way and providing guidance, the
Commission intends to clarify that all legal advice or services of a traditional legal nature involving
the issuance of municipal securities or a municipal financial product are covered under the attorney
exclusion. This approach addresses many comments received by the Commission noting the
negative impacts of requiring attorneys in municipal finance transactions to limit their advice and
services to those related strictly to legal issues and describing the difficulty involved in complying
with such limitations given the nature of the legal advice and services attorneys traditionally have
provided, and are expected to provide, in municipal finance transactions. 819 In addition, if another
participant in the issuance or transaction, who is not a client of the attorney, receives and acts upon
the legal advice the attorney provides to its client, the attorney will not have to register as a
municipal advisor. In this situation, the attorney is still only advising its client, even if the advice
affects the actions of other participants in the transaction. This approach addresses commenters’
concerns that bond counsel and other attorneys routinely share their views with non-client parties in

818

Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(iv). In addition to the modifications discussed above, the Commission
is adopting the attorney exclusion with minor, non-substantive modifications to provide
greater clarity and consistency with other organizational changes the Commission is making
to the exclusions and exemptions.

a municipal finance transaction in the context of working group discussions. 820 Because such
attorney would not be required to register as a municipal advisor, he or she would not be subject to
an additional fiduciary duty that could potentially conflict with the attorney’s existing fiduciary duty
to his or her client. 821 By revising its interpretation of the exclusion to include a client of such
attorney that is a municipal entity, obligated person, or other participant in the transaction, the
Commission intends to be responsive to the comments received that attorneys representing
participants other than a municipal entity or obligated person should be included in the
exemption.822
If, however, in connection with the issuance of municipal securities or municipal financial
products, an attorney represents himself or herself as a “financial advisor” or “financial expert,” the
attorney will be required to register as a municipal advisor if the attorney engages in municipal
advisory activities. As provided in the Proposal, the Commission would consider an attorney to be
representing himself or herself as a “financial advisor” or “financial expert” if the attorney provides
advice that is primarily financial in nature, such as: (1) the financial feasibility of a project or
financing; (2) advice estimating or comparing the relative cost to maturity of an issuance of
municipal securities depending on various interest rate assumptions; (3) advice recommending a
particular structure as being financially advantageous under prevailing market conditions; (4) advice
regarding the financial aspects of pursuing a competitive sale versus a negotiated sale; and (5) other

counsel in a municipal securities transaction and the expectation that attorneys share their
advice with the financing team).

821

See supra notes 809 and 814 and accompanying text (discussing comments on potentially
conflicting duties if an attorney is not counsel to the municipal entity or obligated person,

the transaction).

220

types of financial advice that are not related to the attorney’s provision of legal advice and services
of a traditional legal nature. 823 In these examples, attorneys would be providing services that are
primarily financial in nature and that are beyond their traditional legal roles and outside of the
statutory exclusion. The Commission believes that if an attorney represents himself or herself as a
financial advisor or expert and engages in municipal advisory activities, the attorney is acting
outside the scope of the statutory exclusion (i.e., the attorney is not offering legal advice or
providing services that are of a traditional legal nature). 824
The Commission recognizes that analysis, discussion, negotiation, and advice regarding the
legal ramifications of the structure, timing, terms, and other provisions of a financial transaction by
an attorney to a client are essential to the development of a plan of finance. In turn, these services
become, among other things, the basis for a transaction’s basic legal documents, the preparation and
delivery of the official statement or other disclosure document that describes the material terms and
provisions of the transaction, the preparation of the various closing certificates that embody the
terms and provisions of the transaction, the preparation and delivery of the attorney’s legal opinion
with respect to the transaction that is relied upon by the client and investors in the municipal
securities marketplace, and advice and documentation with respect to post-closing policies and
procedures that are necessary for compliance with federal and state law during the term of the
municipal securities or municipal financial product. Similarly, attorneys often provide legal advice
and related legal services regarding Federal tax requirements for issues of municipal securities, such
as, for example, legal advice and services in determining ongoing compliance of an issue of
municipal securities with the Federal tax law requirement to “rebate” excess arbitrage earnings on
investments of tax-exempt bond proceeds to the Federal Government at periodic intervals during the

221

term of the bond issue. The legal advice and legal services described in this paragraph would be
within the attorney exclusion to the municipal advisor definition. Thus, attorneys providing this
advice or these services would not be required to register as municipal advisors.
In addition, the Commission recognizes that attorneys seeking to represent municipal
entities and obligated persons are often required to respond to RFPs and RFQs, and to participate in
interviews during which they are requested to, and do, offer advice regarding the structure, timing,
terms, and other provisions of a proposed offering of municipal securities or municipal financial
products before being retained as counsel and that these requests may not be limited to legal
questions. As discussed above in Section III.A.1.c.ii, the Commission does not believe that a
response to an RFP or RFQ is advice with respect to the issuance of municipal securities or
municipal financial products, and the Commission is adopting an exemption from the definition of
municipal advisor for any person providing a response to an RFP or RFQ, provided such person
does not receive separate direct or indirect compensation for advice provided as part of such RFP or
RFQ. The Commission notes that responses to RFPs and RFQs are provided at the request of the
municipal entity or obligated person. Thus, anyone responding to an RFP or RFQ in accordance
with the exemption, including an attorney, will not have to register as a municipal advisor.
The Commission also recognizes that attorneys who represent municipal entities or
obligated persons with respect to the issuance of municipal securities or municipal financial
products are often asked to provide interpretation of the provisions of the legal documents
throughout the term of the municipal securities or municipal financial products, including before
and after the formal attorney-client relationship with respect to the issuance or municipal financial
product exists. 825 Although the attorney-client relationship may not be in existence, if the advice is

825

See supra notes 816-817 and accompanying text.
222

with respect to an issuance or transaction in connection with which the municipal entity was or will
be a client of the attorney, the Commission considers such advice to be “to a client.” Accordingly,
such advice will not require the attorney to register as a municipal advisor.
Finally, as discussed above, the Commission is clarifying that provision of general
information, including the provision of educational materials to an attorney’s clients and non-clients
does not constitute advice, and therefore, will not require the attorney to register as a municipal
advisor. 826
Engineers Providing Engineering Advice
Section 15B(e)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act excludes engineers providing engineering advice
from the municipal advisor definition. In the Proposal, the Commission proposed to interpret this
exclusion to mean that the term “municipal advisor” shall not include “[a]ny engineer, unless the
engineer engages in municipal advisory activities other than providing engineering advice.” 827 In
the Proposal, the Commission stated that costing out engineering alternatives would not subject an
engineer to registration because such activity would be considered “engineering advice.” 828 The
Commission, however, further proposed that this exclusion would not include circumstances in
which the engineer is engaging in municipal advisory activities, including cash flow modeling or
the provision of information and educational materials relating to municipal financial products or
the issuance of municipal securities, even if those activities are incidental to the provision of
engineering advice. 829 The Commission also proposed that the exclusion would not include
preparing feasibility studies concerning municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal

securities that provide analysis beyond the engineering aspects of the project. Therefore, under the
Proposal, engineers engaging in the types of activities described above would have been required to
register as a municipal advisor. 830
The Commission requested comment on whether it should expand its proposed
interpretation of the statutory exclusion beyond engineers providing engineering advice. 831 The
Commission also asked how the term “engineering advice” should be interpreted and whether the
engineering exclusion should include circumstances in which the engineer is preparing feasibility
studies concerning municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities that include
analysis beyond the engineering aspects of the project. 832
The Commission received approximately 32 comment letters regarding the proposed
interpretation of the statutory engineering exclusion. Some commenters supported the proposed
interpretation of the exclusion. 833 One commenter stated that the Commission ignored the statutory
exclusion altogether. 834 Most commenters, however, suggested that the Commission’s proposed
interpretation of the engineering exclusion was too narrow and that activities such as cash flow
analyses and feasibility studies represent an integral part of an engineer’s services. 835 Some

that engineering firms reporting on the condition of water and sewer systems should be excluded

to municipal securities or municipal financial products; and that rate consultants providing
advice regarding rates and revenues should, like engineers providing engineering advice, be

A number of commenters highlighted energy services and solar energy companies, in
particular, as a sector of the engineering industry that would be especially affected by the
Commission’s proposed interpretation. 840 Three commenters suggested that energy service
companies should be able to provide disclosure statements to municipalities without being
considered municipal advisors, 841 and one commenter suggested that solar energy companies acting
in an engineering role and providing just information and education related to cost savings integral
to solar engineering should be included in the exemption. 842
The Commission has carefully considered the issues raised by commenters on the Proposal
and is adopting its interpretation of the statutory engineering exclusion, substantially as proposed, to
provide that engineers are excluded from the definition of municipal advisor “to the extent that the

engineer is providing engineering advice,” 843 with modifications and clarifications regarding the
scope of its interpretation of the statutory exclusion in response to public comment. 844 In general,
the Commission believes activities within the scope of the engineering exclusion may include
feasibility studies, cash flow analyses, and similar activities; provided, however, that the
engineering exclusion does not cover activities in which an engineer provides advice to a municipal
entity or obligated person regarding municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities, as discussed further herein.
Activities within the scope of the engineering exclusion include, among other things, certain
activities discussed below. The Commission believes that this exclusion covers an engineer’s
provision of certain information to its client regarding a project schedule and anticipated funding
requirements of the project. The Commission further believes that the provision of engineering
feasibility studies that include certain types of projections, such as projections of output capacity,
utility project rates, project market demand, or project revenues that are based on considerations
involving engineering aspects of a project are within the scope of the engineering exception.
For example, 845 an engineer who provides funding schedules and cash flow models that
anticipate the need for funding at certain junctures in a project or engineering feasibility studies
based on analysis of engineering aspects of the project will fall within the Commission’s
interpretation of the statutory engineering exclusion from the municipal advisor definition. An
engineering feasibility study, for example, might include a discussion of how much power might be
843

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(v). The Commission is adopting the engineering exclusion with
minor, non-substantive modifications from the version proposed to provide greater clarity
and consistency with other organizational changes the Commission is making to the
exclusions and exemptions.

844

See supra notes 835-836 and accompanying text (discussing comments related to cash flow
analyses and feasibility studies).

See, e.g., supra note 835 and accompanying text.
227

generated by the installation of solar panels, and such a discussion would not constitute a municipal
advisory activity. Similarly, recommendations about how to increase power output based on factors
such as the placement of the panels or the number of panels would also not constitute a municipal
advisory activity. Moreover, an engineer might provide estimates of water delivery capacity or a
road’s traffic capacity without engaging in municipal advisory activity. Engineers who report on
the physical condition of infrastructure, such as roads, bridges or water and sewer systems, would
also not be engaged in municipal advisor activity. 846 Absent other facts and circumstances which
indicate that an engineer is providing advice to a municipal entity or obligated person regarding the
issuance of municipal securities, an engineer’s use of assumptions provided by a municipal entity or
obligated person regarding interest rates or debt levels in preparing an engineering feasibility study
or cash flow analysis alone will not result in municipal advisory activity.
With respect to services related to cash flow analysis, a municipal entity might seek input
from an engineering company about whether a project could be accomplished with estimated
available funding, including the timing of such funding. As noted above, engineers that provide
input about the anticipated funding requirements of a project would not be engaging in a municipal
advisory activity. 847 Thus, an engineer could advise a municipal entity about whether a project
could be safely or reliably completed with the available funds and provide engineering advice about
846

See supra note 837. Whether a rate consultant providing advice regarding rates and
revenues would be a “municipal advisor” will depend upon the facts and circumstances. For
example, if such consultant provides advice on whether certain rates and revenues would
support debt service on an issue of municipal securities, such activity would be municipal
advisory activity that would subject the consultant to the registration requirement. Although
the Commission is not adopting an exemption for persons performing such activities, the
Commission notes that like all persons, such entities could apply for no-action or exemptive
relief. As noted above, when requesting exemptive relief pursuant to Section 15B(a)(4), a
person may follow the procedures for requesting exemptive relief pursuant to Section 36 of
the Exchange Act, as set forth in Rule 0-12 under the Exchange Act. See 17 CFR 240.0-12.

847

In the Proposal, the Commission gave as an example of activity that would be engineering
advice the costing out of engineering alternatives. See Proposal, 76 FR at 834.
228

other alternative projects, cost estimates, or funding schedules without engaging in municipal
advisory activity. Further, the Commission would consider an engineering company that informs a
municipal entity or obligated person of potential tax savings, discounts, or rebates on supplies to be
acting within the scope of the engineering exclusion.
By contrast, however, activities of engineers are outside the scope of the engineering
exclusion if they include advice to a municipal entity or obligated person regarding municipal
financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, including advice with respect to the
structure, timing, terms, or other similar matters concerning such products or issuances. For
example, an engineer that is engaged by a municipal entity or obligated person to prepare revenue
projections to support the structure of an issuance of municipal securities would be providing advice
outside the scope of the engineering exclusion and would be engaging in municipal advisory
activity. Further, while the inclusion of an engineering feasibility study in an official statement or
other offering document for an issuance of municipal securities alone does not cause an engineer’s
activities with respect to the feasibility study to be treated as municipal advisory activity, other facts
and circumstances, such as the inclusion of revenue projections and debt service coverage
calculations in the feasibility study, may suggest municipal advisory activity.
Engineering companies may also provide advice to their clients regarding financing of
products and services delivered to such clients. As noted previously, the Commission is clarifying
that provision of general information that does not involve a recommendation regarding municipal
financial products or the issuance of municipal securities (including general information with
respect to financing options) would not be municipal advisory activity. 848 Depending on all the
facts and circumstances, however, the provision of information describing financing alternatives
848

See supra note 168 and accompanying text. See also supra Section III.A.1.b.i. (providing
guidance on the term “advice” and discussing the provision of general information).
229

that may meet the needs of a municipal entity or obligated person may be considered a
recommendation with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities
that would be municipal advisory activity. 849
One commenter stated that another standard service offered by engineers involves the
provision of introductions of municipal entities to brokers, dealers, municipal advisors, and
municipal securities dealers and that such introductions should be within the engineering
exclusion. 850 One commenter recommended that the Commission “refine its approach” to register
only those solicitors that receive compensation for introductions to funding sources. 851
The Commission does not believe it is necessary or appropriate to provide a separate
exemption for engineers engaging in introductions. The Commission notes that introductions
provided by engineers would be subject to the same analysis as any other “solicitation of a
municipal entity or obligated person.” 852 Thus, if an introduction does not result in direct or indirect
compensation to the engineer, the introduction will not constitute such a solicitation and the
engineer will not be required to register as a municipal advisor.
Finally, as discussed previously, the Commission is providing an exemption for advice
given to municipal entities and obligated persons in circumstances in which the municipal entity or
obligated person separately is represented by an independent registered municipal advisor. 853

obligated person represented by an independent municipal advisor”).
230

Engineers may provide advice beyond engineering advice when such an independent registered
municipal advisor is present without triggering the requirement to register as a municipal advisor.
Vendors Generally
Some commenters who commented on other aspects of the Proposal also provided
information with respect to purchases from vendors made by municipal entities that could
potentially involve the issuance of municipal securities. One commenter stated that most
municipalities, for example, do not purchase a solar installation upfront, but rather enter into a
purchase or lease agreement with the solar company. 854 Another commenter referenced leaseleaseback arrangements and preferred provider or performance contract arrangements. 855
The Commission notes that municipal entities and obligated persons purchase a wide range
of products from vendors, including, for example, computers, office furnishings and supplies, car,
truck and school bus fleets, telephone systems, and a multitude of other products. The Commission
believes that the activities of vendors in advertising, promoting, and selling their products to
municipal entities are generally outside the scope of municipal advisory activities because these
activities generally do not involve advice with respect to the issuance of municipal securities or
municipal financial products. 856
The Commission understands, however, that sometimes municipal entities and obligated
persons may finance the purchase of products from vendors through the use of instruments such as
installment purchase contracts, installment sale contracts, lease-purchase agreements, or loans. The
Commission notes that the provision of advice and recommendations by vendors (or any other

856

See supra note 143 and accompanying text (discussing the term “municipal advisory
activities”).
231

person including, for example, lease financing companies affiliated with vendors) to municipal
entity or obligated person clients regarding specific financing options for the purchase of products
could, depending on the facts and circumstances, be a municipal advisory activity. For example,
certain financings, depending on how they are structured, could constitute the issuance of a
security857 by a municipal entity and, therefore, could constitute the issuance of a municipal
security. 858 The provision of advice and recommendations regarding such an issuance would
constitute municipal advisory activity unless an exclusion or exemption applies.
Actuaries
Section 15B(e)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act does not include an exclusion for actuaries from
the municipal advisor definition. The Commission received approximately five comment letters
concerning a possible exemption for actuaries. 859
One commenter stated that if the term “investment strategies” extends beyond proceeds of
municipal securities to include funds held in pension plans, actuarial services for pension plans
would potentially require municipal advisor registration. 860 The same commenter recommended
that the Commission exempt from the municipal advisor definition enrolled actuaries and members
of the five U.S.-based actuarial organizations that have adopted the actuarial Code of Professional
Conduct (including the American Academy of Actuaries, the American Society of Pension
Professionals and Actuaries, the Casualty Actuarial Society, the Conference of Consulting
857

See Reves v. Ernst & Young, Inc., 494 U.S. 56 (1990), where the U.S. Supreme Court
established a multi-factor test to distinguish securities from instruments that are not
securities.

Actuaries Letter.

232

Actuaries, and the Society of Actuaries). 861 This commenter suggested that such exemption should
apply to actuaries providing actuarial services that are governed by the Actuarial Standards of
Practice and the Code of Professional Conduct. 862 Further, another commenter recommended that
actuaries providing actuarial services to public pension plans, 403(b) plans, and 457(b) plans
generally should also be exempt. 863 Additionally, one commenter recommended that the
Commission clarify whether actuaries who perform actuarial and/or consulting services for certain
other governmental benefit plans and trusts, such as retiree medical plans, voluntary employee
benefit associations and related trusts (“VEBAs”), and other post-employment benefits (“OPEB”)
plans and trusts would be municipal advisors. 864 Finally, another commenter stated that actuarial
studies should not be considered to be “municipal advisory activities.” 865
For the reasons discussed below, the Commission does not believe that it is necessary or
appropriate to exempt actuaries from the municipal advisor registration regime as suggested by
commenters. However, as discussed in other sections of the release, the Commission is making
several changes to the final rule text and its interpretations that would also address some of the
concerns raised by commenters. As discussed above in Section III.A.1.b.viii, the Commission is
exempting from the definition of municipal advisor persons that provide advice with respect to
investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal
securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments. Thus, persons
who provide advice with respect to a plan, such as a public employee benefit plan (including 403(b)

233

plans and 457(b) plans, to the extent the plans do not contain proceeds of municipal securities) will
not be required to register as municipal advisors. To the extent that a plan contains proceeds of
municipal securities, the Commission understands that an actuary’s service does not generally
involve advice with respect to the investment of such proceeds. As such, an actuary’s services with
respect to such plan generally would not constitute municipal advisory activities and would not
require the actuary to register as a municipal advisor.
In addition, the provision of actuarial studies that are used as the basis for a municipal entity
to engage in a financing will not be considered a municipal advisory activity if the actuarial study
only uses client-provided investment return assumptions and does not make any recommendations
about how such municipal entity might address an unfunded liability, including a discussion of the
advisability of an issuance of municipal securities or a municipal financial product. Further, in
order for the provision of actuarial studies that form the basis for disclosure with respect to an
issuance of municipal securities to not constitute a municipal advisory activity, it must not include a
discussion of the advisability of an issuance of municipal securities or a municipal financial
product. Such actuarial studies only provide calculations using data from the client and do not
involve the provision of any advice. An actuary may be deemed to be engaged in a municipal
advisory activity if the facts and circumstances indicate that the actuary tailored its actuarial study
to support an issuance of municipal securities or to support entering into a municipal financial
product.
viii. Banks
In the Proposal, the Commission discussed a commenter’s suggestion that the Commission
exempt from the definition of “municipal advisor” banks providing “traditional banking services”

234

and banks and trust companies that provide “investment advisory services.” 866 The Commission
noted that Congress included in the statutory definition of municipal advisor a limited number of
exclusions, and such exclusions did not include banks in any capacity. 867 In addition, as discussed
more fully above, 868 the Commission proposed to interpret the term “investment strategies” to
include “plans, programs, or pools of assets that invest in funds held by or on behalf of a municipal
entity.” 869 In connection with its proposed interpretation of “investment strategies,” the
Commission stated that, because every bank account of a municipal entity is comprised of funds
“held by or on behalf of a municipal entity,” money managers that provide advice to municipal
entities regarding their bank accounts could be municipal advisors. 870
The Commission requested comment on whether it should exempt banks providing advice to
a municipal entity or obligated person concerning transactions that involve a “deposit” (as defined

Trust and Investments, American Bankers Association, and Deputy General Counsel, ABA
Securities Association, dated October 13, 2010. See also Proposal, 76 FR at 834, notes 143144 and accompanying text. As support, this commenter stated that banks are currently
well-regulated and banks that offer trustee services are subject to rigorous and frequent
examination, as well as extensive regulation by the various federal or state banking
regulators.
The commenter also listed the following activities as examples of the types of activities in
which bank and trust companies engage: providing direct loans, checking accounts, and
CDs; responding to RFPs regarding investment products offered by the bank, such as
interest bearing deposits, money market mutual funds, or other exempt securities; investing
in securities issued by municipalities and providing credit, or through their affiliates,
underwriting services to municipalities (such as when the municipality wants to buy a fire
truck or build a school); providing fiduciary services to municipal entities (such as by
managing investment accounts for local towns or acting as trustee with respect to bond
proceeds, escrow accounts, governmental pension plans and other similar capacities). See

in Section 3(l) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 871) at an “insured depository institution” (as
defined in Section 3(c)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act 872). The Commission stated that, if
adopted, banks would be exempted from the definition of municipal advisor to the extent they
provide advice to a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to such banking products as
insured checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposit. However, banks would not be
exempted if they engage in other municipal advisory activities. 873
In response to request for comment, the Commission received over 300 letters from
commenters, many of them commercial banks and banking associations. The commenters stated
that, because the Commission was proposing to interpret the term “investment strategies” to
encompass any funds “held” by a municipal entity, regardless of whether such funds are related to
the issuance of municipal securities or investment of bond proceeds, the definition would

The Commission also requested on comment on whether to exclude banks performing
certain other specific activities, including, for example: banks responding to RFPs from
municipal entities regarding other investment products offered by the banking entity, such as
money market mutual funds or other exempt securities; banks that provide to a municipal
entity a listing of the options available from the bank for the short-term investment of excess
cash (for example, interest-bearing bank accounts and overnight or other periodic
investment sweeps) and negotiate the terms of an investment with the municipal entity;
banks that provide to a municipal entity the terms upon which the bank would purchase for
the bank’s own account (to be held to maturity) securities issued by the municipal entity,
such as bond anticipation notes, tax anticipation notes, or revenue anticipation notes; banks
that direct or execute purchases and sales of securities or other instruments with respect to
funds in a trust account or other fiduciary account in accordance with predetermined
investment criteria or guidelines, including on a discretionary basis; banks and trust
companies that provide other fiduciary services to municipal entities, such as acting as
trustees with respect to governmental pension plans and other similar capacities; and banks
and trust companies to the extent they are providing advice that otherwise would subject
them to registration under the Investment Advisers Act, but for the operation of a prohibition
to or exemption from registration. See Proposal, 76 FR at 837.

potentially cover what commenters termed “traditional banking products and services.” 874
According to the commenters, such services include deposit accounts, cash management products,
and loans to municipalities, all of which are already subject to supervision by federal bank
regulators. 875 As a result, these commenters stated that banks providing such products and services
would have to register as municipal advisors, adding “a new layer of regulation on bank products
for no meaningful public purpose.” 876 One commenter noted that “the OCC and the other federal
banking agencies have an existing regulatory framework and oversight over traditional banking
products and services, which include bank deposit transactions… The OCC also already evaluates
the ability of bank management to monitor and control traditional banking products and services,
including the administration of deposit accounts, through regular and extensive on-site

See, e.g., American Bankers Association Letter I (the SEC’s proposed interpretation would
regulate “already-regulated traditional banking products, such as deposit, cash management
and lending activities, and trust or custody products with or on behalf of municipalities”);
Union Bank Letter; Form Letter A (of the approximately 300 comment letters that addressed
the topic of commercial bank regulation, 170 were submitted in Form Letter A format) (the
SEC’s proposed interpretation would cover “traditional bank products and services, such as
deposit accounts, cash management products, and loans to municipalities”). See also Form
Letter D (36 comment letters were submitted in this form) (the SEC’s proposed
interpretation “would label as “municipal advisors” banks and many bank employees
providing essential and traditional bank services to their local municipalities, including dayto-day deposit, cash management, custody, trustee, and lending services—a result we do not
believe furthers any legitimate policy goal...”).

See, e.g., Form Letter A. See also Form Letter D (36 comment letters were submitted in this
format) (stating that “the rule would result in… additional, redundant layers of multiple
rules by the SEC and Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (MSRB) for the very same
products and services for which we are already comprehensively supervised by the
prudential banking regulators”); BOK Financial Corp. Letter (stating that “[e]xpanding
the… registration requirement to providers of traditional banking services is unnecessary
because it provides no additional protection to municipalities or investors in municipal
securities beyond existing regulation and oversight”); American Bankers Association Letter
I (stating that “[d]eposit accounts, cash management products, loans, and trust and custody
products are but four broad types of [municipal financial products]” and that “[a]ll are

examinations.” 877 Other commenters recommended that municipal advisor registration should
instead only apply to currently unregulated entities. 878
Many commenters focused, in particular, on the potential effects of the proposed rules on
“community banks.” 879 Many other commenters claimed that the additional regulatory burden of
registering as a municipal advisor would raise costs, which would either discourage community
banks from offering their full array of products and services to municipalities 880 or lead community
banks to pass on added costs and expenses to their municipal entity customers. 881
Commenters stated that “traditional banking products and services” are not the intended
focus of the municipal advisor registration provision of the Dodd-Frank Act and that banks that
provide these services should not be subject to this provision. 882 For example, one commenter

877

See OCC Letter.

878

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter I; American Bankers Association Letter I (stating that “as drafted,
the proposal goes far beyond legislative intent or public policy need by purporting to
regulate already-regulated traditional banking products, such as deposit, cash management
and lending activities, and trust and custody products with or on behalf of municipalities”);
Union Bank Letter (stating that Congress intended to regulate a heretofore unregulated
group that advises municipal entities, and not banks that are already regulated).

879

Entities referring to themselves as “community banks” include, for example First Bank of
Owasso; ACB Bank, Cherokee; First National Bank of Bastrop, Texas; and The First
National Bank of Suffield. See letter from Dominic Sokolosky, President, First Bank of
Owasso, dated February 14, 2011; letter from Kari Roberts, President/CCO, ACB Bank,

Bank of Bastrop, Texas, Bastrop, Texas, dated February 16, 2011; letter from George W.

The OCC defines “community banks” generally as “banks with less than $1 billion in total
assets and may include limited-purpose chartered institutions, such as trust banks and
community development banks.” See Comptroller’s Handbook, Community Bank

noted that products such as deposit accounts and cash management products do not warrant
municipal advisor registration, because “[t]hese types of products merely are extension [sic] of
more traditional deposit products, such as savings accounts, checking accounts and CDs, and do not
constitute ‘advice’ under any reasonably accepted definition of the term.” 883
Other commenters listed specific banking products and services that, in their view, should
not be encompassed within municipal advisor registration. For example, one commenter stated that,
“[a]t a minimum, the Commission should clarify that banks providing municipal entity customers
advice regarding traditional banking products including deposit accounts, savings accounts,
certificates of deposit, bankers acceptances, bank loans and letters of credit, and certain loan
participations do not need to register as municipal advisors.” 884 This commenter also stated that the
Commission should clarify that “banks providing the terms for the purchase of municipal securities
for the bank’s own account shall be excluded from registration as ‘municipal advisors’” and
explained that “banks are authorized to purchase municipal securities for their own account subject
to extensive regulation and oversight.” 885 Another commenter also argued that banks extending

investment of cash, this commenter listed “interest-bearing bank accounts and overnight or
other periodic investment sweeps.” See id.

2011 (stating that “a bank teller would be caught under the [municipal advisor] definition

account if the teller, seeing that the account carries a high balance, recommends a savings
account or certificate of deposit that would give the entity a higher rate of return”).

239

credit, “whether through loans, letters of credit or otherwise,” should be excluded from the
definition of municipal advisor. 886
Meanwhile, another commenter recommended that the Commission adopt an exclusion for
providing advice concerning (or soliciting) transactions that involve a “deposit” at an “insured
depository institution,” as defined in Section 3(c)(2) of the Federal Deposit Insurance Act, including
advice with respect to: (1) insured checking and savings accounts and certificates of deposit; (2)
directing or executing purchases and sales of securities or other instruments in a trust, fiduciary, or
investment management account in accordance with predetermined investment criteria or
guidelines, including on a discretionary basis; (3) providing other services to municipal entities,
such as acting as trustees with respect to governmental pension plans and other similar capacities;
(4) providing advice concerning (or soliciting) transactions that are subject to an exemption under
Regulation R under the Exchange Act, or transactions otherwise excluded from the definition of
broker-dealer activities under the Exchange Act, including bank broker-dealer exceptions relating to
third-party networking arrangements, trust and fiduciary activities, deposit “sweep” activities,
custody and safekeeping activities and certain securities lending transactions; (5) and serving as
trustee to a pooled investment vehicle. 887 Another commenter recommended that the municipal
advisor definition only cover the services of advisors with respect to the investment of proceeds of
municipal securities and exclude the deposit and cash management services traditionally provided
by “community banks.” 888 Another commenter suggested that “investment strategies” not include
products and services in the categories of deposit accounts insured by the FDIC (up to $250,000) or
bank activities that the Commission has exempted from the definitions of “broker” under Section

3(a)(4)(B) of the Exchange Act. 889
The Commission is exempting from the definition of municipal advisor persons that provide
advice with respect to “investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the
proceeds of municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow
investments.” 890 Accordingly, the performance of many of the bank activities and services about
which commenters were concerned would not require banks to register as municipal advisors. In
addition, as discussed further below, the Commission is exempting from registration banks that
perform certain activities.
Specifically, the Commission is exempting from the definition of municipal advisor “[a]ny
bank, as defined in section 3(a)(6) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78c(a)(6)), to the extent the bank provides
advice with respect to the following: (A) [a]ny investments that are held in a deposit account,
savings account, certificate of deposit, or other deposit instrument issued by a bank; (B) [a]ny
extension of credit by a bank to a municipal entity or obligated person, including the issuance of a
letter of credit, the making of a direct loan, or the purchase of a municipal security by the bank for
its own account; (C) [a]ny funds held in a sweep account that meets the requirements of Section
3(a)(4)(B)(v) of the Act (15 U.S.C.78c(a)(4)(B)(v)); or (D) [a]ny investment made by a bank acting
in the capacity of an indenture trustee 891 or similar capacity.” 892 The Commission believes that
advice by banks to municipal entities and obligated persons with respect to these products and

889

See First Tennessee Bank National Association Letter.

890

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii). See also supra Section III.A.1.b.viii.

891

For purposes of this rule, an indenture trustee acts as an order-taker at the direction of the
municipal entity that issued the municipal securities, within the investment parameters set
forth in the indenture, ordinance, resolution, or similar instrument, and, therefore, acts in a
constrained capacity, because the indenture trustee is responsible for making sure that any
investments it undertakes fall within the investment parameters of the indenture.

892

Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(iii).
241

services would not subject municipal entities and obligated persons to the kinds of risks that the
municipal advisor registration regime is intended to mitigate.
The Commission notes that the products and services included in the exemption, such as
deposit accounts and certain other short-term cash investments like sweep accounts, and extensions
of credit by a bank (whether by direct loan or otherwise), 893 are transactions in which there should
be no confusion as to the role of the bank or its employees. Similarly, the Commission notes that
banks that purchase securities from municipal entities or obligated persons for their own account
(without providing advice to the municipal entities or obligated persons with respect to other issues
or municipal products) are not engaging in municipal advisory activities. Instead, they are acting as
principals in purchase transactions. 894 In the case of investments made by an indenture trustee, the
bank acts at the direction of the municipal entity or obligated person.
Accordingly, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(iii) provides an exemption from the definition of
municipal advisor for banks that provide advice with respect to certain enumerated products and
services that the Commission believes do not pose the types of risks that the Dodd-Frank Act was
designed to address. Moreover, the Commission notes that the narrower focus of the “investment
strategies” definition on investments of proceeds of municipal securities and municipal escrow

893

The Commission notes that the examples of extensions of credit set forth in Rule 15Ba11(d)(3)(iii) are not intended to be exhaustive, and that the exemption would also apply to
banks providing advice to a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to other
extensions of credit by a bank such as a banker’s acceptance or a participation in a loan
which the bank or an affiliate of the bank (other than a broker or dealer) funds, participates
in, or owns.

894

Specifically, banks providing municipal entities or obligated persons with the terms under
which they would purchase securities for their own account are not engaging in municipal
advisory activities.
The Commission notes that, in this context, such banks may, however, depending on the
facts and circumstances, be subject to regulation as “municipal securities dealers.” See
Sections 3(a)(30) and 15B of the Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder.
242

investments discussed above is intended to be responsive to comments about the impact of the
municipal advisor registration requirement on the provision of products and services offered by
banks. The Commission believes that, together, these exemptions to the definition of “municipal
advisor” generally will cover banks with respect to advice that they provide regarding the types of
products and services that commenters referred to as “traditional banking products and services.” 895
For example, commenters identified deposit accounts, which municipal entities typically use for
short-term investments of revenues, as one type of traditional banking product. Under the final
rules, banks that provide advice regarding deposit accounts generally will be explicitly exempt from
the definition of municipal advisor for this type of account. Similarly, banks will be explicitly
exempt with respect to other identified products and services such as letters of credit and sweep
accounts. Additionally, although the final rules would not explicitly exempt certain products and
services such as custody accounts and trust services (unless the bank is serving in the capacity of an
indenture trustee or a similar capacity), a bank providing advice with respect to such products or
services would not be required to register as a municipal advisor, as a result of the narrower
approach with respect to investment strategies, unless such accounts contain proceeds of municipal
securities or municipal escrow investments.
By contrast, however, the Commission is not exempting from registration banks that engage
in municipal advisory activities, including without limitation banks that provide advice to municipal
entities or obligated persons with respect to the issuance of municipal securities, or banks that
provide advice with respect to municipal derivatives, unless the bank qualifies for another exclusion
or exemption, such as under the limited circumstances described above with respect to the

895

See, e.g., supra notes 874 and 875, and accompanying text. See also supra note 884 and
accompanying text (discussing the OCC Letter).
243

exemption for certain swap dealers. 896 As discussed above in the context of the definition of
municipal derivatives and the exemption for certain swap dealers, with the Dodd-Frank Act,
Congress established heightened protection with respect to swaps and security-based swaps, 897 and
the Commission therefore does not believe that a blanket exemption for banks with respect to such
activities would be appropriate. The Commission believes it is important to emphasize that the
bank exemption does not apply to advice on municipal derivatives, which is a significant problem
area identified in the financial crisis in which municipal entities suffered significant losses, 898 and
further, the bank exemption does not apply to advice on the issuance of municipal securities, which
is a core focus of the protections to municipal entities in the municipal advisor registration provision
and is an area in which a blanket exemption to banks would result in a potential inappropriate
competitive advantage to banks over other financial advisors. 899
The Commission believes that the exemption it is providing for banks will help ensure that
parties engaging in key municipal advisory activities are registered, while permitting banks to
continue to provide products and services to municipal entities and obligated persons that do not
pose the types of risks that the Dodd-Frank Act was designed to address. Therefore, for these
reasons and the reasons described above, the Commission finds that it is consistent with the public
interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act, to use its
authority pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(4) to exempt banks engaging in certain

municipal advisory activities from the definition of municipal advisor pursuant to the limitations
described above. Accordingly, such banks are not required to register as municipal advisors.
Separately Identifiable Departments or Divisions
Sections 3(a)(30) and 15B(b)(2)(H) of the Exchange Act provide for the MSRB to define a
separately identifiable department or division of a bank (“SID”) for purposes of whether a bank is a
municipal securities dealer and must register as such. 900 In the Proposal, the Commission
specifically requested comment on whether the Commission should permit SIDs (providing a
bank’s municipal advisory activities) to register as a municipal advisor, rather than the bank
itself. 901 The Commission requested comment on suggested rule text relating to SIDs, based on
MSRB Rule G-1 relating to SIDs engaged in municipal securities dealer activities, 902 and asked:
whether such a rule would provide appropriate conditions for determining whether and when a SID
engaged in municipal advisory activities may register as a municipal advisor; whether there were
reasons the language based on MSRB Rule G-1 should not be used for SIDs engaging in municipal
advisory activities; and whether the language should be modified or clarified in any way, or if there

900

Exchange Act Section 3(a)(30)(B) provides that the term “municipal securities dealer” does
not include banks, unless the bank is engaged in the business of buying and selling
municipal securities for its own account other than in a fiduciary capacity, provided,
however that if the bank is engaged in such activities through a separately identifiable
department or division, the department or division, and not the bank itself, shall be deemed
to be the municipal securities dealer. Exchange Act Section 15B(b)(2)(H) provides for the
MSRB to “define the term ‘separately identifiable department or division’, as that term is
used in [Exchange Act Section 3(a)(30)], in accordance with specified and appropriate
standards to assure that a bank is not deemed to be engaged in the business of buying and
selling municipal securities through a separately identifiable department or division unless
such department or division is organized and administered so as to permit independent
examination and enforcement of applicable provisions of [the Exchange Act], the rules and
regulations thereunder and the rules of the [MSRB].”

was alternative language the Commission should consider. 903 The Commission notes that the
concept of separate treatment for SIDs exists in the current regulatory regimes for both municipal
securities dealers and investment advisers, which both permit the SID to be the regulated entity. 904
Although as discussed above many commenters recommended that the Commission create a
blanket exemption for banks, 905 some commenters specifically recommended that, to the extent a
bank provides products or services that would not be excluded, the Commission should allow a
bank to register a SID if its municipal advisory services or actions are performed through such a
SID. 906 A few commenters 907 additionally stated that permitting registration of SIDs would be
consistent with the registration scheme for municipal securities dealers 908 and investment

SIDs to register instead of the entire banking entity); Union Bank Letter (recommending that
the Commission permit registration of SIDs on a voluntary basis, because given the
dispersion of public finance activities throughout a bank, a bank may not be able to

advisers. 909
The Commission has carefully considered issues raised by commenters on its proposal and
is adopting Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4) to permit a SID that meets the requirements of the rule to register as
a municipal advisor instead of the bank. The Commission agrees with commenters that it is
appropriate to treat banks performing municipal advisory activities through a SID in a manner
consistent with their treatment under the investment adviser and municipal securities dealer
registration regimes. 910 Thus, to the extent a bank provides advice with respect to a municipal
derivative or engages in any other non-exempted municipal advisory activity, if such advice is
provided through a SID that meets the requirements of Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4), the SID, rather than the

909

See Section 202(a)(11)(A).
The Commission notes that the Investment Advisers Act excepts from the definition of
“investment adviser” “a bank, or any bank holding company as defined in the Bank Holding
Company Act of 1956, which is not an investment company,” but provides that the
exception does not apply to “any bank or bank holding company to the extent that such bank
or bank holding company serves or acts as an investment adviser to a registered investment
company.” The Investment Advisers Act also provides that “if in the case of a bank, such
services or actions are performed through a separately identifiable department or division,
the department or division, and not the bank itself, shall be deemed to be the investment
adviser” See Section 202(a)(11) of the Investment Advisers Act.

910

One commenter stated that, “given the dispersion of municipal advisory activities
throughout the bank, banks may not be able to consolidate the activities in a single
department or division as is contemplated in the analogous language for municipal dealer
SIDs” and, as a result, does “not think the referenced language is workable.” This
commenter also stated that the Commission should not dictate the structure of a bank’s
municipal business. See American Bankers Association Letter I.
The Commission notes that it is not requiring banks to consolidate their municipal advisory
activities into a SID. Rather, to the extent that a bank does not otherwise qualify for an
exclusion or exemption (such as the exemption for banks with respect to certain activities
described above), the bank may choose to consolidate its municipal advisory activities into a
SID. In such case, only the SID, and not the bank itself, would be required to register as a
municipal advisor. Also, as discussed further below, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4) would not
preclude a finding that a bank has a SID if the bank’s municipal advisory activities are
conducted in more than one geographic organizational or operational unit, so long as all
such units are identifiable and otherwise meet the requirements of the rule with respect to
each such unit.
247

bank itself, shall be deemed to be the municipal advisor. 911 The Commission believes that
permitting SIDs to register is in the public interest, because it will ensure that municipal entities and
obligated persons receive the regulatory protection intended by the statute, while addressing
commenters’ general concerns about duplicative regulation for banks and the impact of imposing
the municipal advisor registration regime on banks in general. 912
Specifically, as adopted, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4) provides that “[i]f a bank engages in municipal
advisory activities through a separately identifiable department or division that meets the
requirements of [Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4)], the determination of whether those municipal advisory
activities cause any person to be a municipal advisor may be made separately for such department
or division. In such event, that department or division, rather than the bank itself, shall be deemed
to be the municipal advisor.” For purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4), a SID of a bank is defined as
“that unit of the bank which conducts all of the municipal advisory activities of the bank” provided
that certain specific requirements are met. In the Proposal, the Commission suggested defining SID
as such term is defined in Section 3(a)(30) of the Exchange Act. To provide additional clarity,
however, the Commission is eliminating the specific reference to Section 3(a)(30) of the Exchange
Act in the definition of SID that it is adopting because, while based on that definition, Section
3(a)(30) relates specifically to activities of municipal securities dealers, as opposed to municipal
advisory activities. The Commission is also clarifying, consistent with the definition for SIDs
suggested in the Proposal, that the fact that directors and senior officers of the bank may from time
to time set broad policy guidelines affecting the bank as a whole and which are not directly related
to the day-to-day conduct of the bank’s municipal advisory activities, shall not disqualify such unit
or require that such directors or officers be considered as part of such unit. Further, the fact that the

bank’s municipal advisory activities are conducted in more than one geographic organizational or
operational unit of the bank shall not preclude a finding that the bank has a separately identifiable
department or division for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4), provided, however, that all such units
are identifiable and that the requirements of Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4) are met with respect to each such
unit. All such geographic, organizational or operational units of the bank shall be considered in the
aggregate as the separately identifiable department or division of the bank for purposes of this
paragraph Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4). 913 With the exception of the reference to Section 3(a)(30) and the
removal from the rule text of the Commission’s guidance with respect to the activities of directors
and senior officers and multiple geographic locations, the other applicable requirements are
substantively identical to those suggested in the proposal and based on the rules applicable to
municipal securities dealer SIDs. 914
2. Rule 15Ba1-2
a.

Application for Municipal Advisor Registration

Section 15B(a)(1)(B) of the Exchange Act provides that it shall be unlawful for a municipal
advisor to provide advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to
municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, or to undertake a solicitation of
a municipal entity or obligated person, unless the municipal advisor is registered in accordance with
the relevant provisions of the statute. A “municipal advisor” is defined in Section 15B(e)(4) of the
Exchange Act to mean, with certain exceptions, “a person” that “provides advice to or on behalf of

as suggested in the Proposal. See supra note 902.

other differences between the definition suggested in the Proposal and the adopted definition

249

a municipal entity or obligated person … or undertakes a solicitation of a municipal entity.” 915 In
the Proposal, the Commission indicated that the type of information it should gather from firms
versus individuals for registration purposes may be different. 916 As such, the Commission proposed
two different registration forms: Form MA for “municipal advisory firms” and Form MA-I for
“natural person municipal advisors.” 917
In connection with these forms, the Commission also proposed Rule 15Ba1-2(a) and 15Ba12(b) for the registration of municipal advisory firms and natural person municipal advisors,
respectively. Rule 15Ba1-2(a), as proposed, required a “person, other than a natural person,
including a sole proprietor” 918 applying for registration with the Commission as a municipal advisor
to complete Form MA in accordance with the instructions to the form and to file the form
electronically with the Commission. Rule 15Ba1-2(b), as proposed, required a “natural person
(including a sole proprietor)” 919 applying for registration with the Commission as a municipal
advisor to complete Form MA-I in accordance with the instructions to the form and to file the form
electronically with the Commission. This proposed requirement applied to, among others, each

Id.

917

Id. A “municipal advisory firm,” as defined in the Glossary of Terms for the forms and used
hereinafter, is “any organized entity that is a municipal advisor, including sole proprietors.”
A “natural person municipal advisor,” as was defined in the Glossary, as proposed, and used
hereinafter, is “any natural person that is a municipal advisor, including sole proprietors,”
with the further clarification that “[a] sole proprietor that is a municipal advisor is also a
municipal advisory firm.” See also infra notes 918 and 919.

918

This language in proposed paragraph 15Ba1-2(a) is equivalent to the simpler term,
“municipal advisory firm” used in the forms and herein, see supra note 917. The
formulation of the rule language was intended to preclude any misinterpretation of the word
“firm” as excluding sole proprietors.

919

The category to which proposed paragraph 15Ba1-2(b) applied is identical to the “natural
person municipal advisor” defined above. See supra note 917. The formulation of the rule
language was intended to preclude any misinterpretation that would exclude sole
proprietors.
250

individual employee of a firm who meets the definition of municipal advisor. The two proposed
provisions read together required a sole proprietor to complete both Form MA and Form MA-I.
The Commission requested comments on proposed Rule 15Ba1-2(a) and Form MA. The
Commission received no comments directly on proposed Rule 15Ba1-2(a) and is adopting this
provision substantively920 as proposed. 921
The Commission also requested comments on proposed Rule 15Ba1-2(b) and Form MA-I.
Specifically, the Commission solicited comments on the effects of a separate registration
requirement for natural persons and firms and the relative advantages and disadvantages for firms,
municipal advisor employees, municipal entities, obligated persons, investors, and regulators, of
requiring separate registration for natural person municipal advisors. 922 The Commission also
asked, if the Commission were to only require registration of municipal advisory firms, would
inclusion of information regarding the firm’s employees on the firm’s Form MA cause confusion
for municipal entities, obligated persons, and investors. 923 Finally, the Commission also asked

920

The adopted rule, however, is phrased differently. Rule 15Ba1-2(a), as adopted, provides:
“A person applying for registration with the Commission as a municipal advisor pursuant to
section 15B of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4) must complete Form MA (17 CFR 249.1300) in
accordance with the instructions in the Form and file the Form electronically with the
Commission.”
The adopted rule no longer includes the phrase “person, other than a natural person,
including a sole proprietor” to describe the person subject to registration on Form MA. As
discussed below, under the adopted rules, natural persons that engage in municipal advisory
activities solely on behalf of a firm with which they are associated (generally, as employees)
are exempted from registration. Thus, such persons do not need to be excluded from Rule
15Ba1-2(a), which applies to municipal advisors “applying for registration.” In addition,
sole proprietors do not need to be identified specifically among the persons who are required
to complete Form MA.

921

As discussed in the Proposal at 76 FR 838, Rule 15Ba1-2(a) requires firms that are currently
registered on Form MA-T to register anew on Form MA.

what, if any, legal ramifications may result for firms, and/or for natural persons, based on a
registration regime that allows natural person municipal advisors that are employees of a municipal
advisory firm to be registered by their firms as opposed to separate registration. 924
The Commission received several comment letters regarding the proposed requirement for
individual registration of natural person municipal advisors on Form MA-I. 925 One commenter
asserted that the Commission should not require individuals to register separately on Form MA-I. 926
This commenter stated such requirement would not only impose significant burden and costs on
municipal advisory firms and their individual associated persons but also would “force the SEC to
devote substantial resources to processing many individual applications for registration” in addition
to processing municipal advisory firms’ registrations on Form MA. 927 This commenter noted that
the Commission expected approximately 21,800—if not more—individuals to register as municipal
advisors on Form MA-I 928 and that “[t]he sheer number of registrations would place significant
strain on the SEC’s budget and personnel, especially if it plans to review all applications for

926

SIFMA Letter I. The commenter also argued that the separate registration requirement
would be “excessively burdensome and costly.” Although this description was made
primarily in the context of the commenter’s belief that the information requested by Form
MA-I regarding individuals “largely duplicates Form MA’s disclosures regarding a
municipal advisor’s associated persons,” the Commission believes that the commenter also
intended it as a reason to eliminate individual registration regardless of the extent of the
information required on the form. Regarding the commenter’s concern about duplication,
see infra notes 1171-1173 and accompanying discussion.

Id. The commenter added that “[t]his would be in addition to the 800 municipal advisory
firms that have already registered with the SEC on Form MA-T and would be required to reregister on Form MA, and at least 200 additional firms that are also expected to register.”
For the basis of the referenced Commission’s estimate, see Proposal, 76 FR at 865.
252

municipal advisors that are filed under the permanent registration program.” 929 The commenter
questioned “whether the incremental regulatory benefit (which [the commenter] does not believe
would be significant) stemming from the public availability of the information that would be
produced by a system of individual registration would justify this massive resource commitment by
both applicants and the SEC.” 930 Another commenter also suggested that the Commission eliminate
individual registration of registrants’ employees. 931
Two commenters argued that the statute does not require individual registration of natural
person municipal advisors. 932 One of these commenters asserted that the statute appears to intend
that registration of municipal advisors be limited to entities (including partnerships, unincorporated
organizations, and sole proprietors). 933 This commenter also stated that such entities would provide
the critical information about individuals (including associated persons of the municipal advisor
entity) during the registration process. 934
Another commenter believed that “dual reporting” on Forms MA and MA-I “could lead to
confusion” and that “there could be inadvertent inconsistencies in the information.” 935 In particular,
929

by the SEC is not called for in any respect by Section 975”) and MSRB Letter I.

934

Id. The commenter further maintained that forms relating to individuals at municipal
advisor firms should be viewed as officially submitted by the municipal advisor entity. (To
clarify, however, the commenter was questioning why individuals within a firm that is itself
acting as a registered municipal advisor should be viewed as municipal advisors rather than
as associated persons of a municipal advisor.)

935

Deloitte Letter. This letter, like SIFMA Letter I, see supra note 926, tied the argument
against separate registration for individuals to its belief that “separate registration for natural
persons is largely redundant.”
253

the commenter noted that, under the Proposal, natural persons would be required to maintain and
comply with recordkeeping and inspection requirements, which, in the commenter’s view, would be
“a significant burden” without “any meaningful benefit.” The commenter suggested that the
Commission eliminate registration for natural persons altogether, or at least require natural persons
to register as “registered representatives,” without recordkeeping and inspection requirements. 936
Similarly, another commenter believed that, rather than introducing a new Form MA-I to provide
for registration of natural persons, FINRA’s Form U4 should be adapted to allow for registration of
individuals. 937
The Commission has carefully considered the issues raised by commenters on the Proposal.
In response to these comments, the Commission is modifying its approach in the final rules and is
not adopting Rule 15Ba1-2(b) and Form MA-I as proposed. Specifically, the Commission is
exempting certain natural persons from the requirement to register as municipal advisors 938 and is
modifying Rule 15Ba1-2(b) and Form MA-I accordingly. Rule 15Ba1-3, as adopted, exempts from
municipal advisor registration natural persons who are associated persons of a registered municipal
advisor and who engage in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of a registered municipal
advisor. 939 In practical terms, this exemption means that employees of municipal advisory firms
who do not engage in municipal advisory activities independently of their firms (e.g., by engaging
936

See id.

937

See Financial Services Roundtable Letter. See also infra note 992 and accompanying text
for information concerning Form U4 and further discussion.

938

See Rule 15Ba1-3, as adopted, which provides: “A natural person municipal advisor shall
be exempt from section 15B(a)(1)(B) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(1)(B)) if he or she: (a)
[i]s an associated person of an advisor that is registered with the Commission pursuant to
section 15B(a)(2) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2)) and the rules and regulations
thereunder; and (b) [e]ngages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of a
registered municipal advisor.”

939

This exemption does not include sole proprietors, who must register as a municipal advisor
on Form MA and also file a Form MA-I.
254

in municipal advisory activities on the side as a sole proprietor) will not be required to register as
municipal advisors.
While the Commission is not requiring municipal advisor registration for these natural
persons, the Commission is requiring municipal advisory firms to provide the Commission with
information relating to these exempted natural persons. In this regard, Rule 15Ba1-2(b), as adopted,
requires the municipal advisor to complete and file with the Commission Form MA-I for each of its
natural persons who are associated with the municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory
activities on its behalf. 940 While Form MA-I, as adopted, is not a form for individual registration of
natural persons, adopted Form MA-I requires municipal advisory firms to provide similar
information regarding its associated natural persons as proposed Form MA-I required (with some
modifications, as discussed below).
The Commission believes that the information obtained from Form MA-I is necessary and
appropriate to assist the Commission in assuring compliance with Section 15B of the Exchange Act
and the rules thereunder. The Commission believes that exempting certain natural persons from
registration and requiring municipal advisors to complete and file a Form MA-I for certain
exempted natural persons retains the benefits of individual registration discussed in the Proposal
while also addressing the concerns raised by commenters. Specifically, the final rules and forms

940

See Rule 15Ba1-2(b), as adopted, which provides: “(1) A person applying for registration or
registered with the Commission as a municipal advisor pursuant to section 15B of the Act
(15 U.S.C. 78o-4) must complete Form MA-I (17 CFR 249.1310) with respect to each
natural person who is a person associated with the municipal advisor (as defined in section
15B(e)(7) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(7))) and engaged in municipal advisory activities
on its behalf in accordance with the instructions in the Form and file the Form electronically
with the Commission. (2) A natural person applying for registration with the Commission
as a municipal advisor pursuant to section 15B of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4), in addition to
completing and filing Form MA pursuant to paragraph (a), must complete Form MA-I (17
CFR 249.1310) in accordance with the instructions in the Form and file the Form
electronically with the Commission.”
255

mitigate commenters’ concerns about imposing registration obligations upon the large number of
individuals without negating the important disclosures and other benefits that the Commission
believes would be obtained through Form MA-I. 941 For example, as discussed in the Proposal, the
information provided by Form MA-I would help the Commission (i) manage its regulatory and
examination programs by assisting the Commission in identifying municipal advisors and
understanding their business structures; (ii) prepare for its inspection and examination of municipal
advisors; and (iii) oversee the municipal securities market and investigate possible wrongdoing. 942
This approach would also provide municipal entities, obligated persons, investors, and other
regulators with information that would inform them as to the relevant municipal advisory
experience and history of each natural person for whom the municipal advisor completed and filed a
Form MA-I. 943
This approach also would help to streamline the manner of gathering pertinent information,
reduce confusion in the disclosure process, and reduce inconsistencies in the information reported
because the municipal advisory firm will be required to complete and file Form MA and Form MAI for each of the associated natural persons engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf. 944
Indeed, commenters observed that a registered municipal advisory firm should provide critical
information about its employees who engage in municipal advisory activities, rather than require the
individual’s separate registration. 945 Accordingly, as adopted, Rule 15Ba1-2(b), Rule 15Ba1-3, and

941

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter I.

942

See Proposal, 76 FR at 850.

943

See id., at 851.

944

This approach does not address the argument of commenters that Form MA-I is redundant
of Form MA. That issue is addressed in the discussion below regarding the information
requested in Form MA-I. See infra notes 1171-1173 and accompanying text.

945

See, e.g., MSRB Letter I.
256

Form MA-I will serve this purpose. Finally, the Commission also believes that eliminating the
requirement for individual municipal advisors to separately register addresses commenters’
concerns regarding regulatory efficiency, as it will allow the Commission to direct resources that
would have otherwise been required to review many thousands of these individuals’ applications to
other regulatory matters.
As stated above, one commenter argued against individual registration, claiming that, under
the Proposal, natural persons would be required to maintain and comply with recordkeeping and
inspection requirements, which, in the commenter’s view, would be “a significant burden” without
“any meaningful benefit.” 946 The Commission notes, however, that the recordkeeping obligations
imposed by the Proposal always applied only to municipal advisory firms. 947
The Commission recognizes that the rule, as adopted, places on municipal advisory firms an
obligation to file a Form MA-I for each individual employee that acts as a municipal advisor on its
behalf. The Commission notes that, in the context of broker-dealer regulation, Form U4, which is
required of individual employees and asks for much the same information as Form MA-I, is
generally filed by the employees’ firms. 948 Indeed, commenters appeared to favor a regime in
which firms submit information regarding their employees rather than one in which each employee

946

See id.

947

As proposed, the text of Rule 240.15Ba1-7(a) provided: “Every person, other than a natural
person, including sole proprietors, registered or required to be registered under Section 15B
of the Securities Exchange Act … shall make and keep true, accurate, and current the
following books and records relating to its municipal advisory activities ….” (emphasis
added). See Proposal, 76 FR at 883. The highlighted language is retained in the
recordkeeping rule, as adopted, which has been renumbered as Rule 240.15Ba1-8. See infra
Section III.C.

948

The Commission notes, moreover, that Form U4 is used for registration. Under the rules as
adopted Form MA-I is not a registration form. It is a form to obtain information about
persons who engage in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firm.
257

submits information separately. 949
The Commission notes further that, as described below, 950 the information that firms will
need to obtain to complete Form MA-I is primarily the individual’s full legal and other names,
social security number, and employment and residential history, other business activities in which
the employee is engaged, and his or her disciplinary history. The Commission notes that, in any
case, a firm generally must obtain information regarding any relevant criminal, regulatory, or civil
judicial history concerning any of its associated persons 951 in order to accurately complete Form
MA for purposes of its own registration. 952 In addition, to help ensure adequate regulatory
oversight, aid the prosecution of wrongdoing, and benefit municipal entities and investors, the final
Form MA-I collects substantially the same information as required under the proposed form. 953
Moreover, although under the adopted rules employees of municipal advisory firms are not required
to register independently, they are otherwise not exempt from any other provision relating to
949

See, e.g., MSRB Letter I and citation at supra note 934. See also Deloitte Letter, stating:
“Alternatively, if the SEC does not eliminate separate registration for natural persons, the
Commission should require such persons to register as registered representatives of
municipal advisors, as is done in the broker-dealer context, rather than as municipal
advisors.” Although the commenter is suggesting an alternative kind of registration for
natural persons, and does not specifically state that the applications for registration of such
persons would be filed by their firms, the analogy to the broker-dealer context suggests that
the proposed alternative would operate in a similar manner, where firms file an individual’s
Form U4.

950

See infra Section III.A.2.c., “Information Requested in Form MA-I.”

951

See infra note 1054 for the meaning of “associated persons” in this context.

952

See infra Section III.A.2.b., under “Item 9: Disclosure Information and Related DRPs.”
Thus, for purposes of completing an employee’s Form MA-I, a firm will additionally need
to obtain the information required by the form concerning investigations of the employee;
customer complaints, arbitration, and civil litigation relating to municipal advisor-related or
investment-related matters involving the employee; terminations of the employee; and
outstanding judgments or liens against the employee. This information is substantially the
same as required by Form MA-I under the Proposal, with the modifications discussed below.
See infra Section III.A.2.c., “Information Requested in Form MA-I.”

municipal advisors.
The Commission received no comments on the requirement, under the Proposal, for a sole
proprietor to file both Form MA and Form MA-I. Accordingly, the Commission is retaining this
requirement in the rules, although, in view of the other changes described above, a provision has
been added to set forth explicitly that a natural person applying for registration must file Form MAI in addition to Form MA. 954
The Commission stated in the Proposal that it was considering whether Form MA and Form
MA-I should be submitted through the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and
Retrieval System (“EDGAR”) or otherwise. 955 The Commission requested comment on whether
the electronic registration system to be established should have the ability to cross-check other
electronic systems, such as IARD and CRD, and whether requiring the filing of forms on EDGAR
would be an appropriate means to make the requested information available. 956
Two commenters favored the use of FINRA’s electronic registration system for CRD and
IARD or some similar system for the registration of municipal advisors. 957 One commenter stated
that this system would “allow regulators to easily find filings for firms and individuals, as well as

954

See Rule 15Ba1-2(b)(2) of the adopted rules, 17 CFR 240.15Ba1-2(b)(2), which provides:
“A natural person applying for registration with the Commission as a municipal advisor
pursuant to section 15B of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4), in addition to completing and filing
Form MA pursuant to paragraph (a), must complete Form MA-I (17 CFR 249.1310) in
accordance with the instructions in the Form and file the Form electronically with the
Commission.” The addition of Rule 15Ba1-2(b)(2), which relates to sole proprietors, was
necessary because Rule 15Ba1-2(b)(1), as adopted, is worded specifically to require
municipal advisors that are firms to file Form MA-I with respect to associated persons who
engage in municipal advisory activities on their behalves, and would not by definition apply
to sole proprietors.

cross reference between the CRD and IARD systems.” 958 The commenters believed that use of
FINRA’s system would allay concerns that EDGAR would subject registration information to
“unnecessary public scrutiny” 959 and “compromise the confidentiality of operating performance
data for privately held Municipal Advisors.” 960
After carefully considering the comments, the Commission has determined to require the
forms to be submitted through EDGAR. 961 Although EDGAR is known primarily as the vehicle
through which public companies file their annual and quarterly reports and other disclosures, the
Commission has adapted EDGAR for other information gathering purposes. 962 Further, collecting
information regarding municipal advisors through EDGAR should enable the Commission to
efficiently retrieve and analyze data in a cost-effective manner to carry out its oversight of
municipal advisors and their municipal advisory activities. The Commission notes that, while
IARD, which is an electronic filing system that facilitates investment adviser registration, is funded

961

As discussed in the Proposal, because the registration forms will be required to be submitted
through EDGAR, the electronic filing requirements of Regulation S-T will apply. See
generally 17 CFR 232 (governing the electronic submission of documents filed with the
Commission). The Commission will provide, in the municipal securities area of its website,
full instructions on how applicants for municipal advisor registration that are not currently
EDGAR filers can acquire authorized codes to access the system. These instructions have
now also been added to the General Instructions for the Form MA series. General
information about EDGAR is available at http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar.shtml, where the
EDGAR Filer Manual can also be accessed. The Commission recommends that applicants
read this filer manual before they begin using the system.

962

Most recently, for example, the Commission determined to adapt EDGAR to accept Form
13H filings required under the “Large Trader Reporting” regime established by new Rule
13h-1 under Section 13(h) of the Exchange Act. See Securities Exchange Act Release No.
64976 (July 27, 2011), 76 FR 46960 (August 3, 2011).
260

through user fees, 963 there is no comparable provision in Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act
authorizing the Commission to charge municipal advisors (or to authorize another entity to collect)
registration fees. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to leverage its existing technology
to serve as a mechanism by which municipal advisors can register with the Commission. The
Commission further notes that EDGAR is a widely utilized resource that is already familiar to
investors and other interested parties seeking information about public companies, and believes that
municipal entities, investors, other regulators, and members of the public seeking information about
municipal advisors should not have difficulty learning how to use the system.
Regarding the comment that the use of FINRA’s CRD and IARD systems would be
preferable because it would allow regulators to cross reference the information in Forms MA and
MA-I with information in those other systems, the Commission notes that, as discussed further
below, Form MA requires a municipal advisor that has been assigned a number either under the
CRD system or the IARD system (a ‘‘CRD Number’’) to provide that number in completing the
form. 964 In addition, Form MA asks an applicant specifically whether it is registered with the
Commission in various other capacities (e.g., municipal securities dealer, government securities
broker-dealer, or other category that the applicant must specify) and, if so, to provide the relevant
file numbers. 965 In a similar fashion, an applicant is required to supply file numbers for any
registrations it has with another federal agency or state or other U.S. jurisdiction. 966 Form MA-I
requires the municipal advisory firm filing the form to provide the relevant individual’s CRD

963

See Section 204(c) of the Advisers Act, which permits the Commission to charge fees
associated with filings and the maintenance of a filing system.

964

Number, if registered on the CRD or IARD system; list any other names by which the individual is
known or has been known; and provide the name, registration number, and the firm’s EDGAR CIK
(Central Index Key) number. 967 These identifying numbers should assist municipal entities,
regulators, and the public to access any other publicly available information about the municipal
advisor. Although EDGAR will not automatically provide an electronic link to the information on
the CRD and IARD systems, these systems are nevertheless readily accessible to regulators,
municipal entities, and to the public.
With respect to commenters’ concerns regarding privacy, the Commission notes that, while
information required in Form MA and Form MA-I generally will not be confidential, some
information, such as social security numbers, will be kept confidential (subject to the provisions of
applicable law). 968 The EDGAR system will block the relevant information in these forms in the
versions that will be made public.
One commenter argued that information relating to operating performance of privately held

See infra Section III.A.2.c., “Information Requested in Form MA-I,” discussion of Items 1
and 2, “Identifying Information and Other Names.”

968

The Proposal specified that social security numbers would not be made public. See
Proposal, 76 FR at 867, 868, and 869. The forms, as adopted, specify additional instances in
which responses will be kept confidential subject to the provisions of applicable law. See,
e.g., Item 8 of Schedule A of Form MA (advising applicants that social security numbers,
foreign identity numbers, and dates of birth will not be publicly disseminated) and Item 3 of
Form MA-I, as adopted (advising that private residential addresses disclosed in completing
the residential history section of the form will not be included in publicly available
versions). The Commission has determined that it is appropriate to block this information
from public view, as well. To make this clear, in the forms, as adopted, in each place where
an applicant is asked for a social security number, foreign identity number, private
residential address, or a date of birth, guidance has been added stating that the information
will not be included in publicly available versions of the form. In addition, at various other
places in the forms that ask for an address, the filer is asked to indicate whether the address
provided in response is a private residence and is advised that, if so, the address will not be
included in publicly available versions of the form. One of the DRPs in Form MA-I, which
asked whether the docket or case number of a particular case is the municipal advisor’s
social security number, bank card number, or personal identification number, has been
deleted as unnecessary.
262

municipal advisors should be kept confidential. 969 The commenter did not specify which particular
questions in the forms it considered problematic. The Commission believes, however, that the
public interest in making the information available – to allow municipal entities to better evaluate
candidates for service in municipal advisory roles and to provide investors in municipal securities
with clearer knowledge of who may be influencing the use and outcome of their investments –
outweighs this type of confidentiality concern. 970
The Commission received no comments on the requirement in proposed Rules 15Ba1-2(a)
and (b) that Forms MA and MA-I, respectively, must be filed electronically, and is adopting this
requirement as proposed. The Commission also received no comments on paragraph (c) of
proposed Rule 15Ba1-2, which provided that the forms would be considered filed with the
Commission “upon acceptance by the [applicable electronic system].” However, the Commission is
adopting the rule with modifications.
As proposed, Rule 15Ba1-2 provides that Forms MA and MA-I “shall be considered filed
with the Commission upon acceptance by the [applicable electronic system].” As adopted, the rule
instead provides that the forms are considered filed upon “submission of a completed Form MA,
together with all additional required documents, including all required filings of Form MA-I (17
CFR 249.1310)…” The Commission is modifying the rule to state that the form is considered filed
upon “submission” to EDGAR rather than upon “acceptance” to align the rule with the terminology
used by the EDGAR system. Further, the Commission is modifying the rule to provide that Form
MA will be considered filed upon submission of a “completed Form MA, together with all
969

See supra note 960.

970

Form ADV, upon which Form MA was substantially modeled (see text accompanying infra
note 975), requires a similar level of disclosure. The Commission would make this
information publicly available regardless of the electronic registration system that is used.
See also infra notes 1046 and 1048 and accompanying text.
263

additional required documents,” to clarify that, if a Form MA is not considered complete, the
Commission’s statutory forty-five day review period will not commence. 971 Moreover, because a
municipal advisor applying for registration under the final rules is responsible for submitting Form
MA-I for each associated person engaging in municipal advisory activities on its behalf, the
Commission believes it appropriate to stipulate that the firm’s application for registration will be
considered filed only if the firm has submitted all requisite Form MA-Is.
When an applicant attempts to transmit its Form MA electronically, EDGAR performs the
initial automated checks to determine whether questions that require responses have been answered
and to detect, in certain instances, defective responses. For example, if an applicant indicates that it
has three websites but provides, contrary to instructions, only two corresponding website addresses,
EDGAR will detect the deficiency. 972 In such instance, EDGAR will not permit the applicant’s
submission. However, if a form passes EDGAR’s automated checks, EDGAR will display a
message indicating that the submission was successfully transmitted and will provide an “accession
number,” which permits the applicant to enter the system to check the status of its application. At
this point, the applicant is also advised that its application is not “accepted,” which is an EDGAR
term for not “approved,” and EDGAR will display the status of the application as “In Progress.”
Once an application passes EDGAR’s initial automated check and is successfully
transmitted, the Commission staff will check the application for the types of deficiencies that may
not be detected through automation, and if the Form MA is considered incomplete, the applicant
will receive by email an EDGAR-generated notice of suspension. The notice will inform the
971

If a Form MA is complete and all additional required documents are attached, the form is
considered filed and the forty-five day period for the Commission to act upon the
application (i.e., either approve or institute proceedings to determine whether it should be
denied) begins.

972

See infra note 1003 for more examples.
264

applicant that the transmission has been suspended and the reason for the suspension. The notice
will also instruct the applicant to make corrections and re-transmit the application to the
Commission in its entirety.
The Commission notes that, within forty-five days of the date a complete Form MA is
considered filed, the Commission shall by order grant registration or institute proceedings to
determine whether registration should be denied. The Commission also notes that the statutory
review period for a filed Form MA may be longer if the applicant consents to a longer time period.
If the Commission determines to grant registration, an EDGAR-generated email will be sent to
inform the applicant that the filing has been “accepted” and the Commission will issue a formal
order of approval separately.
The Proposed paragraph (d) of Rule 15Ba1-2 provided that Forms MA and MA-I constitute
“reports” within the meaning of Sections 15B(c), 17(a), 18(a), 32(a) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c), 78q(a),
78r(a), 78ff(a)) and other applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. 973 The Commission received
no comments on paragraph (d) and is adopting this provision as proposed. As a consequence, it is
unlawful for a municipal advisor to willfully make or cause to be made, a false or misleading
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact in Form MA or Form MA-I.
b. Information Requested in Form MA
Municipal advisors that are municipal advisory firms (including sole proprietors) must
submit Form MA to register with the Commission. The Commission received several comments, as
discussed further below, on the information it proposed to require from applicants in completing
Form MA. 974 After carefully considering the comments, the Commission is adopting Form MA
substantially as proposed, with some modifications, as discussed below.
973

See Rule 15Ba1-2(d).

974

See infra notes 979-987.
265

Form MA is modeled primarily on Form ADV (Part 1), 975 which is used for the registration
of investment advisers with the Commission, with appropriate changes made to reflect the
differences in the activities of municipal advisors and the markets that they serve. The information
that applicants are required to provide on the form is described in detail below. As discussed in the
Proposal, the items in Form MA were drafted broadly to apply to the different types of municipal
advisors that may register with the Commission.976
Form MA asks for information about the municipal advisor and persons associated with the
advisor. The Commission believes it necessary to obtain the requested information to manage the
Commission’s regulatory and examination programs and to make such information available to the
MSRB to better inform its regulation of municipal advisors. The information will assist the
Commission in identifying municipal advisors, their owners, and their business models, and in
determining whether a municipal advisor might present sufficient concerns as to warrant the
Commission’s further attention in order to protect the municipal advisor’s clients. In addition, the
information will assist the Commission in understanding the kinds of activities in which the
applicant participates. The information will also be useful to the Commission in tailoring any
requests for additional information that the Commission may send to a municipal advisor.
Furthermore, the required information will assist the Commission in the preparation of the
Commission’s inspection and examination of municipal advisors and the MSRB in determining
what regulations for municipal advisors may be necessary or appropriate and how such regulations
might be best implemented. 977
Moreover, the Commission believes that the information sought will enable municipal

266

entities and potential obligated persons to better assess the experience and background of municipal
advisors in deciding whether to engage the services of, or do business with, any particular municipal
advisor. Similarly, information about the persons serving as municipal advisors can be important to
investors in deciding whether to purchase specific municipal securities. In determining what
information should be disclosed, the Commission also considered the broader public interest in the
availability of information about municipal advisors to the public. 978
The Commission received several comments regarding the extent and kind of information
sought on Form MA, as a general matter, and the impact that the requirement to provide this
information will have on municipal advisors. 979 While one commenter generally approved of the
content of the questions, most of the commenters on this subject believed that the scope of
information sought was too broad, that the form should ask different questions for different kinds of
municipal advisors, or that providing the answers would be too burdensome.
Specifically, one commenter stated its belief that the information requested was “generally
appropriate” and that it would assist the Commission in its examination and enforcement activities
as well as assist its rulemaking activities. 980 Another commenter stated that it does not object in

See, e.g., Acacia Financial Group Letter; Financial Services Roundtable Letter; JP Morgan
Chase Letter; Managed Funds Association Letter; MSRB Letter I; NAESCO Letter; SIFMA
Letter I; Specialized Public Finance Letter.

980

See MSRB Letter I. The MSRB also expressed the hope that the Commission would receive
“significant meaningful feedback from small municipal advisors regarding the potential
burdens the Rule Proposal would impose, and give due weight to such feedback in light of
the Congressional intent regarding regulatory burden on small municipal advisors.” At the
same time, the MSRB believed that the information gleaned from the forms will “help the
MSRB to better gauge the parameters of what should be considered a small municipal
advisor and to structure its rules to effectuate the intent of Section 15B(b)(2)(L)(iv) [of the
Exchange Act],” which requires that the MSRB “not impose a regulatory burden on small
municipal advisors that is not necessary or appropriate in the public interest and for the
protection of investors, municipal entities, and obligated persons, provided that there is
robust protection of investors against fraud.”
267

principle to requiring municipal advisors to make disclosures similar to the disclosures required of
registered investment advisers, but urged that the Commission “tailor carefully” any disclosure
document to “ensure that the information to be disclosed relates only to the municipal advisor
activities of the provider, rather than broadly requiring companies to disclose information unrelated
to municipal advisory activities.” 981 Another commenter suggested that the forms be tailored for
various categories of advisors, instead of a “one-size-fits-all” approach. 982 According to another
commenter, “the disclosures required for investment advisers on Form ADV, on which proposed
Form MA is based, are, in many cases, not relevant to municipal advisors.” 983 The commenter
maintained that many of the other questions drawn from Form ADV are “not likely to obtain useful
responses from municipal advisors” and that the Commission “has not articulated a convincing
purpose for much of the information.” 984
Some commenters additionally believed that supplying the information requested on the
proposed forms would be too burdensome on certain firms and individuals, but varied on the
specifics. 985 On the one hand, some commenters believed, as one commenter expressed, that “the
scope of the proposed information to be collected” in Form MA “is exhaustive and could place a

984

See id. The commenter cited in particular in this regard the proposed disclosure
requirements in Form MA relating to a municipal advisor’s clients; compensation
arrangements; other business activities; financial industry affiliations; proprietary and sales
interests in its municipal advisory clients’ transactions; and investment or brokerage
discretion. The Commission believes that information in each of these areas can shed light
on the possible conflicts of interest that a municipal advisor may have when providing
advice. See also infra notes 1065, 1087, and 1119 and accompanying text, regarding this
commenter’s comments relating specifically to disclosures about affiliates and other
associated persons.

See, e.g., Acacia Financial Group Letter, SIFMA Letter I.
268

burden on small municipal advisors.” 986 On the other hand, one commenter believed that large
organizations would incur “significant time, burden, and expense in identifying personnel involved
in activities that would subject them to registration.” 987
In considering these comments, the Commission carefully analyzed each aspect of Form
MA as set forth in the Proposal, consulting with and drawing on the experience and expertise of
Commission’s enforcement and examination staffs. As already stated, the Commission had paid
conscious and due attention in developing Form MA to the differences between the activities of
investment advisers and those of municipal advisors. The Commission has analyzed proposed
Form MA in the light of the comments received, specifically with an eye to making any possible
further adjustments to reflect the field of municipal advisory activities and to remove any proposed
elements of Form MA that are not appropriate to the regulation of municipal advisors or valuable
for such regulation in consideration of the burdens of completing the form.
The Commission continues to believe that the information requested will be valuable in
establishing and maintaining effective oversight of municipal advisors. The various purposes to
which the Commission intends to put the information to use, as well as its value for municipal
entities and investors, have been broadly described above. The decision to model Form MA on
Form ADV was based, in part, on the Commission’s belief that the level of information sought in
Form ADV is important, appropriate, and not unduly burdensome for participants engaged in
providing investment advice, bearing in mind the goal of protection of investors and the public
interest. The Commission believes that the regulation of municipal advisors warrants obtaining a
similar level of information as pertinent to municipal advisors. 988 The Commission notes that the

For example, knowledge of the kind of clients that a municipal advisor serves may be useful
269

MSRB, the statutorily mandated rulemaking body for the municipal securities market, believes that
the information obtained generally will contribute to the Commission’s and its own regulatory
activities. 989
Some commenters believed that the information sought by Form MA with respect to many
municipal advisors is information already available to the Commission through other registrations
and that the proposed disclosures would therefore be redundant. 990 One commenter argued that
“adding new layers of regulation in this area will not serve to enhance the protection of municipal
entities or investors.” 991 Another commenter contended that it would be “more efficient for the

to a municipal entity in determining whether that advisor has the background and expertise
necessary to provide advice regarding the issuance that the entity is contemplating.
Similarly, information regarding the advisor’s compensation arrangements generally may
help a municipal entity evaluate the advisor’s proposed compensation arrangements for the
issuance under consideration. Such information can also be valuable to regulators in
uncovering irregularities when questions are raised regarding a municipal advisor’s motives
and/or business conduct with respect to a particular transaction. The information that a
municipal advisor provides regarding its other business activities, its financial industry
affiliations, the proprietary and sales interests it may have in its municipal advisory clients’
transactions, and the investment or brokerage discretion that it is granted in carrying out its
services may help municipal entities, investors in municipal securities, and regulators assess
whether conflicts of interest may affect the advice that the firm provides or may have
influenced its advice in a transaction under investigation. The Commission believes that
obtaining such information is consistent with the intent of the Dodd-Frank Act in
establishing a regulatory framework for municipal advisory activities.
989

See MSRB Letter I. The MSRB also commented that the Commission “should give due
weight to feedback from small municipal advisors regarding the potential burdens in light of
the Congressional intent regarding regulatory burden on small municipal advisors.” See id.
The Commission addresses the burden for smaller municipal advisory firms in the Final
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis below. See infra Section IX.

See also Financial Services Roundtable Letter (maintaining that, for registered brokerdealers, “Form MA is largely duplicative of Form BD”); and Managed Funds Association

SEC to leverage existing registration forms, which have years of interpretive guidance behind them,
than to create a new form seeking much of the same information as required by Forms BD and
U4.” 992 To address this issue, some suggested that the Commission allow persons that are already
registered with the Commission – such as broker-dealers, investment advisers, and municipal
securities dealers – to check an additional box on their primary registration forms already filed with
the Commission or to provide them with a short-form registration process. 993 Short of this,
commenters urged that, if such persons must complete Form MA, they should be allowed to
incorporate by reference on Form MA any information that is included on another registration form
and be required to provide on Form MA only such additional information as deemed essential
regarding municipal advisory activities. 994
The Commission notes that Form MA, both as proposed and adopted, allow for
incorporation by reference of certain information that already has been submitted on certain other
forms by the applicant, any of its associated persons, or another entity pursuant to the requirements
of other regulatory regimes. Specifically, each of the Disclosure Reporting Pages (“DRPs”) of
Form MA permits incorporation by reference to DRPs that are already on file with regulators. 995

Securities Industry Registration or Transfer, available at

993

See SIFMA Letter I. See also Managed Funds Association Letter, Financial Services
Roundtable Letter.
Also, one commenter suggested that, instead of registering a second time as a municipal
advisor, an investment adviser should be permitted to amend its Form ADV to reflect the
fact that it engages in municipal advisory activities. This commenter also suggested
permitting state-registered investment advisers to register as municipal advisors by
amending their Forms ADV. See ABA Letter.

994

See SIFMA Letter I, ABA Letter.

995

As explained below, Item 9 of Form MA requires an applicant to provide certain
information concerning any criminal, regulatory, and civil judicial actions relating to the
271

The DRPs are generally where the most significant amount of information is requested on Form
MA and on which applicants will likely need to expend the most time and effort.
Form MA, as adopted, more prominently highlights the option to incorporate information by
reference. Part A of each DRP asks for basic information regarding the person(s) or entity(ies)
concerning whom the DRP must be filed. Immediately thereafter, in Part B, the form asks if there is
another DRP or other disclosure already on file in the IARD, CRD, or EDGAR system containing
the information required by the DRP. If the answer is “Yes,” the form asks the applicant to identify
where the disclosures may be found. In addition, for the benefit of regulators, municipal entities,
and other interested parties, the DRPs ask for information that will enable such parties to locate the
referenced document easily, by requiring the applicant to provide the name of the registrant on the
referenced document, the relevant registration number, and other identifying information. Thus, for
all persons for whom disclosures of criminal, regulatory, and civil judicial actions must be made,
Form MA already allows for incorporation by reference. The Commission believes that the
accommodation of incorporation by reference for these disclosures will eliminate a significant
amount of redundancy to which the commenters refer.
The Commission believes that commenters’ suggestion to allow applicants already
registered with the Commission under other regulatory regimes to check an additional box on their
primary registration forms 996 would not achieve the aim of the municipal advisor registration

applicant or any of its associated persons. For each action reported in Item 9, the applicant
is required to complete a DRP by providing for further details, such as the court where the
charges were filed and when, a description of the charge and the circumstances relating to it
(in the case of criminal actions); the authority that initiated the action and a description of
the allegations and the product-type (in the case of regulatory actions); or the initiator of the
court action, the relief sought, and the product type (in the case of civil judicial actions).
The information sought in the DRPs of Form MA is similar to information sought in DRPs
that must be filed, as applicable, with Forms BD, ADV, and U4.
996

See supra note 993.
272

regime. Specifically, the Commission believes that persons seeking to compile, compare, and
analyze data pertaining to registered municipal advisors, as well as regulators overseeing
compliance with rules and regulations applicable to registered municipal advisors, should generally
be able to easily access within one system relevant information about municipal advisors.
The Commission notes that the vast majority of applicants registering under the permanent
registration regime would be new Commission registrants. 997 As such, the majority of all
information pertaining to municipal advisors will be centralized in EDGAR. On the other hand, the
Commission acknowledges that, because disclosures required by Form MA DRPs and Form MA-I
DRPs may be incorporated by reference from other forms, some information will reside outside
EDGAR. However, the Commission notes that, under the temporary registration regime, only about
15% of applicants on Form MA-T indicated a history of criminal, regulatory, or civil judicial action
that would require the submission of DRPs under the permanent registration regime. Moreover, not
all 15% of municipal advisors indicating such a history would have DRPs on file elsewhere, as
many may not be broker-dealers or investment advisers and thus would not be required to file Form
BD or Form ADV. Accordingly, the Commission believes that fewer than 15% of municipal
advisors should have DRP information stored outside EDGAR, with the majority of information
collected under the permanent municipal advisor regime centralized in EDGAR. The Commission
also notes that, if applicants that are already registered with the Commission under other regulatory
regimes can register as municipal advisors by only checking an additional box on their primary
registration form, a municipal entity or investor seeking information about a municipal advisor may
997

According to MA-T data as of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 1,110 Form
MA-T registrants. Of these Form MA-T registrants, 226 were also registered with the
Commission as broker-dealers; 39 were also registered with the Commission as investment
advisers; and 65 were registered with the Commission as both broker-dealers and investment
advisers. Therefore, the vast majority of Form MA-T registrants were new Commission
registrants.
273

not realize that the information they seek is available on a Form BD or ADV, rather than a Form
MA or MA-I.
Description of the Form: Introduction
As previously noted, in addition to considering the comments, the Commission analyzed the
entire proposed Form MA and its appended schedules and disclosure pages to make any necessary
adjustments. The discussion below describes Form MA, as adopted, and notes the substantive
changes to the proposed form. At the outset, the Commission notes that it is making some revisions
to clarify questions asked in Form MA. Other revisions are intended to elicit additional
information. The Commission believes that the additional required data should make the
information provided by registrants more useful to examiners, investigators, and other regulatory
authorities and/or to municipal entities and investors. 998
As noted below, the Commission made some revisions to the form to eliminate unnecessary
disclosure requirements. Other changes involve a reorganization of the requested information. In
general, the Commission intends to improve the picture that municipal entities, investors, and
regulators will be able to obtain from Form MAs, whether regarding municipal advisors, in
particular, or regarding municipal advisory activities, as a whole. For example, while the proposed
DRPs required information generally regarding the disposition of criminal charges or resolution of
regulatory or civil proceedings, in the DRPs, as adopted, the questions are more specific and require
certain additional details. 999
Format of Form MA
998

Although some commenters believed, generally, that the forms, as proposed, required too
much information, the Commission believes that the modifications it has made to the forms
that ask for additional information will elicit information that can be of significant use to
regulators and municipal entities. The discussion below includes the reasons why, in each
significant case, the Commission has made the revision. See, e.g., infra notes 1028-1030.

999

See further the discussion below regarding Item 9 of Form MA.
274

Form MA, as proposed, required the applicant to provide information describing itself and
its business through a series of fill-in-the-blank, multiple choice, and the check-the-box
questions. 1000 In the form, as adopted, these questions have been adapted to an electronic, webbased format, 1001 with minor revisions to the text as necessary or appropriate for online
completion. 1002 As stated above, EDGAR is designed to detect certain failures to respond to
mandatory questions and, to detect, in certain instances, defective responses. 1003

1000

No comments were received on the format of the form.

1001

For example, where the paper form asked a Yes or No question and, if the answer is Yes,
other questions must be answered, in the electronic form those additional questions will
appear only if the applicant selected Yes. In the paper form, in some instances when the
applicant answers Yes, the form instructs the applicant to supply additional information in
Schedule D of the form. In the electronic form, a pop-up screen appears that immediately
enables the applicant to complete the additional information. Filers will be able to obtain a
paper version of the form at any time through the electronic system, which should help them
anticipate in advance the information they will need to gather to complete on the online
form. In addition, filers will be able to print out a hard copy version of the form with their
responses included in their appropriate places on the form.

1002

Certain documents, such as a signed and notarized Form MA-NR (required of certain nonresidents as discussed below) or copies of court orders required as part of a DRP will need to
be converted into a portable document file (PDF) meeting the specifications set forth in the
EDGAR Filer Manual, supra note 961, and attached to the electronic submission.

1003

Some examples: If an applicant provides an EDGAR CIK number, the name of the
company will be pre-populated in the electronic form with the name assigned to that CIK
number and the applicant will not be permitted to list a different name. When an applicant
indicates that it is registered under another Commission regulatory regime but supplies a
registration number for that regulatory regime that cannot be valid because it is not in the
correct numbering format, the system will prevent the applicant from filing the form. If an
applicant answers affirmatively to a question that asks whether it only engages in solicitation
and does not advise clients, it will not be possible to indicate in response to another question
that it advises clients and does not solicit. If an applicant indicates that it has three websites
but provides the addresses of only two, the system will not permit submission of the form.
If an applicant discloses that it or an associated person has been involved in a criminal,
regulatory, or civil judicial action, the system will prevent the applicant from filing the form
if the appropriate DRP is not completed. If the principal address of a firm in Form MA or
the residence of an individual reported in Form MA-I is in a foreign country (which the
system can detect because states and countries are indicated by selecting the appropriate
name in a drop-down box), the system will not permit submission of the form unless, at the
appropriate step in the form, a Form MA-NR is attached.
275

Form MA also contains several supplemental schedules that must be completed, where
applicable, each of which is discussed further below: Schedule A asks for information about the
municipal advisor’s direct owners and executive officers; Schedule B asks for information about the
municipal advisor’s indirect owners; Schedule C is used to amend information on either Schedule A
or Schedule B; and Schedule D asks for additional information when an applicant answers in the
affirmative regarding certain questions in the form and also provides space for any explanations that
a filer may wish to add to its application. Form MA also contains DRPs, which require further
details about events and proceedings involving the municipal advisor and/or the municipal advisor’s
associated persons that the applicant was required to report in Item 9 of the main body of the form,
and are discussed in the context of Item 9 below.
Form MA, as proposed, first required a municipal advisor to indicate whether it is
submitting the form for initial registration as a municipal advisor or submitting an annual update or
an amendment (other than an annual update) to a registration as a municipal advisor. 1004 In the
electronic form, as adopted, Form MA asks the applicant to indicate, upon entry, whether it is filing
an initial form, an annual update, or amendment. Once an initial form is submitted, when a filer
subsequently enters the system and selects the choice of annual update or amendment, the most
recently submitted version of the form will appear, pre-populated with the responses as completed
at that time. Thus, the filer will need only to amend the outdated information.
Item 1: Identifying Information
The Commission proposed Item 1 of Form MA to require essential identifying information
regarding the applicant. For the reasons discussed below and in the Proposal, 1005 the Commission is
adopting Item 1 substantially as proposed but with the minor modifications discussed below.
1004

Amendments to Form MA are discussed further below. See infra Section III.A.5.

1005

See Proposal, 76 FR at 841.
276

As proposed and adopted, Items 1-A and B of Form MA require a municipal advisor to
indicate the full legal name of the municipal advisor and, if different, the name under which it
primarily conducts its municipal advisor-related business. 1006 As adopted, Item 1-A also asks for
the municipal advisor’s CRD Number, if it has one. 1007 Item 1-C of Form MA as proposed and
adopted requires a municipal advisor also to provide its Employer Identification Number (or “EIN,”
a number used with respect to Internal Revenue Service matters) or, if the applicant (such as a sole
proprietor) does not have an EIN, a social security number. 1008
In Item 1-D, as proposed and adopted, if the municipal advisor is also registered with the
Commission as an investment adviser, broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer, or if it has
previously registered with the Commission as a municipal advisor on Form MA-T, such municipal
advisor is required to provide its related SEC file number or numbers. Further, if the municipal
advisor is a broker-dealer or an investment adviser and has a CRD Number assigned to it either
under the CRD system or the IARD system, it is required to provide its CRD Number.
As proposed and adopted, Item 1-D also requires an applicant to indicate whether it is a
state-registered investment adviser. In such case, as adopted, Item 1-D additionally requires the
applicant to identify the state (or states) with which it is registered, 1009 and adds to this category

1006

As proposed and adopted, Item 1-B requires any additional names under which the applicant
conducts municipal advisor-related business and the jurisdictions in which they are used to
be listed in Schedule D.

1007

Obtaining a municipal advisor’s CRD Number, if it has one, enables regulators, municipal
entities, and investors in a most basic way to research the background of a registrant. See,
e.g., supra text accompanying note 964.

1008

As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission is asking for the social security number of
sole proprietors to permit the electronic filing system to distinguish between persons who
share the same name. This information is necessary in connection with the Commission’s
enforcement and examination functions pursuant to Section 15B(c) of the Exchange Act (15
U.S.C. 78o-4(c)). See Proposal, 76 FR at 840, note 176. See also supra note 968.

1009

Requiring the place(s) of registration directly on Form MA can be helpful to regulators,
277

other U.S. jurisdictions where the applicant is registered. 1010
Item 1-D, as adopted, additionally requires a municipal advisor to indicate if it is an “exempt
reporting adviser” with respect to investment adviser registration and, if so, to provide the SEC file
number and CRD Number. The category of exempt reporting advisers, discussed in Section
III.A.1.c.v. herein, was created by Commission rule after Form MA was proposed. Because exempt
reporting advisers are not exempt from municipal advisor registration, if applicable, the
Commission believes that the information that such advisers must report to the Commission, and the
identifying numbers necessary to ease access to such information, is no less important to regulators
of the municipal market, municipal entities, and investors than the equivalent information available
regarding municipal advisors who are registered investment advisers. 1011
The information provided in response to Item 1-D will allow the Commission to more
effectively cross-reference those entities applying for registration as municipal advisors to those
who are registered as brokers, dealers, municipal securities dealers, investment advisers, or
otherwise registered 1012 with the Commission. As discussed in the Proposal, the ability to cross-

municipal entities, and investors while imposing little burden upon the applicant. The
omission of this disclosure requirement in the proposed version of the form was
unintentional.
1010

The revision to include other U.S. jurisdictions in addition to states has been made
throughout the forms.

1011

As proposed and adopted, an applicant is further asked in Item 1-D whether it is a
government securities broker-dealer, and, if so, to provide the SEC file number and bank
identifier; whether it has any other SEC registration, and, if so, to specify which registration
and the file number; and whether it is registered with another federal or state regulator, and,
if so, to specify the regulator’s name and the applicant’s registration number. As adopted,
Item 1-D asks whether the applicant has any additional registrations that were not already
reported, and, if so, to list the regulator and the applicant’s registration number in Schedule
D. The addition of this last question clarifies that if there are additional registrations, the
applicant must list all of them.

1012

For example, as the Commission noted in the Proposal, pursuant to Section 764 of the DoddFrank Act, security-based swap dealers will be required to register with the Commission.
278

reference will allow the Commission to assemble more complete information concerning a
municipal advisor to inform the Commission’s decision to approve or institute proceedings to deny
an application for registration as a municipal advisor. The ability to cross-reference will also permit
the Commission or any designee 1013 to plan for, and carry out, efficient and effective examinations
of registered municipal advisors. By obtaining all of an applicant’s regulatory file numbers, the
Commission will be able to cross-reference disciplinary information in the CRD or IARD systems
with the information on Form MA. This ability would provide the Commission with a more
complete understanding of a municipal advisor’s structure and business.
Item 1-E asks for the address of applicant’s principal office and place of business 1014 and the
telephone and fax numbers at that location. As proposed, Item 1-E of Form MA required an
applicant to list on Schedule D any additional names under which it conducts municipal advisorrelated business and the offices at which such business is conducted. In consideration of comments,
generally, that the form is too burdensome, 1015 in Item 1-E, as adopted, the Commission has
determined to require information pertaining only to the five largest offices.
Item 1-F of Form MA, as proposed, asked whether the applicant has one or more websites,
and, if so, to list them in Schedule D of the form. As adopted, Item-F continues to require an

See Section 764(a) of the Dodd-Frank Act and 15 U.S.C. 78o-8(a). See Proposal, 76 FR at
841, note 178.
1013

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(7)(A)(iii) (providing that examinations of municipal advisors shall
be conducted by the Commission or its designee).

1014

Rule 15Ba1-1(l) defines principal office and place of business to mean: “the executive
office of the municipal advisor from which the officers, partners, or managers of the
municipal advisor direct, control, and coordinate the activities of the municipal advisor.”
See also Glossary.
In addition, the municipal advisor must supply its mailing address, if it is different from its
principal office and place of business.

See, e.g., supra note 979 and accompanying text and text following note 987.
279

applicant to list all its websites, but also requires the address of its principal website on the main
part of the form and any additional website addresses on Schedule D. 1016
Item 1-G of Form MA, as proposed, required applicants to supply the name, address, e-mail
address, and telephone and fax numbers of its Chief Compliance Officer, if it has such an officer,
and to list any other title(s) the officer holds. Item 1-H, as proposed, asked for the title of, and
similar contact information for, any other person whom the municipal advisor has authorized to
receive information and respond to questions about the registration (the “contact person”). Items 1G and 1-H are being adopted, as proposed, with a clarification to advise applicants that they must
provide the name and contact information for only one person (i.e., either a Chief Compliance
Officer or another contact person). The intent of the Proposal was for the applicant to provide one
or the other, and the form, as adopted, makes this clearer. The added note also advises, however,
that information for both may be provided if the applicant so chooses. As discussed in the Proposal,
the Commission is requesting the identifying and contact information in Item 1-G and/or 1-H to
assist the Commission and the staff in evaluating applications for registration and overseeing
registered municipal advisors. 1017
As proposed and adopted, Item 1-I of Form MA requires the applicant further to state
whether it maintains, or intends to maintain, some or all of its books and records required to be kept
under MSRB or Commission rules somewhere other than at its principal office and place of
business and, if so, to provide (on Schedule D) information about the other location(s).
Item 1-J of Form MA, as proposed and adopted, requires an applicant to answer whether it is

1016

The Commission believes that identification of the applicant’s principal website out of
possibly many will increase the benefit of the information to regulators, municipal entities,
and investors without adding any unreasonable burden on the applicant.

1017

280

registered with any foreign financial regulatory authority, 1018 and, if so, to provide the name (on
Schedule D) of each such authority and the country. Item 1-J is being adopted as proposed, with the
additional requirement to provide the applicant’s registration number under the foreign
authority. 1019
Item 1-K, as proposed and adopted, requires an applicant to disclose whether it is affiliated
with any other business entity, and, if so, to disclose on Schedule D the name and registration
number of each such affiliate. 1020 As discussed in the Proposal, this information will help inform
the Commission as to the structure of the municipal advisor’s business, which will help staff
prepare for examinations of the municipal advisor. 1021
Item 2: Form of Organization
The Commission proposed Item 2 of Form MA to require information about a municipal
advisor’s form of organization. The Commission received no comments regarding Item 2 and is
adopting this item substantially as proposed. Item 2 requires a municipal advisor to specify whether
it is organized as a corporation, partnership, sole proprietorship, limited liability company, limited
liability partnership, limited partnership, or other form of organization that the municipal advisor
1018

An added instruction in Item 1-J, as adopted, makes clear that an applicant should answer
“No” to this question even if it is affiliated with a business that is registered with a foreign
financial regulatory authority.

1019

Schedule D relating to Item 1-J, as adopted, clarifies that both the name of the country and
the name of the authority must be provided in English, which may not have been evident in
the proposed version. In general, throughout the forms, as adopted, when the name of a
foreign country and/or authority is required, the filer is instructed that answers must be
provided in English.

1020

The text of Item 1-K has been revised to make explicit that “business entity” refers to any
domestic or foreign entity. Similarly, the related questions in Schedule D, which, as
proposed, asked only for “any federal or state registration” has been revised to include
foreign registrations, as well. These revisions have been made in accordance with the
description of this disclosure item in the Proposal, which included foreign affiliates among
the required disclosures. See Proposal, 76 FR at 842.

must specify; the month of its annual fiscal year end; the date on which it was organized; and the
state or other U.S. jurisdiction 1022 or foreign jurisdiction where it was organized. As discussed in
the Proposal, this information will assist the Commission in evaluating the applications for
registration and overseeing registered municipal advisors. 1023
Item 2 also requires an applicant to specify whether it is a public reporting company under
Section 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act and, if so, to provide its Commission-assigned EDGAR
CIK number. As discussed in the Proposal, the information that an applicant is a public reporting
company will provide a signal that additional public information is available about the municipal
advisor and/or its control persons. 1024
Item 3: Successions
The Commission proposed Item 3 of Form MA to require applicants to disclose whether
they are succeeding to the business of a registered municipal advisor and, if so, the date of
succession. Further, Item 3 requires, on Schedule D, the name of, and registration information for,
the firm the applicants are succeeding. 1025 The Commission received no comments regarding Item
3 and is adopting this item as proposed. As discussed in the Proposal, this information will assist
the Commission, among other things, in overseeing registered municipal advisors and in

1022

Proposed Item 2 did not specifically mention U.S. jurisdictions other than states. The Item,
as adopted, makes clear that such jurisdictions are included. See supra note 1010 and
accompanying text.

1023

See Proposal, 76 FR at 842.

1024

See id.

1025

As discussed elsewhere in this release, depending on whether the succession is a result of a
merger or acquisition, or a reorganization, the succeeding firm will be able to register by
either submitting a new Form MA or amending the Form MA of its predecessor. See infra
note 1318 and accompanying text and infra Section III.A.7. (discussing Rule 15Ba1-7
regarding registration of a successor to a municipal advisor).
282

determining whether there has been a change in control of a municipal advisor. 1026
Item 4: Information About Applicant’s Business
The Commission proposed Item 4 to require certain information about the applicant’s
business. The Commission received several comments relating to Item 4, which are discussed
below. 1027 The Commission is adopting Item 4 substantially as proposed, with certain
modifications as discussed in the description of the item below.
As proposed and adopted, subparts A to C of Item 4 require an applicant to provide
information regarding the approximate number of employees it has, approximately how many of
those employees engage in municipal advisory activities, and approximately how many are
registered representatives of a broker-dealer or investment adviser representatives.
Item 4-D, as proposed and adopted, requires an applicant to state approximately how many
firms, or other persons (that are not employees or otherwise associated persons of the applicant)
solicit municipal advisory clients on the applicant’s behalf. As proposed, an applicant is required to
disclose on Schedule D the names, addresses, and phone numbers of firms that solicit on its behalf.
As adopted, Item 4-D additionally requires the applicant to disclose on Schedule D the same
information for other persons who are not employed by, or otherwise associated persons of, the
applicant but who solicit on its behalf. 1028 In addition, to make the information more useful, the
Commission has determined to require an applicant also to provide the EDGAR CIK and/or
individual CRD Number, if any, of the soliciting firm or other person.

1026

See id. See also Proposal, 76 FR at 842.

1027

See infra notes 1040-1046 and accompanying text.

1028

Upon review of the form as proposed, the Commission determined that requiring a firm to
list the names of all persons who solicit on its behalf will provide potentially valuable and
more fulsome information, as it may yield the names of persons who are providing such
services without themselves registering.
283

Further, Item 4-E, as proposed, required an applicant to state whether it has any employees
that also do business independently on the applicant’s behalf as affiliates of the applicant and, if so,
to disclose in related Section 4-E of Schedule D the names of such employees. 1029 In the form, as
adopted, Section 4-E of Schedule D requires the applicant, in addition, to provide the address,
telephone and fax number, EDGAR CIK (if any) and individual CRD Number (if any) of each such
employee. 1030
Item 4-F, as proposed and adopted, requires the applicant also to approximate the number of
clients it served in the context of its municipal advisory activities in the past fiscal year and to
specify by checking the appropriate box(es) whether its clients include: municipal entities, nonprofit organizations (e.g., 501(c)(3) organizations) who are obligated persons, corporations or other
businesses not listed previously who are obligated persons, or other types of entities (and specify
which other types of entities); or whether the applicant engages only in solicitation and does not
serve clients in the context of its municipal advisory activities.
As proposed and adopted, applicants also are required, in Item 4-G, 1031 to specify
approximately the number of municipal entities or obligated persons that were solicited by the
1029

This category of employee includes persons who do not necessarily engage in municipal
advisory activities on behalf of the firm, and for whom a Form MA-I would thus not be
required. Regarding employees who do also engage in municipal advisory activities on
behalf of the firm, the applicant must in any case obtain the information requested in Section
4-E, as adopted, to complete a Form MA-I for each such employee. See also infra note
1030.

1030

The Commission believes that these additional details in Schedule D will further serve the
purposes for which Item 4 is designed and that an applicant firm should be able to provide
such information about employees that do business on its behalf. Item 4-E, as adopted, asks
the applicant to state the number of employees of this kind. This does not require an
applicant to search for any additional information, because each such employee must be
named in Schedule D. However, it can serve as a helpful cross-check to the filer as well as
to regulators, and is also a useful number for interested parties who do not need the
additional details.

1031

The section of Item 4 that relates to solicitations of municipal entities and obligated persons
284

applicant on behalf of a third-party during its most recently completed fiscal year, including any
clients that it solicits in addition to serving them in the context of its municipal advisory activities.
However, Item 4-G, as adopted, requires the applicant to provide the numbers separately for
municipal entities and obligated persons. 1032
Further, as proposed and adopted, applicants must indicate, in Item 4-H, 1033 whether they
solicit public pension funds, 529 Savings Plans, local or state government investment pools,
hospitals, colleges, or other types of municipal entities or obligated persons (and to specify which
other types). Alternatively, an applicant is able to indicate that the question is inapplicable, because
it serves only clients and does not engage in solicitation in the context of its municipal advisory
activities.
As proposed and adopted, applicants are also required to disclose, in Item 4-I, 1034 whether
they are compensated for their advice to or on behalf of municipal entities or obligated persons by
hourly charges, fixed fees (not contingent on the success of solicitations), contingent fees,
subscription fees (for a newsletter or other publications), or otherwise. 1035 If the applicant checks

has been restructured in Form MA, as adopted, into two parts. Item 4-G is the first part of
Item 4-G as proposed, which requires the applicant to state the number of municipal entities
and obligated persons that the applicant solicited on behalf of a third party, as described
above. New Item 4-H is comprised of the questions regarding the types of persons solicited
by the applicant that constituted the rest of Item 4-G as proposed. Hereinafter, subparts 4-H,
I, J, and K of the Proposal will be referred to by their numbers in the adopted form, i.e., 4-I,
J, K, and L, respectively.
1032

The Commission believes that the information requested will be more useful for regulatory
purposes, and for gaining an understanding of municipal advisory activities in general, when
broken down in this manner. Municipal entities and other interested parties can also benefit
from this breakdown in assessing the specific experience of a municipal advisor.

1033

Item 4-H was a part of Item 4-G as proposed. See supra note 1031.

1034

Item 4-I was Item 4-H as proposed. See supra note 1031.

1035

An applicant may alternatively state that the question is inapplicable because the applicant
engages only in solicitation.
285

“other,” the other kind of arrangement must be described. Item 4-J, 1036 as proposed and adopted,
asks for similar information about compensation for solicitation activities. Item 4-K, 1037 as
proposed and adopted, asks whether the applicant receives compensation, in the context of its
municipal advisory activities, from anyone other than clients, and, if so, to provide an explanation.
As discussed in the Proposal, disclosure of information relating to the number of a municipal
advisor’s employees and compensation arrangements will provide the Commission with a clearer
understanding of the business structure of registered municipal advisors, including the size of each
advisor, the number of its employees that engage in municipal advisory activities, and in what
capacity these employees engage in such activities. Information about compensation arrangements
also will identify possible conflicts of interest that the municipal advisor may have with its
clients. 1038
The Commission received several comments regarding the five categories of compensation
arrangements. 1039 One commenter believed that the Commission should “refrain from utilizing this
limited information in making a determination as to the existence of conflicts of interest with
respect to compensation” and that “a more comprehensive analysis of compensation arrangements
and the rationale for such fees should be considered prior to making any determination as to the
appropriateness of a particular fee arrangement.” 1040 Another commenter believed that, because
investment advisers generally have “a completely different business model, approach to business
and compensation model,” as well as “scale of business,” than municipal advisors, Form ADV is

“not a good model in this element of registration.” 1041
The five choices from among which applicants are asked to select are not intended to give
an exhaustive picture of a municipal advisor’s business model, but the Commission does believe
that receiving responses regarding compensation, at least on the level of specificity requested in this
item, will enable Commission staff to ask more targeted questions on routine examinations and may
highlight relationships that should be more closely examined. Furthermore, the Commission notes
that in addition to the five choices, an applicant may also check “Other” to describe its
compensation arrangements. If selected, the applicant is required to specify the nature of such
arrangements.
Item 4-L, 1042 as proposed and adopted, also requires the municipal advisor to indicate the
general types of municipal advisory activities in which it engages. 1043 The Commission
1041

See Public FA Letter. Another commenter stated that most municipal advisors “charge on a
project or transaction specific basis and not on an annual all encompassing service basis”
and thus believed that Form ADV is not a relevant document that would help in
understanding “the nature of an ‘Independent Municipal Advisor,’ its corporate makeup, nor
the fee relationship” and “does not afford any basis for analyzing potential conflict of
interest.” See Fiscal Advisors and Marketing Letter.

1042

Item 4-L was Item 4-K as proposed. See supra note 1031.

1043

The following eleven activities are listed: (1) advice concerning the issuance of municipal
securities (including, without limitation, advice concerning the structure, timing, terms and
other similar matters, such as the preparation of feasibility studies, tax rate studies,
appraisals and similar documents, related to an offering of municipal securities), (2) advice
concerning the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities (including, without
limitation, advice concerning the structure, timing, terms and other similar matters
concerning such investments), (3) advice concerning municipal escrow investments
(including, without limitation, advice concerning their structure, timing, terms and other
similar matters), (4) advice concerning the investment of other funds of a municipal entity or
obligated person (including, without limitation, advice concerning the structure, timing,
terms and other similar matters concerning such investments), (5) advice concerning
guaranteed investment contracts (including, without limitation, advice concerning their
structure, timing, terms and other similar matters), (6) advice concerning the use of
municipal derivatives (including, without limitation, advice concerning their structure,
timing, terms and other similar matters), (7) solicitation of investment advisory business
from a municipal entity or obligated person (including, without limitation, municipal
287

understands that the listed activities are those in which the municipal advisors engage and are
derived from the definition of municipal advisor in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(4) 1044 or closely
related to the activities included within that definition. As discussed in the Proposal, this
information will help the Commission understand the scope of activities in which a municipal
advisor engages and identify possible conflicts of interest and in preparing for examinations, and
will also provide the Commission with data useful to making regulatory policy. 1045
One commenter believed that, due to competitive concerns, a municipal advisor should not
be required to disclose the names and contact information of persons that solicit municipal clients
on its behalf. 1046 The Commission notes that the definition of municipal advisor under the
Exchange Act includes, specifically, persons who undertake solicitation of municipal entities and
obligated persons. The Commission thus believes that requiring an applicant to provide information
about persons who solicit clients on its behalf will help it carry out its oversight responsibilities with
respect to the full range of persons who are municipal advisors. For example, as already stated, 1047
such information may yield the names of persons who are engaged in such activities without
themselves registering. Moreover, as stated in the Proposal, the Commission believes that

pension plans) on behalf of an unaffiliated person or firm (e.g., third party marketers,
placement agents, solicitors and finders), (8) solicitation of business other than investment
advisory business from a municipal entity or obligated person on behalf of an unaffiliated
broker, dealer, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor or investment adviser (e.g.,
third party marketers, placement agents, solicitors and finders), (9) advice or
recommendations concerning the selection of other municipal advisors or underwriters with
respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities, (10)
brokerage of municipal escrow investments, or (11) other. Applicants who check “other”
activities will be required to provide a narrative description of such activities.

288

information requested in Item 4-L is important for discerning possible conflicts of interest. 1048 The
Commission further notes that the requirement that a municipal advisor disclose all persons who
solicit clients on its behalf applies equally to all applicants for registration. The Commission
believes that such universal disclosure serves to mitigate the competitive concerns raised by the
commenter.
Item 5: Other Business Activities
The Commission proposed Item 5 to require information about the applicant’s other
business activities. The Commission received no comments regarding Item 5 and is adopting Item
5 substantially as proposed, with minor modifications as discussed below.
As proposed and adopted, Item 5 requires applicants to indicate whether they are actively
engaged any one of an enumerated list of businesses. 1049 In Item 5, as adopted, the applicant is
required additionally to indicate, for each other business in which it is engaged, whether this is its
primary business. 1050 As proposed and adopted, Item 5 requires an applicant also to state whether it
1048

See supra note 1038 and accompanying text.

1049

Specifically, in Item 5, as adopted, an applicant is asked whether it is actively engaged in
business in, or as, a (1) broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer or government securities
broker or dealer, (2) registered representative of a broker-dealer, (3) commodity pool
operator (whether registered or exempt from registration), (4) commodity trading advisor
(whether registered or exempt from registration), (5) futures commission merchant, (6)
major swap participant, (7) major security-based swap participant, (8) swap dealer, (9)
security-based swap dealer, (10) trust company, (11) real estate broker, dealer, or agent,
(12) insurance company, broker, or agent, (13) banking or thrift institution (including a
separately identifiable department or division of a bank), (14) investment adviser (including
financial planners), (15) attorney or law firm, (16) accountant or accounting firm, (17)
engineer or engineering firm, or (18) other financial product advisor (and, if so, to specify
the type). Minor differences in this multiple choice list from the list, as proposed, are that
engineer is now included, in addition to engineering firm (as in Item 6 as proposed and
adopted), and swap dealer and security-based swap dealer are now two distinct categories.

1050

Although this specific question was not included in the proposed form, the Commission
notes that in the next subpart of Item 5, as proposed, if the applicant identifies any other
businesses in which it is engaged that are not included in the list of choices described above,
it is further asked whether this is its primary business. See infra note 1051.
289

is actively engaged in any other business that is not one of those enumerated above and whether that
other business is its primary business. It also is required to describe the other business on Schedule
D to Form MA. As discussed in the Proposal, this information will assist the Commission, among
other things, in identifying conflicts of interest for municipal advisors and preparing for inspections
and examinations of municipal advisors. The information also will assist the Commission and the
MSRB in understanding municipal advisors in the context of their activities for regulatory
purposes. 1051
Item 6: Financial Industry and Other Activities of Associated Persons 1052
The Commission proposed Item 6 to require an applicant to disclose financial industry
affiliations of its associated persons. The Commission received several comments on Item 6, as
discussed below. 1053 The Commission has carefully considered these comments and is adopting
Item 6 and the related information it requires on Schedule D of Form MA largely as proposed.
Some modifications have been made, however, and these are discussed below.
Item 6, as proposed and adopted, requires an applicant to provide information about its
associated persons 1054 that are engaged in activities other than those that relate to their association

1051

See Proposal, 76 FR at 844.

1052

The title of Item 6, which, as proposed, was “Financial Industry Affiliations of Associated
Persons,” has been changed in Form MA as adopted to better reflect the range of activities
that the item concerns – all of which may be a source of conflict of interest for the municipal
advisor – and to avoid any possible confusion that could be caused by the use of the term
“affiliations” in the title.

1053

See infra notes 1064-1070.

1054

Section 15B(e)(7) provides that the term “person associated with a municipal advisor” or
“associated person of an advisor” means “(A) any partner, officer, director, or branch
manager of such municipal advisor (or any person occupying a similar status or performing
similar functions); (B) any other employee of such municipal advisor who is engaged in the
management, direction, supervision, or performance of any activities relating to the
provision of advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to
municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities; and (C) any person
290

with the applicant. As discussed in the Proposal, Item 6 lists twenty activities that an associated
person may engage in, some of which are not listed in Item 5 as other activities in which the
applicant itself may be engaged. 1055 The collection of this information is designed to gather more
complete information about the associated persons of a municipal advisor who are actually
providing advice or are controlling the firm and help better inform the Commission’s regulatory and
examination programs. 1056
As proposed, Item 6 of Form MA required an applicant to list, on related Section 6 of
Schedule D of the form, all associated persons, including foreign affiliates, that are broker-dealers,

directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such
municipal advisor.” 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(7). For purposes of Form MA, the Glossary defines
“associated person or associated person of a municipal advisor” to have the same meaning
as in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(7) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(7)), but to exclude employees
that are solely clerical or administrative. Specifically, the Glossary defines these terms to
mean: “Any partner, officer, director, or branch manager of a municipal advisor (or any
person occupying a similar status or performing similar functions); any other employee of
such municipal advisor who is engaged in the management, direction, supervision, or
performance of any municipal advisory activities relating to the provision of advice to or on
behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products
or the issuance of municipal securities (other than employees who are performing solely
clerical, administrative, support or other similar functions); and any person directly or
indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such municipal
advisor.”
1055

Specifically, under Item 6, a municipal advisor is required to disclose whether any of its
associated persons is: (1) a broker-dealer, municipal securities dealer, or government
securities broker or dealer; (2) an investment company (including a mutual fund), (3) an
investment adviser (including a financial planner), (4) a swap dealer, (5) a security-based
swap dealer, (6) a major swap participant, (7) a major security-based swap participant, (8) a
commodity pool operator (whether registered or exempt from registration), (9) a commodity
trading advisor (whether registered or exempt from registration), (10) a futures commission
merchant, (11) a banking or thrift institution, (12) a trust company, (13) an accountant or
accounting firm, (14) an attorney or law firm, (15) an insurance company or agency, (16) a
pension consultant, (17) a real estate broker or dealer, (18) a sponsor or syndicator of limited
partnerships, (19) an engineer or engineering firm, or (20) another municipal advisor. See
supra note 1049. As adopted, Item 6 includes an instruction that if an associated person is
involved in more than one of these activities, each such activity must be reported.

1056

See Proposal, 76 FR at 844.
291

municipal securities dealers, or government securities brokers or dealers, or investment advisers,
municipal advisors, registered swap dealers, banking or thrift institutions, or trust companies. As
adopted, the form requires the applicant also to list in Section 6 of Schedule D all associated
persons that are investment companies (including mutual funds), major swap participants and major
security-based swap participants, commodity pool operators, commodity trading advisors, futures
commission merchants, accountants or accounting firms, attorneys or law firms, insurance
companies or agencies, pension consultants, real estate brokers or dealers, sponsors or syndicators
of limited partnerships, or engineers or engineering firms. 1057
Section 6 of Schedule D, as proposed and adopted, also requires the applicant to provide the
legal and primary business names of each associated person listed, as well as to indicate the
category or categories listed in Item 6 of the main form of which the associated person is a member.
Finally, Section 6 of Schedule D, as proposed and adopted, requires the applicant to indicate
whether it controls, or is controlled by, the associated person; whether the two are under common
control; 1058 and/or whether the associated person is registered with a foreign financial regulatory
authority and, if so, the country and name in English of that authority. 1059
As discussed above, the purpose of Item 6 is to elicit more complete information about who

1057

In other words, the form, as adopted, requires the applicant to list in Section 6 of Schedule D
the names of all associated persons in any of the categories in Item 6. See supra note 1055
and accompanying text.

1058

See infra note 1080 for the definition of “control” as used in the municipal advisor
registration forms.

1059

To the extent that Item 6, as adopted, requires associated persons in additional categories to
be listed in Schedule D, as discussed supra note 1057, the requirements to provide in
Schedule D the legal and primary business names of each associated person, indicate the
category or categories to which the person belongs, and respond to the questions relating to
control now apply to persons in those additional categories. Similarly, the questions relating
to registration with foreign financial regulatory authorities, as discussed further below, apply
to associated persons in all the categories listed in Item 6, as adopted.
292

is providing advice or controlling the applicant. Moreover, as new Rule 15Bc4-1 underscores, all
associated persons of municipal advisors are subject to censure. 1060 Thus, after further
consideration, the Commission believes that requiring the applicant municipal advisory firm to
identify associated persons that are involved in any of the above categories – each of which
involves activities that can impact or be impacted by the advice the firm provides – will better assist
the Commission in gaining an understanding of possible conflicts of interest or wrongful influence
in the municipal advisor’s activities. The Commission notes that Form MA elsewhere already
reflects a concern that involvement in a wider range of areas can lead to conflict of interest, as Item
5 of the form requires disclosure of whether the applicant firm itself is involved in any of 17
enumerated categories of that Item and must further indicate whether it acts as any other type of
financial product advisor and specify the type. 1061
As already noted, 1062 in conformance with the additions to the categories of associated
persons that must be identified in Item 6, Section 6 of Schedule D, as adopted, will require
disclosure of foreign registration information with respect to associated persons in twenty
categories. As discussed above, the Commission believes that an associated person’s involvement
in any of these categories can impact or be impacted by the advice the firm provides, and foreign
financial regulatory authorities can be of significant help in tracking such activity and uncovering
possible wrongdoing. An additional change in Section 6 of Schedule D, as adopted, requires the
applicant to provide, in the case of an associated person registered with a foreign financial
1060

See infra Section III.A.9.

1061

Item 6, as adopted, also asks the applicant to state the total number of its associated persons
that belong to any of the twenty categories (listed above in note 1055). Because, in Item 6,
as adopted, all such persons must be identified in Schedule D, tallying the number involves
no additional disclosure and will act as a cross-check to ensure that the information provided
is complete.

1062

See supra note 1059.
293

regulatory authority, the relevant registration number. The Commission believes that, for associated
persons that are active in foreign countries, having the registration number, if any, under foreign
financial regulatory authorities can be particularly helpful in obtaining information for regulatory
and investigative purposes.
The Commission received several comment letters opposing the extent of the disclosures
required by Item 6 and, on a more general level, all the disclosures that Form MA requires
regarding an applicant’s associated persons. 1063 One commenter believed that the form requires
“overly extensive disclosure” regarding affiliates of a municipal advisor, particularly for a
municipal advisor that is a member of a large affiliated group of institutions. 1064 These
requirements, the commenter said, would impose “a vast information-gathering burden on
applicants.” 1065 The commenter raised specifically the case of affiliates that are under common
control with a municipal advisor (“sister affiliates”), whose activities “may have no connection to
municipal advisory activities, let alone, in the case of financial institutions with global operations, a
nexus or connection to any activities in the United States.” 1066 The commenter suggested that
disclosures regarding affiliates be limited to affiliates that control or are controlled by the municipal
advisor or “at a minimum” to sister affiliates providing municipal advisory services in the U.S. 1067
This commenter also believed that a municipal advisory firm should not be required to provide
information regarding its individual associated persons (citing the example of employees) on Form
MA unless those persons “devote a significant amount of time or resources” to, or are “primarily

294

engaged” in, municipal advisory activities, particularly if those persons are already registered with a
broker-dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, commodity trading advisor or swap
dealer. 1068
Another commenter believed that requiring disclosures regarding associated persons
performing “any activities” relating to advice could “impose significant costs” and “create a
significant burden.” 1069 This commenter stated that the Commission should “establish a threshold
for reporting and updating associated person information in Form MA” – a certain minimum of
hours spent on municipal advisory activities over a specified time period. The commenter also
suggested that, when personnel from an entity are subcontracted, the entity itself should not be
required to register. 1070
The Commission notes that, for certain information pertaining to affiliates, it has determined
to limit the required disclosures in Form MA to information regarding persons that control, or are
controlled by, the municipal advisor (and not persons under common control). 1071 However, with
respect to financial industry and other activities represented on the list in Item 6, the Commission
believes it is appropriate to extend its information base regarding such activities to all of a
municipal advisor’s associated persons (which, by definition, includes persons under common
control with the municipal advisor). 1072 For example, the Commission believes that ascertaining

1071

See also the discussion below regarding Item 8, infra notes 1079-1088 and accompanying
text.

1072

See Section 15B(e)(7)(C) of the Exchange Act, which defines the term “person associated
with a municipal advisor” or “associated person of an advisor” as including “any person
directly or indirectly controlling, controlled by, or under common control with such
municipal advisor.”
295

such information may assist the Commission in identifying potential conflicts of interest.
The ability to discern connections within a large network of affiliations and other
associations that otherwise would not be evident is particularly important to the Commission for
purposes of enforcement, to enable regulators to detect possible trails of influence and to widen
their potential sources of factual information relevant to investigations of wrongdoing. The
Commission believes that establishing such an information base is consistent with the Dodd-Frank
Act’s amendments to Section 15B of the Act, which explicitly extend the Commission’s regulatory
authority (directly and through its oversight of the MSRB) to associated persons of municipal
advisors. 1073
The Commission notes that Item 6 and Section 6 of Schedule D ask for little more than the
names (legal and business) of any associated persons of the municipal advisor that do business in
the specified fields and, if the associated person is registered with a foreign financial regulatory
authority, the registration number. Otherwise, Section 6 asks only whether the municipal advisor
controls or is controlled by the associated person or whether the two are under common control.
Such control relationships are directly relevant to investigations of the municipal advisor.
The Commission believes that, in today’s world of organizational and managerial
sophistication and advanced information technology, including as is pertinent to cross-border
affiliations, it should not be unreasonably difficult for a municipal advisor that finds itself within a
larger family of affiliates, particularly of the size discussed by commenters, to obtain knowledge of
1073

See, e.g., Section 15B(c)(4) of the Exchange Act (authority of Commission to censure or
place limitations on the activities or functions of associated persons of municipal advisors);
and Section 15B(b)(2)(A) (authority of MSRB to establish standards of training, experience,
competence, and other qualifications for associated persons of municipal advisors). See also
Section 15B(a)(2) (application for registration as a municipal advisor to contain such
information and documents concerning associated persons of municipal advisors as the
Commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors).
296

its own place and the place of others within that family. Given the potential relevance and
importance of such information, as discussed above, to assuring lawfulness and fairness in the field
of municipal advisory services, as well as in maintaining confidence in the municipal securities
markets, the Commission believes it is appropriate to require municipal advisors to obtain and
provide such information.
With respect to the suggestions that a municipal advisory firm should not be required to
provide information regarding its individual associated persons unless those persons devote a
certain threshold of time or resources to municipal advisory activities, the Commission disagrees.
In particular, the kind of activity that disclosure relating to associated persons is intended to bring to
light may involve the kind of significant influence that often is wielded in very short timeframes of
activity, e.g., a short phone call from a partner in the firm to a key person in a municipal entity
“urging” the issuance of a particular offering, or soliciting the municipal entity’s investment.
Item 7: Participation or Interest in Municipal Advisory Client or Solicitee Transactions 1074
The Commission proposed Item 7 to require information about an applicant’s participation
and interest in the transactions of its municipal advisory clients. The Commission received no
comments referencing Item 7 that are not discussed elsewhere 1075 and is adopting Item 7 as
proposed. 1076
1074

The title of Item 7 has been revised in Form MA, as adopted, to include “solicitee”
transactions to better reflect the information sought in this item. The term “solicitee” is
defined in the discussion below and is included in the Glossary of Terms for the Form MA
series as adopted.

1075

As discussed above, the Commission received a general comment questioning whether
useful information could be elicited from applicants with regard to some required
disclosures. See supra note 984 and accompanying discussion.

1076

The Commission notes that, as published in the Proposal, several of the questions in this
item referred explicitly only to clients of the municipal advisor. It is clear from the context,
however, that these questions were also intended to apply to persons that the municipal
advisor solicits or intends to solicit in the context of its municipal advisory activities. Item
297

As discussed in the Proposal, the purpose of Item 7 is to identify possible conflicts of
interest that the municipal advisor and its associated persons may have with the municipal advisor’s
clients and/or the persons the municipal advisor solicits. 1077 For example, a municipal advisor that
receives commissions or other payments for sales of securities to clients may have a conflict of
interest with its clients. This type of practice gives the municipal advisor and its personnel an
incentive to base investment recommendations on the amount of compensation they will receive
rather than on the client's best interests.
Specifically, Item 7 requires an applicant to disclose whether it, or any of its associated
persons, has a proprietary interest in the securities or other investment or derivative product
transactions of its clients or of persons whom it solicited or intends to solicit (“solicitees”). These
disclosures include whether the applicant buys securities or other investment or derivative products
from, or sells them to, its clients or solicitees; whether it buys or sells for itself securities (other than
shares of mutual funds) or other investment or derivative products that it also recommends to such
clients or solicitees; whether it enters into derivative contracts with such clients or solicitees; or
whether it recommends to its clients or solicitees securities or other investment or derivative
products in which it or any associated person has any proprietary interest (other than as already
disclosed in response to the previous questions).
An applicant is also asked to disclose whether it or its associated persons recommend
purchases of securities or derivative products to clients or solicitees for which the municipal advisor
or its associated persons serve as underwriter, general or managing partner, or purchaser
representative; recommend purchases or sales of securities or derivatives to clients or solicitees in

7, as adopted, has been modified to explicitly reference such solicitees in addition to clients
in each of these instances.
1077

See Proposal, 76 FR at 844.
298

which applicant or its associated person has any other sales interest (other than the receipt of sales
commissions as a broker or registered representative of a broker-dealer); have certain discretionary
authority over transactions in securities or other investment or derivative products for its clients or
solicitees; and recommend brokers, dealers, or investment advisers to its clients or solicitees, and, if
so, whether those brokers, dealers, or investment advisers are associated persons of the municipal
advisor. Item 7 also requires the municipal advisor to disclose whether it or its associated persons
give or receive compensation for municipal advisory client referrals. 1078
Item 8: Owners, Officers, and Other Control Persons 1079
The Commission proposed Item 8 of Form MA to require information about an applicant’s
control persons. As discussed below, the Commission received one comment specifically relating
to Item 8. The Commission carefully considered issues raised by the commenter and is adopting
Item 8 substantially as proposed, with minor modifications discussed below.
Item 8, as proposed and adopted, asks applicants to identify on Schedules A and B every
person that owns a certain percentage of the applicant, that directly or indirectly controls the
applicant, or that the applicant directly or indirectly controls. 1080 An initial applicant is required to
1078

In Item 7, as adopted, the phrase “in the context of its municipal activities” has been deleted
in instances where the intention may not have been clear. For example, Item 7.C, as
proposed, asked: “Does applicant or any associated person have discretionary authority to
determine the: (1) securities or other investment or derivative products to be bought or sold
for the account of a client that it serves or person that it has solicited or intends to solicit in
the context of its municipal advisory activities.” The phrase “in the context of its municipal
advisory activities” was not intended to limit the question to products bought or sold in such
context, but to limit the kind of solicitation being referenced. To avoid confusion, it has
been deleted.

1079

The title of this item as proposed was “Control Persons.” It has been changed in Form MA,
as adopted, because the item, among other things, is seeking information about owners to
determine whether such persons are control persons.

1080

The term “control” is defined in the Glossary to mean, for purposes of the municipal advisor
registration forms, “the power, directly or indirectly, to direct the management or policies of a
person, whether through ownership of securities, by contract, or otherwise.” Further, the
299

complete Schedules A and B. Schedule C is used to amend information previously reported on
Schedules A and B.
Schedule A requires information about the applicant’s executive officers and, for firms,
persons that directly own 5% or more of the applicant. 1081 Schedule B requests information about
persons that indirectly own 25% or more of the applicant. A clarifying instruction has been added
to Schedule B, as adopted, explaining that, for these purposes, an “indirect owner” includes any
owner of 25% or more of any direct owner listed in Schedule A and any owner of 25% or more of
each such indirect owner going up the chain of ownership. Applicants are also asked to identify, on
Schedule D, any person that controls the applicant’s management or policies if not otherwise
identified as an owner or officer in Schedule A or B. Further information is requested with respect
to control persons that are public reporting companies under Sections 12 or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act. 1082
For ease of use and clarity, Form MA, as adopted, asks for information separately on

Glossary provides that: (a) each of the municipal advisor’s officers, partners, or directors
exercising executive responsibility (or persons having similar status or functions) is presumed
to control the municipal advisor; (b) a person is presumed to control a corporation if the
person: (i) directly or indirectly has the right to vote 25 percent or more of a class of the
corporation’s voting securities; or (ii) has the power to sell or direct the sale of 25 percent or
more of a class of the corporation’s voting securities; (c) a person is presumed to control a
partnership if the person has the right to receive upon dissolution, or has contributed, 25
percent or more of the capital of the partnership; (d) a person is presumed to control a limited
liability company (“LLC”) if the person: (i) directly or indirectly has the right to vote 25
percent or more of a class of the interests of the LLC; (ii) has the right to receive upon
dissolution, or has contributed, 25 percent or more of the capital of the LLC; or (iii) is an
elected manager of the LLC; and (e) a person is presumed to control a trust if the person is a
trustee or managing agent of the trust. See Glossary.
1081

As detailed in the form, the 5% criterion varies in its applicability and does not always mean
ownership in the ordinary sense of the word – depending on whether the applicant is a
corporation, partnership, trust, or limited liability company.

1082

Section 8-B of Schedule D to Form MA requires the name and CIK number of each control
person listed on Schedule A, B, C or Section 8-A of Schedule D.
300

Schedules A-1 and B-1 for owners and control persons that are business entities and on Schedules
A-2 and B-2 for owners and control persons who are natural persons, as well as (in Schedule A-2)
for executive officers. 1083 The information sought in these schedules, however, is the same as in the
Proposal, with minor modifications. 1084
For each business entity listed, the applicant is required to provide its organization CRD
Number, if it has one, or its IRS tax number, EIN, or, if not a domestic entity, any foreign business
number. For each natural person listed, the applicant is required to provide the person’s individual
CRD Number, if any, or the person’s social security number or foreign identity number, as well as
date of birth. 1085
As discussed in the Proposal, the information requested and the definition of control are
consistent with that requested and used by the Commission in other contexts. 1086 This information
will help to inform the Commission’s understanding of the ownership structure of the municipal
advisor and who ultimately controls the municipal advisor. Such information in turn will provide
useful information in preparing for examinations and also in identifying potential conflicts of
interest. The information requested also will inform the Commission about changes in control of
1083

The guidance provided in the form has been correspondingly revised to reflect this
restructuring. Although these Schedules, as published in print, display the information
requested in table form, the electronic version of Form MA – which is the only format in
which the form can be completed and submitted – asks the questions in a series of pop-up
boxes and instructions. See also supra note 1001.

1084

In the form, as adopted, in addition to providing information about other registrations that
the control person that is a firm or organization may have with the Commission, information
about any registration on Form MA-T must also be provided. In addition, the nature of the
control must also be described. If the control person is a natural person, his or her CIK
number, if any, must be supplied in addition to the other basic information requested.

1085

As noted above, the form, as adopted, makes clear that social security numbers, foreign
identification numbers, and date of birth will not be publicly disseminated.

1086

The requested information and definition of “control” are consistent with the information
requested of, and definition used for, investment advisers required to register on Form ADV.
See 17 CFR 279.1. See also Proposal, 76 FR at 845, note 195 and accompanying text.
301

the municipal advisor.
One commenter, as discussed above with respect to Item 6, 1087 cited Item 8 and Schedules
A, B, C and D as another illustration of the burden imposed by the reach of Form MA’s questions to
information about affiliates. Although Item 8 refers to “control persons,” 1088 the Commission notes
that the disclosure requirements in Item 8 apply only to “every person that, directly or indirectly,
controls the applicant, or that the applicant directly or indirectly controls” and does not include
sister affiliates (although a control relationship in other contexts is sometimes understood to include
two persons under common control). The very point of registration is that, to be permitted to
register as a municipal advisor, a firm must provide certain basic information that will enable the
Commission to oversee the activities of, and exercise jurisdictional authority over, those who
register. The Commission notes that Forms BD and ADV require filers to provide substantially
similar information.
Item 9: Disclosure Information and Related DRPs
As discussed in the Proposal, Item 9 requires an applicant to provide certain information
concerning any criminal, regulatory, and civil judicial actions relating to the applicant or any of its
associated persons 1089 (collectively referred to hereinafter as “disciplinary history”). 1090 If an
applicant indicates in Item 9 that there has been a history of such actions involving itself or any of
its associated persons, the applicant must report further information in the DRPs that comprise Part

1087

SIFMA Letter I, supra note 1065.

1088

The definition of “control” does not refer to persons under common control. On the other
hand, the definition of “associated person” of a municipal advisor does include a person that
is under common control with the municipal advisor.

1089

See supra note 1054 (discussing the definition of “person associated with a municipal
advisor” or “associated person of a municipal advisor”).

1090

However, as discussed further below, the disclosures regarding criminal actions are limited
to the period of the past ten years.
302

II of Form MA, which are described below. 1091 The Commission received several comments
regarding the disclosures required by Item 9 and its related DRPs, which are discussed below. 1092
The Commission is adopting Item 9 with certain changes. Although, as adopted, Item 9 generally
seeks the same information as in the Proposal, some questions have been more narrowly tailored
and broken down into subparts. These changes and the reasons for them are detailed below.
As discussed in the Proposal, 1093 Section 975(c)(3) of the Dodd-Frank Act amended Section
15B of the Exchange Act to direct the Commission, by order, to censure, place limitations on the
activities, functions, or operations of, or suspend for a period not exceeding twelve months, or
revoke the registration of any municipal advisor, if it finds 1094 that such municipal advisor has
committed or omitted any act, or is subject to an order or finding, enumerated in subparagraph (A),
(D), (E), (G) or (H) 1095 of paragraph (4) of Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act; has been convicted
of any offense specified in Section 15(b)(4)(B) 1096 of the Exchange Act within ten years of the
commencement of the proceedings under Section 15B(c); or is enjoined from any action, conduct,
or practice specified in Section 15(b)(4)(C) 1097 of the Exchange Act. 1098
Generally, Item 9 was designed to elicit information from a municipal advisor concerning
certain of its activities or the activities of its associated persons that could subject the municipal
1091

1092

See infra notes 1119-1121 and accompanying text.

1094

Such findings must be on the record after notice and opportunity for hearing and include a
finding that the particular disciplinary action is in the public interest. See 15 U.S.C. 78o4(c)(2).

1095

1097

See 15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)(C).

The Commission has the same authority with respect to municipal securities dealers. See 15
U.S.C. 78o-4(c).
303

advisor to disciplinary action by the Commission under these statutory provisions. The
Commission intends to use this information to determine whether to approve an application for
registration, to decide whether to institute proceedings to revoke registration, or to place limitations
on an applicant’s activities as a municipal advisor. In addition, the information will also identify
potential problem areas on which to focus examinations. 1099
In addition to its value for the Commission’s oversight of municipal advisors, generally, as
well as to inform MSRB rulemaking, the Commission seeks this information because it may
indicate that a municipal advisor is statutorily disqualified from acting as a municipal advisor. 1100
Further, this information may be valuable to municipal entities and obligated persons who engage
municipal advisors and to investors who may purchase securities from offerings in which municipal
advisors have participated, as well as to other regulators.
The information to be disclosed is substantially similar to the information required to be
disclosed in Form BD 1101 for broker-dealers and in Form ADV 1102 for investment advisers. 1103 In
addition to information sought on Forms BD and ADV with respect to investment-related activities
Form MA also requests parallel information with respect to municipal advisory activities.
The requested information is also generally consistent with the disclosure requirements of

1099

See infra Section III.B. (discussing approval or denial of registration). See also Proposal, 76
FR at 846, note 205 and accompanying text.

1100

See infra Section III.B. and Proposal, 76 FR at 846, note 206 and accompanying text. See
also Section 15B(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, which directs the Commission to deny
registration to an applicant municipal advisor if, among other things, it finds that if the
applicant was registered, its registration would be subject to suspension or revocation.

304

the temporary registration form, Form MA-T. 1104 However, as discussed in the Proposal, in Form
MA-T, the Commission limited the disciplinary history disclosure requirements to “associated
municipal advisor professionals.” 1105 As explained in the Proposal, due to the short timeframe
between the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act and the deadline for registration of municipal advisors
on October 1, 2010, the Commission believed it was appropriate to limit the disclosure requirement
to this subgroup of associated persons, which is limited to persons who are closely associated with
an advisor’s municipal advisory activities. 1106
In connection with the permanent registration regime, however, the Commission believes it
is appropriate to require in Item 9 that a municipal advisor disclose the disciplinary history, as
applicable, of all its associated persons, as that term is defined in Exchange Act Section 15B(e)(7),

1104

As discussed in the Proposal, in Form MA-T, the disclosure required with respect to orders
entered against the municipal advisor by regulatory authorities, and whether any court has
enjoined the municipal advisor or associated person in connection with investment related
activities, are limited to the past 10 years. See Proposal, 76 FR at 846, note 209. On Form
MA, the Commission is not including any time limitation on this disclosure, as discussed
further below.

1105

The Commission defined the term “associated municipal advisor professional” in the
glossary section of Form MA-T to mean: (A) any associated person of a municipal advisor
primarily engaged in municipal advisory activities; (B) any associated person of a municipal
advisor who is engaged in the solicitation of municipal entities or obligated persons; (C) any
associated person who is a supervisor of any persons described in subparagraphs (A) or (B);
(D) any associated person who is a supervisor of any person described in subparagraph (C)
up through and including, the Chief Executive Officer or similarly situated official
designated as responsible for the day-to-day conduct of the municipal advisor’s municipal
advisory activities; and (E) any associated person who is a member of the executive or
management committee of the municipal advisor or a similarly situated official, if any; and
excludes any associated person whose functions are solely clerical or ministerial. See also
Proposal, 76 FR at 846, note 211 and accompanying text.

1106

This includes those persons who are primarily engaged in an advisor’s municipal advisory
activities, have supervisory responsibilities over those primarily engaged in municipal
advisory activities, are engaged in day-to-day management of the conduct of an advisor’s
municipal advisory activities, or are responsible for executive management of the advisor.
See Temporary Registration Rule Release, 67 FR at 54469. See also Proposal, 76 FR at
846, note 212 and accompanying text.
305

with the exclusion of employees who perform solely clerical, administrative, support, or other
similar functions. 1107 The Commission believes that, for purposes of the permanent registration
regime, it is important to collect information about disciplinary matters for all such associated
persons, because, under the Exchange Act, such matters may form the basis for an action to suspend
or revoke a municipal advisor’s registration. 1108
Specifically, Item 9 as proposed and adopted requires disclosure of disciplinary history with
respect to any partner, officer, director or branch manager of a municipal advisor, and any other
employee who is engaged in the management, direction, supervision, or performance of any
municipal advisory activities relating to the provision of advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity
or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities; and any person that directly or indirectly controls, is controlled by, or under common
control with the municipal advisor. As a result, Form MA will capture information with respect to
employees that engage in municipal advisory activities, even if that is not their primary activity.
Form MA, in contrast to temporary Form MA-T, also requires disclosure with respect to controlling
persons and other affiliates of the municipal advisor.
As proposed and adopted, Item 9 asks whether the applicant or any associated person has, in
the last ten years, been convicted of any felony, or pled guilty or nolo contendere to any charge of a
felony in a domestic, foreign, or military court, or charged with any felony. Item 9 further asks
whether the applicant or any associated person has been convicted of any misdemeanor or pled
guilty or nolo contendere in a domestic, foreign, or military court to any charge of a misdemeanor in

business, or any fraud, false statements, or omissions, wrongful taking of property, bribery, perjury,
forgery, counterfeiting, extortion or a conspiracy to commit any of these offenses, or charged with
any misdemeanor of the type described above. 1110 With respect to charges alone, an applicant must
respond only with respect to charges that are currently pending.
A clarification has been added in Item 9, as adopted, regarding the provision that disclosure
of an event in the Criminal Action Disclosure section is not required if the date of the event was
more than ten years ago. The applicant is instructed that, for purposes of calculating the ten-year
period, the date of an event is the date that the final order, judgment, or decree was entered, or the
date that any rights of appeal from preliminary orders, judgments, or decrees lapsed. This
instruction provides a clear-cut guideline by requiring any past cases to be resolved with finality
before the ten-year period of no criminal history can begin. The Commission notes that this
defining line has been set forth explicitly in other contexts. 1111
In the Regulatory Action disclosure section of Item 9, Form MA as proposed and adopted
asks for information regarding whether the SEC or the CFTC has ever: found the municipal advisor
or any associated person to have made a false statement or omission; found the municipal advisor or
any associated person to have been involved in a violation of its regulations or statutes; found the
municipal advisor or any associated person to have been a cause of a municipal advisor- or
investment-related business having its authorization to do business denied, suspended, revoked, or
1109

The term “municipal advisor-related” is defined as “[c]onduct that pertains to municipal
advisory activities (including, but not limited to, acting as, or being an associated person of,
a municipal advisor).” See Glossary.

1110

The disclosures relating to felonies, in Form MA as in Form BD, concern felonies of any
kind, and are not limited to felonies relating to municipal advisor-related and investmentrelated business.

1111

See, e.g., Item 11 of Form ADV.
307

restricted; entered an order against the municipal advisor or any associated person in connection
with municipal advisor- or investment-related activity; or imposed a civil money penalty on the
municipal advisor or any associated person, or ordered the municipal advisor or any associated
person to cease and desist from any activity. Item 9 of the form also asks for similar information
with respect to other federal regulatory agencies, any state regulatory agency, or any foreign
financial regulatory authority.
Item 9 further asks for information regarding whether any SRO or commodity exchange
ever found the municipal advisor or any associated person to have made a false statement or
omission; found the municipal advisor or any associated person to have been involved in a violation
of its rules (other than a violation designated as a “minor rule violation” under a plan approved by
the SEC); found the municipal advisor or any associated person to have been the cause of a
municipal advisor- or investment-related business having its authorization to do business denied,
suspended, revoked, or restricted; or disciplined the municipal advisor or any associated person by
expelling or suspending it from membership, barring or suspending its association with other
members, or otherwise restricting its activities. It also asks whether the municipal advisor or its
associated persons have had authorization to do business or to act as an attorney, accountant or
federal contractor revoked or suspended.
The Civil Judicial Disclosure section of Item 9, as proposed, asks whether any domestic or
foreign court has ever (a) enjoined the applicant or any associated person in connection with any
municipal advisor-related or investment-related activity; (b) found that the applicant or any
associated person was involved in a violation of any municipal advisor- or investment-related
activity; or (c) dismissed a municipal advisor- or investment-related civil action brought against the
applicant or an associated person by a state or foreign financial regulatory authority. Form MA, as

308

adopted, retains the same questions, although the latter question has been revised to explicitly
include actions brought by U.S. jurisdictions other than states. 1112
As already indicated, the Criminal Action Disclosure section of Form MA as proposed and
adopted requires disclosure of events that occurred within the last ten years. 1113 With respect to
Regulatory and Civil Judicial Actions, the form as proposed and adopted places no time limit on
how far back in time events must be disclosed. The applicability of these disclosure requirements to
any event in the past is consistent with the disclosure reporting requirements on Form BD, adopted
pursuant to Section 15(b)(1) of the Exchange Act, 1114 with one exception. In Form BD, the
requirement to disclose any civil judicial injunctions is limited to the past ten years. In contrast, the
Commission proposed its corresponding question in Form MA regarding past civil injunctions
without limiting the disclosure requirement to the past ten years. The Commission received no
comment on this disclosure requirement and is adopting it as proposed.
As mentioned above, Form MA includes three separate kinds of DRPs to report information,
as relevant, relating to criminal, regulatory, and civil actions involving the municipal advisor or its
associated persons reported in Item 9. 1115 The Commission is adopting each of these DRPs as

1112

The Commission notes that the question, as proposed, relates to actions in “any domestic or
foreign court.” The Commission believes this phrase implicitly includes courts in U.S.
jurisdictions other than states, but is making this explicit to clarify its intent. If an action
was brought and dismissed in a U.S. jurisdiction other than a state or a foreign jurisdiction,
the information requested is no less pertinent to regulators and investors.

1113

As is the case with respect to brokers and dealers pursuant to Section 15(b)(4) of the
Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)), Section 15B(c)(2) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C.
78o-4(c)(2)), as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, limits the Commission’s ability to impose
sanctions on municipal advisors for convictions of felonies and misdemeanors to convictions
occurring within ten years preceding the filing of any application for registration.

1114

See Proposal, 76 FR at 846.

1115

An applicant is required to complete a separate DRP of the relevant kind for each event or
proceeding in which the applicant itself or any of its associated persons was involved, but
the same event or proceeding may be reported for more than one person or entity using one
309

proposed. Some modifications have been made, however, and these are discussed below.
Generally, each DRP requires detailed information about the reported action, such as the
court where the charges were filed and when, a description of the charge and the circumstances
relating to it (in the case of criminal actions); the authority that initiated the action and a description
of the allegations and the product-type (in the case of regulatory actions); or the initiator of the court
action, the relief sought, and the product type (in the case of civil judicial actions). Applicants are
also required to indicate the status of the charge or action, including resolution details as
appropriate. As discussed in the Proposal and consistent with the limitations set forth in Section
15(b)(4)(B) 1116 of the Exchange Act, 1117 however, information on the Criminal Action DRP is
limited to matters within the last ten years.
The Commission believes that it is important to collect the information required by the
DRPs in addition to the basic disclosures in Item 9 to further the aims described above regarding the
information required in Item 9: to assist it in deciding whether to grant or institute proceedings to
deny an application for registration or to revoke a registration; to manage the Commission’s
regulatory and examination programs; to make such information available to the MSRB; and to
obtain information that can be of value to municipal entities engaging the services of municipal
advisors and to investors who may purchase securities from offerings in which municipal advisors
have participated, as well as to other regulators. 1118
One commenter expressed concerns about the “vast information-gathering burden on

DRP.

applicants” imposed by Item 9. 1119 The commenter indicated that its concerns, which focused on
the requirement to collect information regarding sister affiliates of a municipal advisor, applied
“particularly in the light of the required disciplinary history disclosures.” 1120 This commenter
observed that Form ADV, upon which Form MA is based, does not require disclosure of a sister
affiliate’s disciplinary history. Another commenter stated that “[s]ome entities, such as banks,
broker-dealers and investment advisers, may have many branches, and branch managers, that have
nothing to do with the entity’s municipal advisory business” and urged that Form MA be amended
to require disciplinary history “only with respect to branch managers of branches where a municipal
advisory business is conducted.” 1121
In considering these comments, the Commission notes that Section 15B of the Exchange Act
assigns the Commission oversight and disciplinary responsibilities with respect to all associated
persons of a municipal advisor, a category that includes sister affiliates and branches. Moreover, as
discussed elsewhere in this release, 1122 the Commission is clarifying with new Rule 15Bc4-1 that
associated persons of municipal advisors are subject to censure, limitations on their activities,
suspension, or being barred from being associated. As explained above, with regard to the value of
obtaining information regarding financial industry and related activities of associated persons, the
Commission believes that the ability to discern connections within a large network of affiliations
and other associations is important for investigations of wrongdoing. The ability to gain, through
disclosure requirements, a base of knowledge that includes actions of past wrongdoing is all the
more important for these purposes.

Regarding the comment concerning the burden of obtaining information about sister
affiliates, the Commission notes that Form ADV, too, requests certain information regarding an
investment adviser’s sister affiliates – specifically, business information – as the commenter
acknowledged. Moreover, as the commenter also acknowledged, Form ADV requests the
disciplinary history of the investment adviser and all of its “advisory affiliates” (emphasis added) –
i.e., all current employees, all officers, partners or directors, and all persons directly or indirectly
controlling or controlled by the investment adviser. Given that a municipal advisor is in any case
required to gather certain facts about its sister affiliates’ business activities, the Commission
believes that it is appropriate to request the added information about any disciplinary history of
these affiliates, particularly in view of its potential value to regulators for purposes of investigation
and enforcement discussed above.
The DRPs associated with the disclosures in Item 9 are being adopted substantially as
proposed. However, as discussed below, some additional disclosure requirements and other
revisions have been included in the DRPs, as adopted. 1123
Generally in all the DRPs, as proposed, when an amendment was filed seeking to remove a
previously-filed DRP, the applicant was asked for the reason. Some, but not all of the DRPs, gave
the option of checking a box indicating that the DRP was filed in error. Some, but not all of the
DRPs, additionally asked for an explanation of the circumstances that gave rise to the error. For the
sake of consistency and to provide regulators, municipal entities, and others with important detail,
all the DRPs, as adopted, have been revised to include these elements. Also, in the Criminal Action
DRP, an additional option is given to indicate why the DRP was filed an error. The new option is
1123

Many of the same or similar revisions have also been made to the DRPs of Form MA-I,
including those other than the Criminal, Regulatory, and Civil Judicial Action DRPs of that
form, and a discussion of all of them will not be repeated in the section on Form MA-I
below.
312

that the event or proceeding occurred more than ten years ago. 1124
As proposed, if a DRP pertains to an associated person of the municipal advisor, the DRP
asks whether that person is registered with the Commission. In the DRPs, as adopted, if the
associated person is registered, the registration number must be provided. 1125 The Commission
believes that, if an applicant for registration with the Commission has an associated person that is
otherwise registered with the Commission, such information is valuable for cross-referencing and
enforcement and other regulatory purposes and providing it should not constitute an undue
burden. 1126
Each DRP, as proposed, asked if the municipal advisor or associated person whom the DRP
concerned was registered through the IARD or CRD system or the municipal advisor was
previously registered on Form MA-T, whether the advisor or associated person previously filed a
DRP (with Form ADV, BD, or U4) or the advisor filed disclosure on Form MA-T regarding the
same event. The adopted version of each DRP now asks whether an accurate and up-to-date DRP
containing the information regarding the applicant or associated person required by the DRP is
already on file in the IARD or CRD system (with a Form ADV, BD, or U4) or in the SEC’s
EDGAR system (with a Form MA or Form MA-I), and, if so, to specify the type of filing and
provide specific information regarding the name of the filer, the CRD Number (where relevant), the

1124

See supra note 1116 and accompanying text.

1125

In all the DRPs, as adopted, if an applicant indicates that the DRP concerns one or more
associated persons, the form asks how many. Because the names of all such associated
persons must be identified in the DRP in any case, tallying the number involves no
additional disclosure and will act as a cross-check to ensure that the information provided is
complete.

1126

On the other hand, the requirement to name the employer of an associated person when the
activity occurred that led to an action has been eliminated.
313

date, and disclosure or accession number of the relevant other form. 1127 As discussed above, 1128 the
ability to incorporate by reference any required information about the disciplinary history of an
applicant or associated person from a DRP that already has been filed relieves the regulatory burden
on applicants who can do so. At the same time, however, sufficient information about where the
information is filed is necessary for regulators, municipal entities, and investors to be able to access
it with reasonable ease.
As proposed, some of the DRPs, where relevant, asked for the name of the federal, military,
state or foreign court where a case was formally brought or appealed. In the DRPs, as adopted, an
applicant is presented with a list of types of courts from which to choose and must specifically
check the type of court in which the case was brought. 1129 In addition, “international court” and
“other” have been added to the choices (and, if the latter is checked, the applicant must specify the
type) and the street address and postal code of the court will now need to be provided in addition to
the city or county and state or country. Requests for information in all the DRPs regarding courts
and other panels have been made consistent to require the name of the case (in addition to the
docket number, as proposed). The Commission believes that these additions will enable regulators,
municipal entities, and investors to more easily locate information that may be relevant to them and,
if need be, address further inquiries. The Commission further believes that complete responses to
the questions in the DRPs, as proposed, would have supplied most of this same information. 1130

1127

The DRPs, as adopted, do not provide the option of indicating that the information is already
on file in a Form MA-T, as Form MA-T does not require the disclosures required in the
DRPs.

1128

See supra note 995 and accompanying text.

1129

In the electronic form, the applicant must make a selection and thus cannot avoid answering
the question specifically.

1130

As proposed, the DRP asked the applicant to describe details of the event in narrative form,
and to, among other things, “include charge(s)/charge Description(s), and for each charge
314

For the same reason, similar changes have been introduced into the DRPs regarding
regulatory adjudications and civil judicial actions. Where the proposed Regulatory Action DRP
asked the filer to indicate whether a regulatory proceeding was initiated by the SEC, another federal
authority, state, SRO, or foreign authority, the forms as adopted add, as choices, the CFTC, a
federal banking agency, the National Credit Union Administration, or other regulator or authority
that the applicant must specify. In addition, the applicant must now indicate, as applicable, the
name of the administrative proceeding, commission or agency hearing, or other regulatory
proceeding or forum in which the action was brought and the street address and postal code of the
location where the case was heard. Specific choices added with respect to who initiated a Civil
Judicial Action include the CFTC, another federal authority (which the applicant must specify), and
a municipal advisory firm.
As proposed, not all the DRPs contained instructions to the applicant regarding the language
to be used in naming or describing the charges brought in a foreign jurisdiction. As adopted, the
forms consistently require the applicant to provide all the information requested in English. The
Commission believes that this requirement is appropriate in an application for U.S. registration
designed to obtain information on behalf of U.S. regulators, municipal entities, and investors.
As proposed, in the Criminal Action DRP, in a case where criminal charges were brought

provide: (1) number of counts, (2) felony or misdemeanor, [and the] (3) plea for each
charge” and “provide a brief summary of circumstances leading to the charge(s) as well as
the disposition.” The proposed version separately required the applicant to “[i]nclude, for
each charge, (a) Disposition Type (e.g., convicted, acquitted, dismissed, pretrial, etc.), (b)
Date, (c) Sentence/Penalty, (d) Duration (if sentence-suspension, probation, etc., (e) Start
Date of Penalty, (f) Penalty/Fine Amount, and (g) Date Paid.” It also required an applicant
to provide “a brief summary of circumstances leading to the charge(s) as well as the
disposition” and to include “the relevant dates when the conduct which was the subject of
the charge(s) occurred.” The Commission also notes that the Criminal Action DRP of Form
MA-I, both as proposed and adopted, asks for information about amended or reduced
criminal charges.
315

against a firm or organization over which the applicant or associated person had control, the
applicant was required to indicate whether the firm or organization was engaged in a municipal
advisor-related business. In the DRP, as adopted, the question has been revised to ask, in addition,
whether the firm or organization was engaged in an investment-related business. 1131 Because of the
close relationship between investment-related business and municipal advisory activities, the
Commission believes that it is important for regulators, municipal entities, and investors in
municipal securities to have this information.
The instructions in the Criminal Action DRP on how to report an event or proceeding have
been revised in the form as adopted. 1132 No substantive changes have been introduced in the
reporting requirements. The revisions have been made solely for purposes of clarity. The adopted
version of the instructions states: “Use this DRP to report all charges, including multiple counts of
the same charge, arising out of the same event and filed in one criminal action. The same DRP may
be used for more than one person with respect to the same event or proceeding. Separate criminal
actions arising out of the same event, and unrelated criminal actions, must be reported on separate
DRPs.” The Commission believes that the revised instructions, which are similar to instructions
that appear in the DRPs for Forms BD and ADV, will help assure that the disciplinary information
provided in response can be easily understood.
An instruction has been added to the Criminal Action DRP advising applicants that
1131

In the form, as proposed, the applicant would have been required to indicate only whether
the firm or organization was in municipal advisor-related business.

1132

In the Criminal Action DRP, as proposed, the applicant was instructed: “Use a separate
DRP for each event of proceeding. The same event or proceeding may be reported for more
than one person or entity using one DRP… Multiple counts of the same charge arising out of
the same event(s) should be reported on the same DRP. Use this DRP to report all charges
arising out of the same event. Unrelated criminal actions, including separate cases arising
out of the same event, must be reported on separate DRPs. One event may result in more
than one affirmative answer to the [questions asked earlier in the DRP].”
316

applicable court documents must be attached to, and filed with, the DRP if not previously
submitted. 1133
In the Criminal Action DRP, as proposed, an applicant was not required specifically to
indicate whether the original criminal charge was amended or reduced. As adopted, the DRP asks
for this information and for the relevant date. The Commission believes that the clearer picture of
the disciplinary history that will emerge when this information is supplied should assist regulators,
municipal entities, and investors in assessing the credentials and background of the municipal
advisor and its associated persons.
In the Criminal Action DRP, as proposed, an applicant was not required to state, if the case
was on appeal, to whom it was appealed and the date of the appeal. As adopted, the DRP now
requires these disclosures. 1134
The Criminal Action DRP, as proposed, asked for information generally about the
disposition of the relevant action, in narrative form, and to include details concerning any sentence
or penalty imposed, its start date, and its duration, and the amount and date of payment. 1135 As
adopted, the form requires the applicant to choose from among 16 types of disposition of a case (or
to check “other,” and specify the other), and to further identify any other type of disposition.
Choices are also provided to describe specifically the disposition of any appeal. 1136 The DRP, as

1133

This instruction, which was included in the proposed Criminal Action DRPs for Form MA-I,
was not included in the proposed Criminal Action DRP for Form MA. The Commission
notes that Form BD also requires applicable court documents to be attached to the Criminal
Action DRP in that form.

1134

The Commission notes that the Regulatory and Civil Judicial Action DRPs, when proposed,
already required similar information regarding appeals.

1135

See supra note 1130.

1136

These choices are: affirmed; vacated and returned for further action; or vacated/final. An
applicant may also respond “other,” in which case the other type of disposition must be
specified.
317

adopted, further asks specifically whether any incarceration was imposed in connection with the
action, and, if so, the duration, the start and end dates, and any concurrent sentences. 1137 It also
asks, in question-by-question format, whether any portion of a monetary penalty was reduced or
suspended, whether it has been paid in full, and, if not, how much remains unpaid. The
Commission believes that these revisions will help ensure that the description of the disposition is
complete.
As proposed, the Regulatory Action DRP required the applicant to check off any of 14 types
of “principal sanctions” 1138 in the case (or to check “other,” and specify the other type), and to
further identify any other sanctions. As adopted, the DRP does not differentiate between principal
sanctions and any other kind of sanction, but adds more types to the list in addition to requiring the
applicant to identify any others. This, too, will help ensure that the filer provides appropriate detail,
thereby enabling interested parties to better assess the credentials and background of the applicant
and its associated persons.
Similarly – and for the same reason – the Civil Judicial Action DRP no longer differentiates
between “principal relief” sought and other relief, and provides a longer list of possible sanctions or
relief sought from among which the applicant must select in addition to identifying any other
sanctions or relief sought.
The questions in the Regulatory and Civil Judicial Action DRPs regarding how a case was
resolved, like the questions in the Criminal Action DRP regarding disposition, have been revised in
the DRPs, as adopted, to be more specific and to offer more choices from among which an applicant
must select, for the same reason as in the Criminal Action DRP. The Commission believes that
1137

The DRP, as adopted, also asks specifically whether any sentence or any other penalty is
ordered, and, if so, to list each type, giving the examples of prison, jail, probation,
community service, counseling, education, or other (which must be specified).

1138

The DRP, as adopted, clarifies that the question refers to the sanctions sought.
318

these revisions will help ensure that the description of the disposition is complete. More possible
answers are provided from among which the applicant must choose to describe specifically the type
of resolution that resulted (acceptance, waiver, and consent, settlement, dismissal, judgment
rendered, etc.) and choices are now given regarding how any appeal was resolved.
Similarly, more choices are presented to describe any sanctions that were ordered in the
relevant Regulatory or Civil Judicial Action. 1139 In addition, questions are broken out into separate
sections regarding the details of three specific types of sanctions and/or conditions of sanctions: (a)
bars, injunctions, and suspensions; (b) requalifications (by examination, retraining, or other
process); and (c) monetary sanctions. 1140
As proposed, the Regulatory and Civil Judicial Action DRPs asked the applicant to provide
a brief summary of details relating to the action’s status with relevant terms, conditions, and dates.
1139

For example, the choices in the Regulatory Action DRP, as proposed, were: monetary/fine;
revocation/expulsion/denial; censure; disgorgement/restitution; cease and desist/injunction;
bar; suspension; and other (which must be specified). The choices added in the adopted
version include: civil and administrative penalties/fines; expulsion; prohibition; reprimand;
rescission; requalification; revocation; and undertaking.

1140

For example, in the Regulatory and Civil Judicial Action DRPs, as proposed, the applicant
was asked broadly to describe, in narrative form: “Sanction detail: if suspended, enjoined
or barred, provide duration including start date and capacities affected (General Securities
Principal, Financial Operations Principal, etc.). If requalification by exam/retraining was a
condition of the sanction, provide length of time given to requalify/retrain, type of exam
required and whether condition has been satisfied. If disposition resulted in a fine, penalty,
restitution, disgorgement or monetary compensation, provide total amount, portion levied
against the applicant or an associated person, date paid and if any portion of penalty was
waived.”
By contrast, in the DRPs as adopted, similar information is requested in question-byquestion format in each of the separate sections described above. Questions relating to bars,
injunctions, and suspensions are further subdivided into a separate subsection for each, and
the questions distinguish between temporary and permanent bars. The applicant is also
instructed to report any additional details if one or more bars, injunctions, or suspensions
were imposed with regard to different activities and the terms specify different time periods,
and a similar instruction is included with regard to requalifications. Details similar to those
specified in the Criminal Action DRP, as adopted, see supra notes 1135-1137 and
accompanying text, are also requested.
319

As adopted, the DRPs specifically ask whether any limitations or restrictions are in effect while the
case is pending or on appeal, as applicable. For pending cases, the DRPs also ask for the date that
notice or other process was served. 1141 Here, too, the Commission believes that specifying these
details as required elements will serve to ensure that the applicant’s description is complete.
The Civil Judicial Action DRP, as proposed, did not ask for the full name of the defendant
or ask whether the applicant is a named defendant. As adopted, the DRP requires this information,
and, if the applicant is not a named defendant, further requires a description of how the action
involves the defendant. This information should help interested parties more easily determine the
role of the applicant or associated person in the civil judicial action as part of their assessment of the
applicant.
The DRPs, as adopted, now ask for various minor additional disclosures reflecting a level of
detail generally similar to the disclosures discussed above, which the Commission believes should
serve to enhance the usefulness of the information to regulators and the benefit it will have for
municipal entities and the investing public without unreasonably burdening applicants for
registration. 1142
1141

As previously mentioned, the DRPs, as proposed, already requested the date of any appeal.
See supra text accompanying note 1134.

1142

Some examples, when an applicant is asked to check the type of product involved in a case,
more choices are included in the list of possibilities than in the proposed version. When the
resolution of a case is an order, the applicant is asked whether it is a final order based on
violations of any laws or regulations that prohibit fraudulent or deceptive conduct. Several
changes were made so that if one or more DRPs asks a follow-up question when a certain
response is given, other DRPs are consistent and ask the same follow-up question. Thus,
each time an applicant selects more than one resolution of a case as having occurred or if the
choice that the applicant has selected does not adequately summarize the resolution, the
applicant must provide an explanation. Each time an applicant indicates that a relevant date
provided is not exact, an explanation is required. See also infra note 1147. In addition,
throughout the DRPs, instructions have been revised to offer more clarity on how to file a
DRP or when a separate DRP must be filed regarding the same event. See also supra note
968.
320

Item 10: Small Businesses
As described further in Section IX below, the Commission is required by the Regulatory
Flexibility Act (“RFA”) 1143 to consider the effect of its regulations on small entities. The
Commission’s rules do not define “small business” or “small organization” for purposes of
municipal advisors. As discussed in the Proposal, the Small Business Administration (“SBA”)
defines small business for purposes of entities that provide financial investment and related
activities as a business that had annual receipts of less than $7 million during the preceding fiscal
year and is not affiliated with any person that is not a small business or small organization. 1144 The
Commission proposed to use the SBA’s definition of small business to define municipal advisors
that are small entities for purposes of the RFA. 1145 This definition will remain unchanged in the
rules as adopted.
The Commission proposed Item 10 of Form MA to enable it to determine how many
applicants meet the SBA’s definition of “small business” or “small organization” as applied to
municipal advisors. Thus, Item 10 requires each applicant to disclose whether it had annual receipts
of less than $7 million during its most recent fiscal year (or during the time it has been in business,
if it has not completed its first fiscal year in business). Item 10 also requires each applicant to
disclose whether any business or organization with which it is affiliated had annual receipts of more
than $7 million in its most recent fiscal year (or during the time it has been in business, if it has not
completed its first fiscal year in business).
The Commission received no comments on the information requested by Item 10 and is

adopting this item as proposed. 1146
Technical and Other Changes
In addition to the modifications discussed above, a number of non-substantive, technical and
clarifying changes have been made to Form MA, its schedules and the DRPs as adopted. 1147
Further, some of the multi-pronged questions have been broken down into separate parts to make
the form clearer and more user-friendly. 1148 The Commission has also made certain additional
changes to correct inadvertent omissions in the form, as proposed. 1149
Execution Page
Form MA includes an Execution Page that an authorized person of the municipal advisor
filing the form is required to sign electronically before the form can be submitted. 1150 The

1146

Several commenters did raise issues with respect to the impact that the new registration
requirements could have, generally, on small businesses. See, e.g., supra note 986, and see
also supra note 980. Such concerns are addressed in Section IX below.

1147

For example, new guidance is included on Form MA, as adopted, that reminds applicants
that they must supply supporting documents where applicable, and that Form MA-NR must
be included for non-residents. Filers are also advised that false statements or omissions may
result in administrative or civil actions, in addition to the other legal consequences
mentioned in the Proposal. Instructions have been included regarding non-US telephone and
fax numbers. References to U.S. state jurisdictions have been amended to consistently
include other types of U.S. jurisdictions, and the choices on the forms, accordingly, include
such jurisdictions by name. See also supra note 968.

1148

For example, the questions in the DRPs regarding associated persons are divided into
separate sections for firms and organizations, on the one hand, and natural persons on the
other. Many of the questions now present applicants with a series of choices that they can
check off. Some questions are renumbered, and some subsections have been given titles
where there were none in the proposed version.

1149

For example, the Criminal Action DRP requires that if the applicant is amending a
previously filed DRP pertaining to an associated person because it was filed in error, the
applicant is required to explain the circumstances. The Proposal inadvertently omitted a
requirement to explain the circumstances when the error pertained to the applicant itself.
The Regulatory and Civil Judicial Action DRPs as previously proposed and now adopted
require an explanation in both cases.

1150

See Proposal, 76 FR at 849. As proposed, the Execution Page (except for the selfcertification section) is similar in purpose to the Execution Page of Form ADV (see 17 CFR
322

Commission received no comments regarding the Execution Page, other than on the selfcertification contained therein. For reasons discussed below, the Commission is removing the selfcertification section of the Execution Page in Form MA but otherwise is adopting the Execution
Page substantially as proposed. 1151
An authorized person signs the form by typing his or her name and submitting the form on
behalf of the municipal advisor. The authorized person is required to sign one of two different
Execution Pages, depending on whether the municipal advisor is resident in the United States or a
“non-resident” municipal advisor. In either case, by signing the Execution Page, the authorized
person states that he or she is signing Form MA on behalf, and with the authority, of the municipal
advisor and affirms that the information in Form MA is true and correct.
The Execution Page for both resident and non-resident municipal advisors requires the
signatory to certify that the books and records of the municipal advisor will be preserved and
available for inspection and to authorize any person with custody of the books and records to make
them available to federal representatives. On the Execution Page for non-resident municipal
advisors, the signatory, in signing the form, also states that the municipal advisor agrees that it will
provide to the Commission, at its own expense, copies of all books and records that the municipal
advisor is required to maintain by law. As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission believes that,
before granting registration to a domestic or non-resident municipal advisor, it is appropriate to
obtain assurance that such person has taken the necessary steps to be in the position to provide the
Commission with prompt access to its books and records and to be subject to inspection and
279.1), but deletes references to state registration, bonding requirements and other
inapplicable components, and will require a non-resident municipal advisor to execute a
separate form (Form MA-NR) to designate agent for service of process. See infra Section
III.A.6.
1151

The description immediately below relates to the Execution Page as adopted. Discussion of
the removal of the self-certification section follows.
323

examination by the Commission.1152
On the Execution Page for domestic municipal advisors, the signatory also states that it
appoints certain officials as agents for service of process in the state where the advisor maintains its
principal office or place of business. Specifically, a domestic municipal advisor appoints the
Secretary of State or other legally designated officer in the state where it maintains its principal
office and place of business. As discussed in the Proposal, this appointment allows private parties
and the Commission to bring actions against the municipal advisor by delivering necessary papers
to the appointed agent. 1153 The agent is able to receive any process, pleadings, or other papers in
any action that arises out of or relates to or concerns municipal advisory activities of the municipal
advisor. The agent also is able to receive service for investigation and administrative proceedings.
On the Execution Page for non-resident municipal advisors, the signatory on behalf of the
registrant also states that an opinion of counsel is attached as an exhibit to Form MA and that the
municipal advisor can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with access to the books and
records of the municipal advisor, as required by law, and that the municipal advisor can, as a matter
of law, submit to inspection and examination by the Commission.1154 As discussed in the Proposal,
each jurisdiction may have a different legal framework with respect to its laws (e.g., privacy laws)
that may limit or restrict the Commission’s ability to receive information from a municipal
advisor. 1155 Providing an opinion of counsel that a municipal advisor can provide access to its

1152

See Proposal, 76 FR at 848.

1153

See id. Appointment of agent for service of process for non-resident municipal advisors is
discussed further below. See infra Section III.A.6 (discussing Form MA-NR).

1154

The opinion of counsel is required by Rule 15Ba1-6, as adopted. General Instruction 13
(General Instruction 14 as proposed) now states that the non-resident municipal advisor
filing Form MA must attach the opinion as an exhibit to the Execution Page.

1155

The Execution Page for non-resident municipal advisors, as adopted, however, does not
require the opinion of counsel to state that the municipal advisor is able, as a matter of law,
324

books and records and can be subject to inspection and examination allows the Commission to
better evaluate a municipal advisor’s ability to meet the requirements of registration and ongoing
supervision. 1156 Failure to provide an opinion of counsel may be a basis for the Commission to
deny an application for registration. 1157
As proposed, Form MA required the authorized person of a municipal advisor completing
the Execution Page to certify separately on behalf of the municipal advisor that it and every natural
person associated with it had met, or within any applicable required timeframes would meet, such
standards of training, experience, and competence, and such other qualifications, including testing,
for a municipal advisor and natural persons associated with it, required by the Commission, the
MSRB, or any other relevant SRO. Under the Proposal, the authorized person, on behalf of the
municipal advisor also would have been required to certify that the municipal advisor had
conducted an initial or annual review, as applicable, of the municipal advisor’s business, and had
reasonably determined that the municipal advisor: (a) could carry out the activities described in the
items that are checked in Item 4-K (Applicant’s Business Relating to Municipal Securities) of Form
MA; 1158 (b) could comply with all applicable regulatory obligations; and (c) had met such

to submit specifically to “onsite” inspection.
1156

See Proposal, 76 FR at 848.

1157

See Section 15B(a)(2), providing that a municipal advisor applying for registration must file
with the Commission an application for registration in such form and containing such
information and documents concerning such municipal advisor as the Commission, by rule,
may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors. Thus, failure to provide an opinion of counsel, as required, is a basis under the
statute for the Commission to conclude that the requirements of Section 15B(a)(2) are not
satisfied.

1158

Under the Proposal, factors to be considered in determining whether a municipal advisor can
carry out the described activities included, but were not limited to, whether the municipal
advisor has, with respect to the described activities, the appropriate technology systems and
equipment; the appropriate financial resources; adequate staffing with appropriate skill sets,
training, and expertise; and adequate facilities, such as office space, as appropriate. See
325

regulatory obligations during the last year (or during such shorter period if the application was an
initial application for registration). For these purposes, such applicable regulatory obligations were
to include obligations under the federal securities laws and rules promulgated thereunder and
applicable rules promulgated by the MSRB, or any other relevant SRO.
Under the Proposal, the authorized person also would have been required to certify that the
municipal advisor had documented this review process and would maintain all documents relating
to the review in accordance with Rule 15Ba1-7 under the Exchange Act. 1159 Such certification
would have been required in conjunction with the filing of an initial application for registration as a
municipal advisor and annually thereafter. 1160
The Commission received one comment letter opposing the proposed self-certification
requirement. 1161 The commenter provided that self-certification should not be required and noted

Proposal, 76 FR at 849.
1159

Proposed Rule 15Ba1-7 also required municipal advisory firms to make and keep a record of
the initial or annual review, as applicable, conducted by the municipal advisory firm of its
business in connection with its self-certification on Form MA. Because the Commission is
not adopting a self-certification requirement, the Commission is also not adopting this
corresponding books and records requirement. See infra note 1344.

1160

See proposed Rule 15Ba1-4(e). The rule required the annual self-certification to be filed by
municipal advisory firms within 90 days of the end of the municipal advisor’s fiscal year, or
within 90 days of the end of the calendar year for municipal advisors that are sole
proprietors.

1161

Further, the Commission received two comment letters that, although did not object to the
proposed self-certification requirement, related to the Commission’s request for comment on
an alternative to self-certification. See infra notes 1164 and 1165. The Commission also
received many letters commenting, in the context of opposing the Commission’s proposal to
exclude appointed members of the governing body of a municipal entity from its
interpretation of “employee of a municipal entity,” that the cost to comply with “reporting,
record keeping, and certification requirements” and the related continuing education
requirements and training, would take away from the board members’ full-time jobs and
families, and that such costs were unjustified. See, e.g., letter from Susan N. Kelly, Senior
Vice President of Policy Analysis and General Counsel, and Diane Moody, Director,
Statistical Analysis, American Public Power Association, dated February 22, 2011; Nick
Costanzo, Vice President Strategic, Financial, and Management Services, City of El Paso,
326

that similar certifications are not required with Form BD and Form ADV. 1162 The commenter also
asserted that requiring a municipal advisory firm to conduct an annual review of its business and
determine that it can carry out its municipal advisory activities, including requiring the applicant to
document the review process, would be costly, burdensome, and confusing. Further, the commenter
noted that the Commission and the MSRB have yet to propose standards that are the subject of the
certification. Accordingly, the commenter believed that, without such standards or related
guidance, it is premature for prospective advisors to even comment. The commenter added that a
municipal advisor would be unsure as to how to conduct the review, which may lead to unnecessary
expense and exposure to liability (since the certification would be “reports” and therefore subject
the municipal advisor to criminal liability). The commenter suggested that, if the Commission’s
interest is in ensuring competence of a municipal advisor, a better approach would be to create an
MSRB examination process with qualifications clearly defined by the MSRB.
After careful consideration of the comment received, the Commission is not requiring selfcertification in Form MA, as adopted. As the commenter notes, Forms BD and ADV, on which
Form MA is based, do not require self-certification. Further, as pointed out by the commenter, the
MSRB has yet to propose standards that are the subject of the certification. Accordingly, at this
time, the Commission does not believe that self-certification should be required of municipal
advisors.
In response to the Commission’s request for comment regarding an independent third party
review and whether the Commission should mandate a minimum level of review as an alternative to

Texas, dated February 22, 2011; and letter from Ben Gorzell, Chief Financial Officer and
Michael D. Bernard, City Attorney, City of San Antonio, dated February 18, 2011.

327

the self-certification requirements, 1163 the Commission received two letters. The two commenters
did not object to the self-certification requirement but did oppose any third-party review or
audit. 1164 Both commenters assert that such a review would impose unnecessary costs, and that
Commission review would be sufficient. One of these commenters also opposed any minimum
review standards. 1165 In concurrence with these commenters, the Commission has determined at
this time not to establish a minimal level of review or require review by an independent third-party.
c.

Information Requested in Form MA-I

As discussed above, although Form MA-I was proposed as a registration form for all natural
person municipal advisors, Rule15Ba1-3, as adopted, exempts a natural person municipal advisor
from the requirement to register, if such person is associated with a registered municipal advisory
firm and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of a registered firm. 1166 Rule
15Ba1-2(b)(1), as adopted, requires a municipal advisory firm, on behalf of which an associated
natural person engages in municipal advisory activities, to file Form MA-I with the Commission
with respect to each such individual. Pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-2(b)(2), as adopted, a natural person
who is a sole proprietor must file Form MA-I in addition to filing an application to register as a
municipal advisor on Form MA.
The Commission received more than 30 comment letters relating to proposed Form MA-I.
About 25 of these letters concerned the impact that the registration requirement for natural person
municipal advisors would have if applied to volunteer members of public boards, in view of the fact
1163

See Proposal, 76 FR at 850.

1164

See NAIPFA Letter I and Joy Howard WM Financial Strategies Letter. The Commission
also received a third comment letter opposing, as overly-burdensome, any independent party
review either prior to the filing of an initial application or on an annual or periodic basis
thereafter. See Public FA Letter.

1165

See NAIPFA Letter I.

1166

See supra note 938.
328

that registration would require completing a Form MA-I. Because, under the rules as adopted,
volunteer public board members would generally not be required to register, the Commission
believes the concerns of these commenters have been otherwise addressed. 1167
The remaining comment letters concerned the nature and scope of the information requested
by Form MA-I and are discussed below. 1168 After considering the comments, the Commission is
adopting Form MA-I substantially as proposed. However, the Commission is modifying Form MAI to require a few additional points of information and is also eliminating some data requests. In
addition, some of the language in Form MA-I has been modified to reflect the fact that, under the
rules, as adopted, the form is no longer an application for registration and, except in the case of sole
proprietors, will be completed by a firm, rather than by the individual with respect to whom the
form is being filed. 1169
As a general matter, the information requested on Form MA-I, as proposed and adopted, is
similar to information requested on FINRA’s Form U4. 1170 Some questions on Form U4 have been
adapted for purposes of Form MA-I to relate specifically to municipal advisors. Other questions
have been omitted as not necessary or appropriate in the municipal advisor context.
One commenter argued that information sought by Form MA-I largely duplicates

1167

See supra Section III.A.1.c.i. See also infra note 1187.

1168

In addition, the Commission notes that a number of the comments received regarding
proposed Form MA apply similarly to proposed Form MA-I. Examples include concerns
about the duplicative nature of seeking information already gathered through other
registration programs; confidentiality issues; and compliance burdens. These comments
have been discussed in the section on Form MA above and are not further addressed here.
See, e.g., supra notes 991-992 and 995-996 and accompanying text and the Commission’s
response in the discussion following these comments.

1169

For example, the form will now no longer refer to the individual as “the applicant” or “the
registrant.”

1170

See Form U4, supra note 992. See also Proposal, 76 FR at 851, note 237 and accompanying
text.
329

information relating to associated persons sought by Form MA. 1171 The Commission acknowledges
that a municipal advisory firm that registers by filing Form MA must already provide information
on that form concerning the disciplinary history of each of its associated persons, including
employees providing advice on behalf of the firm. However, there is very little overlap between the
information required by Form MA and that required by Form MA-I that cannot be incorporated by
reference. 1172 Moreover, Form MA-I elicits additional information that would not be provided by
the firm as part of its Form MA. For example, Form MA-I requires the following information about
each relevant natural person that would not be found on his or her firm’s Form MA if engaged in
municipal advisory activities on behalf of a firm or on his or her own Form MA if acting as a sole
proprietor: social security number of the individual; other names of the individual; his or her
residential and employment history; the offices of the firm where the individual is located and from
which he or she is supervised; the names of any other municipal advisory firms that employ the
individual; and any other businesses in which the individual is engaged. 1173
1171

See SIFMA Letter I. The concern over duplication of information was raised as an
argument against separate registration of individuals on Form MA-I. The rules, as adopted,
no longer require registration for natural person municipal advisors acting solely as
employees of a municipal advisory firm. However, because Form MA-I is being retained in
the rules, as adopted, the Commission believes it important to address concerns that the
information required by Form MA-I is redundant of information already available from the
firm’s Form MA.

1172

Regarding incorporation by reference, see supra notes 994-995 and accompanying text. The
Commission acknowledges that a municipal advisory firm must already provide information
on Form MA concerning the disciplinary history of each of its associated persons – a term
that includes employees who are “engaged in the management, direction, supervision, or
performance of any activities relating to the provision of advice to or on behalf of a
municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the
issuance of municipal securities.” However, to the extent that the disciplinary history of an
individual is reported in Form MA, it can be incorporated by reference in Form MA-I.

1173

As noted above, the Commission believes that, in fact, there is very little overlap between
the information required by Form MA and that required by Form MA-I. For example, when
Form MA asks for the number of employees of the firm engaged in municipal advisory
activities, such information might be gleaned, technically, by counting all the Form MA-I
330

Therefore, in completing a Form MA-I for each employee, the Commission believes that a
firm will be supplementing, rather than duplicating, the information provided on Form MA. For
this reason, as proposed and adopted, the rules require a sole proprietor to complete and file both
forms.
Among the comments received by the Commission, specifically with regard to Form MA-I,
as has already been discussed, several commenters questioned the need for separate registration
forms for firms and their individual employees. 1174 One commenter believed that separate
registration of individuals on Form MA-I could “lead to confusion” and “inadvertent
inconsistencies in the information.” 1175 Another commenter believed that processing the estimated
21,800 forms expected to be filed would put “significant strain” on the Commission.1176 In addition
to these comments, one commenter suggested that, in lieu of requiring individuals to register
separately with the Commission on Form MA-I, the Commission could “work with the MSRB to
submissions filed by the firm, but is not readily apparent. When Form MA asks for the
names of all associated persons of the firm and requires the firm to indicate whether each
such person is active in certain municipal advisory related fields, the firm is not required to
state whether the associated person is an employee and it does not capture information on
other businesses in which the person is engaged. The requirement to list the firm’s
registration information (which, of course, is available on the firm’s Form MA) on the Form
MA-I of the individual will better serve to identify the individual and locate his or her firm
when only the database of individuals reported on Form MA-I is being searched, separately
from the database in which information obtained in Forms MA is collected. Similarly, the
responses to Form MA’s questions in Item 9, in which a firm must disclose whether any of
its associated persons has had a disciplinary history, do not shed light on the history of any
particular employee unless the relevant DRPs are consulted. Moreover, the disciplinary
history questions in Item 6 of Form MA-I, other than those concerning criminal, regulatory,
and civil judicial actions, do not appear in Form MA.
1174

See Deloitte Letter; JP Morgan Chase Letter; SIFMA Letter I. Deloitte stated that
registration for natural persons should be eliminated altogether; or that individuals at least be
required to register only as “registered representatives.” See also MSRB Letter I, stating
that “forms relating to individuals at municipal advisor entities should be viewed as
officially submitted by the municipal advisor entity.”

establish, through the MSRB, a licensing and registration mechanism for individuals who are
municipal advisors, which would be similar to the program used to register a broker-dealer’s
licensed associated persons with FINRA.” 1177 Further, the commenter stated that, if the
Commission believes it is necessary to formally register individuals (in addition to licensing them),
the MSRB could adopt Form U4 and require it to be filed in connection with granting a license to
individuals who engage in municipal advisory activities on behalf of a Commission- and MSRBregistered municipal advisory firm. 1178 The Commission believes that these comments have been
addressed by the exemption created in the rules, as adopted, for natural persons who engage in
municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of a registered municipal advisor. 1179
Commenters also expressed concerns regarding the disclosures required by Form MA-I and
the plan to make them publicly available. 1180 For example, one commenter believed that some of
the information required in Form MA-I “could not be disclosed by a law enforcement agency, such
as the individual’s detailed criminal history – which includes arrests that do not result in prosecution

1177

Id. SIFMA stated that because the MSRB is already planning to develop qualification tests
for individuals engaged in municipal advisory activities, “having only the MSRB, as
opposed to both the SEC and MSRB, involved in the licensing and registration of
individuals would eliminate duplication and reserve the SEC resources for regulation of
municipal advisory firms.”

1178

See id. SIFMA added that, because many individual municipal advisors may also be
associated persons of a broker-dealer or investment adviser, it would better serve the
interests of the public to have a single source of information—on Form U4—about a
licensed individual. It would also be easier for an individual and his or her employer to
ensure that the individual is properly licensed under all applicable regulatory programs if
only a single form is required to be filed with any applicable regulator. See also Financial
Services Roundtable Letter (advocating use of Form U4 for individuals).

1179

See supra note 938.

1180

The comments cited in this paragraph appeared in the context of letters opposing the
application of the definition of municipal advisor to appointed members of public boards,
see supra note 1161, but are treated here separately because of their possible relevance to
any municipal advisor.
332

or conviction.” 1181 The commenter further believed that “[g]overnment disclosure of a compiled
criminal history is a criminal offense.” 1182
The Commission believes that it is consistent with the Exchange Act to require disclosure of
such information in order to permit persons whom Form MA-I concerns to lawfully engage in
municipal advisory activities. 1183 Regarding a commenter’s concern about government disclosure
of compiled criminal history, the Commission notes that engaging in municipal advisory activities
is voluntary. Persons engaging in municipal advisory activities are on notice that the information
supplied to the Commission on Form MA and MA-I will not be kept confidential (except where
indicated otherwise). Therefore, if a person does not wish to disclose his or her criminal history,
such person may choose to not engage in municipal advisory activities. In addition, the
Commission notes that the information requested on Form MA-I is consistent with comparable
provisions in Forms BD and ADV, as well as Form U4. 1184
One commenter focused on the impact that Form MA-I could have on bank employees,
believing that it would require such information as the addresses of all offices at which the
employee will be physically located or supervised and noting that it was not uncommon for bank
branch employees such as tellers to work at multiple branch locations in a geographic region. 1185
As discussed above, the Commission is limiting the application of the term investment strategies,
providing a limited exemption for banks, and permitting the registration of SIDs. 1186 Due to these

changes, few, if any, bank employees of the type described by the commenter will be engaging in
municipal advisory activities that would require filing of a Form MA-I. For those who are, the
Commission believes that it is as important to obtain this information as it is with respect to any
other natural person who is engaged in municipal advisory activities.
The Commission also received comment letters on Form MA-I from many municipal
entities and agencies concerned about the impact of requiring appointed members of public boards
to make the disclosures required by the form. 1187 As discussed in Section III.A.1.c.i., the
Commission is exempting all members of the governing body of a municipal entity (acting in their
capacity as such), including appointed members, from the requirement to register as municipal
advisors. Thus, the concerns of these commenters should be alleviated.
Items 1 and 2: Identifying Information and Other Names
Item 1 of Form MA-I is being adopted substantially as proposed, with minor modifications
as discussed below. 1188 Item 1 requires certain basic identifying information to be disclosed about
any natural person engaged in municipal advisory activities. 1189 Although, as discussed above,
certain information about an employee of a firm would already be available through the firm’s Form
MA, the individual’s Form MA-I requires more information, including:
• the individual’s CRD Number, if he or she has one;

1187

See, e.g., letter from Barry Moline, Executive Director, Florida Municipal Electric
Association, dated February 22, 2011; and Pennsylvania Public School Employees’
Retirement Board Letter.

1188

No comments were received concerning Item 1.

1189

This includes, for example, the individual’s full legal name. It also requires the registration
and other identifying numbers of the individual’s firm to be provided directly in the Form
MA-I, to make it easier for regulators, municipal entities and investors to gather the
information they need.
334

• the individual’s social security number; 1190
• the date of the individual’s employment or contract with the firm;
• whether the individual has an independent contractor relationship with the firm;
• the firm’s registration status;
• all the offices of the firm where the individual may be physically located and all the offices
from which the individual is or will be supervised; and
• whether any of these offices are located in a private residence.
These elements of Item 1 are being adopted as proposed. With respect to information about
the employee’s firm, Item 1, as proposed, would have required the filer to provide any SEC file and
registration numbers assigned to the firm in any registered capacity and also the firm’s CRD
Numbers, if any. To ease the completion of the form, Item 1, as adopted, requires a filer only to
indicate whether the firm is currently registered as a municipal advisor on a Form MA and, if not,
whether it has filed an application for registration on Form MA. If the latter, the filing date and the
firm’s EDGAR CIK number must be provided.
Item 1, as adopted, additionally requires a filer to provide the name under which the firm
primarily conducts its municipal advisor-related business, if different from its legal name. It further
also takes into account that an individual may be employed at more than one municipal advisory
firm and requires entry of the relevant information for each such firm. 1191 The Commission

1190

This information will not be made publicly available. As stated in the Proposal, this
information is necessary in connection with the Commission’s enforcement and examination
functions pursuant to Section 15B(c) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)). See
Proposal, 76 FR at 851, note 240. See also generally supra note 968.

1191

The form also asks the filer for the total number of such firms. This question does not
require a filer to research any further information than indicated above, but it can serve as a
helpful cross-check to the filer as well as to regulators, and is also a useful number for
interested parties who do not need the additional details.
335

believes that this additional information would be useful to the Commission’s oversight of the
municipal advisory market, without unreasonably increasing the burdens upon registrants in
completing the form.
As proposed, Item 2 requires a filer to disclose all other names that the natural person
engaged in municipal advisory activities is using or has been known by since the age of 18, such as
nicknames, aliases, and names before and after marriage. No comments were received concerning
Item 2, and it is being adopted substantially as proposed.
As stated in the Proposal, the Commission believed that the information sought by Items 1
and 2 would be useful to municipal entities and obligated persons in exploring the background,
credentials, reliability, and trustworthiness of an individual in the course of making a decision
whether to engage that natural person or his or her firm as a municipal advisor. 1192 The same
information will be valuable to regulators in overseeing municipal advisors and investigating
possible instances of wrongdoing.
Item 3: Residential History
In Item 3, which is being adopted substantially as proposed, 1193 Form MA-I requires
disclosure of each location where the natural person engaged in municipal advisory activities has
resided for the past five years, including the time period at each residence. 1194 Changes in residence
must be reported (via an amendment) as they occur. In addition, no gaps greater than three months
between addresses are permitted.
1192

See Proposal, 76 FR at 851.

1193

No comments were received concerning Item 3, other than in the general context of
concerns that the degree of detail required by the forms was overly burdensome and, in
particular, in the context of concerns about registration requirements for appointees to
municipal entity boards, which concerns are discussed elsewhere in this release.

1194

Non-substantive, technical, and clarifying changes have been made to Item 3. See infra note
1237.
336

As stated in the Proposal, the Commission believes that the residential history of a natural
person engaged in municipal advisory activities, like the additional identifying information Form
MA-I seeks, will be useful for municipal entities and other interested parties in exploring the
background, credentials, reliability, and trustworthiness of the individual and be valuable to
regulators in overseeing municipal advisors and investigating possible instances of wrongdoing.
The information that is required regarding residential history is similar to the information requested
on Form U4. 1195
Item 4: Employment History
In Item 4, which is being adopted substantially as proposed, 1196 Form MA-I requires a
listing of the complete employment history of the natural person engaged in municipal advisory
activities for the past ten years, including full and part-time employment, self-employment, military
service, and homemaking. All statuses during the ten-year period, such as unemployed, full-time
education, extended travel, and other similar circumstances must be included. In addition, the filer
may not leave a gap longer than three months between entries. As discussed in the Proposal, the
information required is similar to the information requested on Form U4. 1197 Such information will
help inform an understanding of an employee’s business experience and provide useful information
in preparing for regulatory examinations. 1198

1195

See Proposal, 76 FR at 852. As stated in the Proposal, the Commission does not intend to
make the information required by Item 3 publicly available. See id., at 852, note 241. A
statement to this effect has been added to the introduction to Item 3, as adopted.

1196

No comments were received concerning Item 4, other than in the general context of
concerns that the degree of detail required by the forms was overly burdensome and, in
particular, in the context of concerns about registration requirements for appointees to
municipal entity boards, which concerns are discussed elsewhere in this release.

1197

The Commission intends to make this information publicly available.

1198

See Proposal, 76 FR at 852. Because no separate blanks are provided for statuses other than
employment at a firm or company, (e.g., military service, homemaking, unemployment,

Item 5: Other Business
Item 5 of Form MA-I is being adopted substantially as proposed. 1199 Item 5 requires
information about the individual’s other business activities, if any, in which he or she is currently
engaged, as a proprietor, partner, officer, director, employee, trustee, agent or otherwise. The form
asks for the name of the other business, its address, whether it is municipal advisor-related and, if
not, the nature of the business in which it is engaged.
The filer is required to provide the individual’s position, title, or relationship with the other
business, the start date of the relationship, the approximate number of hours per month the
individual devotes to the other business, and a brief description of his or her duties relating to the
other business. As discussed in the Proposal, the information sought in this section is similar to the
information sought by the equivalent section in Form U4. Such information will help the
Commission understand the other business activities of a natural person engaged in municipal
advisory activities and will help staff prepare for examinations.1200
Item 6: Disclosures Relating to Any Criminal Action, Regulatory Action, Investigation, Civil
Judicial Action, Customer Complaint/Arbitration/Civil Litigation, Termination, Certain Financial
Matters, and Judgments and Liens
Item 6 of Form MA-I, regarding the disciplinary history of the individual, is being adopted
substantially as proposed. 1201 However, the Commission has made some modifications to the
information sought in the DRPs, which are discussed below.

education, or travel), guidance has been included in Item 4, as adopted, instructing the filer
to enter such statuses in the space provided for “Name of Municipal Advisory Firm or
Company.” Regarding non-substantive, technical, and clarifying changes, generally, see
infra note 1237.
1199

No comments were received concerning Item 5. Only slight clarifying changes have been
made in the wording of this item as adopted.

1200

See Proposal, 76 FR at 853.

1201

The Commission received no comments specifically relating to Item 6 in the Proposal.
338

Item 6 of Form MA-I includes three sections that require the same general types of
information regarding an individual’s criminal, regulatory, and civil judicial history, if any, as
required regarding municipal advisory firms in corresponding sections in Form MA, 1202 although
the questions in these sections of Form MA-I differ somewhat from those in the corresponding
sections of Form MA, as will be discussed below. As in Form MA, certain responses in the
criminal, regulatory, and civil judicial action sections of Form MA-I require disclosure of complete
details of all events or proceedings in DRPs pertaining to these areas.
Item 6 of Form MA-I also has five additional disclosure sections 1203 relating to an
individual, which are also discussed below. Four of these ask about any investigations,
terminations, customer complaints/arbitration/civil litigation, or judgments/liens relating to the
individual. Each of these four sections has an associated DRP requiring further detail where
applicable. The fifth additional section, which has no associated DRP, asks for certain financial
disclosures. As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission believes that additional disclosures in
these five areas, which are also required of individuals associated with broker-dealers and
investment advisers on Form U4, are appropriate to aid municipal entities, obligated persons, and
other members of the public in researching the background of municipal advisors and to aid
regulators in enhancing their oversight of municipal advisors. 1204
As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission believes that the additional disclosure items
in the DRPs will be helpful to municipal entities and obligated persons as clients or prospective
1202

See supra Section III.A.2.b.

1203

In the proposed version of Item 6, the question about investigations appeared at the end of
the Regulatory Action section. In the adopted version, a separate section has been created
for this question (which remains the same) for the sake of clarity, as it concerns both
criminal and regulatory investigations. Form MA-I, both as proposed and adopted, has a
separate DRP that concerns only investigations reported in this question.

1204

See Proposal, 76 FR at 853.
339

clients of municipal advisors. 1205 The information may also serve as the basis for granting or
instituting proceedings to deny a registration or for revoking a registration or imposing other
sanctions by the Commission with respect to an individual. 1206
As a general matter, as was the case with the proposed DRPs of Form MA, many of the
questions in the proposed DRPs of Form MA-I did not ask for specifics. The Commission believes
that, with regard to certain questions, additional details of the kind requested in the adopted versions
of Form MA’s DRPs will help regulators, municipal entities, and other interested parties more
easily research and better assess the background of the individual that is the subject of the DRP of
Form MA-I. 1207 Thus, many of the revisions made to the DRPs of Form MA have also been made
to the DRPs of Form MA-I.
Among these are changes in questions relating to: removing a DRP filed in error; 1208
incorporation by reference of disclosures already filed elsewhere; 1209 names and types of courts,
regulatory authorities and forums and their locations, and parties who initiated the relevant
action; 1210 how to report an event ; 1211 appeals; 1212 disposition of a case and sanctions imposed in
criminal cases; 1213 sanctions and/or relief sought, type of resolution, and sanctions ordered in

regulatory and civil judicial actions; 1214 and other matters. 1215
The following discussion summarizes Item 6 and its related DRPs as well as additional
revisions made in their adopted versions:
Criminal Action Disclosures
With respect to felonies, Item 6 of Form MA-I – in contrast to the disclosures required by
Item 9-A of Form MA – requires disclosure of:
• any past conviction of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony by the individual,
rather than limiting the disclosure to the past ten years, as in a firm’s or solo
practitioner’s Form MA;
•

any charges of felony against the individual in the past, rather than limiting disclosure to
currently pending charges, as in a firm’s or sole proprietor’s Form MA; and

•

any convictions of, or plea of guilty or nolo contendere to, a felony by an organization
based on activities that occurred when the individual exercised control over the
organization – a disclosure not required in Form MA.

With respect to misdemeanors, while Form MA requires only disclosures of convictions and
pleas concerning an individual looking back ten years, and requires only disclosures of charges that
are currently pending, Form MA-I requires disclosure of such convictions, pleas, and charges that
occurred at any time in the individual’s past. Misdemeanors, and convictions, pleas, and charges of
misdemeanor against an organization while the individual exercised control over the organization
are also required to be disclosed.
These criminal action disclosure requirements regarding individuals beyond the information

1214

See supra notes 1137-1139 and accompanying text.

1215

See supra notes 1140-1142 and accompanying text.
341

required in Form MA, are consistent with the disclosure requirements on Form U4. In addition, as
discussed in the Proposal, these disclosures provide additional information with respect to natural
persons engaged in municipal advisory activities that will be useful to the Commission’s regulatory
and examination programs, and may be useful to municipal entities and obligated persons who are
clients or prospective clients of the individual or his or her firm. 1216
As proposed and adopted, the Criminal Action DRP of Form MA-I asks for additional
details regarding, among other things: the charges, number of counts, and the court in which they
were brought; status of the action; details of its disposition and sanctions ordered; and the date of
amended charges, if any. It also provides an option and space for comment consisting of a brief
summary of the circumstances leading to the charge(s) as well as their current or final disposition.
Certain revisions have been made in the adopted version of the DRP. For example, in its
disclosure requirements concerning the charges, the DRP, as adopted, asks specifically whether the
charge is (a) municipal advisor-related or (b) investment-related; and, if so, in each case, (c) what
product type it involved. 1217
Moreover, as proposed, the DRP required a description, in narrative form, of details
concerning any sentence or penalty imposed, its start date, and its duration, and the amount and date
of payment. 1218 As adopted, the DRP asks specifically whether any sentence or any other penalty is
1216

See Proposal, 76 FR at 853.

1217

The Commission believes that these additional details contribute to an accurate picture of
the individual’s disciplinary history and notes that the same questions are asked in the
equivalent DRP of Form MA, as both proposed and adopted. On the other hand, specific
questions regarding pleas to amended charges have been removed as unnecessary because
the requested information should be provided in responses to other questions.

1218

The form provided a blank space for: “Sentence/Penalty, Duration (if suspension, probation,
etc.), Start Date of Penalty: (MM/DD/YYYY), End date of Penalty (MM/DD/YYYY); If
Monetary penalty/fine – Amount paid, Date monetary/penalty fine paid: (MM/DD/YYYY),
if not exact, provide explanation.” It also gave the filer the option of providing “a brief
summary of circumstances leading to the charge(s) as well as the current status or final
342

ordered, and requires, if so, a description of whether it involved prison, jail, probation, community
service, counseling, education, or other. It further asks, in question-by-question format, for the
duration in days, months, and/or years of any incarceration, the start and end dates, whether any
concurrent sentence is to be served, and, if so, the end date. It also asks, in question-by-question
format, whether any portion of a monetary penalty was reduced or suspended, whether it has been
paid in full, and, if not, how much remains unpaid. These details should contribute to the clarity of
the picture received by regulators, municipal entities, and investors of the individual’s disciplinary
background.
Finally, the proposed Criminal Action DRP of Form MA-I did not ask specifically about
appeals. In its adopted version, the DRP asks whether the criminal action was appealed, and, if so,
the name and location of the appeals court, and other details. Choices are also provided to describe
specifically the disposition of any appeal. 1219 The Commission believes that obtaining this
information will better enable regulators, municipal entities, and other interested parties to research
the complete criminal history of the individual. 1220
Regulatory Action Disclosures
As proposed and adopted, the questions in Item 6 of Form MA-I relating to regulatory
actions by the Commission or the CFTC, similar to those in Form U4, require the same disclosures
as in proposed Item 9 of Form MA and additional disclosures, including whether the Commission
or the CFTC has ever found the individual to have:

disposition.”
1219

These choices are: affirmed; vacated and returned for further action; or vacated/final. An
applicant may also respond “other,” in which case the other type of disposition must be
specified.

1220

See also supra note 1134.
343

•

willfully violated, or been unable to comply with, any provision of the federal securities
laws, the Commodity Exchange Act, and the rules thereunder, and any rule of the MSRB;

•

willfully aided, abetted, commanded, induced, or procured the violation by any other
person of these laws and rules; and

•

failed reasonably to supervise another person subject to his or her supervision with a
view to preventing violation of these laws and rules.

As proposed and adopted, Form MA-I requires the same disclosures as proposed Form MA
with respect to findings and actions relating to the individual by other federal regulatory agencies,
state regulatory agencies, and foreign financial regulatory authorities. It also requires additional
disclosures, including whether the individual has ever been subject to a final order of a state
securities commission or similar agency or office; state authority that supervises or examines banks,
savings associations, or credit unions; state insurance commission; an appropriate federal banking
agency; or the National Credit Union Administration that:
•

bars the individual
from association with an entity regulated by such commission, agency, authority or
office, or from engaging in the business of securities, insurance, banking, savings
association activities, or credit union activities; or

•

constitutes a final
order based on violations of laws or regulations that prohibit fraudulent, manipulative, or
deceptive conduct.

In addition to the disclosures required of a municipal advisory firm regarding its individual
associated persons on proposed Form MA, Form MA-I as proposed and adopted requires disclosure
of any finding by an SRO that the individual:

344

•

willfully violated, or is unable to comply with, any provision of the federal securities
laws, the Commodity Exchange Act and the rules thereunder, or the rules of the MSRB;

•

willfully aided, abetted, counseled, commanded, induced, or procured the violation of
any of these laws or rules; or

•

failed reasonably to supervise another person subject to his or her supervision, with a
view to preventing such violations.

Like Form MA, Form MA-I as proposed and adopted also requires disclosure of whether the
individual had an authorization to act as an attorney, accountant or federal contractor revoked or
suspended.
Item 6 of Form MA-I as proposed and adopted also requires disclosure of whether the
individual has been notified in writing that he or she is currently the subject of a regulatory
complaint or proceeding that could result in any occurrence of the kind that would trigger any of the
disclosure requirements described above relating to regulatory actions, except the latter occurrence
pertaining to attorneys, accountants, and federal contractors. The form advises that if the answer is
affirmative, the filer must complete a Regulatory Action DRP. 1221
The DRP for regulatory action disclosure in Form MA-I, as proposed and adopted, requires
the filer to provide further details, including: the allegations, which regulatory authority initiated
the action, the kind of product involved, and the sanctions sought; the status of the action; the
disposition or resolution of the action, the sanctions ordered, and their duration; the registration
capacities of the individual that were affected; whether requalification was a condition of any
1221

Form MA does not include an analogous question and advisory in its regulatory action
section. Item 6, as proposed, also asked whether the individual has been notified in writing
that he or she is the subject of an investigation that could result in affirmative answers to
questions about criminal and regulatory actions above in the form. This question has been
separated into a separate section in the form, as adopted, titled “Investigation Disclosures.”
See infra note 1223 and accompanying text.
345

sanction reported, and whether it was by exam, retraining, or other process; the length of time given
to requalify; and whether the requalification condition was satisfied. Disclosures required in the
Regulatory Action DRP, as proposed, also include details of any monetary sanction imposed,
including amount; portion levied against the individual; any amount waived; payment plan; whether
such plan was current; date paid; and whether the sanction was a civil or administrative penalty or
fine, a monetary penalty other than a fine, disgorgement, or restitution. Revisions made in the
Regulatory Action DRP, as adopted, include the following:
• In the DRP, as proposed, a filer was asked to identify every type of product involved in the
action. As adopted, the DRP requires the filer to distinguish between principal product
types and other products.
• As proposed, the DRP asked about any bars and suspensions of the individual from his or
her registration capacities. As adopted, the DRP also requires information specific to
any injunction that was imposed as a regulatory sanction.
• In addition to the questions about requalification and exams, as described above, the DRP
as adopted asks for a description in narrative form of any examination, re-training, or
other process that was required as a condition for the person to re-qualify.
The Commission believes that these additional details will provide regulators, municipal
entities, and investors with a more accurate picture of disciplinary history of the individual. 1222
Disclosure of Investigations 1223
Item 6 of Form MA-I, as proposed and adopted, asks whether the individual has been
1222

Other revisions in the adopted version of the Regulatory Action DRP: The form now asks
for date of service of process in pending actions; and additional details when one or more
injunctions specify different time periods; and more choices to describe sanctions sought,
how the action was resolved, and sanctions ordered.

1223

See supra note 1203.
346

notified in writing that he or she is currently the subject of any investigation that could result in a
positive answer to any of the questions in either the criminal and regulatory sections of Item 6
described, except the question pertaining to attorneys, accountants, and federal contractors. If the
answer is positive, an Investigation DRP must be filed.
The Investigation DRP requires details of any such investigation, including the date the
investigation was initiated and whether it was initiated by an SRO, a foreign financial regulatory
authority (giving the specific jurisdiction), the Commission, other federal agency, or “other.” The
Investigation DRP requires that the full name of the authority that initiated the investigation be
specified. Space is provided for the filer to briefly describe the nature of the investigation, if
known; whether it was pending or resolved; and details of any resolution. Space for optional
comment is also provided to present a brief summary of the circumstances leading to the
investigation and its current status or final disposition and/or findings.
The Investigation DRP also asks for similar details regarding a criminal investigation by a
federal, military, state, foreign or international authority or court. Although Item 6 requires a DRP
for criminal investigations, the DRP, as proposed, did not specifically reference criminal
investigations or authorities.
Civil Judicial Action Disclosure
The disclosures required by Form MA-I with respect to certain matters relating to an
individual’s civil judicial history are the same as disclosures required on Form MA. Thus, a filer is
required to disclose on Form MA-I whether the individual:
•

was ever enjoined by a domestic or foreign court in connection with any investmentrelated or municipal advisor-related activity;

347

•

was ever found by a domestic or foreign court to be involved in a violation of any
investment-related or municipal advisor-related statute or regulation; or

•

ever had an investment-related or municipal advisor-related civil action brought against
him or her dismissed, pursuant to a settlement agreement, by a domestic jurisdiction 1224
or foreign financial regulatory authority; or

•

was ever named in any such pending action that could result in a positive answer to the
three previous questions.

As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission believes that it is appropriate to seek
information regarding investment-related activities as well as municipal advisor-related activities
due to the significant similarities that exist between the two advisory functions. Moreover, such
information could serve as a basis to institute proceedings to deny registration of a municipal
advisor or to impose other sanctions on the municipal advisor’s activities. 1225
A DRP is required for affirmative responses to questions under this item. Specifically, the
DRP requires, among other things, information regarding: by whom the court action was initiated;
the name of the party initiating the proceeding; information about the relief sought; the date on
which the action was filed and notice or process was served; the types of financial products
involved; a description of the allegations relating to the civil action; the current status, including
whether the action is on appeal and details relating to any such appeal; sanction details; and if the
disposition resulted in a fine, disgorgement, restitution or monetary compensation, information
relating thereto. The DRP also provides the opportunity for a filer to provide additional comment,

1224

The phrase “domestic jurisdiction” is used in the form, as adopted, in place of “state” in the
proposed version. The question of whether such an occurrence is part of the individual’s
history was not intended to be limited to state actions.

1225

See Proposal, 76 FR at 854-855.
348

including a summary of the circumstances leading to the action and current status.
The Civil Judicial Action DRP, as adopted, has been modified to ask whether the individual
is a named defendant in the action for which the DRP is being completed; 1226 indicate, if an order
was issued, whether the order is a final order based on violations of any laws or regulations that
prohibit fraudulent or deceptive conduct; and indicate whether a condition of any sanction was
requalification by examination, retraining, or other process. The Commission believes that these
changes generally will add clarity for filers in determining the type of information that must be
provided. 1227
Customer Complaints/Arbitration/Civil Litigation
Form MA does not require a municipal advisory firm to disclose any customer complaints,
arbitration matters, and civil litigation concerning natural person municipal advisors. Form MA-I,
however, requires disclosure of whether an individual engaged in municipal advisory activities has
ever been:
•

the subject of a complaint initiated by a customer, whether written or oral, regarding
investment-related or municipal advisor-related matters, which alleged that he or she
was involved in fraud, false statements, omissions, theft, embezzlement, wrongful taking
of property, bribery, forgery, counterfeiting, extortion, and dishonest, unfair or unethical
practices; or

1226

In addition, this DRP, as proposed and adopted, asked for the full name(s) of the plaintiff(s)
in the action. The adopted version further asks the filer whether all plaintiffs were fully
identified, to make clear that the information needs to be complete.

1227

In addition, the list of sanctions or relief that are specified as required to be reported has
more detail in order to provide more choices for filers. The list of specific possible
resolutions of the action that the applicant can indicate as applicable has also been expanded.
More information also is sought regarding details of how the action was resolved, and, if
resolved with sanctions, more details about those sanctions.
349

•

the subject of an arbitration or civil litigation initiated by a customer regarding
investment-related or municipal advisor-related matters, which alleged that he or she
was involved in fraud, false statements, omissions, theft, embezzlement, wrongful taking
of property, bribery, forgery, counterfeiting, extortion, and dishonest, unfair or unethical
practices.

In the case of a complaint, the filer must indicate whether the complaint is still pending or
was settled. In the case of arbitration or civil litigation, the filer must indicate whether the
arbitration or litigation is still pending; resulted in an arbitration award or civil judgment against the
individual in any amount; or was settled.
A DRP is required for affirmative responses to questions under this item. Specifically, the
relevant DRP requires the filer to disclose the customer’s name; the customer’s state of residence
and other states of residence; the employing firm of the individual when the activities occurred that
led to the complaint, arbitration, CFTC reparation or civil litigation; and the allegations and a brief
summary of events related to the allegations, including the dates when they occurred; the product
type; and the alleged compensatory damage amount.
For customer complaints, arbitration, CFTC reparation, or civil litigation in which the
individual is not a named party, the DRP requires disclosure of whether the complaint is oral or
written, or whether it is an arbitration, CFTC reparation or civil litigation (and the arbitration or
reparation forum, docket or case number, and the filing date); whether the complaint, arbitration,
CFTC reparation or civil litigation is pending, and if not, the status. The DRP requires disclosure of
the status date and the settlement award amount, including the individual’s contribution amount.
If the matter involves an arbitration or CFTC reparation and the individual is a named
respondent, the DRP requires disclosure of the entity with which the claim was filed; the docket or

350

case number; the date process was served; whether the arbitration of CFTC reparation is pending,
and if not pending the form of disposition; the disposition date; and the amount of the monetary
award, settlement or reparation (including the individual’s contribution).
If the matter involves a civil litigation in which the individual is a defendant, the DRP
requires disclosure of the court in which the case was filed; the location of the court; the docket or
case number; the date the complaint was served on or received by the individual; whether the
litigation is still pending; if not still pending the form of its disposition; the disposition date; the
judgment, restitution or settlement amount, including the individual’s contribution amount; whether
the action is currently on appeal, and if so, the date the appeal was filed, the court in which the
appeal was filed, the location of the court, and the docket or case number for the appeal. The DRP
also provides for optional additional comment, such as a summary of the circumstances leading to
the complaint.
As discussed in the Proposal, these disclosures, too, mirror similar disclosures in Form U4,
provide additional information about natural persons engaged in municipal advisory activities that
may be useful to municipal entities or obligated persons as clients or prospective clients, and help
the Commission prepare for and plan examinations. 1228
Several revisions have been made to this DRP, as adopted. In the questions relating to
settlements, awards, and monetary judgments, the DRP now additionally asks whether any portion
of the individual’s settlement, award, or monetary judgment amount was waived, and, if so, how
much; and whether the final amount was paid in full, and, if so, the date. In the section relating to

1228

See Proposal, 76 FR at 855.
351

civil litigation, the DRP now additionally asks whether the individual appealed, and, if so, to which
court, its location, and other details. 1229
Termination Disclosure
Unlike Form MA, Form MA-I requires disclosure regarding the termination of a natural
person’s employment. Specifically, consistent with Form U4, Form MA-I asks whether the
individual ever voluntarily resigned or was discharged or permitted to resign after allegations were
made that accused him or her of:
•

violating investment-related or municipal advisor-related statutes, regulations, rules, or
industry standards of conduct;

•

fraud or the wrongful taking of property; or

•

failure to supervise in connection with investment-related or municipal advisor-related
statutes, regulations, rules or industry standards of conduct.

An affirmative response to the questions described above requires additional information on
a related DRP. Specifically, the DRP requires disclosure of the name of the firm, the type of
termination (whether discharged, permitted to resign, or voluntary resignation), the termination
date, the allegations, and the product types. The DRP also provides for optional additional
comment, such as a summary of the circumstances leading to the termination.
As discussed in the Proposal, this disclosure will provide information that will be useful to
the Commission in planning and preparing for inspections and examinations. The disclosure also
will be useful to the public generally (including municipal entities and obligated persons, as clients
or prospective clients). 1230

1229

See generally supra notes 1208-1215.

1230

See Proposal, 76 FR at 856.
352

Financial Disclosures
Item 6 of Form MA-I, as proposed and as adopted, also requires financial disclosures
regarding individuals that are not required to be made on Form MA by municipal advisory firms,
generally, regarding their associated persons or by sole proprietors regarding themselves.
Specifically, the form asks the filer whether, within the past ten years:
•

the individual has made a compromise with creditors, filed a bankruptcy petition, or
been the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition;

•

an organization controlled by the individual has made a compromise with creditors, filed
a bankruptcy petition, or been the subject of an involuntary bankruptcy petition based
upon events that occurred while he or she exercised control over it; or

•

a broker or dealer controlled by the individual has been the subject of an involuntary
bankruptcy petition, had a trustee appointed, or had a direct payment procedure initiated
under the Securities Investor Protection Act based upon events that occurred while he or
she exercised control over it.

In addition, a filer must disclose whether a bonding company ever denied, paid out on, or
revoked a bond for the individual. There is no DRP associated with these financial disclosures.
Judgment / Lien Disclosure
Item 6 of Form MA-I also asks whether the individual has any unsatisfied judgments or liens
against him or her. An affirmative response requires additional disclosure on a DRP. Specifically,
the filer must disclose the amount, holder, and type of the judgment or lien. The form also requires
information about the date the judgment or lien was filed, the court in which the action was brought,
the name and location of the court, the docket or case number, 1231 whether the judgment or lien is

1231

See supra note 968.
353

outstanding, and if the judgment or lien is not outstanding, the status date and how the matter was
resolved. The DRP also provides for optional comment, such as a brief summary of the
circumstances leading to the action. 1232
As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission believes that the information that is required,
which is consistent with that required by Form U4, will be useful for its regulatory purposes,
including planning and preparing for inspections and examinations. The Commission also believes
that the information will be useful to the public generally (including municipal entities and
obligated persons, as clients or prospective clients). 1233
Other Changes in Form MA-I, As Adopted
Additional modifications to the DRPs
The Commission has made the following modifications to the DRPs in addition to those
discussed above. An instruction has been added at the beginning of all the DRPs, regarding
incorporation by reference, to clarify that the filer of Form MA-I may incorporate information either
from a DRP that was filed by the firm, or from a DRP filed by another Commission registrant about
the individual. This should help filers avoid the inconvenience and burden of completing the
additional information.
When a DRP is being filed to remove a previously filed DRP, the filer in each case is asked
whether the reason is because the matter was resolved in the individual’s favor, or because the DRP
was filed in error. 1234 Moreover, as proposed, several of the DRPs asked for the name of the
employing firm of the individual when the relevant event occurred only if the firm was a municipal
1232

Modifications made to the DRPs of Form MA-I as adopted are discussed below under the
sub-heading, “Other Changes in Form MA-I, As Adopted.”

1233

See Proposal, 76 FR at 856.

1234

This question is adapted from a similar question in the DRPs to Form MA, and should help
clarify the status of the applicant for users of the information.

advisory firm. 1235 The Commission has concluded, however, that the name of the individual’s
employer when the activity occurred can be useful to regulators, municipal entities, and investors
regardless of whether the individual was employed specifically by a municipal advisory firm, and is
not limiting the requested information to such firms. In the case of a municipal advisory firm
employer, however, the DRPs as adopted ask for the municipal advisor registration number of the
firm. 1236
As proposed, the Regulatory and Civil Action DRPs asked the filer to identify the principal
product types that were the subject of the activity regarding which the formal action involving the
individual was taken. As adopted, they also ask for any other product types. Finally, the adopted
versions of the Regulatory and Civil Action DRPs ask for the date on which notice or other process
was served if the action being reported on the DRP is still pending.
An Associated Person Who Ceases to be Engaged in Municipal Advisory Activities
Because Form MA-I, as adopted, is not a registration form, when a natural person associated
with a registered municipal advisor ceases to engage in municipal advisory activities on its behalf,
Form MA-W – which is a form designed for withdrawal of registration – will not be required.
Instead, the change must be reported by the registered municipal advisor that filed the Form MA-I
relating to that person. This is accomplished by filing an amendment to the Form MA-I, which
must be submitted promptly, like any other amendment.
For this purpose, a filer submitting an amendment to Form MA-I can indicate that the
purpose of the amendment is to report that the individual to whom the form relates is no longer an
associated person of the municipal advisory firm or no longer engages in municipal advisory

Complaint/Arbitration/Civil Litigation DRPs.

The Commission believes this specific information is particularly relevant for municipal
advisor regulation.
355

activities on its behalf. When submitting an amendment of this kind, the filer must complete only
the portion of the form asking for the name of the individual, his or her social security number, and
CRD Number if any (Item 1-A) and the Execution Page of the form (Item 7).
Non-Substantive, Technical, and Clarifying Changes
In addition, a number of non-substantive, technical and clarifying changes have been made
to Form MA-I, as adopted, to make the form clearer and more user-friendly. These include, where
applicable, the same kinds of changes made to Form MA. 1237
Item 7: Execution of the Form
If Form MA-I is being filed by a municipal advisory firm with respect to a natural person
engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf, the authorized representative of the firm who
signs the Execution Page of Form MA-I must attest to the truth and correctness of the information
provided in the form. He or she must also attest that the firm has obtained and retained written
consent from the individual that service of any civil action brought by, or notice of any proceeding
before, the SEC or any self-regulatory organization in connection with the individual’s municipal
advisory activities may be given by registered or certified mail to the individual’s address given in
Item 1 of the firm.
If Form MA-I is being filed by a natural person municipal advisor who is a sole proprietor,
by signing the Execution Page of Form MA-I, the filer must represent that the information and
statements made in the form are true and correct. He or she must also consent that service of
process of any civil action or notice of any proceeding before the Commission or an SRO regarding
its municipal advisory activities may be given by registered or certified mail to the address he or she
1237

See supra note 1147. Examples of other revisions of this nature in Form MA-I include:
Guidance advising filers to refer to the Specific Instructions for Form MA-I; corrections of
inaccurate references; clarifying and editorial changes; and additional instructions to aid the
filer that do not introduce any substantive changes.
356

has supplied in Item 1of the form.
As proposed, Form MA-I also required its signatory to certify that he or she has: (a)
sufficient qualifications, training, experience, and competence to effectively carry out his or her
designated functions; (b) met, or within any applicable required timeframes will meet, such
standards of training, experience, and competence, and such other qualifications, including testing,
for a municipal advisor, required by the Commission, the MSRB or any other relevant SRO; and (c)
the necessary understanding of, and ability to comply with, all applicable regulatory obligations.
The Commission received comment letters on the self-certification requirement in Form
MA-I from many municipal entities and agencies concerned about the impact of requiring appointed
members of public boards to make such certifications. As discussed in Section III.A.1.c.i., the
Commission is exempting all members of the governing body of a municipal entity (acting in their
capacity as such), including appointed members, from the requirement to register as municipal
advisors. Thus, the Commission believes that the concerns of these commenters have been
addressed. However, one comment received by the Commission regarding the self-certification
requirement in Form MA-I, as proposed, called the requirement “problematic.” 1238
In view of the change in the nature of Form MA-I, as adopted, including who is required to
sign the form, the Commission has decided to eliminate the self-certification requirement in Item 7.
Because, under the rules, as adopted, individuals who engage in municipal advisory activities on
behalf of a registered firm are exempt from registration, and, with respect to these individuals, the
function of Form MA-I is only to provide information, the self-certification requirement is no
longer a propos. Moreover, as discussed above, the Commission has determined to remove the selfcertification requirement with respect to firms in Form MA. Thus, Form MA-I, as adopted, will no

1238

See SIFMA Letter I.
357

longer require self-certification.
3. Rule 15Ba1-3: Exemption of Certain Natural Persons Associated with
Registered Municipal Advisors From Registration 1239
Rule 15Ba1-3, as adopted, exempts certain natural persons from registration with the
Commission as a municipal advisor if the natural person is associated with a registered municipal
advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of a registered municipal
advisor. This exemption is discussed above in Section III.A.2.a. 1240
4. Rule 15Ba1-4: Withdrawal From Municipal Advisor Registration; Form
MA-W
a.

Rule 15Ba1-4: Withdrawal From Municipal Advisor Registration

Proposed Rule 15Ba1-3 provided that notice of withdrawal from registration as a municipal
advisor must be filed on Form MA-W, in accordance with the instructions to the form, and set forth
other requirements regarding withdrawal of a municipal advisor from registration. The Commission
received one comment letter regarding this proposed rule which supported the proposed rule. 1241
The Commission is adopting Rule 15Ba1-4 as it was set forth in proposed Rule 15Ba1-3, with
certain minor, technical modifications. 1242 The rule as adopted, however, only applies to municipal
advisors registered on Form MA, because the Commission is exempting from registration certain
natural persons who are associated persons of a registered municipal advisor and who engage in
municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of a registered municipal advisor. 1243

1239

Rule 15Ba1-3, under the Proposal, contained the requirements for a municipal advisor to
withdraw an existing registration. This provision is being adopted as Rule 15Ba1-4, which
is discussed below.

1240

See supra notes 938-939 and accompanying text.

1241

See MSRB Letter I.

1242

See Rule 15Ba1-4, as adopted. The modifications are non-substantive and are limited to
updating citations in the rule text or changing the article “such” to the article “the.”

1243

In the Proposal, the Commission proposed to require natural person municipal advisors to
358

As with Forms MA and MA-I, Form MA-W must be filed electronically with the
Commission. 1244 Form MA-W also constitutes a “report” for purposes of Sections 15B(c), 17(a),
18(a), 32(a) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c), 78q(a), 78r(a), 78ff(a)) and other applicable provisions of the
Exchange Act. 1245
Rule 15Ba1-4 also provides that a notice of withdrawal from registration becomes effective
for all matters on the 60th day after the filing of the Form MA-W. It may also become effective
within a longer time period to which the municipal advisor consents or which the Commission by
order determines as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors,
or within a shorter time if the Commission so determines. 1246
The rule further provides that if a municipal advisor filed a notice of withdrawal from
registration with the Commission at any time subsequent to the date of issuance of a Commission
order instituting proceedings pursuant to Section 15B(c) of the Exchange Act 1247 to censure, place
limitations on the activities, functions or operations of, or suspend or revoke the registration of the
municipal advisor or if, prior to the effective date of the notice of withdrawal, the Commission
institutes such a proceeding or a proceeding to impose terms and conditions upon the withdrawal,
the notice of withdrawal will not become effective except at the time and upon the terms and
register on proposed Form MA-I and accordingly proposed that these natural person
municipal advisors would be required to file a Form MA-W to withdraw from registration
with the Commission as a municipal advisor. See Proposal, 76 FR at 850, 857. As
discussed in more detail in Section III.A.2.a. and Section III.A.3., the Commission is
adopting an exemption from registration for certain natural persons and Form MA-I will not
be an application for registration.
1244

See Rule 15Ba1-4(b).

1245

See Rule 15Ba1-4(d). As a consequence, it will also be unlawful for a municipal advisor to
willfully make or cause to be made, a false or misleading statement of a material fact or omit
to state a material fact in Form MA-W.

See Rule 15Ba1-4(c).

conditions as deemed by the Commission as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the
protection of investors. 1248
b. Form MA-W
The Commission received one comment letter regarding Form MA-W, which was generally
supportive of the form. 1249 As discussed in more detail above, 1250 the Commission is exempting
certain natural persons from municipal advisor registration. Accordingly, the Commission is
adopting Form MA-W substantially as proposed, but is modifying it solely to remove all references
to individual registration of natural persons associated with a municipal advisor and engaged in
municipal advisory activities on its behalf and to Form MA-I as an application for registration 1251
and to add an introductory direction to refer to the General Instructions for the forms in the MA
series before completing Form MA-W. Form MA-W for municipal advisors is designed to be
generally consistent with the requirements of Form ADV-W for investment advisers withdrawing
from registration. First, Form MA-W requires a municipal advisor to provide identifying
information keyed to the identifying information on, and the SEC file number of, the municipal
advisor’s Form MA. A municipal advisor is required to provide on Form MA-W the name of a

1248

See Rule 15Ba1-4(c).

1249

See MSRB Letter I.

1250

See supra note 1243 and supra Section III.A.2.a. and Section III.A.3.

1251

The Commission has removed references in certain instructions that contemplated individual
registration of certain natural persons on Form MA-I and that designated Form MA-I as a
registration form. Additionally, on the Execution Page, the Commission has also removed
the certification for natural person municipal advisors other than sole proprietors.
When a natural person for whom a municipal advisory firm filed a Form MA-I is no longer
an associated person or no longer engages in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the
firm, the firm must file an amendment to the Form MA-I to indicate this change. See
General Instruction 2.d. of the General Instructions and supra Section III.A.2.c., under subheading “An Associated Person Who Ceases to be Engaged in Municipal Advisory
Activities.”
360

principal or employee of the municipal advisor who is authorized to receive information and
respond to questions about the Form MA-W. Contact information for a municipal advisor’s outside
counsel is insufficient.
A municipal advisor filing to withdraw its registration is required to indicate on Form MAW whether it has received any pre-paid fees for municipal advisory activities that have not been
delivered, including subscription fees for publications, and, if so, to specify the amount. In
addition, the withdrawing municipal advisor is required to indicate how much money, if any, it has
borrowed from clients and has not repaid. If the municipal advisor responds affirmatively to either
question, it is required to disclose on Schedule W2 to Form MA-W the nature and amount of its
assets and liabilities and its net worth as of the last day of the month prior to the filing of the Form
MA-W.
A municipal advisor that is filing to withdraw its registration is required to indicate on Form
MA-W whether it has assigned any municipal advisory contracts to another person that engages in
municipal advisory activities, and if so, the municipal advisor is required to list in Section 4 of
Schedule W1 to Form MA-W each person to whom it has assigned any such municipal advisory
contracts and provide the requested information.
A municipal advisor filing to withdraw its registration also is required to indicate whether
there are any unsatisfied judgments or liens against it. If the municipal advisor responds
affirmatively that it owes money or has any judgments or liens against it, it is required to disclose
on Schedule W2 to Form MA-W the nature and amount of its assets and liabilities and its net worth
as of the last day of the month prior to the filing of the Form MA-W.
As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission believes that requiring such information from
a withdrawing municipal advisor is appropriate for the protection of investors and those persons

361

who do business with municipal advisors. 1252 The filing of Form MA-W and the information
contained in the form will provide notice that the municipal advisor is no longer registered and,
therefore, is not able to engage in municipal advisory activities without violating federal securities
laws. 1253 Additionally, the information provided will alert clients and prospective clients to a
municipal advisor’s financial stability if the municipal advisor received fees from clients for
services not yet delivered, borrowed any money from clients that has not been repaid, or has any
unsatisfied judgments or liens at the time of withdrawal because the municipal advisor would be
required to disclose the nature and amount of its assets and liabilities and net worth on Schedule
W2. This information also will help regulators’ investigative and enforcement efforts.
Additionally, as noted in the Proposal, an investment adviser that withdraws from registration must
supply similar information on its Form ADV-W. 1254
As discussed below, Rule 15Ba1-8(c), as adopted, requires a municipal advisor withdrawing
from registration to preserve its books and records. 1255 Therefore, a municipal advisor filing a Form
MA-W is required to list the name and address of each person who has or will have custody or
possession of the municipal advisor’s books and records and the location at which such books and
records are or will be kept. In addition, as discussed above, a withdrawing municipal advisor also is
required to identify on Schedule W1 each person to whom it has assigned any of its contracts. As
discussed in the Proposal, the Commission believes that such a requirement – which also exists for
investment advisers – is important for the protection of participants in the municipal securities

markets. 1256
The signatory to the Form MA-W is required to certify, under penalty of perjury, that the
information and statements made in the Form MA-W, including any exhibits or other information
submitted, are true. If the form is being filed on behalf of a municipal advisor that is not a sole
proprietor, 1257 the signature constitutes such certification by both the municipal advisor and the
signatory. Similarly, the signatory is required to certify that the municipal advisor’s books and
records will be preserved and available for inspection as required by law. The signatory is also
required to authorize any person having custody or possession of these books and records to make
them available to authorized regulatory representatives.
The certification includes a statement that all information previously submitted on the
municipal advisor’s most recent Form MA (and Form MA-I for sole proprietors) is accurate and
complete as of the date the Form MA-W was signed. It also includes an understanding by the
signatory that if any information contained in items on the Form MA-W is different from the
information contained on the most recent Form MA (and MA-I for sole proprietors), the
information on the Form MA-W will replace the corresponding entry on the municipal advisor’s
Form MA (and/or MA-I for sole proprietors). As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission
believes that the certification requirement should serve as an effective means to assure that the
information supplied in Form MA-W is correct. 1258

1256

See Proposal, 76 FR at 857.

1257

As discussed in the Proposal, in the case of a municipal advisor that is not a sole proprietor,
the signatory’s certification includes a statement that he or she has signed on behalf of and
with the authority of the municipal advisor firm withdrawing the registration. See id., at
857, note 254.

1258

See id., at 858.

5. Rule 15Ba1-5: Amendments to Form MA and Form MA-I
Proposed Rule 15Ba1-4 set forth requirements regarding when amendments to Form MA
and Form MA-I are required and how such amendments must be filed. The Commission received
one comment letter regarding this proposed rule which supported the proposed rule. 1259 The
Commission is adopting Rule 15Ba1-5 substantially as proposed in Rule 15Ba1-4, but is modifying
the rule primarily to be consistent with the exemption of certain natural persons from municipal
advisor registration that the Commission is adopting in Rule 15Ba1-3. Specifically, the
Commission’s modifications to Rule 15Ba1-5 are limited to removing or revising rule text to reflect
that natural persons who are associated with a municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory
activities on its behalf are not required to register as municipal advisors on Form MA and that Form
MA-I is not an application for registration and to update citations in the rule text. Therefore, the
requirement in Rule 15Ba1-5 to amend promptly Form MA and Form MA-I applies exclusively to
registered municipal advisors since they will be responsible for amendments to their own Form MA
and amendments to Form MA-I for each natural person who is a person associated with the
municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf. 1260
Rule 15Ba1-5(a) requires that a registered municipal advisor must promptly amend the
information in its Form MA: (1) at least annually, within 90 days of the end of the municipal
advisor’s fiscal year, or of the end of the calendar year for a sole proprietor; 1261 and (2) more
frequently than annually if required by the General Instructions. 1262

1259

See MSRB Letter I.

See Rule 15Ba1-5(a) and (b).

1261

See Rule 15Ba1-5(a)(1).

1262

See Rule 15Ba1-5(a)(2). See also infra Section III.A.8. (discussing the General Instructions
and Glossary).
364

In addition to the annual update amendment to Form MA, General Instruction 8 specifies
that a municipal advisory firm must amend its Form MA promptly whenever a material event has
occurred that changes the information provided in the form. General Instruction 8 further states
that, for purposes of Form MA, a material event will be deemed to have occurred if information
provided in response to Item 1 (Identifying Information), Item 2 (Form of Organization), or Item 9
(Disclosure Information) becomes inaccurate in any way; or if information provided in response to
Item 3 (Successions), Item 7 (Participation or Interest of Applicant, or of Associated Persons of
Applicant in Municipal Advisory Client or Solicitee Transactions), or Item 8 (Owners, Officers and
Other Control Persons) becomes materially inaccurate. 1263
In addition, General Instruction 8 provides that a non-resident municipal advisory firm must
promptly file an amendment to Form MA to attach an updated opinion of counsel after any changes
in the legal or regulatory framework or the firm’s physical facilities that would impact its ability, as
a matter of law, to provide the Commission with access to its books and records or to inspect and
examine the municipal advisory firm. 1264 As the Commission stated in the Proposal, 1265 an
amendment in such case should include a revised opinion of counsel describing how, as a matter of
law, the municipal advisor will continue to meet its obligations to provide the Commission with the
required access to the municipal advisor’s books and records and to be subject to the Commission’s
1263

See General Instruction 8 in the Instructions for the Form MA Series. General Instruction 8
further notes that a municipal advisor submitting an amendment between annual updates is
not required to update the responses to Item 4 (Information About Applicant’s Business),
Item 5 (Other Business Activities), Item 6 (Financial Industry and Other Related Affiliations
of Associated Persons), or Item 10 (Small Businesses), even if the responses to those items
have become inaccurate.

1264

See General Instruction 8 in the Instructions for the Form MA Series. See also infra note
1308 and accompanying text. For a discussion of Rule 15Ba1-6 (Consent to Service of
Process to be Filed by Non-Resident Municipal Advisors) and Form MA-NR (Designation
of U.S. Agent for Service of Process for Non-Residents), see Section III.A.6.

onsite 1266 inspection and examination under the new regulatory regime. If a registered non-resident
municipal advisory firm becomes unable to comply with this requirement, then this may be a basis
for the Commission to institute proceedings to revoke the municipal advisor’s registration.
Regarding amendments to Form MA-I, Rule 15Ba1-5(b) provides that a registered
municipal advisor must promptly amend the information contained in Form MA-I by filing an
amended Form MA-I whenever the information contained in the Form MA-I becomes inaccurate
for any reason. As discussed above, registered municipal advisors will be responsible for filing and
amending Form MA-I for each natural person associated with the municipal advisor and engaged in
municipal advisory activities on its behalf. 1267 As discussed in the Proposal, unlike municipal
advisors filing Form MA, who must file annual updating amendments, the Commission is not
requiring municipal advisory firms to update annually the Forms MA-I for each natural person who
is associated with the municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory activities on its
behalf. 1268 The Commission believes that the additional gains obtained by requiring the
confirmation of an annual update would impose unnecessary burdens on municipal advisors and
that the standard adopted in Rule 15Ba1-5(b) strikes an appropriate balance between maintaining
1266

As adopted, General Instruction 8 does not require the opinion of counsel to state that the
municipal advisor is able, as a matter of law, to be subject specifically to “onsite” inspection
and examination.

1267

See supra note 1260 and accompanying text.

1268

See Proposal, 76 FR at 858. As discussed in the Proposal, in the case of firms, changes
commonly occur over the course of a year, and a wide range of changes is possible – e.g.,
changes in control persons and personnel, number of employees, nature of services
provided, types of clients, and compensation arrangements, among others, as well as new
disclosures that may be necessary for all of the firm’s associated persons, rather than just
one natural person. Accordingly, the Commission believes it is appropriate to require a firm
to confirm through an annual update that its registration is up-to-date. With respect to
natural person municipal advisors, however, an amendment to Form MA-I is promptly
required whenever information previously provided becomes inaccurate. The Commission
believes that any additional benefits of an annual update would not justify the burden such a
requirement would impose. See id.
366

current information regarding natural persons and minimizing the burden on municipal advisors to
provide this information.
All amendments to Form MA and Form MA-I are required to be filed electronically with the
Commission. 1269 In addition, amendments to Form MA and Form MA-I constitute “reports” for
purposes of Sections 15B(c), 17(a), 18(a), 32(a) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c), 78q(a), 78r(a), 78ff(a)) and
other applicable provisions of the Exchange Act. 1270 As discussed in the Proposal, these rules are
consistent with the Commission’s requirements for other registrants (e.g., national securities
exchanges, securities information processors (“SIPs”), broker-dealers) to file updated and annual
amendments with the Commission.1271 The Commission believes that such amendments are
important for obtaining updated information for registered municipal advisory firms and their
associated natural persons engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firms’ behalf so that the
Commission can assess whether such persons continue to be in compliance with the federal
securities laws and the rules and regulations thereunder. 1272 Obtaining updated information will
also assist the Commission in its inspection and examination of municipal advisors and better
inform the MSRB’s regulation of municipal advisors. In addition, the Commission believes it is
important for municipal entities and obligated persons, as well as the public generally, to have
access to current information regarding advisors registered with the Commission.

6. Rule 15Ba1-6: Consent to Service of Process to be Filed by Non-Resident
Registered Municipal Advisors; Legal Opinion to be Provided by NonResident Municipal Advisors; and Form MA-NR
a.

Rule 15Ba1-6: Consent to Service of Process to be Filed by NonResident Registered Municipal Advisors; Legal Opinion to be
Provided by Non-Resident Municipal Advisors

Proposed Rule 15Ba1-5 required each non-resident 1273 municipal advisor and each nonresident general partner and managing agent 1274 of a municipal advisor to furnish to the
Commission, at the time of filing Form MA or Form MA-I, a written irrevocable consent and power
of attorney on Form MA-NR to appoint an agent in the United States upon whom may be served
any process, pleadings, or other papers in any action brought against the non-resident municipal

1273

The definition of “non-resident” in Rule 15Ba1-1(j) that the Commission is adopting is
substantially similar to the definition of “non-resident” that the Commission set forth in
proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(h). However, the Commission is modifying this definition so that it
includes only those persons residing, having their principal office and place of business, or
incorporated in any place not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States. Therefore,
persons residing; having their principal office and place of business; and incorporated in the
United States or a territory of the United States would not be considered non-residents. Rule
15Ba1-1(j), as adopted, defines “non-resident” as “(1) [i]n the case of an individual, one
who resides in or has his principal office and place of business in any place not subject to the
jurisdiction of the United States; (2) [i]n the case of a corporation, one incorporated in or
having its principal office and place of business in any place not subject to the jurisdiction of
the United States; or (3) [i]n the case of a partnership or other unincorporated organization or
association, one having its principal office and place of business in any place not subject to
the jurisdiction of the United States.” As adopted, this definition of “non-resident” is similar
to the definition of “non-resident broker-dealer” in Rule 15b1-5 under the Exchange Act.
See 17 CFR 240.15b1-5. See also 17 CFR 275.0-2 (defining the term “non-resident” for
purposes of serving non-residents in connection with Form ADV).

1274

Rule 15Ba1-1(c) defines a “managing agent” as “any person, including a trustee, who directs
or manages, or who participates in directing or managing, the affairs of any unincorporated
organization or association other than a partnership.” As discussed in the Proposal, this
definition is consistent with the definition of a “managing agent” as used in Rule 15b1-5
under the Exchange Act relating to consent to service of process to be furnished by nonresident brokers or dealers and by non-resident general partners or managing agents of
brokers or dealers. See 17 CFR 240.15b1-5. See also 17 CFR 275.0-2 (discussing general
procedures for serving non-resident investment advisers in connection with Form ADV);
and Proposal, 76 FR at 859, note 262 and accompanying text.
368

advisor, general partner or managing agent. 1275 Proposed Rule 15Ba1-5 also specified
circumstances when each non-resident municipal advisor, general partner and managing agent
would be required to amend Form MA-NR. In addition, proposed Rule 15Ba1-5 required that each
non-resident municipal advisor, other than a natural person, provide an opinion of counsel that the
municipal advisor can provide the Commission with access to the advisor’s books and records and
submit to onsite inspection and examination by the Commission. The Commission received one
comment letter regarding this proposed rule which supported the proposed rule. 1276
While adopted Rule 15Ba1-6 retains the same purpose and focus of the proposed rule, the
Commission is adopting Rule 15Ba1-6 with certain modifications to reflect the Commission’s
decision to exempt certain natural persons from municipal advisor registration in Rule 15Ba1-3, as
adopted, and to clarify and update the rule text as described below. First, the Commission is
removing certain references that contemplate individual registration on Form MA-I of natural
persons associated persons with a municipal advisor and is revising the rule text to clarify that a
municipal advisor is required to file a Form MA-NR for each of its non-resident general partners,
managing agents, and associated natural persons engaged in municipal advisor activities on the
municipal advisor’s behalf. Second, since the term registered municipal advisor no longer includes
natural persons who are associated with a municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory
activity on its behalf, the Commission is adding new language to Rule 15Ba1-6 to address such
persons. For example, Rule 15Ba1-6(a)(2) requires a registered municipal advisor, at the time of
the Form MA-I filing, to file with the Commission a Form MA-NR for each non-resident natural
person associated with a municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory activities on its

See Rule 15Ba1-5(a). The agent may not be a Commission member, official, or employee.

1276

369

behalf. 1277 Third, the Commission is modifying the rule to require registered municipal advisors to
file a new Form MA-NR in the instances where the proposed rule required an amendment because,
unlike Form MA and Form MA-I, Form MA-NR is not completed online and signed
electronically. 1278 Form MA-NR must be printed out and signed manually and a scanned copy of
the signed and notarized form must be attached as a PDF file to the Form MA or Form MA-I being
submitted. 1279 Finally, the Commission made other clarifying revisions to and updated the citations
in the rule text. 1280
As discussed in the Proposal, 1281 the provisions in Rule 15Ba1-6, as adopted, are designed to
allow the Commission and others to provide service of process to a registered non-resident
municipal advisor, a non-resident general partner or managing agent of a registered municipal
advisor, and non-resident natural person associated with a municipal advisor and engaged in
municipal advisory activities on its behalf by requiring the municipal advisor to file a written
irrevocable consent and power of attorney on Form MA-NR to appoint an agent in the United States
for service of process. 1282 Rule 15Ba1-6 also requires a municipal advisor to file promptly a new
Form MA-NR to reflect any change to the name or address of the agent for service of process for
1277

Similarly, Rule 15Ba1-6(c)(2), as adopted, sets forth requirements regarding when a
registered municipal advisor is required to file a new Form MA-NR for its non-resident
natural persons who are associated with the municipal advisor and engaged in municipal
advisory activities on its behalf.

1278

See General Instruction 2.c. in the Instructions for the Form MA Series.

1280

For example, the Commission removed “onsite” from Rule 15Ba1-6(d), as adopted, because
the Commission does not conduct all inspections and examinations onsite.

See Rule 15Ba1-6(a)(1) and (2) (requiring a non-resident municipal advisor to file a Form
MA-NR on its own behalf and requiring municipal advisors to file a Form MA-NR for each
of the municipal advisor’s non-resident general partners, managing agents, or natural
persons associated with the municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory activities
on its behalf).
370

itself if the municipal advisor is a non-resident and for each of a municipal advisor’s non-resident
general partners, managing agents, or natural persons associated with the municipal advisor and
engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf. 1283 The rule further requires a registered
non-resident municipal advisor to appoint promptly a successor agent and file a new Form MA-NR
if the non-resident municipal advisor discharges its agent or if its agent becomes unwilling or
unable to accept service on behalf of the non-resident municipal advisor. 1284 Similarly, Rule
15Ba1-6(c)(2) provides that each registered municipal advisor must require each of its non-resident
general partners or non-resident managing agents, or non-resident natural persons associated with
the municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf to appoint promptly
a successor agent and the registered municipal advisor must file a new Form MA-NR if such nonresident general partner, managing agent, or associated natural person discharges the agent or if the
agent is unwilling or unable to accept service on behalf of such person. Rule 15Ba1-6 also requires
each non-resident municipal advisor applying for registration to provide an opinion of counsel on
Form MA that the municipal advisor can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with access to
the municipal advisor’s books and records and that the municipal advisor can, as a matter of law,
submit to inspection and examination by the Commission.1285 Finally, similar to the other forms in
the MA series, Form MA-NR must be filed electronically. 1286
b. Form MA-NR
The Commission received one comment letter on proposed Form MA-NR, which generally

371

supported Form MA-NR. 1287 While Form MA-NR, as adopted, retains the same purpose and focus
of the proposed Form MA-NR, the Commission is adopting Form MA-NR with certain
modifications. First, the Commission has provided more detailed instructions to improve the form’s
readability and ease of use. For example, the Commission included an introductory direction to
refer to the General Instructions for the forms in the MA series before completing Form MA-NR, a
paragraph explaining the purpose of the form, and a specific instruction providing technical
guidance for how to attach Form MA-NR to Form MA or Form MA-I. Second, the Commission
has expanded its discussion of certain concepts in Form MA-NR so that persons executing the form
have a clearer and more complete understanding of the information they are required to provide.
For example, Section A of Form MA-NR, as adopted, instructs the person executing the form to
“[i]dentify the agent for service of process for the non-resident municipal advisor, for the nonresident general partner or managing agent of a municipal advisor, or for the non-resident natural
person associated with the municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory activities on its
behalf. Fill in all lines.” 1288 The Commission expanded the discussions in several other parts of
Form MA-NR, such as the description relating to the designation and appointment of the agent for
service of process immediately following the agent’s address and phone number in Section A.2,
including language addressing the effect on partnerships of the irrevocable power of attorney
appointment and consent to service of process, the designator’s certification, and the method by
which the designator discloses the capacity in which he or she is signing the form. Third, the
Commission has included Section B and Section C in Form MA-NR, as adopted. Section B
requires the municipal advisor to obtain the signature of the United States person identified in
1287

See MSRB Letter I.

1288

Section A in Form MA-NR, as proposed, consisted only of “Name of United States person
applicant designates and appoints as agent for service of process” with space for the name
provided in a blank box immediately underneath.
372

Section A as the agent for service of process to demonstrate that this person has accepted the
designation and appointment as the agent for service of process. This certification that the agent for
service of process has accepted the designation and appointment is necessary to ensure effective
service of process upon a non-resident municipal advisor, non-resident general partner or managing
agent of a municipal advisor, or non-resident natural person associated with the municipal advisor
and engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf. Additionally, the Commission believes
that the additional burden imposed on municipal advisors to obtain the signature of the U.S. agent
for service of process would be minimal. Section C requires the person executing the form to
disclose whether any signature is pursuant to a written authorization and whether there is a written
contractual agreement or other written document evidencing the designation and appointment of the
named agent for service of process and/or the agent’s acceptance, and if so, to identify the
document and provide an accurate and complete copy with submission of the Form MA or Form
MA-I.
Pursuant to General Instruction 2, and consistent with the rule, every non-resident municipal
advisor must file Form MA-NR in connection with the municipal advisor’s initial application for
registration on Form MA and file a new Form MA-NR when required. 1289 In addition, regardless of

1289

See General Instruction 2.c. As discussed in the Proposal, failure to attach a signed and
notarized Form MA-NR, where required, for a non-resident municipal advisor or for any
non-resident general partner or managing agent of a municipal advisory firm or non-resident
natural person associated with a municipal advisor who engages in municipal advisory
activities on behalf of the advisor, may delay SEC consideration of the municipal advisor’s
application for registration. Additionally, an SEC-registered municipal advisory firm that
becomes a non-resident after the municipal advisor firm’s initial application has been
submitted must file a Form MA-NR within 30 days of becoming a non-resident. The same
applies when a general partner or managing agent of a municipal advisory firm becomes a
non-resident, or a non-resident becomes a general partner or managing agent of a municipal
advisory firm, after the firm’s initial application. Also, a municipal advisory firm must file a
Form MA-NR together with Form MA-I if, after the firm’s initial registration, a non-resident
natural person becomes associated with the firm and engages in municipal advisory
373

whether a municipal advisory firm is a resident of the United States, the firm must file a separately
completed and executed Form MA-NR for (i) non-resident general partners and managing agents of
the firm, and (ii) every non-resident natural person associated with the firm and engaged in
municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf. 1290 Form MA-NR for general partners and
managing agents is filed by the firm together with the firm’s Form MA. 1291 Form MA-NR for
natural persons associated with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s
behalf is filed by the firm together with the Form MA-I relating to the natural person associated
with the firm. 1292
7. Rule 15Ba1-7: Registration of Successor to Municipal Advisor
Proposed Rule 15Ba1-6 was designed to govern the registration of a successor to a
registered municipal advisor. 1293 The rule is substantially similar to Rule 15b1-3 under the

activities on the firm’s behalf. In addition, a municipal advisory firm must file a form MANR if a natural person associated with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities
on behalf of the firm becomes a non-resident after the firm has filed a Form MA-I relating to
that individual. The firm must file the Form MA-NR within 30 days of such individual
becoming a non-resident. See Instruction 3 in the General Instructions to Form MA-NR.

1293

As discussed in the Proposal, the purpose of Rule 15Ba1-7 is to enable a successor
municipal advisor to operate without an interruption of business by relying for a limited
period of time on the registration of the predecessor municipal advisor until the successor’s
own registration becomes effective. See Proposal, 76 FR at 860. The rule is intended to
facilitate the legitimate transfer of business between two or more municipal advisors and to
be used only where there is a direct and substantial business nexus between the predecessor
and the successor municipal advisor. The rule is not designed to allow a registered
municipal advisor to sell its registration, eliminate substantial liabilities, spin off personnel,
or facilitate the transfer of the registration of a “shell” organization that does not conduct
any business. As discussed in the Proposal, no entity is permitted to rely on Rule 15Ba1-7
unless it is acquiring or assuming substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the
predecessor’s municipal advisor business, or there has been no practical change of control.
See General Instruction 1 to Form MA.
374

Exchange Act, which governs the registration of a successor to a registered broker-dealer. 1294 The
Commission received no comments on the proposed Rule 15Ba1-6 and is adopting the rule as Rule
15Ba1-7 without modification.
Succession by Application
Rule 15Ba1-7(a) provides that in the event that a municipal advisor succeeds to and
continues the business of a municipal advisor registered pursuant to Exchange Act Section 15B(a),
the registration of the predecessor will be deemed to remain effective as the registration of the
successor if the successor, within 30 days after the succession, files an application for registration
on Form MA and the predecessor files a notice of withdrawal from registration with the
Commission on Form MA-W. The rule further provides that the registration of the predecessor
municipal advisor will cease to be effective as the registration of the successor municipal advisor 45
days after the application for registration on Form MA is filed by the successor. 1295 In other words,
the 45-day period will not begin to run until a complete Form MA has been filed by the successor
with the Commission. This 45-day period is consistent with Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(2),
pursuant to which the Commission has 45 days to grant a registration or institute proceedings to
determine if a registration should be denied. 1296
Succession by Amendment
The Commission will not apply Rule 15Ba1-7 to a reorganization that involves only
registered municipal advisors. See Proposal, 76 FR at 860. In those situations, the
registered municipal advisors need not rely on the rule because they can continue to rely on
their existing registrations. The rule also will not apply to situations in which the
predecessor intends to continue to engage in municipal advisory activities. Otherwise,
confusion may result as to the identities and registration statuses of the parties.
1294

See 17 CFR 240.15b1-3. See also Registration of Successors to Broker-Dealers and
Investment Advisers, Exchange Act Release No. 31661 (December 28, 1992), 58 FR 7
(January 4, 1993) (providing interpretive guidance regarding amendments to Rule 15b1-3).

1295

See Rule 15Ba1-7(a).

1296

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2).
375

Rule 15Ba1-7(b) provides that, notwithstanding Rule 15Ba1-7(a), if a municipal advisor
succeeds to and continues the business of a registered predecessor municipal advisor, and the
succession is based solely on a change in the predecessor’s date or state of incorporation, form of
organization, or composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the
succession, amend the registration of the predecessor municipal advisor on Form MA to reflect
these changes. Such an amendment will be deemed an application for registration filed by the
predecessor and adopted by the successor.
In all three types of successions specified in Rule 15Ba1-7(b) (change in the date or state of
incorporation, change in form of organization, and change in composition of a partnership), the
predecessor must cease operating as a municipal advisor. As stated in the Proposal, the
Commission believes that it is appropriate to allow a successor to file an amendment to the
predecessor’s Form MA in these types of successions because such successions do not typically
result in a change of control of the municipal advisor. 1297
8. General Instructions and Glossary
The Commission proposed a set of instructions, which includes general instructions for
proper completion and submission of Forms MA, MA-I, MA-W, and MA-NR (“General
Instructions”), 1298 as well as specific instructions relating to each of the forms individually, as
applicable. A glossary of terms (“Glossary”) is included at the end of the General Instructions to
help applicants complete the forms. As discussed in the Proposal, the definitions in the Glossary

1297

See Proposal, 76 FR at 860.

1298

Form MA-W is for withdrawal from registration as a municipal advisor, and Form MA-NR
is for the appointment of an agent for service of process by a non-resident municipal
advisor, non-resident general partner or managing agent of a municipal advisor, or nonresident natural person associated with a municipal advisor and engaged in municipal
advisory activities on behalf of the municipal advisor. See supra Sections III.A.4.b. and
III.A.6. (discussing Forms MA-W and MA-NR, respectively).
376

generally are derived from the terms in Exchange Act Section 15B(e), 1299 the definitions in Rule
15Ba1-1, 1300 and Form ADV. 1301 For ease of reference, the Commission proposed one Glossary to
define terms that may appear in any or all of the forms. All terms that are defined or described in
the Glossary appear in the forms in italics.
The Commission did not receive any comments on the General Instructions and Glossary
and is adopting the General Instructions and Glossary generally as proposed. However, some
revisions have been made to clarify or modify instructions and definitions or to provide additional
guidance, as discussed more fully below. In particular, the instructions are being revised to reflect
that Form MA-I, as adopted, will not serve as a registration form and that municipal advisory firms,
rather than natural persons (other than sole proprietors), have the obligation to file and complete
Form MA-I. In addition, some sections of the General Instructions have been reorganized to
enhance their readability, three new instructions have been added, additional defined terms have
been introduced and included in the Glossary, and one term has been removed from the Glossary.
General Instruction 1, as proposed, directed applicants to the Commission’s website for
additional information about the Commission’s rules regarding municipal advisors and the
Exchange Act. General Instruction 1, as adopted, notes that a comprehensive explanation of the
form requirements is provided in this release.
General Instruction 2, as proposed, discussed who should file Form MA and Form MA-I and
explained that these forms must be used to register with the Commission and to amend previously
submitted Forms MA and MA-I. The instruction also discussed the responsibility of sole
proprietors to file both forms. General Instruction 2, as proposed, further included information
1299

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e).

regarding voluntary registration for certain individuals; the requirement that a Form MA-NR must
be submitted for municipal advisors and general partners and managing agents of municipal
advisors that are not residents of the United States; and the requirement that a municipal advisor
that is no longer required to be registered must file Form MA-W.
As adopted, General Instruction 2 has been revised for clarity and now also provides more
details about the use of Form MA. For example, it now notes the requirement for a municipal
advisor that registers on Form MA to submit an annual update of that form. 1302
General Instruction 2 has been revised to reflect the fact that Form MA-I is no longer a
registration form. It explains that municipal advisory firms must complete and file Form MA-I on
behalf of natural persons associated with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on
behalf of the firm, including employees of the firm. In addition, General Instruction 2 notes that
independent contractors are included in the definition of “employee” of a municipal advisor for
purposes of a firm’s obligation to complete and file Form MA-I. 1303 The instruction explains that
Form MA-I is also used to amend a previously submitted Form MA-I.
With regard to Form MA-NR, General Instruction 2 now more clearly indicates that every
municipal advisory firm must file with the firm’s Form MA a separately completed and executed
Form MA-NR for every general partner and/or managing agent of a firm that is a non-resident. In
addition, the instruction has been revised to indicate that municipal advisory firms must also file
Form MA-NR for every non-resident natural person associated with the firm and engaged in
municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf together with the Form MA-I related to the
1302

The instruction, as proposed, referred only to amendments, which may have implied that
additional filings are required only in the instance of changes in the information provided on
previously-submitted forms.

1303

Although independent contractors are included in the definition of employee for purposes of
these forms in the Glossary (as both proposed and adopted), their inclusion is noted in
General Instruction 2, as adopted, because it might otherwise be overlooked.
378

person. General Instruction 2 indicates that firms have an obligation to file Form MA-NR in these
circumstances, regardless of whether the firm itself is domiciled in the United States or is a nonresident filing a Form MA-NR on its own behalf. In addition, General Instruction 2 clarifies that a
Form MA-NR for a non-resident general partner or managing agent of a municipal advisor must be
filed with the Form MA of the municipal advisor. The instruction, as adopted, also explains that,
unlike the other forms in the Form MA series, which are completed online and signed
electronically, Form MA-NR must be printed out and signed manually by both the non-resident and
the person designated as agent for service of process. Each of the signatures must be separately
notarized, and a scanned copy of the signed and notarized form must then be attached as a PDF file
to the electronically-completed Form MA or Form MA-I. To emphasize the importance of
submitting a Form MA-NR, where required, General Instruction 2, as adopted, includes a warning
that failure to attach a signed and notarized Form MA-NR for a non-resident municipal advisor, any
non-resident general partner or managing agent of a municipal advisory firm, or non-resident
natural person associated with a municipal advisory firm who engages in municipal advisory
activities on behalf of the firm may delay Commission consideration of the municipal advisor’s
application for registration.
General Instruction 2 indicates that Form MA-W does not need to be completed when a
natural person with respect to whom a municipal advisory firm filed Form MA-I is no longer
associated with the firm or no longer engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firm.
The instruction now explains that the firm must indicate this change by filing an amendment to
Form MA-I.
The proposed instructions in General Instruction 2 regarding voluntary registration as a
municipal advisor have been deleted, as the purpose for which this option was created is no longer

379

relevant. 1304
General Instruction 3, as proposed, instructed applicants with respect to the organization of
Form MA (for example, that Form MA also includes Schedules A, B, C, and D, as well as Criminal
Action, Regulatory Action, and Civil Judicial Action DRPs) and made clear that an applicant must
complete all items in Form MA. General Instruction 3 is being adopted substantially as proposed,
with only minor revisions, including an explanation that Form MA includes an “Execution Page”
where the form is signed.
General Instruction 4, as proposed, provided comparable instructions with respect to the
organization and completion of Form MA-I and the schedules and the DRPs required by that form.
General Instruction 4 is being revised to state that Form MA-I asks questions about sole proprietors
and natural persons associated with a municipal advisory firm and engaged in municipal advisory
activities on behalf of the firm, and to reflect the fact that Form MA-I, as adopted, is not a

1304

The Commission notes that several commenters raised concerns regarding the interaction of
the Commission’s proposed rule regarding voluntary municipal advisor registration with
amendments that had been proposed in November 2010 to the Commission’s “Pay-to-Play
Rule.” See, e.g., ICI Letter and MFA Letter. See also Investment Advisers Act Release No.
3010 (November 10, 2010), 75 FR 77052 (December 10, 2010) (Pay-to-Play Proposed
Amendments); and Proposal, 76 FR at 832 n.104 and accompanying text. The Commission
notes that it adopted amendments to its Pay-to-Play Rule on June 22, 2011. See Rules
Implementing Amendments to the Investment Advisers Act of 1940, Investment Advisers
Act Release No. 3221 (June 22, 2011), 76 FR 42950 (July 19, 2011). As proposed, the
amendments to the Pay-to-Play Rule would have excepted only registered municipal
advisors from that rule’s ban on compensating third-party solicitors. If the amendments had
been adopted as proposed, an investment adviser may have been unable to hire an affiliated
solicitor to solicit government entities on its behalf (absent the option for voluntary
municipal advisor registration) because affiliated solicitors would not fall within the
statutory definition of municipal advisor. The final amendments to the Pay-to-Play Rule,
however, permit advisers to compensate municipal advisors and Commission registered
investment advisers and broker-dealers for soliciting government entities if they are subject
to restrictions substantially equivalent to or more stringent than the Pay-to-Play Rule. See
id. See also Rule 206(4)-5 under the Investment Advisers Act (17 CFR 275.206(4)(5)).
Consequently, the option of voluntary registration as a municipal advisor for persons
undertaking solicitation of a municipal entity is no longer necessary.
380

registration form.
General Instructions 5-7 are being adopted substantially as proposed, with revisions to
reflect the fact that municipal advisory firms, not natural persons associated with the firms and
engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firms, must sign and file Form MA-I.
However, the order of these instructions has been rearranged in their adopted version for purposes
of clarity.
First, General Instruction 5 (in the order as adopted) sets forth who must sign Form MA or
MA-I. General Instruction 5 explains that such person will be a sole proprietor (in the case of a sole
proprietorship), a general partner (in the case of a partnership), an authorized principal (in the case
of a corporation), and, for all others, an authorized individual who participates in managing or
directing the municipal advisor’s affairs. 1305 It further makes clear that in all cases the signature
should be a typed name. Next, General Instruction 6 makes clear where Form MA must be signed,
explaining that domestic municipal advisors are required to execute the Domestic Execution Page to
Form MA, while non-resident municipal advisors are required to execute the Non-Resident
Municipal Advisor Execution Page. 1306 General Instruction 7 provides that a municipal advisory
firm signs Item 7 of Form MA-I.
General Instructions 8 and 9 discuss when to amend and/or update Forms MA and MA-I
respectively, as discussed above. 1307 General Instruction 8 (which pertains to Form MA), has been
adopted substantially as proposed, but has been revised to distinguish more clearly between an
amendment and an annual update. To clarify how amendments and updates will work in the
1305

Because natural persons that are not sole proprietors are not required to file Form MA-I, the
part of General Instruction 5 set forth in the Proposal that stated that a natural person filing
Form MA-I on his or her own behalf must sign the form has been deleted.

1306

See supra Section III.A.6. (discussing Rule 15Ba1-6 and Form MA-NR).

1307

See supra Section III.A.5.
381

electronic filing system, the instruction also now explains that each time a firm accesses its Form
MA after its initial filing of the form, the information from the firm’s most recent previous filing
will appear. Only the information that has changed will need to be amended; the applicant will not
need to complete the entire form again. The statement in General Instruction 8 regarding the
requirement for a non-resident municipal advisor to amend its form and attach an updated opinion
of counsel has been revised to more accurately reflect the required content of the opinion of counsel
as stated on Form MA. 1308 General Instruction 9, as proposed, concerned when Form MA-I (for
natural person municipal advisors) needs “to be updated.” The instruction has been revised in its
adopted form to state generally that Form MA-I must “be amended” whenever information
previously provided on the form becomes inaccurate. 1309
General Instruction 10, as proposed, provided that an applicant must complete and file the
forms electronically. As adopted, General Instruction 10 provides that a municipal advisor must
complete and submit the relevant form, including any required attachments, electronically. General
Instruction 10 reflects the change to Rule 15Ba1-2(c), as adopted, 1310 that Form MA is considered
filed upon submission of a completed Form MA, together with all additional required documents,
including all required filings of Form MA-I (17 CFR 249.1310), to EDGAR. General Instruction
10 also explains that when a municipal advisor’s submitted Form MA is accepted by the
Commission, the municipal advisor will receive an SEC file number. General Instruction 11 is
being adopted to provide more specific information about how to electronically file the forms in the

1308

See supra note 1264 and accompanying text for the revised language.

1309

The instruction no longer states that every “natural person municipal advisor” must amend
Form MA-I because the rule, as adopted, requires municipal advisory firms, and not natural
persons (other than sole proprietors), to complete and file Form MA-I. See Rule 15Ba12(b)(1) of the adopted rules.

1310

See supra note 971 and accompanying text.
382

Form MA series and, specifically, how to obtain access to EDGAR to do so. 1311
A new General Instruction 12 has been added to the General Instructions, as adopted, to
clarify what a municipal advisor (or, in the case of a firm, its authorized representative) represents
by signing and executing the form as a whole. 1312 General Instruction 12 explains that, by signing
the Execution Page of Form MA, the authorized signatory of a domestic municipal advisory firm is
appointing the Secretary of State or other legally designated officer of the state in which the firm
maintains its principal office and place of business as the firm’s agent to receive service of
process. 1313 The signatory is also attesting to the truth and correctness of the information provided
in the form and declaring that the firm’s books and records will be preserved and available for
inspection and that any person having custody of the books and records is authorized to make them
available to federal regulators.
General Instruction 12 further explains that a signatory on behalf of a non-resident
municipal advisory firm must use the version of the Execution Page of Form MA that is specifically
required for non-resident firms. Besides attesting to the truth and correctness of the information
provided on the form and making the same representations as a U.S. firm regarding books and
records, the signatory on behalf of the firm is agreeing to provide, at the firm’s own expense,
current, correct, and complete copies of its books and records to the SEC upon request. The
instruction explains that a non-resident firm must designate an agent for service of process on a
1311

See supra note 961. General Instructions 12 and 13 as proposed, regarding self-certification
by municipal advisors filing on Form MA and Form MA-I, have been removed, because, as
discussed above, the Commission has eliminated the self-certification requirement in Form
MA and Form MA-I as adopted.

1312

General Instruction 12 does not introduce new substantive requirements that are being added
in the adopting phase of this rulemaking. They were set forth in the forms, as proposed, and
are now being added to the General Instructions in order to highlight them for applicants
preparing to file. See also supra notes 1150-1156 and accompanying text.

1313

See also supra notes 1275-1287 and accompanying text.
383

separate form, Form MA-NR.
General Instruction 12 explains that an authorized signatory of a domestic municipal
advisory firm filing Form MA-I with respect to a natural person who is associated with the firm and
engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firm, by signing the Execution Page of
Form MA-I, is attesting to the truth and correctness of the information provided in the form. The
instruction also explains that the authorized signatory is attesting that the firm has obtained and
retained written consent from the natural person associated with the firm that service of any civil
action brought by, or notice of any proceeding before, the SEC or any SRO in connection with the
individual’s municipal advisory activities may be given by registered or certified mail to the
individual’s address provided in Item 1 of the form.
General Instruction 12 further explains that by signing the Execution Page of Form MA-I, a
sole proprietor filing Form MA-I is consenting that service of process may be given by registered or
certified mail to the address the sole proprietor has supplied in Item 1of the form and is also
attesting to the truth and correctness of the information he or she has provided in the form.
General Instruction 13, as adopted, (General Instruction 14 as proposed) discusses the
requirement for a non-resident municipal advisory firm to attach a legal opinion to its Form MA
that the municipal advisor can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with access to its books
and records and that the municipal advisor can, as a matter of law, submit to inspection and
examination by the Commission. 1314 As adopted, General Instruction 13 reflects the fact that the
opinion of counsel that non-residents must file no longer needs to state that the municipal advisor
can submit to “onsite” inspection and examination. 1315
The Commission has also added new General Instruction 14 to list together in one place all
1314

See supra note 1154 and accompanying text.

1315

See supra note 1280 and accompanying text.
384

the circumstances in which additional documents must be attached to a Form MA or Form MA-I.
The list of such documents does not include any new requirements that were not included in the
Proposal. General Instruction 14 has been added for purposes of clarity and convenience. The
required documents enumerated include: (1) any documents relating to criminal actions, as
specified in the Criminal Action DRPs of Form MA and Form MA-I, and any other supporting
documentation; (2) a manually-signed Form MA-NR for each non-resident for whom such form is
required; 1316 (3) any written document (e.g., board resolution or power of attorney) authorizing a
signatory to sign a Form MA-NR; and (4) any written contractual agreements relating to Form MANR; and (5) the required opinion of counsel for non-resident municipal advisory firms.
The Commission has added new General Instruction 15 to provide clarity with respect to
filing deadlines. General Instruction 15 provides that if the deadline for submitting an initial filing,
annual update, or amendment to a form occurs on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday on which the
Commission is not open for business, then the deadline shall be the next business day.
The General Instructions also provide some instructions and explanations specific to certain
items in Form MA and Form MA-I. 1317 In addition, the General Instructions provide some
instructions and explanations specific to Form MA-NR. Specific Instruction 1 for Form MA, as
adopted, explains that a municipal advisor that is not currently registered as a municipal advisor and
1316

Form MA-NR, by which a non-resident municipal advisor designates an agent for service of
process in the U.S., is accessed electronically via links within Form MA and Form MA-I.
The information requested by the form may be entered online. However, the form must be
printed out and signed manually – both by the applicant (an authorized signatory in the case
of a firm) and by the designated agent for service of process – and each of the signatures
must be notarized. After the signatures and notarizations are completed, Form MA-NR must
be attached in PDF format to the Form MA or Form MA-I.

1317

As proposed, the sections of the General Instructions that explained how to complete certain
items in Form MA and Form MA-I did not have names. As adopted, these sections are now
called “Specific Instructions for Certain Items in Form MA” and “Specific Instructions for
Certain Items in Form MA-I.”
385

has taken over the business of another municipal advisor or was registered as a municipal advisor
but has changed its structure or legal status will be a new organization with registration obligations
under the Exchange Act. 1318 It further explains that an applicant not registered with the SEC as a
municipal advisor that is acquiring or assuming substantially all of the assets and liabilities of the
advisory business of a registered municipal advisor will be required to file a new application for
registration on Form MA within 30 calendar days after the succession. The instruction also
provides that, once the new registration is effective, Form MA-W (as described above) must be filed
to withdraw the registration of the acquired municipal advisor. The instruction also explains that, if
a new municipal advisor is formed solely as a result of a change in the form of organization or in
the composition of a partnership or the date or the state of incorporation, and there has been no
practical change in control or management, the applicant will be permitted to amend the existing
registration to reflect the changes by filing an amendment within 30 calendar days after the change
or reorganization.
Specific Instruction 2 for Form MA is being adopted substantially as proposed and has been
revised only for clarity and to correct certain citations that have changed. The instruction provides
guidance for newly-formed municipal advisors regarding how to respond to several questions in
Item 4 of Form MA (described above) that may be difficult to answer when the applicant for
registration has not been in existence for a significant amount of time. The instruction advises that,
for a newly-formed municipal advisor, responses should reflect the applicant’s current municipal
advisory activities (i.e., its activities at the time of filing, with certain exceptions). With respect to
specified questions regarding the applicant’s compensation arrangements, the instructions provide

1318

Specific Instruction 1 for Form MA as adopted has been significantly revised for purposes
of clarity but includes no substantive changes. See also infra Section III.A.7, regarding Rule
15Ba1-7, adopted as part of this rulemaking, upon which this instruction is based.
386

that the applicant base its responses on the types of compensation it expects to accept. Further, with
respect to its business activities relating to municipal securities, the applicant is instructed to base its
responses on the types of municipal advisory activities in which it expects to engage during the next
year.
Specific Instruction 3 for Form MA is being adopted substantially as proposed, with nonsubstantive revisions. The instruction explains that Schedule D is to be completed if any response
to Form MA requires further explanation, or if the applicant wishes to provide additional
information.
The Specific Instructions for Certain Items in Form MA-I, as adopted, have been revised to
reflect the fact Form MA-I is not a registration form and that municipal advisory firms, rather than
natural persons (other than sole proprietors), have the obligation to complete and file Form MA-I.
Specific Instruction 1 for Form MA-I explains that, in Item 1 of Form MA-I, the municipal advisory
firm must enter the individual’s CRD Number (if assigned), the individual’s social security
number, 1319 and the addresses of all offices at which the individual is or will be physically located
or from which the individual is or will be supervised, even if the individual does not work at that
location. 1320
Specific Instruction 2 for Form MA-I is being adopted substantially as proposed, with
revisions made for clarity. The instruction emphasizes that, for purposes of completing Item 2 to
Form MA-I, the firm must enter all the other names that the individual is using, has used, is known
1319

As discussed above, social security numbers will not be made publicly available. This
information is necessary in connection with the Commission’s enforcement and examination
functions pursuant to Section 15B(c) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)). See
Proposal, 76 FR at 840, note 171.

1320

General Instruction 1 to Form MA-I in its adopted form has been expanded to provide more
explanation for a firm that submits Form MA-I on behalf of natural persons associated with
the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf, but no new
requirements have been added.
387

or has been known by, other than the individual’s legal name, since the age of 18, which includes
nicknames, aliases, and names used before and after marriage.
Specific Instruction 3 for Form MA-I is being adopted substantially as proposed, but
expanded with more information. The instruction explains that, for purposes of Item 3, with respect
to the individual’s residential history for the past 5 years, post office boxes may not be used to
complete the response and the firm may not leave any gaps in the individual’s residential history
greater than three months. As adopted, this instruction also includes the statement: “This
information is needed for regulatory purposes. However, the version of completed Form MA-I that
will be available for viewing by the public will not show the private residential addresses that you
enter.”
Specific Instruction 4 for Form MA-I is being adopted substantially as proposed, with an
added clarification. The instruction provides that, with respect to Item 4 of Form MA-I, the
individual’s employment history for the past 10 years must be provided with no gaps greater than
three months; that the history should account for full-time and part-time employment, selfemployment, military service and homemaking; and that unemployment, full-time education,
extended travel, and other similar statuses should be included. The added clarification explains that
such statuses should be entered on the line provided for “Name of Municipal Advisor or Company.”
Specific Instruction 5 for Form MA-I, regarding Item 5 of Form MA-I (“Other Business”),
has been revised in its adopted version. Instead of restating, as proposed, some of the information
requests specified in Item 5, the instruction explains that other businesses in which the individual
“is engaged” is intended to capture such engagements as a proprietor, partner, officer, director, or
employee (including independent contractor, trustee, agent or otherwise). As adopted, the
instruction also informs firms that if the number of hours per week that individuals devote to the

388

other business varies, the firms should provide an average.
Specific Instruction 6 for Form MA-I, regarding Item 6 of Form MA-I, is being adopted as
proposed. The instruction advises firms that affirmative responses to certain disclosure questions in
the form could make an individual subject to a statutory disqualification.
Specific Instruction 7 for Form MA-I is being adopted as proposed, with an added reminder
for non-residents. The instruction indicates that, as with Form MA, the form is to be signed (in Item
7 of Form MA-I) by typing a signature in the designated field and makes clear that, by typing a
name, the signatory acknowledges and represents that the entry constitutes in every way, use, or
aspect, his or her legally binding signature. The added reminder advises the firm that if the
individual is a non-resident, the firm must attach a manually-signed Form MA-NR to the form.
The General Instructions contain a new section called “General Instructions to Form MANR” that consists of instructions and explanations specific to Form MA-NR. General Instruction 1
to Form MA-NR repeats the information in General Instruction 2, discussed above, regarding when
Form MA-NR must be filed.
General Instruction 2 to Form MA-NR describes the circumstances in which more than one
Form MA-NR must be filed by a municipal advisory firm. For example, the instruction states that a
non-resident municipal advisory firm filing a Form MA for itself would also need to file Form MANR for each of its non-resident general partners and managing agents, even if a Form MA-NR had
been previously filed by another municipal advisor for the general partner or managing agent. In
addition, a firm filing Form MA-I must attach Form MA-NR for every non-resident natural person
associated with the firm and engaged in municipal activities on the firm’s behalf.
General Instruction 3 to Form MA-NR describes when a Form MA-NR must be filed at
times other than when a municipal advisor submits its initial application for registration. The

389

instruction explains that a registered municipal advisory firm must file a Form MA-NR within 30
days of the firm becoming a non-resident. The same applies when a general partner or managing
agent of the municipal advisory firm becomes a non-resident, or a non-resident becomes a general
partner or managing agent of the firm after the firm’s initial application for registration. In such
cases, the municipal advisor must file an amendment to Form MA with the new Form MA-NR
attached. The instruction explains that a municipal advisory firm must also file Form MA-NR with
Form MA-I if, after the firm’s initial registration, a non-resident natural person becomes associated
with the firm and engages in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf. In addition, a firm
must file Form MA-NR if a natural person associated with the firm and engaged in municipal
advisory activities on behalf of the firm becomes a non-resident after the firm has filed Form MA-I
relating to that individual. The firm must file Form MA-NR within 30 days of the individual
becoming a non-resident. 1321
General Instruction 4 to Form MA-NR describes when a new Form MA-NR must be filed.
The instruction indicates that a new Form MA-NR must be filed promptly if a previously-filed
Form MA-NR becomes invalid or inaccurate. 1322 This includes any change to the name or address
of the non-resident municipal advisory firm, general partner, managing agent, or natural person
associated with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firm, or any
change to the name or address of the agent of service of process of such non-resident, to which the
1321

General Instruction 3 to Form MA-NR also contains a note reminding non-resident
municipal advisory firms of two additional requirements for non-resident municipal
advisory firms that are discussed in General Instruction 12 (to complete Form MA
Execution Page for non-residents and the undertaking regarding books and records) and
General Instruction 13 (to attach an opinion of counsel that the firm can provide the
Commission with access to its books and records and can submit to inspection and
examination by the Commission).

1322

A new Form MA-NR is filed by submitting an amendment to Form MA with a new Form
MA-NR attached.
390

previously-filed Form MA-NR relates. The instruction explains that a non-resident must promptly
appoint a successor agent for service of process and the municipal advisor must file a new Form
MA-NR if the non-resident discharges its identified agent for service of process or if its agent for
service of process becomes unwilling or unable to accept service on behalf of the non-resident.
In the Proposal, the term “non-resident” was defined as an individual, corporation, or
partnership or other unincorporated organization or association that resides in or has his or its
principal office and place of business in “any place not in the United States.” As adopted, the
language in the term “non-resident” that determines whether an individual, corporation, or
partnership or other unincorporated organization or association is a “non-resident” has been slightly
modified to whether the person resides in or has his or its principal office and place of business in
“any place not subject to the jurisdiction of the United States.” The language has been changed to
clarify that persons that reside or have their principal office and place of business in United States
territories do not fall within the definition of “non-resident.”
The Glossary of Terms is being adopted substantially as proposed. However, the Glossary,
as adopted, contains some revisions that are being made for clarity. As adopted, the Glossary
includes some revisions to terms that reflect changes to the definitions being adopted in Rule
15Ba1-1. For example, the definition of “Guaranteed Investment Contract” has been revised to
clarify that the contract at issue must relate to investments of proceeds of municipal securities or
municipal escrow investments. The definition of the term “municipal advisor,” as adopted, has
been revised to make clear that the definition is subject to the exclusions that are being adopted
under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2) 1323 and the exemptions under Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3). 1324 Likewise, the
definition of the term “obligated persons,” consistent with the definition in adopted Rule 15Ba1-1,
1323

17 CFR 240.15Ba1-1(d)(2).

1324

17 CFR 240.15Ba1-1(d)(3).
391

has been revised to state that the term does not include a person whose financial information or
operating data is not material to a municipal securities offering or the federal government. The
Glossary contains other revisions to terms that are consistent with revisions to the definitions in
Rule 15Ba1-1, as adopted.
The Glossary includes some new definitions that were not in the Proposal. For example, the
Glossary now defines the term “federal regulatory agency” to include any federal banking agency
and the National Credit Union Administration. The Glossary also defines the term “state regulatory
agency” to include any State securities commission (or any agency or officer performing like
functions); State authority that supervises or examines banks, savings associations, or credit unions;
or State insurance commission (or any agency or office performing like functions to the above).
The definitions of the terms “federal regulatory agency” and “state regulatory agency” are
consistent with the language in Exchange Act Section 15(b)(4)(H). 1325 The Glossary has also been
revised to include a new definition of the term “affiliate, affiliated, affiliation,” which is derived
from the definition of “advisory affiliate” for Form ADV.
The term “natural person municipal advisor” has been removed from the Glossary, as
adopted. In the Proposal, the term was defined to mean any natural person that is a municipal
advisor, including sole proprietors. The term had been included in the Proposal to collectively
describe natural persons who were required to file Form MA-I. Because municipal advisory firms,
rather than natural persons (other than sole proprietors), are now responsible for filing Form MA-I,
the term is no longer necessary, and is therefore being removed from the Glossary.

1325

The statutory disqualification language of Section 15(b)(4)(H) is referenced in Exchange
Act Section 15B(c)(2), which describes the Commission’s power to censure, place
limitations on the activities, functions, or operations, or suspend, or revoke the registration
of a municipal advisor.
392

9. Rule 15Bc4-1: Persons Associated with Municipal Advisors
As noted in the Proposal, Section 975(c)(5) of the Dodd-Frank Act provides the
Commission with authority to censure or place limitations on the activities or functions of any
person associated with a municipal advisor or to suspend or bar any such person from being
associated with a municipal advisor. As discussed in the Proposal, however, it appears that a
technical error was made in the final draft of this provision. 1326 Specifically, Section 975(c)(5) of
the Dodd-Frank Act provides that Section 15B(c)(4) of the Exchange Act be amended “by inserting
‘or municipal advisor’ after ‘municipal securities dealer or obligated person’ each place that term
appears.” 1327 At the time the Dodd-Frank Act was enacted, however, Section 15B(c)(4) of the
Exchange Act included the term “municipal securities dealer,” but did not include the phrase
“municipal securities dealer or obligated person” (emphasis added).
To address any ambiguity created by this error, the Commission stated in the Proposal its
intent to recommend a technical amendment to Section 975(c)(5) of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1328 To
date, however, the Exchange Act has not been amended to correct this technical error. Therefore, to
clarify the Commission’s interpretation of Section 15B(c)(4) of the Exchange Act, the Commission
is adopting new Rule 15Bc4-1 to make clear the Commission’s understanding of its authority with
respect to associated persons of municipal advisors. Specifically, Rule 15Bc4-1 states that the
Commission has the authority to, by order, censure or place limitations on the activities or functions
of any person associated, seeking to become associated, or, at the time of the alleged misconduct,
associated or seeking to become associated with a municipal advisor, or suspend for a period not
exceeding 12 months or bar any such person from being associated with a broker, dealer,

393

investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer agent, or nationally
recognized statistical rating organization, if the Commission finds, on the record after notice and
opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or bar is in the public
interest and that such person has committed any act, or is subject to an order or finding, enumerated
in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), (H), or (G) of paragraph (4) of Section 15(b) of the Exchange Act,
has been convicted of any offense specified in subparagraph (B) of such paragraph (4) within 10
years of the commencement of the proceedings under section 15B(c)(4) of the Exchange Act, or is
enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph (C) of Section 15(b)(4).
Rule 15Bc4-1 also states the Commission’s interpretation that Section 15B(c)(4) of the Exchange
Act makes it unlawful for any person, as to whom an order is entered pursuant to Section 15B(c)(4)
or Section 15B(c)(5) of the Exchange Act suspending or barring him from being associated with a
municipal advisor is in effect, willfully to become, or to be, associated with a municipal advisor
without the consent of the Commission. Further, Rule 15Bc4-1 sets forth the Commission’s
understanding that it is unlawful for any municipal advisor to permit such a person to become, or
remain, an associated person without the consent of the Commission, if such municipal advisor
knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable care should have known, of such order. Not only does the
Commission believe that such interpretation is the only one that is consistent with the Congressional
intent underlying Section 975(c)(5) of the Dodd-Frank Act, and that any other reading would
produce the absurd result that no amendment would be made to Section 15(c)(4) of the Exchange
Act, but the Commission also believes that this interpretation and the adoption of Rule 15Bc4-1 are
necessary and appropriate to ensure that the Commission may censure or place limitations on the
activities or functions of any person associated with a municipal advisor or to suspend or bar any
such person from being associated with a municipal advisor.

394

B.

Approval or Denial of Registration

As discussed in the Proposal, 1329 Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(2) provides that within fortyfive days of the filing of an application to register as a municipal advisor, 1330 the Commission must
either: “(A) by order grant registration, or (B) institute proceedings to determine whether
registration should be denied. Such proceedings shall include notice of the grounds for denial under
consideration and opportunity for hearing and shall be concluded within one hundred twenty days
of the date of the filing of the application for registration. At the conclusion of such proceedings,
the Commission, by order, shall grant or deny such registration. The Commission may extend the
time for the conclusion of such proceedings for up to ninety days if it finds good cause for such
extension and publishes its reasons for so finding or for such longer period as to which the applicant
consents.” 1331
In accordance with Exchange Act Section 15B(a)(2), the Commission will grant the
registration of a municipal advisor if the Commission finds that the requirements of Section 15B of
the Exchange Act are satisfied. The Commission will deny the registration of a municipal advisor if
the Commission does not make such a finding or if it finds that, if the applicant were registered, its
registration would be subject to suspension or revocation under Section 15B(c) of the Exchange
Act. 1332
As discussed in the Proposal, the information currently required by Form MA-T is not
reviewed by the Commission prior to registration, although the Commission retains full authority to

1329

See id., at 860.

1330

The statute allows for a longer period if the applicant consents. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2).

1331

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2).

1332

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c).
395

review such information and examine any registered municipal advisor at any time. 1333 The
Commission intends that the permanent registration process will entail a review of each filed Form
MA.
In considering whether to grant an application for registration as a municipal advisor, the
Commission will review the information provided on Form MA. For example, as discussed in the
Proposal, the Commission may perform cross checks of applicants through the use of the
applicant’s other registration numbers, such as its CRD or other SEC registration numbers, to the
extent available. 1334 Also, the Commission may review the disclosures required by Item 9 of Form
MA, including the disciplinary history of an applicant. 1335 In addition, as discussed in the Proposal,
the municipal advisor registration process will allow the Commission and staff to ask questions and,
as needed, to request amendments before granting an application for registration. 1336
C. Rule 15Ba1-8: Books and Records to be Made and Maintained by Municipal
Advisors
Section 17(a)(1) of the Exchange Act provides, in pertinent part, that all registered
municipal advisors shall make and keep for prescribed periods such records, furnish such copies
thereof, and make and disseminate such reports as the Commission, by rule, prescribes as necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of the Exchange Act. 1337 With proposed Rule 15Ba1-7, the Commission proposed to
specify the books and records requirements applicable to municipal advisors. 1338 The Commission

1333

See Proposal, 76 FR at 860.

1334

See id.

1335

1336

See id.

1337

See 15 U.S.C. 78q(a)(1).

1338

See Proposal, 76 FR at 860-862. In addition, Section 15B(b)(2)(G) of the Exchange Act
396

is adopting Rule 15Ba1-7 as proposed, but renumbered as Rule 15Ba1-8, with a few technical
clarifications, the addition of general ledgers, and the addition of written consents to service of
process from certain natural persons.
Record-keeping for Municipal Advisors
As discussed in the Proposal, the Commission based Rule 15Ba1-7(a) (as adopted, Rule
15Ba1-8(a)) generally on the books and records requirements for broker-dealers and investment
advisers. 1339 Rule 15Ba1-8(a), among other things, requires a municipal advisory firm to make and
keep true, accurate, and current certain books and records relating to its municipal advisory
activities. 1340 Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-8(a) requires all municipal advisory firms to make and keep
originals or copies of all written communications received, and originals or copies of all written
communications sent, by such municipal advisor (including inter-office memoranda and
communications) relating to municipal advisory activities, regardless of the format of the
communications. 1341 Municipal advisory firms also must keep all check books, bank statements,

provides that the rules of the MSRB shall “prescribe records to be made and kept by . . .
municipal advisors and the periods for which such records shall be preserved.” 15 U.S.C.
78o-4(b)(2)(G).
1339

See Proposal, 76 FR at 861, note 274 and accompanying text.

1340

Therefore, the books and records listed in Rule 15Ba1-8(a) are limited to those relating to a
municipal advisor’s municipal advisory activities.

1341

As discussed in the Proposal, materials posted on a municipal advisor’s website relating to
municipal advisory activities are written communications sent by the municipal advisor for
purposes of this provision. See Proposal, 76 FR at 861, note 275. The Commission notes
that written communications may be in electronic form, such as emails or instant messages.
Further, as discussed above, in determining whether or not funds to be invested constitute
proceeds of municipal securities for purposes of Rule 15Ba1-1(m), a person may rely on
representations in writing made by a knowledgeable official of a municipal entity or
obligated person whose funds are to be invested regarding the nature of such funds, provided
that the person seeking to rely on such representations has a reasonable basis for such
reliance. See Rule 15Ba1-1(m)(3). Similarly, in determining whether or not funds to be
invested or reinvested constitute municipal escrow investments for purposes of Rule 15Ba11(h), a person may rely on representations in writing made by a knowledgeable official of a
397

general ledgers, 1342 cancelled checks, and cash reconciliations; a copy of each version of the
municipal advisor’s policies and procedures, if any, that (i) are in effect or (ii) at any time within the
last five years were in effect (not including those in effect prior to the effective date of Rule 15Ba18); and a copy of any document created by the municipal advisor that was material to making a
recommendation to a municipal entity or obligated person that memorializes the basis for that
recommendation. In addition, a municipal advisory firm must keep all written agreements (or
copies thereof) entered into by the municipal advisor with any municipal entity, employee of a
municipal entity, or an obligated person or otherwise relating to the business of the municipal
advisor as such. Further, a municipal advisory firm is required to keep a record of the names of
persons who are, or have been in the past five years, associated with the municipal advisor (not
including persons associated with the municipal advisor prior to the effective date of Rule 15Ba18); names, titles, and business and residence addresses of all persons associated with the municipal
advisor; 1343 all municipal entities or obligated persons with which the municipal advisor is engaging
or has engaged in municipal advisory activities in the past five years (not including those prior to
the effective date of Rule 15Ba1-8); the name and business address of each person to whom the
municipal advisor provides or agrees to provide payment to solicit a municipal entity, an employee
of a municipal entity, or an obligated person on its behalf; and the name and business address of

municipal entity or obligated person whose funds are to be invested or reinvested regarding
the nature of such investments, provided that the person seeking to rely on such
representations has a reasonable basis for such reliance. See Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2). Such
representations provided by the municipal entity or obligated person official constitute
written communications received by a municipal advisor relating to municipal advisory
activities.
1342

As discussed below in this section, the Commission is including “general ledgers” in the
final books and records rule.

1343

The Commission notes that this provision does not cover persons who were previously and
are no longer associated with the municipal advisor.
398

each person that provides or agrees to provide payment to the municipal advisor to solicit a
municipal entity, an employee of a municipal entity, or an obligated person on its behalf. 1344
Finally, a municipal advisory firm must keep written consents to service of process from each
natural person who is a person associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal
advisory activities solely on behalf of such municipal advisor. 1345
Rule 15Ba1-8(b)(1) requires municipal advisory firms to maintain and preserve all books
and records required to be made for a period of not less than five years, the first two years in an
easily accessible place. Further, corporate governance documents, such as articles of incorporation
and stock certificate books of the municipal advisor, and those of any predecessor, excluding those
that were only in effect prior to the effective date of Rule 15Ba1-8, must be maintained in the
principal office of the municipal advisor and preserved until at least three years after termination of
the business or withdrawal from registration as a municipal advisor.
As discussed in the Proposal, Rule 15Ba1-7(d) (as adopted, Rule 15Ba1-8(d)) is modeled on
Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act. 1346 Specifically, Rule 15Ba1-8(d) permits, and sets
forth the requirements for, electronic storage of the records required to be maintained and preserved
pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-8. The rule further sets forth requirements with respect to the prompt 1347

1344

Proposed Rule 15Ba1-7 also required municipal advisory firms to make and keep a record of
the initial or annual review, as applicable, conducted by the municipal advisory firm of its
business in connection with its self-certification on Form MA. Because the Commission is
not adopting a self-certification requirement, the Commission is also not adopting this
corresponding books and records requirement.

1345

As discussed below in this section, the Commission is including “written consents to service
of process from each natural person who is a person associated with the municipal advisor
and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of such municipal advisor” in
the final books and records rule.

1346

See 17 CFR 275.204-2. See also Proposal, 76 FR at 861.

1347

For purposes of Rule 15Ba1-8(d), the Commission interprets the term “prompt” to mean
making reasonable efforts to produce records that are requested by the staff during an
399

provision of records upon request by the Commission or by its staff or other representatives. In
addition, Rule 15Ba1-8(e) provides that any books or records made, kept, maintained, and preserved
in compliance with Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4 under the Exchange Act, rules of the MSRB, or Rule
204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act, which are substantially the same as the books and records
required to be made, kept, maintained, and preserved under Rule 15Ba1-8, will satisfy the recordkeeping requirements under Rule 15Ba1-8. 1348 Subparagraph (e) of Rule 15Ba1-8 is designed to
minimize the record-keeping burden for municipal advisory firms that are otherwise subject to
similar record-keeping requirements. 1349
In the Proposal, the Commission requested comment on the proposed books and records
requirements. Specifically, the Commission requested comment regarding, among other things, the
types of documents and data that should be retained; whether it is appropriate for the books and
records requirements to be based on the books and records requirements for broker-dealers and
investment advisers; the length of the period for maintaining and preserving books and records; the
format of the records retained; and whether the proposed requirements are overly burdensome. 1350
The Commission received several letters that specifically addressed the books and records
requirements. One commenter generally supported the proposed record-keeping rule. This
commenter stated it does not oppose establishing a five-year period for municipal advisor record
retention and suggested that a record retention period of five years should be the same for broker-

examination without delay. The Commission believes that in many cases a municipal
advisor could, and therefore will be required to, furnish records immediately or within a few
hours of a request. The Commission expects that only in unusual circumstances would a
municipal advisor be permitted to delay furnishing records for more than 24 hours.

dealers, investment advisers, and municipal advisors. 1351 However, other commenters criticized
some of the requirements as being too burdensome, especially for small independent municipal
advisors. 1352 For example, one commenter noted that the expense required for firms to retain
originals or copies of all written communications, internal or external, relating to their municipal
advisory activities caused particular concern. 1353 This commenter recommended that this
requirement be eliminated, while all other books and records requirements could remain. 1354
Alternatively, this commenter suggested that only certain communications with a client or generated

2011 (“Pennsylvania Public School Employees’ Retirement Board Letter”) (noting that the
Commission’s estimate of 181 burden hours for books and records is not broken down
further to an individual municipal advisor); letter from John B. Payne, Principal, B-Payne

time.”); letter from Adam W. Rygmyr, Associate General Counsel, TIAA-CREF, Individual
& Institutional Services, LLC, dated February 22, 2011 (stating that the books and records
requirement would largely duplicate existing record-keeping requirements for brokerdealers).

See Rule 15Ba1-8(a)(1) and NAIPFA Letter I (“The information technology and storage
facilities required to keep all email or similar electronic communication and to segregate
those that relate to municipal advisory business from other unrelated email is expensive.

which would necessitate hiring one or more IT professionals. Either way, the cost would be
significant to firms with such limited revenue.”). See also letter from Thomas DeMars,

internally be required to be kept. 1355 Another commenter stated that, because independent
municipal advisors neither hold client accounts nor hold custody of monies from clients, audited
financial statements should not be required, particularly as they are costly and burdensome for small
firms. 1356 This commenter suggested that the Commission should narrow the record-keeping
requirements to communication material specifically relevant to financing topics and financing
recommendations or advice. 1357 One commenter also requested that the Commission clarify that
every iteration of commonly used and routinely changing technical financial documents, typically
referred to as “numbers runs,” need not be retained, and that only iterations either sent to a client or
used internally to form the basis for a recommendation to a client must be retained. 1358
The Commission has carefully considered the issues raised by commenters and is adopting
Rule 15Ba1-7 generally as proposed, but renumbered as Rule 15Ba1-8 and with modifications to
include general ledgers, as well as written consents to service of process from each natural person
who is a person associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities
solely on behalf of such municipal advisor.
General ledgers would reflect asset, liability, reserve, capital, income and expense
accounts. 1359 In the Proposal, the Commission inadvertently omitted general ledgers from proposed
Rule 15Ba1-7. The Commission notes that ledgers are part of the books and records requirements
for broker-dealers and investment advisers, and would already be made and kept by dually-

402

registered municipal advisors. 1360 The Commission believes that general ledgers will assist its staff
in understanding a municipal advisor’s business dealings and financial condition, identifying and
tracking illicit expenses, identifying sources of revenue that were previously undisclosed or that
pose a conflict of interest, identifying and tracing possible acts of fraud and violations of applicable
laws and rules (e.g., MSRB Rule G-37 (Political Contributions and Prohibitions on Municipal
Securities Business)), and conducting asset verification. In addition, the Commission notes that a
municipal advisor’s balance sheet and profit loss statement are derived from the general ledger.
The Commission believes it is also appropriate to include in the record-keeping requirement
written consents to service of process from each natural person who is a person associated with the
municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of such municipal
advisor. Under proposed Rule 15Ba1-2(b), each natural person who met the definition of municipal
advisor would have been required to register as a municipal advisor by filing Form MA-I. 1361
Proposed Form MA-I included consent to service of process that a natural person would have been
required to execute. In contrast, adopted Rule 15Ba1-2(b) requires a person applying for
registration or registered as a municipal advisor to complete Form MA-I with respect to each natural
person who is a person associated with the municipal advisor and engaged in municipal advisory
activities on its behalf. 1362 As such, Form MA-I no longer includes consents to service of process
executed by such natural persons. Because the Commission would no longer receive these consents
to service of process as part of Form MA-I, the Commission believes it is appropriate to include in
the record-keeping requirement written consents to service of process from each natural person who
is a person associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities

solely on behalf of such municipal advisor. Specifically, the Commission believes that this
requirement will help ensure that such natural persons have indeed executed consents to service of
process and will allow Commission staff to examine such consents to service of process.
With respect to concerns related to the burden of the books and records requirements,
including the burden for retaining originals or copies of all written communications relating to
municipal advisory activities, 1363 the Commission continues to believe that the final books and
records requirements are appropriate for all municipal advisors because they will facilitate the
Commission’s inspections and examinations of municipal advisors and assist the Commission in
evaluating a municipal advisor’s compliance with Section 15B of the Exchange Act, the rules and
regulations thereunder, and MSRB rules. Moreover, even though it recognizes that such
requirements may impose burdens and costs upon municipal advisors, the Commission understands
that many municipal advisors already make and keep certain types of the books and records
required to be made and kept under Rule 15Ba1-8(a) under other regulatory requirements or general
industry practices. Specifically, because the books and records required to be made and kept under
Rule 15Ba1-8(a) are generally based on the existing books and records requirements for brokerdealers and investment advisers, the Commission believes that many municipal advisors would
already be familiar and in compliance with such requirements because they are also registered as
broker-dealers or investment advisers. Moreover, as noted above, to reduce the burden that would
result from the books and records requirements, Rule 15Ba1-8(e)(1) provides that any books or
other records made, kept, maintained, and preserved in compliance with Rules 17a-3 and 17a-4
under the Exchange Act, rules of the MSRB, or Rule 204-2 under the Investment Advisers Act,
which are substantially the same as the books and records required to be made, kept, maintained,

1363

See supra notes 1353-1355.
404

and preserved under Rule 15Ba1-8, will satisfy the requirements of Rule 15Ba1-8.
With respect to those municipal advisors that are not also registered with the Commission as
broker-dealers or investment advisers, the Commission recognizes that Rule 15Ba1-8 establishes
new record-keeping requirements for these entities and may impact these entities to a greater degree
than entities that have previously registered as broker-dealers or investment advisers. 1364 However,
the Commission believes that all municipal advisors should be subject to the same record-keeping
requirements, regardless of whether they have previously registered with the Commission in another
capacity. As noted above, the Commission believes that Rule 15Ba1-8 is appropriate for all
municipal advisors because it will facilitate the Commission’s inspections and examinations of
municipal advisors 1365 and assist the Commission in evaluating a municipal advisor’s compliance
with Section 15B of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and MSRB rules. The
Commission also believes that regulation of municipal advisors is in the public interest and will
improve the protection of municipal entities and investors.
Further, because the Commission is adopting certain additional exemptions from the
definition of municipal advisor, including an exemption for persons providing advice with respect
to investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of
municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments, the
burden of the books and records requirements is similarly reduced (i.e., fewer persons would be
required to register as municipal advisors and the record-keeping requirements would not cover

15Ba1-8).

1365

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(7)(A). Based on the Commission’s experience in conducting
examinations of broker-dealers and investment advisers, which includes examinations of the
types of books and records required by Rule 15Ba1-8(a), the Commission believes that the
municipal advisor books and records requirements under Rule 15Ba1-8 will facilitate the
Commission’s inspections and examinations of municipal advisors.
405

activities that fall under an exemption or exclusion from the definition of municipal advisor). The
Commission also notes that the burden of the books and records requirements for municipal
advisors depends on the complexity of the business of a municipal advisor, which means smaller
municipal advisors would be subject to proportionately lower burden in complying with such
requirements. 1366 Further, as noted below, the Commission assumes that municipal advisors will
use the most cost-effective method available, depending on their size and specific circumstances, to
comply with Rule 15Ba1-8. The Commission understands that many municipal advisors generally
make and keep the required records in electronic form, which will likely minimize the burdens and
costs associated with record-keeping. 1367 Therefore, the Commission does not believe Rule 15Ba18 will be overly burdensome for municipal advisory firms, including small municipal advisory
firms. 1368
Finally, in response to comments, the Commission confirms that only iterations of “numbers
runs” sent to a client or that are used to form the basis for a recommendation to a client must be
retained. 1369 With respect to a commenter’s suggestion that audited financial statements should not
be required, the Commission notes that the requirements of Rule 15Ba1-8 do not apply to audited
financial statements. 1370

406

As proposed, Rule 15Ba1-8(c) 1371 requires a municipal advisory firm, before ceasing to
conduct or discontinuing business as a municipal advisor, to arrange and be responsible for the
continued preservation of the books and records for the remainder of the period required by Rule
15Ba1-8. It also requires the municipal advisory firm to notify the Commission in writing of the
exact address where such books and records will be maintained during such period. The
Commission did not receive any comments on this aspect of the proposal and is adopting Rule
15Ba1-8(c) without modification.
Requirements for Non-Residents
As proposed, Rule 15Ba1-8(f), which is modeled on Rule 204-2(j) under the Investment
Advisers Act, 1372 sets forth the books and records requirements for non-resident municipal advisory
firms, including requirements for keeping, maintaining, and preserving copies of the books and
records that these municipal advisors are required to make, keep, maintain, and preserve under any
rule or regulation adopted under the Exchange Act, as well as requirements for providing written
notice to the Commission of the location of such books and records. 1373 Specifically, Rule 15Ba18(f) requires non-resident municipal advisory firms to keep, maintain, and preserve all such books
and records in the United States 1374 and provide notice to the Commission of the address of such
location within 30 calendar days 1375 after Rule 15Ba1-8 becomes effective (in the case of municipal
advisory firms that are already registered or in the process of applying for registration when the rule
becomes effective) or when filing an application for registration (in the case of municipal advisory

firms that file applications for registration after the rule becomes effective). 1376 A non-resident
municipal advisory firm is not required to keep, maintain, and preserve such books and records in
the United States if the municipal advisor timely files with the Commission a written undertaking
(in a form acceptable to the Commission and signed by a duly authorized person) to furnish the
Commission, upon demand, copies of any or all of such books and records at the municipal
advisor’s expense at the Commission’s principal or regional office (as specified by the
Commission).1377 Specifically, a non-resident municipal advisory firm must furnish the requested
books and records within 14 calendar days 1378 of the Commission’s written demand to the offices of
the Commission as specified in the written demand. 1379
The Commission did not receive any comments on its proposed record-keeping
requirements for non-resident municipal advisory firms and is adopting Rule 15Ba1-8(f) without
substantive modification. 1380 The Commission believes the requirements for non-resident
municipal advisory firms will help ensure the Commission’s effective regulation of municipal
advisors. Further, as discussed in the Proposal, such requirements are designed to ensure that the
Commission has access to the books and records of municipal advisors located outside of the United
States to enable it to perform effective examinations and inspections. The requirements will also
serve to mitigate the time and cost burdens the Commission may otherwise face in attempting to
gain access to books and records located outside of the United States, such as in the case of any

IV.

DESIGNATION OF FINRA TO EXAMINE FINRA MEMBER MUNICIPAL
ADVISORS
The Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to, among other things, require new

entities and individuals to register with the Commission and authorize the Commission to examine
such registrants, including municipal advisors. Some entities that are currently registered, or will be
registered, with the Commission as municipal advisors are also registered with the Commission as
broker-dealers and are members of FINRA. The Commission anticipates that FINRA will conduct
examinations of Commission-registered municipal advisors that are also FINRA members, subject
to the Commission’s oversight. The Commission will be responsible for examining registered
municipal advisors that are not FINRA members, which comprise the vast majority of the
anticipated registrants. 1382
The Commission believes that Section 15A of the Exchange Act provides authority to
FINRA to examine its members’ municipal advisory activities. Section 15A provides, in relevant
part, that an association of brokers and dealers shall not be registered as a national securities
association unless the Commission determines that: (1) the association has the capacity to be able
to enforce compliance by its members and persons associated with its members with the provisions
of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, the rules of the MSRB, and the rules of
the association; 1383 and (2) the rules of the association provide that the association shall provide
information to the MSRB about the examinations of the association so that the MSRB may assist in
1381

See Proposal, 76 FR at 862.

1382

As of December 31, 2012, approximately twenty-five percent of the 1,110 MA-T registrants
were also registered with FINRA as broker-dealers. Accordingly, under the permanent
registration regime, the Commission believes that FINRA will examine but a small
percentage of registered municipal advisors.

1383

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(2).
409

such examinations. 1384 In accordance with these provisions, FINRA, as a registered national
securities association, has traditionally conducted examinations of its members’ activities in
connection with municipal securities for compliance with the Exchange Act, rules and regulations
thereunder, and MSRB rules.
Registered municipal advisors are subject to the Exchange Act, rules and regulations
thereunder, and MSRB rules. As such, Section 15A provides FINRA with authority to conduct
examinations of its members’ activities as registered municipal advisors in order to evaluate their
compliance with the applicable laws and rules. 1385 In addition, the Dodd-Frank Act amended
Section 15B of the Exchange Act to expressly provide that “the Commission, or its designee, in the
case of municipal advisors,” conduct periodic examinations. 1386 Accordingly, the Commission
designates FINRA as a designee to examine its members’ activities as registered municipal advisors
and evaluate compliance by such members with federal securities laws, Commission rules and
regulations, and MSRB rules applicable to municipal advisors.
V. IMPLEMENTATION AND COMPLIANCE DATES
As discussed above, Section 15B of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act,
makes it unlawful for a municipal advisor to provide advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or

1384

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(15).

1385

Moreover, as noted above, Section 15A(b)(15) of the Exchange Act requires FINRA rules to
specify that it shall provide information to the MSRB about its examinations so that the
MSRB may “assist in such . . . examinations.” 15 U.S.C. 78o-3(b)(15). This statutory
provision implies that FINRA has the requisite authority to examine municipal advisors.

1386

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(7)(A)(iii). Specifically, Section 15B(c)(7) provides that “periodic
examinations . . . shall be conducted by — (i) a registered securities association, in the case
of municipal securities brokers and municipal securities dealers who are members of such
association; (ii) the appropriate regulatory agency for any municipal securities broker or
municipal securities dealer, in the case of all other municipal securities brokers and
municipal securities dealers; and (iii) the Commission, or its designee, in the case of
municipal advisors.”
410

obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities, or to undertake a solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person, unless the
municipal advisor is registered with the Commission. 1387 Section 15B of the Exchange Act also
provides that a municipal advisor may be registered by filing with the Commission an application
for registration in such form and containing such information and documents concerning the
municipal advisor and any person associated with the municipal advisor as the Commission, by
rule, may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of
investors. 1388 The temporary municipal advisor registration regime, also as discussed above, is set
to expire on December 31, 2014. 1389 Rules 15Ba1-1 through 15Ba1-8, Rule 15Bc4-1, and Forms
MA, MA-I, MA-W, and MA-NR will become effective 60 days after publication of the rules in the
Federal Register, and municipal advisors must comply with the new rules within the applicable
compliance filing periods described below.
The permanent municipal advisor registration system on EDGAR will be available to accept
registration applications for municipal advisory firms, including sole proprietors, beginning July 1,
2014. As discussed below, however, the Commission is providing specific compliance filing
periods for filing applications for registration under the permanent registration regime. To continue
doing business as a municipal advisory firm, any firm that is registered as a municipal advisor under
Rule 15Ba2-6T and Form MA-T as of the Effective Date must file a complete application for
registration as a municipal advisor within the applicable filing period, as set forth below. In
accordance with Section 15B(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, within forty-five days of the date such

1387

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(1)(B).

1388

note 7.
411

complete application is considered filed (or within such longer period as to which the applicant
consents), the Commission shall grant registration or institute proceedings to determine whether
registration should be denied. 1390 Before filing applications for registration as municipal advisors,
municipal advisory firms will need to file a Form ID requesting an EDGAR access code as soon as
possible, and should do so by no later than 30 days after the Effective Date to minimize processing
delays. 1391
To help ensure an orderly transition from the temporary registration regime to the permanent
registration regime and the submission of applications through EDGAR, the Commission is
providing the following compliance dates for municipal advisory firms to complete their
applications for registration under the permanent registration regime. These compliance dates are
based on the registration number a municipal advisor received (or will receive) when it registered
(or will register) as a municipal advisor under Rule 15Ba2-6T and on Form MA-T (“temporary
registration number”). A municipal advisory firm that has a temporary registration number falling
within the range that begins on 866-00001-00 and ends on 866-00400-00 must file a complete
application for registration under the permanent registration regime on or after July 1, 2014, but no
later than July 31, 2014. A municipal advisory firm that has a temporary registration number falling
within the range that begins on 866-00401-00 and ends on 866-00800-00 must file a complete
application for registration under the permanent registration regime on or after August 1, 2014, but
no later than August 31, 2014. A municipal advisory firm that has a temporary registration number
1390

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2).

1391

As discussed in the Instructions, before a municipal advisory firm can electronically file the
application with the Commission on EDGAR, such person must become an EDGAR filer
with authorized access codes through the “Form ID” authorization process. Form ID is
available on the Commission’s website at
http://www.sec.gov/about/forms/secforms.htm#EDGAR. For staff guidance regarding Form
ID, Electronic Form ID Frequently Asked Questions are available on the Commission’s
website at http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar/feifaq052306.htm.
412

falling within the range that begins on 866-00801-00 and ends on 866-01200-00 must file a
complete application for registration under the permanent registration regime on or after September
1, 2014, but no later than September 30, 2014. A municipal advisory firm that has a temporary
registration number that falls after 866-01200-00 must file a complete application for registration
under the permanent registration regime on or after October 1, 2014, but no later than October 31,
2014.
A municipal advisory firm that enters into the municipal advisory business on or after
October 1, 2014 and does not have a temporary registration number as of October 1, 2014, must file
a complete application for registration under the permanent registration regime on or after October
1, 2014 and be registered with the Commission before engaging in municipal advisory activities.
The Commission believes that this staggered compliance approach will help to facilitate an orderly
transition from the temporary registration regime to the permanent registration regime.
For a municipal advisory firm that files a complete application during the applicable filing
period, its temporary municipal advisor registration will continue in effect until the Commission
grants or denies the application for registration, unless the temporary registration is rescinded by the
Commission or withdrawn by the municipal advisory firm. Any complete application for
registration received prior to the start of the applicable filing period for a municipal advisory firm
will be considered filed 1392 on the first day of the applicable filing period. 1393 For a municipal
advisory firm that engages in municipal advisory activities before and during the applicable filing
1392

See Rule 15Ba1-2(c). See also supra note 971 and accompanying text (discussing that a
Form MA is considered filed upon submission of a completed Form MA, together with all
additional required documents, and clarifying that, if a Form MA is not considered
complete, the Commission’s statutory forty-five day review period will not commence).

1393

For example, if a municipal advisory firm with a temporary registration number that falls
between 866-00401-00 and 866-00800-00 files a complete application for registration on
July 15, 2014, its application will be considered filed on August 1, 2014.
413

period but that fails to file a complete application within the applicable filing period, the firm’s
temporary registration will expire forty-five days after the end of the applicable filing period.
Therefore, a firm that continues to engage in municipal advisory activities after the expiration of its
temporary registration would be in violation of Section 15B of the Exchange Act until it submits a
complete application and the Commission grants its application for registration under the permanent
registration regime.
A municipal advisory firm that is required to register as a municipal advisor with the
Commission on or after the Effective Date but before the applicable filing period must register
under the temporary registration regime as a municipal advisor and must file an application for
registration under the permanent registration regime during the applicable filing period. Such
municipal advisory firm’s temporary registration will continue to be in effect until the date that its
registration is granted or denied by the Commission under the permanent registration regime, unless
the municipal advisory firm’s temporary registration is rescinded by the Commission or withdrawn
by the municipal advisory firm. A municipal advisory firm that is required to register as a
municipal advisor with the Commission after the commencement of the applicable filing period
must file an application with the Commission under the permanent registration regime.

DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY 1394

The Administrative Procedure Act (“APA”) generally requires an agency to publish notice
of a proposed rulemaking in the Federal Register. See 5 U.S.C. 553(b). This requirement
does not apply, however, to rules of agency organization, procedure, or practice. See 5
U.S.C. 553(b)(3)(A). Because the amendments described in this Section VI are limited to
the Commission’s Rules of Organization and Program Management, they are not subject to
the provisions of the APA requiring notice and opportunity for comment. Because the
Commission is not publishing these rule amendments in a notice of proposed rulemaking,
the provisions of the Regulatory Flexibility Act are not applicable. See 5 U.S.C. 603. For
the same reason, and because these amendments do not substantially affect the rights or
obligations of non-agency parties, the provisions of the Small Business Regulatory
Enforcement Fairness Act are also not applicable. See 5 U.S.C. 804(3)(C). Additionally,
the Commission does not believe the amendments will have any anti-competitive effects for

A. Delegation to the Director of the Office of Municipal Securities
Rule 30-3a of the Commission’s Rules of Organization and Program Management
The Commission is amending its existing delegations of authority by adding Rule 30-3a to
its Rules of Organization and Program Management, which governs the delegations of authority to
the Director of the Office of Municipal Securities (“Director”). 1395 Section 15B(a)(2) of the
Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides that “[w]ithin forty-five days of the
date of the filing of [a municipal advisor registration] application (or within such longer period as to
which the applicant consents), the Commission shall… by order grant registration, or… institute
proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied.” 1396 New Rule 30-3a delegates to
the Director the authority to issue orders granting registration of municipal advisors within fortyfive days of the filing of an application for registration as a municipal advisor (or within such longer
period as to which the applicant consents). 1397
Section 15B(c)(3) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides the
Commission with the authority to cancel the registration of a municipal advisor if it finds that such
municipal advisor is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a municipal advisor. 1398
Rule 30-3a delegates to the Director the authority to issue orders canceling the registration of a
municipal advisor, if such municipal advisor is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business

purposes of Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act because they will not impose any new
burden on municipal advisors or other market participants. See 15 U.S.C. 78w(a)(2).
Finally, this amendment does not contain any collection of information requirements as
defined by the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980, as amended. See 44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.

as a municipal advisor. 1399
The delegations of authority to the Director in Rule 30-3a will allow the staff, on behalf of
the Commission, pursuant to Section 15B of the Exchange Act, 1400 to review and act upon
applications for registration, and to issue orders canceling municipal advisor registrations. The
Commission believes that these delegations of authority will facilitate efficient registration and
regulation of municipal advisors. Also, pursuant to Rule 30-3a, the Director may submit matters to
the Commission for consideration as it deems appropriate. 1401
Rule 19d of the Commission’s Rules of Organization and Program Management
The Commission is also amending its existing Rules of Organization and Program
Management by adding Rule 19d, which sets forth the responsibilities of the Director. 1402 In light
of the changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act to Section 15B of the Exchange Act regarding the
registration and regulation of municipal advisors, the Commission is adding Rule 19d, which states
that the Director is responsible to the Commission for the administration and execution of the
Commission’s programs under the Exchange Act relating to the registration and regulation of
municipal advisors. Rule 19d also states that the functions involved in the regulation of municipal
advisors include recommending the adoption and amendment of Commission rules, and responding
to interpretive and no-action requests. Therefore, Rule 19d specifies the role of staff in the
registration and regulation of municipal advisors.

The Commission is amending its existing delegations of authority by amending Rule 30-18
of its Rules of Organization and Program Management governing the delegations of authority to the
Director of the Office of Compliance Inspections and Examinations (“OCIE Director”). 1403 As
noted above, Section 15B(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides
that “[w]ithin forty-five days of the date of the filing of [a municipal advisor registration]
application (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents), the Commission
shall… by order grant registration, or… institute proceedings to determine whether registration
should be denied.” 1404 The Commission delegates to the OCIE Director the authority to issue
orders granting registration of municipal advisors within 45 days of the filing of an application for
registration as a municipal advisor (or within such longer period as to which the applicant consents),
and to grant registration of municipal advisors sooner than 45 days after the filing of an application
for registration. 1405
Section 15B(c)(3) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides the
Commission with the authority to cancel the registration of a municipal advisor if the Commission
finds that such municipal advisor is no longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a
municipal advisor. 1406 The amendment to Rule 30-18 delegates to the OCIE Director the authority
to issue orders to cancel the registration of a municipal advisor, if such municipal advisor is no
longer in existence or has ceased to do business as a municipal advisor. 1407

Section 15B(c)(3) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, also provides
for the withdrawal of municipal advisors from registration under such terms and conditions that the
Commission deems necessary in the public interest or for the protection of investors or municipal
entities or obligated persons. 1408 The amendment to Rule 30-18 delegates to the OCIE Director the
authority to determine whether notices of withdrawal from registration on Form MA-W may
become effective sooner than the 60-day waiting period. 1409
These delegations of authority to the OCIE Director will allow the staff, on behalf of the
Commission, pursuant to Section 15B of the Exchange Act, 1410 to review and act upon applications
for registration and withdrawals from registration, and to make determinations with regard to the
cancellation of municipal advisor registrations. These delegations of authority will facilitate
efficient registration and regulation of municipal advisors. Also, the OCIE Director may submit
matters to the Commission for consideration as it deems appropriate. 1411
Rule 19c of the Commission’s Rules of Organization and Program Management
The Commission is also amending its existing Rules of Organization and Program
Management by amending Rule 19c, which sets forth the responsibilities of the OCIE Director. 1412
Currently, Rule 19c provides that the OCIE Director is responsible for the compliance inspections
and examinations relating to the regulation of exchanges, national securities associations, clearing
agencies, securities information processors, the MSRB, brokers and dealers, municipal securities
dealers, transfer agents, investment companies, and investment advisers. Under Sections 15B and

promulgated by the Commission.1413 Further, Section 17(b) of the Exchange Act provides that all
records of persons described in Section 17(a) are subject “to such reasonable periodic, special, or
other examinations by representatives of the Commission… as the Commission… deems necessary
or appropriate in the public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of
the purposes of this title.” 1414 In light of the changes made by the Dodd-Frank Act, the Commission
is amending Rule 19c to reflect the responsibilities of the OCIE Director with respect to all persons
subject to compliance inspections and examinations, including municipal advisors. These
amendments specify the role of OCIE staff in the inspection and examination of records kept by
municipal advisors.
VII. PAPERWORK REDUCTION ACT
Certain rules that the Commission is adopting impose new “collection of information”
requirements within the meaning of the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (“PRA”). 1415 An agency
may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of information
unless it displays a currently valid control number. In accordance with 44 U.S.C. 3507 and 5 CFR
1320.11, the Commission submitted these collections of information to the Office of Management
and Budget (“OMB”) for review. The title for the collection of information requirement is “Rules
15Ba1-1 to 15Ba1-8 – Registration of Municipal Advisors.” The collection of information was
assigned OMB Control No. 3235-0681.
In the Proposal, the Commission solicited comments on the collection of information

requirements. In particular, the Commission solicited comments on whether the calculations of
either the burden hours or associated costs were too high or too low. 1416 Some commenters
addressed the collection of information aspects of the Proposal.
Many commenters opined generally that municipal advisor registration under the proposed
rules would be overly burdensome and would impose significant costs that would prove
detrimental, especially to smaller “community banks” and local and state municipalities. 1417
Although most of these letters neither provided specific suggestions to revise the Commission’s
estimates, nor provided specific alternative figures or calculations for actual burden hour figures,
the Commission addresses the comments below.
A.

Summary of Collection of Information

Section 15B(a)(2) of the Exchange Act, as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, provides that a
municipal advisor may be registered by filing with the Commission an application for registration in
such form, and containing such information and documents concerning the municipal advisor and
any persons associated with the municipal advisor, as the Commission, by rule, may prescribe as
necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors. 1418
Under the final rules and forms, the permanent registration regime for municipal advisors
will be more comprehensive than the temporary one and will require more detailed disclosures.
Under Rule 15Ba1-2(a), each firm applying for registration with the Commission as a municipal
advisor is required to complete and file electronically with the Commission Form MA. In addition,
each person applying for registration, or registered with, the Commission as a municipal advisor
must complete and file electronically with the Commission Form MA-I with respect to each natural
1416

See Proposal, 76 FR at 872, 878.

1417

See, e.g., Form Letter A.

1418

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2).
420

person who is a person associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory
activities on its behalf. 1419 Each Form MA shall be considered filed with the Commission upon
acceptance of Form MA, together with all additional required documents, including all required
Form MA-Is, by the Commission’s EDGAR system. 1420 A sole proprietor will have to complete
both Form MA and Form MA-I. 1421
Under the permanent registration regime, municipal advisors will include sole
proprietorships and firms of varying sizes. In addition, municipal advisors will include firms that
engage in municipal advisory activities as part of a broader array of financial services, serving many
types of clients, and that have many associated persons. Thus, the paperwork burden will reflect
these differences in size and types of other financial services in which the municipal advisors
engage.
Pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-5(a), a municipal advisory firm that registers on Form MA must
amend its Form MA at least annually, within 90 days of the end of the municipal advisor’s fiscal
year in the case of firms or within 90 days of the end of the calendar year for sole proprietors, and
more frequently as required by the General Instructions. In addition, a registered municipal advisor
must promptly amend Form MA-I whenever any information previously provided therein becomes
inaccurate. 1422 Municipal advisory firms must also amend Form MA-I to indicate that an individual
is no longer an associated person of the municipal advisory firm filing the form or no longer
engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf. Finally, registered municipal advisors must

See Rule 15Ba1-2(b)(1).

1420

See Rule 15Ba1-2(c).

1421

See Rule 15Ba1-2(b)(2). The Commission has developed an online filing system to permit
municipal advisors to file a completed Form MA and Form MA-I through the EDGAR
system.

1422

See Rule 15Ba1-5(b).
421

report successions of registration on Form MA. 1423
Pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-4, all registered municipal advisors are required to file Form MA-W
to withdraw from registration with the Commission as a municipal advisor. As will be the case with
both Forms MA and MA-I, Form MA-W will be required to be filed electronically with the
Commission.
Rule 15Ba1-6 sets forth the general procedures for serving non-residents. Pursuant to Rule
15Ba1-6 and the instructions to Form MA-NR, each non-resident municipal advisor applying for
registration, at the time of filing of the municipal advisor’s application on Form MA, must file with
the Commission a written irrevocable consent and power of attorney on Form MA-NR to appoint an
agent in the United States upon whom may be served any process, pleadings, or other papers in any
action brought against the non-resident municipal advisor. In addition, each municipal advisor
applying for registration pursuant to, or registered under, Section 15B of the Exchange Act must file
Form MA-NR with the Commission for each non-resident general partner, non-resident managing
agent, and non-resident natural person associated with the municipal advisor who engages in
municipal advisory activities on behalf of the municipal advisor. 1424 Rule 15Ba1-6(d) requires each
non-resident municipal advisor to provide an opinion of counsel that the municipal advisor can, as a
matter of law, provide the Commission with access to its books and records and submit to
inspection and examination by the Commission.
Rule 15Ba1-8 requires all registered municipal advisors to maintain true, accurate, and
current books and records relating to their municipal advisory activities. Generally, Rule 15Ba1-8
requires such books and records to be maintained and preserved for a period of not less than five
years, the first two years in an easily accessible place.
1423

See Rule 15Ba1-7.

1424

See Rule 15Ba1-6(a)(2).
422

Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi) exempts from the definition of “municipal advisor” any person
engaging in municipal advisory activities in a circumstance in which a municipal entity or obligated
person is otherwise represented by an independent registered municipal advisor with respect to the
same aspects of a municipal financial product or an issuance of municipal securities, provided that
certain requirements are met. First, an independent registered municipal advisor must be providing
advice with respect to the same aspects of the municipal financial product or issuance of municipal
securities. 1425 Second, the person seeking to rely on Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi) must receive from the
municipal entity or obligated person a representation in writing that the municipal entity or
obligated person is represented by, and will rely on the advice of, an independent registered
municipal advisor. 1426 Third, the person must make certain disclosures to the municipal entity or
obligated person and provide a copy of such disclosures to the municipal entity’s or obligated
person’s independent registered municipal advisor. 1427 With respect to a municipal entity, the
person seeking to rely on the exemption must disclose in writing that, by obtaining the
representation discussed above from the municipal entity, such person is not a municipal advisor
and is not subject to the fiduciary duty set forth in Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act 1428 with

1425

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(A). For purposes of this exemption, the term “independent
registered municipal advisor” means a municipal advisor registered pursuant to Section 15B
of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4) and the rules and regulations thereunder and that is
not, and within at least the past two years was not, associated with the person seeking to rely
on Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi).

1426

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(B). The person receiving the written representation may rely on
the representation, provided that the person receiving such representation has a reasonable
basis for relying on the representation.

1427

Each such disclosure must be made at a time and in a manner reasonably designed to allow
the municipal entity or obligated person to assess the material incentives and conflicts of
interest that such person may have in connection with the municipal advisory activities. See
Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(C)(3).

1428

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(1).
423

respect to the municipal financial product or the issuance of municipal securities. 1429 With respect
to an obligated person, the person seeking to rely on the exemption must disclose in writing that, by
obtaining the representation discussed above from the obligated person, such person is not a
municipal advisor with respect to the municipal financial product or issuance of municipal
securities. 1430
Rule 15Ba1-1(h) defines “municipal escrow investments” to mean proceeds of municipal
securities and any other funds of a municipal entity that are deposited in an escrow account to pay
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on one or more issues of municipal securities. In
determining whether or not funds to be invested or reinvested constitute municipal escrow
investments, a person may rely on representations in writing made by a knowledgeable official of a
municipal entity or obligated person whose funds are to be invested or reinvested regarding the
nature of such investments, provided that the person seeking to rely on such representations has a
reasonable basis for such reliance. 1431
Similarly, the Commission is adopting a qualification to the definition of “proceeds of
municipal securities” that provides that in determining whether or not funds to be invested
constitute proceeds of municipal securities, a person may rely on representations in writing made by
a knowledgeable official of a municipal entity or obligated person whose funds are to be invested
regarding the nature of such funds, provided that the person seeking to rely on such representations
has a reasonable basis for such reliance. 1432

B.

Use of Information

The Commission believes Form MA and Form MA-I will help to ensure that the
Commission can make information about municipal advisors transparent and easily accessible to the
investing public, including municipal entities and obligated persons who engage municipal
advisors; investors who may purchase securities from offerings in which municipal advisors
participated; and other regulators. Further, the information provided on Form MA and Form MA-I
will expand the amount of publicly available information about municipal advisors, including
conflicts of interest and disciplinary history. Although much of the information required by Form
MA is already publicly available with respect to municipal advisors that are already registered with
the Commission as investment advisers or broker-dealers, many municipal advisors that are not
currently registered with the Commission in another capacity will make this information available
for the first time. In addition, while municipal advisors are currently required to disclose
disciplinary history for some of their associated persons on Form MA-T, municipal advisors will be
required to disclose on Form MA disciplinary history for all associated persons. Consequently, the
final rules and forms will allow municipal entities and obligated persons, as well as others, to
become more fully informed about municipal advisors in a more efficient manner.
In addition, the requirement that each municipal advisory firm register with the Commission
on Form MA and complete Form MA-I with respect to each natural person who is a person
associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities on its behalf will
help ensure that the Commission has information to oversee respondents and their activities in the
municipal securities market effectively. In particular, the information provided in Form MA will be
used to determine whether to grant a municipal advisor’s application for registration or to institute
proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. The information will also be used
to focus examinations and aid in risk-based examination. Moreover, Form MA and Form MA-I will
425

enable the Commission to obtain an accurate estimate of the number of municipal advisors, by size
and by municipal advisory activity; analyze data regarding the various types of municipal advisory
activities in which municipal advisors engage; and evaluate the disciplinary history of all municipal
advisors and associated persons, including all regulatory, civil, and criminal proceedings.
The requirement that a municipal advisor make and keep books and records, including
written communications and records of associated persons, will help to ensure that records of the
respondent’s primary municipal advisory activities, as well as the activities of its associated
persons, exist. The Commission and other regulators could potentially request books and records
during an examination to evaluate the municipal advisor’s compliance with the Exchange Act, the
rules thereunder, and MSRB rules, as well as for other regulatory purposes.
The requirement that a non-resident municipal advisor complete Form MA-NR, and furnish
Form MA-NR for its non-resident general partners, non-resident managing agents, and associated
persons engaged in municipal advisory activities, will help minimize legal or logistical obstacles
that the Commission may encounter when attempting to effect service, conserve Commission
resources, and avoid potential conflicts of law. The requirement that a non-resident municipal
advisor provide an opinion of counsel on Form MA will help ensure that such non-resident
municipal advisor can provide access to its books and records and submit to inspection and
examination by the Commission.
The requirement that certain written representations and disclosures be made in order for a
person to be exempt from the definition of municipal advisor where a municipal entity or obligated
person is represented by an independent registered municipal advisor with respect to the same
aspects of a municipal financial product or an issuance of municipal securities will allow the
Commission staff to determine whether a person engaging in municipal advisory activities has

426

failed to register with the Commission. Further, the information will allow municipal entities and
obligated persons to understand whether a person is acting as a municipal advisor. Similarly, the
exceptions from the definitions of municipal escrow investments and proceeds of municipal
securities for reasonable inquiries will allow the Commission staff to determine whether a person
engaging in municipal advisory activities has failed to register with the Commission.
C.

Respondents

In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the proposed “collections of information”
would initially apply to approximately 1,000 municipal advisory firms, including sole
proprietors. 1433 This estimate was based partly on the number of municipal advisors that had
registered with the Commission under Rule 15Ba2-6T. As of October 2010, there were
approximately 800 total unique electronic temporary registrations for municipal advisors where
Form MA-T was completed and not withdrawn. 1434 In the Proposal, the Commission stated its
belief that the number of Form MA-T registrants would likely increase beyond 800 because
numerous applicants that would have been required to register might have missed the October 1,
2010, deadline for a variety of reasons, such as concluding, based on their interpretation of the
Dodd-Frank Act, that they were not required to register as municipal advisors. 1435 For the PRA
analysis of Rule 15Ba2-6T, the Commission estimated that approximately 1,000 applicants would
be required to complete Form MA-T. 1436 The Commission therefore believed that 1,000 applicants
would remain an appropriate estimate for the total number of municipal advisory firms that would
be required to register on Form MA under the proposed permanent registration regime. The

427

Commission also estimated that the average number of new Form MA applicants per year would be
100. 1437
In the Proposal, the Commission also estimated that approximately 21,800 individuals
would be required to register as natural person municipal advisors on Form MA-I, 1438 while the
average number of new Form MA-I applicants per year would be 1,800. 1439 These estimates were
based on trends observed in registrations of investment advisers and Form U4 applications
submitted to FINRA.
In the Proposal, the Commission solicited comments on how many municipal advisors
would incur collection of information burdens if the proposed rules and forms were adopted by the
Commission. 1440 The Commission received no comments regarding the estimated number of
municipal advisory firms that would be required to register initially on Form MA 1441 and no
comments regarding estimates for the average annual number of new Form MA and Form MA-I
applicants. Nevertheless, the Commission is revising its initial estimates of the numbers of
applicants required to complete Form MA. The Commission’s decision to revise its estimates is
based, in part, on a comparison between the current number of Form MA-T registrants and the
number of municipal advisors that are registered with the MSRB.
In October 2010, there were approximately 800 Form MA-T registrants. According to Form
MA-T data, as of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 1,110 Form MA-T registrants. Of
these Form MA-T registrants, as of December 31, 2012, approximately 901 were also registered as

428

municipal advisors with the MSRB, as they are required to do prior to engaging in municipal
advisory activities. 1442 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes that the number
of Form MA-T registrants may not be an accurate representation of the number of municipal
advisors and that MSRB data represents a better basis on which to estimate the number of municipal
advisors active in the market.
The Commission believes that a number of persons, recognizing that the Commission does
not impose any fees for registration, may have registered with the Commission as municipal
advisors out of an initial overabundance of caution. Although some current Form MA-T registrants
may not have registered with the MSRB because of uncertainty regarding the scope of the
temporary registration regime, others may have determined in the intervening time after October 1,
2010, that registration with the MSRB was not required because they were not engaging in
municipal advisory activities. The Commission staff understands based on discussions with market
participants that these Form MA-T registrants may have retained Commission registration because
there are no associated fees to maintain such registration. 1443 In addition, the Commission
anticipates that the exemption for persons providing advice with respect to investment strategies
that are not plans or programs for the investment of proceeds of municipal securities or the
recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments 1444 will reduce the estimated
number of initial Form MA applicants. Likewise, the Commission anticipates the additional

1442

The Commission staff obtained this estimate by comparing the list of MSRB registrants to
the Commission’s list of Form MA-T registrants as of December 31, 2012.

1443

The Commission staff also understands based on discussions with market participants that
some municipal advisors may have maintained Form MA-T registration instead of
withdrawing from registration to wait and see whether registration would be required under
the permanent registration regime, while others may not have realized they could withdraw
from registration or may have determined not to withdraw for other reasons.

1444

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii).
429

exemptions adopted today will also reduce the estimated number of initial Form MA applicants. 1445
For these reasons, the Commission now estimates that the “collections of information” will initially
apply to approximately 910 municipal advisory firms, including sole proprietors. 1446
In addition, the Commission is revising its estimate of the number of Form MA-I
submissions the Commission expects municipal advisory firms will be required to file. 1447 For
reasons discussed below, the Commission is revising its estimate of approximately 21,800 Form
MA-I submissions downward and currently estimates that, during the first year, municipal advisors
will need to complete a Form MA-I for approximately 11,250 individuals. 1448
In the Proposal, the Commission divided the number of Form MA-I applicants into three
main categories: (1) individuals who are currently also registered as investment adviser
representatives, registered representatives of broker-dealers, or both, and who are employed at
investment advisory firms, broker-dealer firms, or banks; (2) individuals who are employed at
financial advisor firms that are not registered as broker-dealers or investment advisers; and (3)

1445

See supra Section III.A.1.c.

1446

This estimate rounds to the nearest higher multiple of ten the number of municipal advisors
that are registered with the MSRB to engage in municipal advisory activities. The
Commission uses a similar rounding convention in estimating the number of municipal
advisors that will newly register with the Commission in subsequent years, amend prior
filings, and withdraw from registration.

1447

As discussed above, natural person municipal advisors who are not sole proprietors no
longer need to register with the Commission. However, the Commission is retaining Form
MA-I to obtain information about individuals associated with municipal advisory firms
engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of such firms. The Commission notes,
moreover, that it is the municipal advisory firms, not the individuals, that will be required to
file Form MA-I with the Commission.

1448

5,602 (estimated number of individuals who are registered as investment adviser
representatives, registered representatives of broker-dealers, or both, for whom a municipal
advisor will be required to file Form MA-I) + 4,910 (estimated number of individuals
employed by a municipal advisor not otherwise registered with the Commission for whom a
municipal advisor will be required to file Form MA-I) + 730 (estimated number of
individuals who are employed at solicitors) = 11,242 Form MA-I applicants.
430

individual solicitors who are employed at third-party marketing and solicitor firms. 1449 First, the
Commission estimated the number of individuals who are currently registered as investment adviser
representatives, registered representatives of broker-dealers, or both, and would register on Form
MA-I. To calculate this estimate in the Proposal, the Commission compared the proportion of
FINRA Form U4 filers (i.e., individuals who are investment adviser representatives and/or
registered representatives of broker-dealers) to the sum of all investment advisers registered on
Form ADV and all broker-dealers registered on Form BD. FINRA estimated that, as of October
2010, 637,000 individuals had registered as investment adviser representatives and/or registered
representatives of broker-dealers on Form U4. 1450 The Commission estimated that as of October
2010, 11,888 investment advisers had registered on Form ADV, while as of March 2010, 5,163
broker-dealers had registered on Form BD. The proportion of Form U4 registrants to the sum of
Form ADV and Form BD registrants was approximately 37.36 to 1. 1451 According to Form MA-T
data that had been collected as of October 2010, the Commission estimated that approximately 450
of 1,000 Form MA-T registrants would be investment adviser and/or broker-dealer firms. Thus, in
the Proposal, the Commission estimated that approximately 16,800 individuals who are registered
as investment adviser representatives, registered representatives of broker-dealers, or both, would
be required to register on Form MA-I. 1452
Based on data collected as of December 31, 2012, the Commission is revising its estimate of

637,000 (estimated number of Form U4 registrants) ÷ (11,888 (estimated number of Form
ADV registrants) + 5,163 (estimated number of Form BD registrants)) = 37.36. See

1452

the number of individuals who are employed at municipal advisors registered with the Commission
as investment advisers and/or broker-dealers and for whom a municipal advisor will be required to
file Form MA-I. FINRA estimates that, as of December 31, 2012, 670,016 individuals had
registered as investment adviser representatives and/or registered representatives of broker-dealers
on Form U4. 1453 The Commission estimates that, as of December 31, 2012, there were 32,645
broker-dealer and investment advisory firms. 1454 Thus, the revised estimate of the average number
of individuals who are employed at municipal advisors registered with the Commission as
investment advisers and/or broker-dealers and for whom a municipal advisor will be required to file
Form MA-I is approximately 20.52. 1455 The Commission estimates that approximately 273 of the
910 Form MA registrants will be municipal advisors registered with the Commission as investment
advisers and/or broker-dealers. 1456 Accordingly, the Commission currently estimates there to be

1453

630,391 (number of registered representatives of broker-dealers) + 39,625 (number of
investment adviser representatives who are not also registered representatives of a brokerdealer) = 670,016. See 2012 “Registered Reps” in “FINRA Statistics,” available at
http://www.finra.org/Newsroom/Statistics. The Proposal did not include the number of
investment adviser representatives who are not also registered representatives of a brokerdealer when determining the proportion of Form U4 registrants to the sum of Form ADV
and Form BD registrants.

1454

4,632 (broker-dealers) + 10,754 (Commission-registered investment advisers) + 17,259
(state-registered investment advisers) = 32,645. The Proposal did not include the number of
state-registered investment advisers when determining the proportion of Form U4 registrants
to the sum of Form ADV and Form BD registrants.

1455

670,016 (estimated number of Form U4 registrants) ÷ 32,645 (number of broker-dealers,
SEC-registered investment advisers, and state-registered investment advisers) = 20.52.

1456

The Commission staff has examined Form MA-T data as of December 31, 2012, and
estimates that approximately 30% of Form MA-T registrants are municipal advisors
registered with the Commission as investment advisers and/or broker-dealers (330 municipal
advisors registered with the Commission as investment advisers and/or broker-dealers
registered on Form MA-T ÷ 1,110 municipal advisors registered on Form MA-T = 29.73%).
The Commission assumes that the same percentage of municipal advisors registered with the
Commission as investment advisers and/or broker-dealers will register with the Commission
on Form MA. 910 (estimated number of municipal advisors registered on Form MA) × 30%
= 273.
432

approximately 5,602 individuals who are employed at municipal advisors registered with the
Commission as investment advisers and/or broker-dealers for whom a Form MA-I will need to be
filed. 1457
Second, in the Proposal, the Commission estimated the number of individuals who are
employed at municipal financial advisors and who would register on Form MA-I. The Commission
staff learned from discussions with industry and market participants that it was reasonable to
estimate that there is an average of approximately 10 professional employees per financial advisor.
According to Form MA-T data that had been collected as of October 2010, the Commission
estimated that approximately 450 of 1,000 MA-T registrants would be financial advisors. Thus, in
the Proposal, the Commission estimated that approximately 4,500 individuals who are employed at
financial advisors would be required to register on Form MA-I. 1458
The Commission now estimates that approximately 491 of the 910 Form MA registrants will
be municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission. 1459 Accordingly, the
Commission currently estimates there to be approximately 4,910 individuals employed by a
municipal advisor not otherwise registered with the Commission for whom a Form MA-I will need
1457

273 (estimated number of municipal advisors registered with the Commission as investment
advisers and/or broker-dealers) × 20.52 (estimated average number of employees per
municipal advisor registered with the Commission as an investment adviser and/or brokerdealer) = 5,601.96.

1458

450 (total number of independent financial advisor firms registered as municipal advisors) ×
10 (estimated average number of professional employees per independent financial advisor
firm) = 4,500. See Proposal, 76 FR at 865.

1459

The Commission staff has examined Form MA-T data as of December 31, 2012, and
estimates that approximately 54% of Form MA-T registrants are municipal advisors not
otherwise registered with the Commission (603 municipal advisors not otherwise registered
with the Commission registered on Form MA-T ÷ 1,110 municipal advisors registered on
Form MA-T = 54.32%). The Commission assumes that the same percentage of municipal
advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission will register with the Commission on
Form MA. 910 (estimated number of municipal advisors registered on Form MA) × 54% =
491.4.

to be filed. 1460
Third, in the Proposal, the Commission estimated the number of individual solicitors who
would register on Form MA-I. The Commission examined the data of all Form MA-T registrants as
of October 2010, and estimated that approximately 100 out of 1,000 registrants were solicitors. For
purposes of the Proposal’s PRA, the Commission assumed that there were five individual solicitors
who would register on Form MA-I for every solicitor firm that would register on Form MA. 1461
Thus, in the Proposal, the Commission estimated that approximately 500 individual solicitors would
be required to register on Form MA-I. 1462
The Commission now estimates that approximately 146 of the 910 Form MA registrants will
be solicitors. 1463 Accordingly, the Commission currently estimates there to be approximately 730
individuals employed by solicitors for whom a Form MA-I will need to be filed. 1464
One commenter noted that, for the Proposal’s estimate of 21,800 natural persons who will
be required to register initially on Form MA-I, the Commission “completely disregards” governing
1460

491 (estimated number of municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission
registered as municipal advisors) × 10 (estimated average number of professional employees
per municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission) = 4,910.

See letter from Donna DiMaria, President, Third Party Marketers Association, dated August
27, 2009, available at http://www.sec.gov/comments/s7-18-09/s71809-36.pdf (commenting
on the Commission’s proposal to adopt a rule addressing “pay-to-play” practices by
investment advisers and estimating that the typical solicitor firm consists of 2 to 5
professionals). See Proposal, 76 FR at 865.

1462

100 (estimated number of solicitors) × 5 (estimated number of Form MA-I applicants per
solicitor) = 500. See Proposal, 76 FR at 865.

1463

The Commission staff has examined Form MA-T data as of December 31, 2012, and
estimates that approximately 16% of Form MA-T registrants are solicitors (177 Form MA-T
registrants that are solicitors ÷ 1,110 municipal advisors registered on Form MA-T =
15.95%). The Commission assumes that the same percentage of solicitors will register with
the Commission on Form MA. 910 (estimated number of municipal advisors registered on
Form MA) × 16% = 145.6.

1464

146 (estimated number of solicitors that are registered as municipal advisors) × 5 (estimated
average number of professional employees per solicitor) = 730.
434

body appointees “who may number in the tens of thousands and will likely require significantly
more time and expense per person to ensure compliance than the population of financial
professionals assumed in the Proposed Rule.” 1465 In the Proposal, the Commission stated that it did
not believe that appointed members of a governing body of a municipal entity that are not elected ex
officio members should be excluded from the definition of “municipal advisor.” 1466 As discussed
above, however, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii) now provides an exemption from the definition of
municipal advisor for any person serving as a member of a governing body, an advisory board, or a
committee of, or acting in a similar official capacity with respect to, or as an official of, a municipal
entity or obligated person to the extent that such person is acting within the scope of such person’s
official capacity, regardless of whether such person is an employee of the municipal entity or
obligated person. 1467 Therefore, the Commission does not believe that it should increase the current
estimated number of Form MA-I to account for appointed board members of governing bodies.
The Commission is not revising its initial estimate of the average number of firms that will
newly register as a municipal advisor each year. In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the
average number of new Form MA applicants per year would be approximately 100. 1468 The
Commission staff has reviewed Form MA-T data as of December 31, 2012, and estimates that
approximately 205 municipal advisors filed an initial Form MA-T in 2011 and approximately 115

1465

See Wayne County Airport Authority Letter.

1466

See Proposal, 76 FR at 834. As proposed, to trigger the municipal advisor registration
requirement, an appointed member of a governing body would have needed to be engaged in
municipal advisory activities, and most appointed members do not engage in such activities.

1467

See supra Section III.A.1.c.i.

1468

For its estimate of the average annual number of new Form MA applicants, the Commission
relied on investment adviser registration data, which indicated that new investment adviser
applicants comprise, on average, approximately 10.4% of the total number of registered
investment advisers. See Proposal, 76 FR at 866. 1,000 (all Form MA applicants) × 10.4%
= 104 new Form MA applicants per year. See id.
435

filed an initial Form MA-T in 2012. In the Proposal, the Commission stated that it believed that the
number of Form MA-T registrants would likely increase beyond 800 because numerous applicants
that would have been required to register might have missed the October 30, 2010, deadline for a
variety of reasons, such as concluding, based on their interpretation of the Dodd-Frank Act, that
they were not required to register as municipal advisors. 1469 The Commission believes this could
explain the higher number of municipal advisors that filed an initial Form MA-T in 2011 than in
2012. Thus, the Commission believes that, going forward, it is appropriate to estimate
approximately 115 new Form MA-T registrations per year (assuming the temporary regime were to
continue). Based on the estimate of the number of new Form MA-T registrations per year, the
Commission continues to estimate that approximately 100 new municipal advisory firms will
register on Form MA each year. 1470
The Commission, however, is revising its estimate of the average number of individuals for
whom municipal advisory firms will need to submit a new Form MA-I. In the Proposal, the
Commission estimated that the average number of new Form MA-I applicants per year would be
1,800. 1471 The Commission now estimates that municipal advisors will need to submit a new Form

1469

See id. at 865.

1470

The Commission estimates that the percentage of Form MA-T registrants that will also be
Form MA registrants is 82%, or 910 (estimated number of Form MA registrants) ÷ 1,110
(current Form MA-T registrants). The Commission assumes that this percentage adjustment
also applies in connection with its estimate of the number of new municipal advisory firms
that will register on Form MA each year. 115 (estimated number of new Form MA-T
registrants per year) × 82% = 94.3 new Form MA registrants per year.

1471

To estimate the average annual number of new Form MA-I applicants, the Commission
relied on FINRA registration data, which indicated that new Form U4 applicants that are
new to the industry comprise, on average, approximately 8.39% of the total number of Form
U4 applicants. See Proposal, 76 FR at 866. 21,800 (all Form MA-I applicants) × 8.39% =
1,829 new Form MA-I applicants per year. See id.

Total Initial and Annual Reporting and Recordkeeping Burdens
1. Initial Registration Burden
a.

Form MA

In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that it would take a municipal advisory firm an
average of 3.5 hours to complete Form MA. 1473 This estimate was based on the estimated average
amount of time for a municipal advisory firm to complete Form MA-T and the estimated average
amount of time for an investment adviser to complete Part 1A of Form ADV. The Commission
stated in the Proposal that this estimate would apply to all municipal advisory firms because even
those that had already completed Form MA-T under the temporary registration regime would be
required to register anew under the permanent registration regime. 1474
Additionally, the Commission stated in the Proposal that, at the time it initially files Form
MA, a municipal advisory firm would be required to conduct an initial review of its business and
certify that, among other things, it and every natural person associated with the municipal advisory
firm would meet standards required by the Commission, the MSRB, or any other relevant SRO to
engage in municipal advisory activities. The Commission estimated that the initial burden to
comply with the Form MA self-certification requirement would be, on average, approximately 3.0
hours per applicant. 1475 The Commission based this estimate on burden estimates for Form N-CSR
(“Certified Shareholder Report of Registered Management Investment Companies”) and Form N-Q

1472

11,250 (initial number of individuals for whom municipal advisory firms will need to submit
a Form MA-I) × 8.39% = 943.88 individuals for whom municipal advisory firms will need
to submit a new Form MA-I.

437

(“Quarterly Schedule of Portfolio Holdings of Registered Management Investment Company”),
which include similar self-certification requirements. 1476 Thus, the Commission estimated that the
total average initial burden for Form MA would be 6.5 hours per applicant. 1477
As noted above, the Commission is making some revisions to clarify the questions asked in
the forms and to elicit additional information. The Commission recognizes that some revisions will
increase the burden for municipal advisors to complete the relevant forms, while others will
decrease the burden. For example, to reduce the burden for municipal advisory firms with many
offices, Form MA will require information pertaining only to the five largest offices. On the other
hand, Form MA now requires certain additional information that will result in additional burdens,
including additional identifying information and information regarding disciplinary history.
Because of these reasons and because most of the changes to Form MA are clarifications not
requiring additional information, 1478 on balance, the Commission does not believe the additional
information requirements will impose additional burdens on municipal advisors in the aggregate.
As noted in the Proposal, the average time necessary to complete Form MA-T is 2.5 hours, while
the average time necessary to complete Part 1A of Form ADV, a lengthier registration form, is 4.32
hours. 1479 Based on the comparative estimated burdens to complete Form MA-T and Part 1A of
Form ADV, the Commission continues to believe that its burden estimate for the completion of
Form MA is reasonable. As discussed above, however, the Commission is not adopting a self-

certification requirement. 1480 Therefore, the Commission estimates that the total average initial
burden for Form MA will be 3.5 hours per applicant.
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the total initial paperwork burden for
completion and submission of Form MA during the first year would be 6,500 hours. 1481 Given its
revised estimates for Form MA applicants, as described above, and its decision not to adopt a selfcertification requirement, the Commission now estimates that the total initial paperwork burden for
completion and submission of Form MA during the first year will be 3,185 hours. 1482
In the Proposal, the Commission solicited comments on the collection of information
burdens associated with the proposed rules and forms. 1483 The Commission received two comment
letters that addressed the Commission’s burden estimates for Form MA. Both commenters argued
that completing Form MA would require significantly more than the estimated 6.5 hours. 1484 One
commenter, in particular, asserted that:
[T]he cost estimates included in the Proposal are grossly underestimated. Rather
than the 6.5 hours estimated by the Commission, our members estimate that the
initial preparation of Form MA would require significantly greater hours and much
higher costs. Annual updates are estimated to require exponentially higher hours to
update and maintain the filing. In this regard, some of our members have observed
that the time required to prepare the Form MA-T to register under the Commission’s
temporary rules required well in excess of 6.5 hours. 1485
However, this commenter did not provide specific figures by which to recalculate the Commission’s
estimates, making it difficult to evaluate these assertions.
1480

See supra Section III.A.2.b.

1481

1,000 (persons required to submit Form MA) × 6.5 hours (average estimated time required
to complete Form MA and initial self-certification) = 6,500 hours. Id.

439

While the Commission recognizes that some applicants will require well in excess of 3.5
hours to complete Form MA, the Commission reiterates that the hourly estimate is meant to reflect
an average and emphasizes that, as noted in the Proposal, depending on the specific circumstances
of the municipal advisory firm, the initial burden to complete Form MA will vary greatly from
respondent to respondent. 1486 Factors that will affect the initial burden include the size of the
municipal advisory firm, the complexity of its business activities, and the amount and type of
information to be included on Form MA. Moreover, as noted above, Form MA generally allows
applicants for municipal advisor registration to incorporate by reference information that already
has been submitted on other forms under other Commission regulatory requirements. 1487 The
Commission believes that the ability of registrants to incorporate by reference will lower the hourly
average burden for many applicants. The Commission anticipates that, generally, many smaller
municipal advisory firms will require less time than the 3.5 hour average burden estimate, while
larger municipal advisory firms that offer a variety of services to municipal entities will require
considerably more time since they will have more information to disclose in Form MA.
The collection of information made pursuant to Form MA is mandatory and generally will
not be confidential and will be made publicly available. Some information, such as social security
numbers, will be kept confidential subject to applicable law.
b. Form MA-I
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average amount of time for a natural
person municipal advisor to complete Form MA-I would be 3.0 hours. 1488 The Commission
determined this figure by estimating the paperwork burden for Form MA-I compared to that of
1486

See Proposal, 76 FR at 867.

1487

See supra Section III.A.2.

1488

See Proposal, 76 FR at 867.
440

Form MA-T, which is estimated to be 2.5 hours per applicant. 1489 The Commission believed that
the paperwork burden of completing Form MA-I would not be significantly greater than the amount
of time required to complete Form MA-T because some of the information required for Form MA-I
would have already been gathered to complete Form MA-T. 1490 In the Proposal, the Commission
stated that the estimate of 3.0 hours to complete Form MA-I would apply to all natural person
municipal advisors because even those that had already completed Form MA-T under the temporary
registration regime would be required to register anew under the permanent registration regime. 1491
As noted above, a natural person municipal advisor who is not a sole proprietor is no longer
required to register as a municipal advisor by completing Form MA-I. However, the Commission
has determined that a municipal advisory firm must submit Form MA-I to provide information
pertaining to each associated person who engages in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s
behalf. Although the person responsible for submitting Form MA-I has changed since the Proposal,
the Commission does not believe that its estimate regarding the number of hours required to
complete Form MA-I would materially change. Rather, the Commission believes that it would take
an individual and a municipal advisory firm substantially the same number of hours to complete
Form MA-I. Similarly, although municipal advisory firms may, over time, become more efficient
in completing Form MA-I, the Commission does not believe the time savings would be substantial
enough to cause the Commission to revise its estimate.
As discussed above, the Commission is also making some revisions to clarify the questions
asked in Form MA-I and to elicit additional information. The Commission recognizes that some

867.

1490

See Proposal, 76 FR at 867.

1491

See id.
441

revisions will change the estimated burden provided in the Proposal to complete Form MA-I, while
others will decrease the burden. For example, to reduce the paperwork burden, an individual’s
disciplinary history reported on Form MA can be incorporated by reference in Form MA-I. On the
other hand, Form MA-I now requires certain additional information that would result in additional
burden, including additional identifying information and information regarding disciplinary history.
As with Form MA, because most of the changes to Form MA-I are clarifications not
requiring additional information, on balance, the Commission does not believe the additional
information requirements will impose additional burdens on municipal advisors in the aggregate. 1492
Moreover, as noted above, Form MA-I generally allows information that already has been
submitted on other forms to be incorporated by reference. 1493 Based on the comparative estimated
burden to complete Form MA-T and the ability to incorporate by reference, the Commission
continues to believe that its hourly burden estimate for the completion of Form MA-I is reasonable
and is retaining the estimate as originally proposed. Therefore, the Commission estimates that the
average amount of time for a municipal advisory firm to complete Form MA-I with respect to each
natural person who is a person associated with the municipal advisor and who engages in municipal
advisory activities on its behalf will be 3.0 hours.
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that, during the first year, the total paperwork
burden for completion and submission of Form MA-I would be 65,400 hours. 1494 Given its revised
estimate of the number of individuals for whom municipal advisory firms will need to complete a
Form MA-I, as described above, the Commission now estimates that the total initial paperwork
1492

See supra Section III.A.2.

1493

See supra Section III.A.2.

1494

21,800 (individuals required to submit Form MA-I) × 3.0 hours (average estimated time
required to complete Form MA-I and initial self-certification) = 65,400 hours. See Proposal,
76 FR at 867.
442

burden for completion and submission of Form MA-I during the first year will be 33,750 hours. 1495
The Commission received two comment letters addressing the estimated burden to complete
Form MA-I. One commenter contended that Form MA-I, as proposed, contained many questions
that are irrelevant to board trustees who are not involved in investment transactions. 1496 According
to the commenter, completion of the form would likely take longer than three hours, would not
benefit the Commission, and would impose unnecessary burdens and costs. 1497 Another commenter
argued that the registration process would create burdens that would significantly outweigh any
benefits created for a citizen to volunteer its services and that the registration requirements, such as
paying fees, meeting multiple disclosure requirements, and facing ongoing potential liabilities,
could act as a deterrent for volunteers. 1498
The Commission stated in the Proposal that it did not believe that appointed members of a
governing body of a municipal entity that are not elected ex officio members, such as citizen
volunteers, should be excluded from the definition of “municipal advisor.” 1499 As discussed above,
however, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii) now provides an exemption from the definition of municipal
advisor for any person serving as a member of a governing body, an advisory board, or a committee
of, or acting in a similar official capacity with respect to, or as an official of, a municipal entity or
obligated person to the extent that such person is acting within the scope of such person’s official
capacity, regardless of whether such person is an employee of the municipal entity or obligated

person. 1500 Accordingly, under the rules that the Commission is adopting today, board trustees are
not required to complete Form MA-I. The Commission, therefore, has not included citizen
volunteers for purposes of the current PRA hourly burden estimate or the economic analysis cost
estimates.
The collection of information made pursuant to Form MA-I is mandatory and generally will
not be confidential and will be made publicly available. Some information, such as social security
numbers, will be kept confidential subject to applicable law.

Total Initial Registration Burden Calculation

The Commission now estimates that the total initial one-time burden for municipal advisors
to register with the Commission will be approximately 36,935 hours. 1501
2. Annual Burden for Newly Registered Municipal Advisors
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the annual paperwork burden for firms to
newly register as municipal advisors after the first year would be 650 hours for Form MA 1502 and
5,400 hours for Form MA-I. 1503 In light of its decision not to adopt a self-certification requirement,
the Commission now estimates that the total ongoing annual burden for firms that will newly
register as municipal advisors each year to complete Form MA will be approximately 350 hours. 1504
In addition, given the revised estimate of the average number of individuals for whom municipal
1500

See supra Section III.A.1.c.i.

1501

3,185 (estimated initial burden for completion and submission of Form MA during the first
year) + 33,750 (estimated initial burden for completion and submission of Form MA-I
during the first year) = 36,935 hours.

1502

100 (new Form MA applicants per year) × 6.5 hours (average estimated time required to
complete Form MA and initial self-certification) = 650 hours. See Proposal, 76 FR at 868.

complete Form MA-I and initial self-certification) = 5,400 hours. See id.

advisory firms will need to submit a new Form MA-I, the Commission now estimates that the total
annual burden to submit a new Form MA-I will be approximately 2,850 hours. 1505 Thus, the
Commission estimates that the annual ongoing registration burden for new municipal advisors after
the first year will be approximately 3,500 hours. 1506
3. Annual Burden for Amendments to Form MA and Form MA-I
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average time necessary to prepare an
annual amendment to Form MA would be approximately 1.5 hours because only certain parts of
Form MA would need to be amended. 1507 The Commission recognized that, depending on the
extent of the amendments, the burden to complete an annual amendment to Form MA may vary
greatly from respondent to respondent, and that some municipal advisors would require
significantly more time than 1.5 hours, while others would require significantly less time than 1.5
hours. 1508 In addition, the Commission estimated that the annual burden to comply with the Form
MA self-certification requirement would be, on average, approximately one hour per respondent.
This estimate was based on burden estimates for Form N-CSR and Form N-Q. 1509
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average amount of time necessary to
prepare an interim updating amendment to Form MA (i.e., any additional amendment other than the
required annual amendment) would be 0.5 hours. 1510 The Commission based this figure on its
estimate for the amount of time required to prepare an interim updating amendment to Form
1505

950 (new Form MA-I filings per year) × 3.0 hours (average estimated time required to
complete Form MA-I) = 2,850 hours.

1506

350 (estimated annual ongoing burden to complete Form MA) + 2,850 (estimated annual
ongoing burden to complete Form MA-I) = 3,200 hours.

ADV. 1511 The Commission estimated that each municipal advisor would likely amend Form MA
two times during the year – one annual amendment and one interim updating amendment – although
the Commission recognized that the actual number of amendments per municipal advisor might be
higher or lower depending on the circumstances. 1512 Accordingly, the Commission estimated that
the total burden to amend Form MA per year, including compliance with the annual selfcertification requirement, would be 3,000 hours. 1513
Given the revised estimate of the number of municipal advisors that will register with the
Commission on Form MA initially, as described above, and its decision not to adopt a selfcertification requirement, the Commission now estimates that the total annual burden for municipal
advisors to amend Form MA will be 1,820 hours. 1514
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average amount of time to complete an
updating amendment to Form MA-I would be 0.5 hours. 1515 The Commission based this figure on
its estimate of the amount of time required to prepare an interim updating amendment to Form
ADV. 1516 The Commission further estimated that the time required to complete the Form MA-I

(1,000 (persons required to amend Form MA) × 2.5 hours (average estimated time to amend

per year)) + (1,000 (persons required to amend Form MA) × 0.5 hours (average estimated
time to prepare an interim updating amendment for Form MA) × 1.0 (number of interim
updating amendments per year)) = 3,000 hours per year. See id.

submit an interim updating amendment to Form MA) × 0.5 hours (average estimated time to
prepare an interim updating amendment to Form MA) × 1.0 (number of interim updating
amendments per year)) = 1,820 hours per year.

annual self-certification requirement would be approximately five minutes, or 0.1 hours. 1517 The
Commission, relying on FINRA U4 registration data, estimated that a Form MA-I respondent would
submit an average of 1.7 updating amendments per year. Therefore, the Commission estimated the
total burden to prepare updating amendments to Form MA-I and to complete the annual selfcertification would be approximately 20,700 hours. 1518
In addition, under the proposed rules and forms, the Commission would have required
individuals who register as municipal advisors by completing Form MA-I to file Form MA-W to
withdraw from registration. Accordingly, in the proposal, the Commission estimated that the total
annual burden to withdraw from MA-I registration would be approximately 1,350 hours. 1519
As noted above, a natural person municipal advisor who is not a sole proprietor is no longer
required to register as a municipal advisor by completing Form MA-I. However, the Commission
has determined that municipal advisory firms must submit Form MA-I to provide information
pertaining to each associated person who engages in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s
behalf. In addition, the final rules and forms require municipal advisory firms to amend Form MA-I
to indicate that an individual is no longer an associated person of the municipal advisory firm filing

1517

See id. The Commission stated its belief that this estimate was appropriate given the short
time required to read and review the self-certification statement and sign the section.

1518

(21,800 (persons required to amend Form MA-I during any given year) × 0.5 hours (average
estimated time to prepare any updating amendment for Form MA-I) × 1.7 (average number
of amendments per year)) + (21,800 (persons required to complete annual self-certification
on Form MA-I) × 0.1 hours (average estimated time to complete self-certification)) = 20,710
hours per year. See id. at 869.

1519

The Commission, relying on the proportion of individuals who fully terminated FINRA
registration to all Form U4 registrants, estimated that the average number of Form MA-I
withdrawals per year would be approximately 2,700. 21,800 (all Form MA-I applicants) ×
(79,722 ÷ 637,000) (proportion of individuals who fully terminated FINRA registration to
all Form U4 registrants) = 2,728. See Proposal, 76 FR at 869. 2,700 (estimated number of
persons withdrawing from Form MA-I registration each year) × 0.5 hours (average
estimated time to complete Form MA-W) = 1,350 hours per year. Id.

the form or no longer engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf.
Given the revised estimate of the number of individuals for whom municipal advisory firms
will need to submit a Form MA-I, the Commission now estimates that the average number of
amendments to Form MA-I that municipal advisory firms will need to submit to indicate that an
individual is no longer an associated person of the municipal advisory firm filing the form or no
longer engages in municipal advisory activities on its behalf will be approximately 1,340. 1520 Thus,
the total annual ongoing burden for municipal advisory firms to amend Form MA-I for this purpose
will be approximately 670 hours. 1521
Given the change to Form MA-I described above and the overall revised estimate of the
number of individuals for whom municipal advisors will be required to submit a Form MA-I, the
Commission now estimates that the total annual burden municipal advisors will incur to prepare
updating amendments to Form MA-I will be approximately 9,563 hours. 1522 As discussed in
Section III.A.2, the final rules do not require an annual self-certification on Form MA-I.
The Commission received one comment that specifically addressed the estimated burden for
amendments to Form MA and Form MA-I. 1523 Although the commenter did not provide its own
burden estimates, it argued that “[a]nnual updates are estimated to require exponentially higher

1520

11,250 (estimated number of individuals for whom municipal advisors will be required to
submit Form MA-I) × (79,722 ÷ 670,016) (proportion of individuals who fully terminated
FINRA registration to all Form U4 registrants) = 1,338.6.

1521

1,340 (estimated number of persons withdrawing from Form MA-I each year) × 0.5 hours
(average estimated time to prepare an updating amendment to Form MA-I) = 670 hours per
year.

1522

11,250 (estimated number of individuals who are employed at municipal advisors for whom
updating amendments to Form MA-I will need to be filed) × 0.5 hours (average estimated
time to prepare an updating amendment to Form MA-I) × 1.7 (average number of
amendments per year) = 9,562.5 hours per year.

hours to update and maintain the filing.” 1524 This commenter also did not provide specific figures
by which to recalculate the estimates, making it difficult to evaluate these assertions.
While the Commission is aware that in some cases (i.e., for some larger municipal advisors
with a large number of municipal entity and obligated person clients) annual updates may require
significantly more time than estimated in the Proposal, the Commission does not agree that regular
updates will generally require “exponentially higher” hours. The Commission anticipates that such
updates will involve incremental or minor changes in reporting and in most cases will not require
large-scale changes to Form MA or Form MA-I. Thus, the Commission believes that its hourly
burden estimates for amendments to Form MA and Form MA-I remain reasonable and retains them
as originally proposed.
In summary, the Commission estimates that the total annual burden for municipal advisors
to complete amendments to Form MA and Form MA-I will be approximately 12,053 hours. 1525
The collection of information made pursuant to amendments to Form MA and Form MA-I is
mandatory and generally will not be confidential and will be made publicly available. Some
information, such as social security numbers, will be kept confidential subject to applicable law.
4. Withdrawal from Municipal Advisor Registration
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average time necessary to complete
Form MA-W would be approximately 0.5 hours. 1526 The Commission based this estimate on

1524

See id.

1525

1,820 (estimated annual burden for municipal advisors to amend Form MA) + 670
(estimated annual burden for municipal advisors to amend Form MA-I to indicate that an
individual is no longer an associated person of the municipal advisory firm filing the form or
no longer engages in municipal advisory activities on its behalf) + 9,563 (estimated annual
burden for municipal advisors to prepare updating amendments to Form MA-I) = 12,053
hours.

burden estimates for Form ADV-W. 1527 Further, in the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the
average number of withdrawals from Form MA registration per year would be 60, 1528 and that the
total annual burden would be approximately 30 hours. 1529
The Commission received no comment letters that specifically addressed the Form MA-W
hourly burden estimates. Although the Commission has made modifications to Form MA-W since
the Proposal, because those changes are minor, 1530 the Commission is retaining its hourly burden
estimates for Form MA-W as originally proposed.
The Commission has reviewed Form MA-T data as of December 31, 2012, and estimates
that approximately 22 municipal advisors filed a withdrawal on Form MA-T in 2011 and
approximately 24 municipal advisors filed a withdrawal on Form MA-T in 2012. Based on
experience with withdrawals on Form MA-T, the Commission now estimates that the average
number of withdrawals from Form MA registration per year will be 30, 1531 and that the total annual
burden will be approximately 15 hours. 1532
The collection of information made pursuant to Form MA-W is mandatory and generally
will not be confidential and will be made publicly available. Some information, such as social

To estimate the annual number of withdrawals for Form MA registrants, the Commission
staff relied on investment adviser registration data, which indicated that, annually,
investment adviser withdrawals comprise, on average, approximately 6.4% of the total
number of registered investment advisers. 1,000 (all Form MA applicants) × 6.4% = 64
Form MA withdrawals per year. See id.

5. Non-Resident Municipal Advisors
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that there would be approximately 20 Form MANR filers: 16 non-resident general partners or non-resident managing agents 1533 and three nonresident municipal advisory firms. 1534 In the Proposal, the Commission noted that the average time
necessary to complete Form ADV-NR, which is similar to Form MA-NR, is approximately one
hour. 1535 The Commission estimated that, because of the additional time required to find and
designate an agent, the process to complete Form MA-NR would take longer than Form ADV-NR,
or approximately 1.5 hours on average. 1536 Thus, the Commission estimated that the total initial
burden to complete Form MA-NR would be approximately 30 hours. 1537
In addition, the Commission estimated that the additional burden to provide an opinion of
counsel would add approximately three hours and $900 in outside legal costs per respondent. 1538
To obtain this estimate, the Commission relied on its burden estimates for Form 20-F, a form

1533

1,000 (all Form MA applicants) × 1.64% (percentage of Form ADV-NR filings to total
number of investment adviser applicants) = 16 Form MA-NR filers that are non-resident
general partners or non-resident managing agents. See Proposal, 76 FR at 869–70.

1534

1,000 (all Form MA applicants) × (2 ÷ 800) (proportion of non-U.S.-based Form MA-T
registrants compared to all Form MA-T registrants) = 2.5 Form MA-NR filers that are nonresident municipal advisors. See id. at 870.

1535

See id. at 869.

1536

See id. The burden associated with this process would primarily involve the designation and
authorization of a United States person as an agent for service of process.

1537

20 (persons expected to file Form MA-NR for the first time) × 1.5 hours (average estimated
time to complete Form MA-NR) = 30 hours. See id. at 870.

1538

See id. The $900 figure is based on an hourly cost estimate of $400 on average for an
outside attorney, which is based on Commission conversations with law firms that regularly
assist regulated financial firms with compliance matters. See Investment Advisers Act
Release No. 3222 (June 22, 2011), 76 FR 39646 (July 6, 2011). Based on previous burden
estimates, the Commission estimated that outside counsel will take, on average, 2.25 hours
to assist in preparation of the opinion of counsel, for an average cost of $900 per respondent.
451

submitted by certain foreign private issuers, which has a similar opinion of counsel requirement to
Rule 15Ba1-6(d). 1539 The Commission estimated that the total initial burden to provide an opinion
of counsel would be approximately 9 hours 1540 and that the total initial cost for all non-resident
municipal advisory firms to hire outside counsel as part of providing an opinion of counsel would
be approximately $2,700. 1541 Thus, the Commission estimated that the total initial burden to
complete Form MA-NR and provide an opinion of counsel would be 39 hours.
The Commission received no comment letters that specifically addressed the Form MA-NR
hourly burden estimates. Although the Commission has made modifications to Form MA-NR since
the Proposal, because most of the changes are clarifications not requiring additional information, on
balance, the Commission does not believe the additional information requirements will impose
significant additional burdens on municipal advisors, 1542 and is retaining its hourly burden estimates
to complete Form MA-NR as originally proposed. 1543 Given the revised estimate of Form MA
applicants as described above, the Commission now estimates that two non-resident municipal
advisory firms will need to complete Form MA-NR. 1544 In addition, the Commission estimates that
those non-resident municipal advisory firms will need to furnish Form MA-NR for 15 non-resident

452

general partners and non-resident managing agents. 1545
The final rules and forms will also require each non-resident municipal advisory firm to file
Form MA-NR for each non-resident natural person associated with the municipal advisor who
engages in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the municipal advisor. The Commission
estimates that the number of such non-resident natural persons will be the same as the number of
non-resident general partners or non-resident managing agents, or 15. 1546 Thus, the total number of
Form MA-NR filers will be approximately 32, and the total initial burden to complete Form MANR will be approximately 48 hours. 1547
The Commission also estimates that the total initial burden to provide an opinion of counsel
will be approximately 6 hours. 1548 Thus, the Commission estimates that the total initial burden to
complete the estimated number of Form MA-NR submissions and provide an opinion of counsel
will be 54 hours. 1549 In addition, the Commission now estimates that the total initial cost for all
non-resident municipal advisory firms to hire outside counsel as part of providing an opinion of
counsel will be approximately $1,800. 1550
In the Proposal, the Commission also estimated the ongoing annual number of new Form

1545

910 (all Form MA applicants) × 1.64% (percentage of Form ADV-NR filings to total
number of investment adviser applicants) = 14.92 Form MA-NR filers that are non-resident
general partners or non-resident managing agents.

1546

See supra note 1545 and accompanying text. The Proposal did not include the number of
Form MA-I filers in estimating the burden associated with Form MA-NR.

1547

32 (persons expected to file Form MA-NR for the first time) × 1.5 hours (average estimated
time to complete Form MA-NR) = 48 hours.

1548

2 (non-resident municipal advisory firms expected to provide opinion of counsel) × 3.0
hours (average estimated time to provide an opinion of counsel) = 6 hours.

1549

48 hours (total initial burden to complete of Form MA-NR) + 6 hours (total initial burden to
provide an opinion of counsel) = 54 hours.

1550

2 (non-resident municipal advisory firms expected to provide opinion of counsel) × $900
(average estimated cost to hire outside counsel to provide an opinion of counsel) = $1,800.
453

MA-NR filers that are non-resident general partners or non-resident managing agents. Relying on
investment adviser registration data, the Commission estimated that only one municipal advisor
respondent per year would have a non-resident general partner or non-resident managing agent that
would be required to complete a new Form MA-NR. 1551 This estimate included the ongoing annual
number of new Form MA-NR filers that are non-resident municipal advisors since the small initial
number of non-resident municipal advisors suggested that, at most, there would be only one new
non-resident municipal advisor every several years. Thus, the Commission estimated that the total
burden per year to complete Form MA-NR would be approximately two hours. 1552 For the
purposes of the analysis, the Commission assumed that the one new non-resident municipal advisor
per year would not be a natural person and would thus be required to provide opinion of counsel.
The Commission estimated that the total burden per year to provide opinion of counsel would be
approximately three hours 1553 and that the ongoing annual cost for non-resident municipal advisors
to hire outside counsel as part of providing opinion of counsel would be approximately $900. 1554
The Commission continues to estimate that only one municipal advisor respondent per year
will have a non-resident general partner, non-resident managing agent, or associated person that
would be required to complete a new Form MA-NR. 1555 Thus, as in the Proposal, the Commission
1551

1,000 (all Form MA applicants) × 0.09% (average annual percentage filings of Form ADVNR) = 0.9 Form MA-NR filers per year; this number was rounded up to 1. See Proposal, 76
FR at 870.

1552

1 (persons expected to file Form MA-NR each year) × 1.5 (average estimated time to
complete Form MA-NR) = 1.5 hours per year. See id.

1553

1 (municipal advisory firms expected to provide an opinion of counsel) × 3.0 (average
estimated time to provide opinion of counsel) = 3.0 hours per year. See id.

1554

1 (persons expected to file Form MA-NR each year) × $900 (average estimated cost to hire
outside counsel to provide opinion of counsel) = $900. See id.

1555

910 (all Form MA applicants) × 0.09% (average annual percentage filings of Form ADVNR) = 0.82 Form MA-NR filers per year; as in the initial estimate, this number is rounded
up to 1.
454

estimates that the total burden per year to complete a new Form MA-NR will be approximately two
hours; 1556 the total burden per year to provide opinion of counsel will be approximately three
hours; 1557 and the ongoing annual cost for non-resident municipal advisors to hire outside counsel
as part of providing opinion of counsel will be approximately $900. 1558
The Commission notes that filers may incur recurring burdens associated with Form MANR, such as costs incurred to monitor and maintain the information required by the form. For the
purposes of this analysis, these recurring burdens are included in the estimates noted above. Rule
15Ba1-6 also will require that municipal advisors update the information on Form MA-NR if it
becomes inaccurate. Similarly, these burdens are accounted for in the above estimates.
In summary, the Commission now estimates that the total initial burden for Form MA-NR
will be approximately 54 hours; 1559 the total ongoing annual burden to complete a new Form MANR will be approximately two hours; 1560 the total initial cost for all non-resident municipal advisory
firms to hire outside counsel as part of providing an opinion of counsel will be approximately
$1,800; 1561 and the ongoing annual cost for non-resident municipal advisors to hire outside counsel
as part of providing opinion of counsel will be approximately $900. 1562
The collection of information made pursuant to Form MA-NR is mandatory and will not be
confidential and will be made publicly available.
1556

1 (persons expected to file Form MA-NR each year) × 1.5 (average estimated time to
complete Form MA-NR) = 1.5 hours per year.

1557

6. Outside Counsel
In the Proposal, the Commission stated its belief that some municipal advisory firms would
seek outside counsel to help them comply with the requirements of the proposed rules, if adopted,
and to complete Form MA. 1563 The Commission also stated its belief that it would be unlikely that
natural person municipal advisors would obtain or consult with counsel for purposes of completing
Form MA-I. 1564 For PRA purposes, the Commission assumed that all 1,000 municipal advisory
firms registering on Form MA would, on average, consult with outside counsel for one hour to help
them comply with the requirements. 1565 The Commission estimated that the total cost for all
municipal advisory firms to hire outside counsel to review their compliance with the requirements
of the proposed rules and forms would be approximately $400,000. 1566 Given the revised estimate
of Form MA applicants as described above, the Commission now estimates that such cost will be
approximately $364,000. 1567 In addition, firms that seek to register as municipal advisors in each
year after the first will likely hire outside counsel to review their compliance with the requirements
of the proposed rules and forms. As discussed above, the Commission estimates that approximately

1563

1564

1565

1566

1,000 (estimated number of municipal advisory firms that would hire outside counsel) × 1
hour (average estimated time spent by outside counsel to help a municipal advisory firm
comply with the rule) × $400 (hourly rate for an outside attorney) = $400,000. The hourly
cost estimate of $400 on average for an attorney is based on Commission conversations with
law firms that regularly assist regulated financial firms with compliance matters. See id.

1567

910 (estimated number of municipal advisory firms that would hire outside counsel) × 1

cost estimate of $400 on average for an attorney is based on Commission conversations with
law firms that regularly assist regulated financial firms with compliance matters. See supra
note 1538 (calculating the hourly rate for an outside attorney).
456

100 new municipal advisory firms will register on Form MA each year. 1568 Accordingly, the
Commission estimates that the ongoing cost for all municipal advisory firms to hire outside counsel
to review their compliance with the requirements of the proposed rules and forms would be
approximately $40,000. 1569
As discussed above, the Commission received many comments that opined generally that
municipal advisor registration under the proposed rules would be overly burdensome and would
impose significant costs that would prove detrimental, especially to smaller “community banks” and
local and state municipalities. 1570 Among these comments, many noted that local governments
would need to hire counsel with expertise in dealing with the Commission to ensure that these
officials are properly trained and advised in the intricacies of securities law. 1571
As already discussed above, however, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii) now provides an exemption
from the definition of municipal advisor for any person serving as a member of a governing body,
an advisory board, or a committee of, or acting in a similar official capacity with respect to, or as an
official of, a municipal entity or obligated person to the extent that such person is acting within the
scope of such person’s official capacity, regardless of whether such person is an employee of the
municipal entity or obligated person. 1572 Therefore, the concern that local governments would need
to hire counsel to assist local government officials that are required to register as municipal

100 (estimated number of new municipal advisory firms that would hire outside counsel

advisors, thus raising the annual burden, is no longer warranted.
Another commenter argued that a natural person municipal advisor that registers on Form
MA-I would require the assistance of an attorney well-versed in the federal securities laws. 1573 As
discussed above, it is the obligation of the municipal advisory firm applying for registration with the
Commission to complete Form MA-I for each natural person who is a person associated with the
municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities on its behalf. In addition, the
Commission notes that the information requested on Form MA-I is similar to the information
requested on FINRA’s Form U4. The Commission believes that Form MA-I, like Form U4, does
not require applicants to possess any specialized knowledge of federal securities laws or retain the
services of a securities lawyer. For municipal advisory firms that are not sole proprietors, the
Commission does not anticipate that such associated persons will require outside counsel to assist in
the completion of Form MA-I. With regard to municipal advisory firms that are sole proprietors,
the Commission anticipates that the estimate above regarding firms that would consult with outside
counsel to assist in completing Form MA would also include the time required to complete Form
MA-I.
One commenter argued that in many cases the Commission’s estimate of $400 per hour for
outside counsel is too low because applicants would generally seek to retain more experienced
counsel when faced with the new registration requirements. 1574 The commenter also stated its belief
that, for a financial institution that provides a variety of services to municipal clients, outside legal
fees could easily exceed $25,000. 1575 However, this commenter did not provide specific figures by
which to recalculate the Commission’s estimates.

The Commission recognizes that, for such larger financial institutions offering diversified
services, the outside legal fees will likely exceed the $400-per-hour estimate. However, the
Commission calculated the estimate as an average cost across all municipal advisory firms, and
many smaller firms require far less assistance from outside counsel or, in some cases, none at all.
The $400 hourly rate for outside legal counsel, based on Commission staff conversations with law
firms that regularly assist regulated financial firms with compliance matters, represents an average
from a diverse group of industry sources, reflecting different geographical regions and seniority
levels. The Commission notes that, depending on such variables, some outside counsel will charge
more than $400 per hour, but many others will charge less. The Commission, therefore, continues
to believe that its average hourly cost estimates for all municipal advisory firms to hire outside
counsel are accurate and retains them as originally proposed.
7. Consent to Service of Process from Certain Associated Persons
If Form MA-I is being filed by a municipal advisory firm with respect to a natural person
engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf, the authorized representative of the
municipal advisory firm who signs the Execution Page of Form MA-I must attest that the municipal
advisory firm has obtained and retained written consent from the individual that service of any civil
action brought by, or notice of any proceeding before, the Commission or any SRO in connection
with the individual’s municipal advisory activities may be given by registered or certified mail to
the individual’s address given in Item 1 of Form MA-I. If Form MA-I is being filed by a natural
person municipal advisor who is a sole proprietor, by signing the Execution Page of Form MA-I, he
or she must consent that service of any civil action brought by, or notice of any proceeding before,
the Commission or any SRO in connection with the sole proprietor’s municipal advisory activities
may be given by registered or certified mail to the sole proprietor’s address given in Item 1 of Form

459

MA-I.
The Commission estimates that each municipal advisory firm, other than sole proprietors,
seeking to register with the Commission following adoption of the final rules and forms will need to
obtain and retain 1576 a written consent to service of process from each natural person engaged in
municipal advisory activities on its behalf. 1577 The Commission does not have the information
necessary to provide a reasonable estimate regarding the number of sole proprietors that will
register with the Commission as municipal advisors because this data is not currently available to
the Commission and the Commission is unaware of any such data being publicly available.
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that all municipal advisory firms seeking to register with
the Commission (i.e., 910 applicants) will need to obtain written consents to service of process. 1578
The Commission estimates that each municipal advisory firm would need approximately 1 hour to
draft a template document to use in obtaining the written consents to service of process, amounting
to an initial, one-time burden of approximately 910 hours. 1579 In addition, as discussed above, the
Commission estimates that, during the first year, municipal advisors will need to complete a Form

1576

Rule 15Ba1-8(a)(8) will require each municipal advisory firm to retain written consents to
service of process from each natural person who is a person associated with the municipal
advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf of such registered
municipal advisor.

1577

Because sole proprietors will consent to service of process by signing the Execution Page of
Form MA-I, sole proprietors will not need to obtain a separate consent to service of process.
The requirement related to sole proprietors is already accounted for in the Commission’s
estimated burden to complete Form MA-I. See supra Section VII.D.1.b.

1578

As discussed above, the Commission estimates that 910 municipal advisory firms, including
sole proprietors, will register under the permanent registration regime. See supra note 1446
and accompanying text.

1579

910 (estimated number of applicants for municipal advisor registration during the first year)
× 1.0 hours (estimated time required to draft a template to use in obtaining the written
consents to service of process) = 910 hours.
460

MA-I for approximately 11,250 individuals. 1580 The Commission estimates that, once drafted, each
applicant would need approximately 6 minutes, or 0.10 hours, to obtain a written consent to service
of process from each natural person engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf,
amounting to an initial, one-time burden of approximately 1,125 hours. 1581 Accordingly, the
Commission estimates that the total initial, one-time burden for all municipal advisory firms to
obtain written consents to service of process from each natural person engaged in municipal
advisory activities on their behalf will be approximately 2,035 hours. 1582
In addition, firms that seek to register as municipal advisors in each year after the first will
need to obtain a written consent to service of process from each natural person engaged in
municipal advisory activities on their behalf. As discussed above, the Commission estimates that
approximately 100 new municipal advisory firms will register on Form MA each year. 1583
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the total ongoing annual burden for firms that will
newly register as municipal advisors each year to draft a template document to use in obtaining the
written consents to service of process will be approximately 100 hours. 1584 In addition, as discussed
above, the Commission estimates that municipal advisors will need to submit a new Form MA-I for

1580

See supra note 1448 and accompanying text.

1581

11,250 (estimated number of natural persons engaged in municipal advisory activities on
behalf of a municipal advisory firm during the first year) × 0.10 hours (estimated time
required to obtain the written consents to service of process) = 1,125 hours.

1582

910 hours (estimated one-time burden for all municipal advisory firms to draft a template to
use in obtaining the written consents to service of process) + 1,125 hours (estimated onetime burden for all municipal advisory firms to obtain the written consents to service of
process) = 2,035 hours.

1583

See supra note 1470 and accompanying text.

approximately 950 individuals annually. 1585 Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the total
ongoing annual burden for firms to obtain written consents to service of process from these persons
will be approximately 95 hours. 1586 The Commission estimates that the total ongoing burden for all
municipal advisory firms to obtain written consents to service of process from each natural person
engaged in municipal advisory activities on their behalf in each year after the first will be
approximately 195 hours. 1587
8. Maintenance of Books and Records
The Commission proposed that all municipal advisory firms would be required, pursuant to
proposed Rule 15Ba1-7, to maintain books and records relating to their municipal advisory
activities. These books and records requirements were generally based on Exchange Act Rules 17a3 and 17a-4 and Investment Advisers Act Rule 204-2, which set forth books and records
requirements with respect to broker-dealers and investment advisers, respectively. 1588
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average annual burden for a municipal
advisory firm to comply with the proposed recordkeeping requirements would be similar to that of
an investment adviser, or 181 hours. 1589 The Commission noted that the proposed recordkeeping
requirements would likely impose initial burdens on respondents in connection with necessary

1585

See supra note 1472 and accompanying text.

1586

950 (estimated number of new Form MA-I filings per year) × 0.10 hours (estimated time
required to obtain the written consents to service of process) = 95 hours.

1587

100 hours (estimated ongoing annual burden for all firms that will newly register as
municipal advisors to draft a template to use in obtaining the written consents to service of
process) + 95 hours (estimated ongoing annual burden for municipal advisory firms to
obtain written consents to service of process) = 195 hours.

462

updates to their recordkeeping systems, such as systems development or modifications. 1590 For the
purposes of the Commission’s analysis, these initial burdens were included in the estimate of 181
burden hours per respondent per year. Thus, the Commission estimated the total compliance burden
would be approximately 181,000 hours per year. 1591
The Commission has made two substantive modifications to the recordkeeping requirements
since the Proposal. As discussed above, Rule 15Ba1-8(a)(2) will require municipal advisors to
maintain general ledgers, a requirement that was inadvertently left out of proposed Rule 15Ba17. 1592 In addition, as discussed above, Rule 15Ba1-8(a)(8) will require each municipal advisory
firm to retain written consents to service of process from each natural person who is a person
associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf
of such municipal advisor. 1593 In light of these changes, the Commission now estimates that the
average annual burden for a municipal advisory firm to comply with the recordkeeping
requirements will be approximately 182 hours. Given the revised estimates of the number of Form
MA applicants, the Commission now estimates that the total compliance burden will be
approximately 165,620 hours per year. 1594
The Commission received two comment letters that specifically addressed the annual books
and records burden estimate. One commenter noted that, although the Commission estimated an

1590

463

annual burden of 181 hours for a municipal advisory firm, the estimate was not broken down further
to an individual municipal advisor, such as a retirement board trustee. 1595 The Commission notes
that, as proposed, the recordkeeping requirement would have applied only to municipal advisory
firms and sole proprietors. 1596 For this reason, the Commission estimated the books and records
burden for municipal advisory firms and sole proprietors only, and the estimate was not intended to
reflect any recordkeeping burden for any other persons. Similarly, Rule 15Ba1-8(a), as adopted,
states that the books and records requirement applies to “[e]very person registered or required to be
registered under section 15B of the Act.” 1597 Because natural person municipal advisors, other than
sole proprietors, are not required to register with the Commission under the final rules, 1598 the books
and records requirement does not apply to natural person municipal advisors that are not sole
proprietors.
Another commenter asserted that the Commission’s estimate was “optimistic,” and that,
although the estimated burden represents nearly ten percent of a full-time person’s time, the number
of hours did not include the cost of storage, and the actual burden would likely be higher. 1599
The Commission recognizes that, for larger municipal advisory firms, the annual burden
estimate of 182 hours may be low. The Commission anticipates that, for the purposes of calculating
the applicable PRA burden, the annual burden for larger municipal advisory firms that offer a

1597

See Rule 15Ba1-8(a).

1598

Rule 15Ba1-3, as adopted, exempts from the registration requirement a natural person
municipal advisor who is an associated person of an advisor that is registered with the
Commission pursuant to Section 15B(a)(2) of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2)) and
the rules and regulations thereunder, and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on
behalf of a registered municipal advisor.

1599

464

variety of services to municipal entities and have significantly greater volumes of books and records
to maintain will be offset in the average by the significantly lower annual burden for smaller firms.
As the Commission stated in the Proposal, 1600 given the relatively smaller size of municipal
advisory firms compared to investment advisory firms and the fewer books and records
requirements imposed by Rule 15Ba1-8, in the Commission’s view, the annual hourly burden for
smaller municipal advisory firms will likely be lower than 182 hours.
The Commission also believes that variations in the current records storage systems of
respondents make it difficult for the Commission to estimate separately the cost of storage for a
typical respondent. To the extent that the additional records required by the recordkeeping
requirements can be stored and produced for inspection by electronic means, the additional costs
should not be substantial. The Commission also reiterates that the books and records estimate, as
originally proposed, included storage costs and any needed technology refinements or upgrades. 1601
Accordingly, the Commission believes that the 182-hour figure, as an average annual hourly burden
across all firms regardless of their size is an appropriate estimate.
This collection of information is mandatory. The Commission staff will use the mandatory
collection of information for maintenance of books and records in its examinations and oversight
program, and the information will be kept confidential subject to applicable law.
9. Exemption When a Municipal Entity or Obligated Person is Represented by
an Independent Registered Municipal Advisor
The Commission believes that underwriters in negotiated deals, because of the services they

municipal advisory firms in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis below. See infra
Section IX.

465

provide and the nature of negotiated deals, 1602 are the persons most likely to rely on the exemption
available to persons engaging in municipal advisory activities where a municipal entity or obligated
person is otherwise represented by an independent registered municipal advisor. The Commission
believes other persons will be less likely to rely on this exemption because the nature of the services
they provide may not require a municipal entity or obligated person to engage an independent
registered municipal advisor. The determination of whether to rely on this exemption will depend
on the facts and circumstances of a particular deal and the parties involved in that deal, as well as
the type of entity seeking to rely on the exemption. It is possible that not many persons will seek to
rely on the exemption because another exclusion or exemption from the definition of municipal
advisor is available. Although the Commission is providing this exemption, any efforts to rely on
the exemption in Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi) are purely voluntary.
According to available market data for 2012, approximately 204 underwriters participated in
negotiated deals of municipal securities in 2012. 1603 The Commission estimates that 210 persons
will seek to rely on this exemption.1604
A person seeking to rely on the exemption pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi) must obtain a
written representation from the municipal entity or obligated person that it will not rely on the
advice of the person seeking to rely on the exemption, and that it will rely on the advice of an
independent registered municipal advisor. The Commission estimates that each person seeking to
1602

See supra note 604 and accompanying text (describing typical services provided by an
underwriter in a negotiated deal) and note 614 (stating the definition of “negotiated sale”).

1603

According to data obtained from Thomson Reuters’ SDC Platinum database, in 2012, 156
lead underwriters participated in negotiated deals. Including all underwriters that
participated in negotiated deals in 2012, that number increases to 204.

1604

This estimate rounds to the nearest higher multiple of ten the number of underwriters that
participated in negotiated deals of municipal securities. The Commission believes this
estimate, which likely overestimates the number of underwriters who are likely to seek to
rely on this exemption, is inclusive of other persons who may seek to rely on this exemption.
466

rely on this exemption would need approximately 1 hour to draft a template document to use in
obtaining the written representation, amounting to an initial, one-time burden of 210 hours. 1605
There will also be an ongoing burden each time a person seeks to rely on this exemption.
The Commission estimates that, on average, there are approximately 8,770 negotiated deals
involving an underwriter each year. 1606 The Commission estimates that a person seeking to rely on
this exemption would need approximately 15 minutes, or 0.25 hours, to obtain a written
representation from a municipal entity or obligated person, amounting to an annual burden of
approximately 2,193 hours. 1607
In addition, the person seeking to rely on this exemption must make certain disclosures to
the municipal entity or obligated person, and provide a copy of such disclosures to the municipal
entity’s or obligated person’s independent registered municipal advisor. With respect to a
municipal entity, such person must disclose in writing that, by obtaining the representation
discussed above from the municipal entity, such person is not a municipal advisor and is not subject
to the fiduciary duty set forth in Section 15B(c)(1) of the Exchange Act with respect to municipal
financial products or the issuance of municipal securities. 1608 With respect to an obligated person,
such person must disclose in writing that, by obtaining the representation discussed above from the
obligated person, such person is not a municipal advisor with respect to the municipal financial
product or issuance of municipal securities. 1609 The Commission estimates that each person seeking

1605

210 (estimated number of persons who will seek to rely on the exemption) × 1.0 hours
(estimated time required to draft the written representation) = 210 hours.

1606

This estimate represents an average of the number of negotiated deals each year from 2009
through 2012 relying upon data obtained from Thomson Reuters’ SDC Platinum database.

1607

8,770 (estimated number of negotiated deals per year) × 0.25 hours (estimated time required
to obtain the written representation) = 2,192.5 hours.

1608

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(C)(1).

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(C)(2). Each such disclosure must be made at a time and in a

to rely on this exemption would need approximately 1 hour to draft the required disclosure,
amounting to an initial, one-time burden of approximately 210 hours. 1610 The Commission believes
that once these disclosures have been drafted, such language would become part of the standard
municipal advice documentation and, accordingly, there would be no further ongoing associated
burden.
In summary, the Commission estimates that the initial burden related to the exemption when
a municipal entity or obligated person is represented by an independent registered municipal advisor
will be 2,613 hours. 1611 In addition, the Commission estimates that the ongoing burden will be
2,193 hours. 1612
The Commission staff will use the collection of information under the exemption for
independent registered municipal advisors in its examinations and oversight program to ensure that
unregistered municipal advisors are properly exempt from registration. Any information reviewed
by the Commission will be kept confidential subject to applicable law. In addition, the collection of
information will allow municipal entities and obligated persons to understand whether a person is
acting as a municipal advisor, and will allow persons relying on the exemption to demonstrate that
registration with the Commission as municipal advisors was not required.

manner reasonably designed to allow the municipal entity or obligated person to assess the
material incentives and conflicts of interest that such person may have in connection with
the municipal advisory activities. See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(C)(3).
1610

210 (estimated number of persons who will seek to rely on the exemption) × 1.0 hours
(estimated time required to draft the required disclosure) = 210 hours.

1611

210 hours (estimated time to draft a template document to use in obtaining the written
representation) + 2,193 hours (estimated time to obtain a written representation from a
municipal entity or obligated person) + 210 hours (estimated time to draft the required
disclosure) = 2,613 hours.

Municipal Escrow Investments

Rule 15Ba1-1(h) defines “municipal escrow investments” to mean proceeds of municipal
securities and any other funds of a municipal entity that are deposited in an escrow account to pay
the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on one or more issues of municipal securities. As
discussed above, 1613 in determining whether or not funds to be invested or reinvested constitute
municipal escrow investments, a person may rely on representations in writing made by a
knowledgeable official of a municipal entity or obligated person whose funds are to be invested or
reinvested regarding the nature of such investments, provided that the person seeking to rely on
such representations has a reasonable basis for such reliance. 1614
The Commission believes that state-registered investment advisers with municipal entity
clients are the persons most likely to rely on Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2) for reasonable reliance on
representations related to municipal escrow investments. The Commission notes that no entity is
required to utilize Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2) and that any efforts to do so are voluntary.
The Commission estimates that approximately 700 persons may seek to rely on the
exception for reasonable reliance on representations related to municipal escrow investments. 1615
1613

See supra notes 383–384 and accompanying text.

1614

See Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2).

1615

To calculate this estimate, the Commission staff examined data regarding investment
advisers with assets under management under $100 million as of May 3, 2010. Section 410
of the Dodd-Frank Act reallocated primary responsibility for oversight of investment
advisers by delegating generally to the states responsibility over certain investment advisers
with assets under management between $25 million and $100 million (“mid-sized
advisers”). The Commission does not maintain aggregate data regarding state-registered
investment advisers, including mid-sized advisers registered with one or more state
securities authorities, and is not aware of any publicly available data regarding stateregistered investment advisers that could be used to calculate this estimate. As described in
the paragraph below, however, the Commission does have such data as of May 3, 2010,
which was prior to the passage of the Dodd-Frank Act (and the time those advisers were
required to switch to state registration). Given the relatively short period of time that has
elapsed since 2010 and the Commission’s belief that, for purposes of this analysis, the
469

The Commission estimates that each person seeking to rely on this exception would need
approximately 1 hour to draft a template document to use in obtaining the written representation,
amounting to an initial, one-time burden of approximately 700 hours. 1616
In addition, the Commission estimates that, once drafted, a person seeking to rely on this
exception would need approximately 15 minutes, or 0.25 hours, to obtain a written representation
from its client. The Commission estimates that persons that will seek to rely on this exception have
approximately 8,620 clients that are municipal entities. 1617 Thus, the Commission estimates that the

nature of the investment advisory industry has not changed significantly since that time, the
Commission is relying on data from 2010 to calculate these estimates.
According to registration information from the Investment Adviser Registration Depository
(“IARD”) as of May 3, 2010, responses to Item 5.F(2)(c) of Part 1 of Form ADV indicate
that there were 5,550 investment advisers with less than $100 million in assets under
management registered with the Commission. According to responses to Item 5.D(9) of Part
1 of Form ADV, 211 of those investment advisers (or approximately 4%) (211 ÷ 5,550 =
0.038) had clients that were “state or municipal government entities.”
As of January 1, 2013, there were 17,259 state-registered investment advisers. Using the
same percentage of investment advisers with clients that were state or municipal government
entities, the Commission staff estimates that approximately 700 state-registered investment
advisers have clients that are state or municipal government entities. 17,259 (number of
state-registered investment advisers as of January 1, 2013) × 0.04 (estimated percentage of
state-registered investment advisers with state or municipal government entity clients) =
690.36. This estimate rounds to the nearest higher multiple of ten the number of stateregistered investment advisers that have clients that are state or municipal government
entities. The Commission believes this estimate, which likely overestimates the number of
state-registered investment advisers who are likely to seek to rely on this exception, is
inclusive of other persons who may seek to rely on this exception.
1616

700 (estimated number of persons who will seek to rely on the exception) × 1.0 hours
(estimated time required to draft the written representation) = 700 hours.

1617

According to responses to Item 5.D(9) of Part 1 of Form ADV, as of May 3, 2010, the 211
investment advisers identified above (see supra note 1615) had approximately 2,770 state or
municipal government entity clients. The Commission staff used the midpoint of each range
to estimate the number of such clients. The Commission does not have exact data from
2010 on the number of clients of investment advisers that are state or municipal government
entities because Form ADV responses are in the format of a range (e.g., 26–100 clients). In
addition, the Commission does not have the information necessary to provide another point
estimate.
470

burden to obtain the written representation will be 2,155 hours. 1618
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the total initial burden for all persons to rely on
the exception for reasonable reliance on representations related to municipal escrow investments
will be 2,855 hours. 1619 Because the person seeking to rely on this exception only needs to obtain
the written representation one time, the Commission does not believe that there will be an ongoing
burden.
The Commission staff will use the collection of information under Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2) in its
examinations and oversight program to determine whether a person engaging in municipal advisory
activities has failed to register with the Commission. Any information reviewed by the Commission
will be kept confidential subject to applicable law. In addition, the collection of information will
allow persons relying on Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2) to demonstrate that registration with the Commission
as municipal advisors was not required.

The Commission staff, extrapolating from the ratio of the estimated number of state or
municipal government entity clients in May 2010 to the number investment advisers with
less than $100 million in assets under management registered with the Commission as of
May 2010, estimates that, currently, state-registered investment advisers have approximately
8,620 clients that are state or municipal government entities. (2,770 (approximate number
of state or municipal government entity clients of investment advisers having less than $100
million in assets under management that were registered with the Commission as of May 3,
2010) ÷ 5,550 (number of investment advisers with less than $100 million in assets under
management that were registered with the Commission as of May 3, 2010)) × 17,259
(number of state-registered investment advisers as of January 1, 2013) = 8,613.95. This
estimate rounds to the nearest higher multiple of ten the number of clients of state-registered
investment advisers that are state or municipal government entities. The Commission
believes this estimate, which likely overestimates the number of clients from which stateregistered investment advisers would obtain written representations in reliance on this
exception, is inclusive of the clients of other persons who may seek to rely on this exception.
1618

8,620 (estimated number of clients from which written representation will be obtained) ×
0.25 hours (estimated time required to obtain the written representation) = 2,155 hours.

1619

700 hours (estimated time to draft a template document to use in obtaining the written
representation) + 2,155 hours (estimated time required to obtain the written representations
from clients) = 2,855 hours.
471

11.

Proceeds of Municipal Securities

The definition of “proceeds of municipal securities” includes a qualification similar to Rule
15Ba1-1(h)(2) pertaining to municipal escrow investments. Namely, in determining whether or not
funds to be invested constitute proceeds of municipal securities, a person may rely on
representations in writing made by a knowledgeable official of a municipal entity or obligated
person whose funds are to be invested regarding the nature of such funds, provided that the person
seeking to rely on such representations has a reasonable basis for such reliance. 1620
The Commission believes state-registered investment advisers with clients that are
municipal entities or certain pooled investment vehicles in which municipal entities invest are the
persons most likely to rely on Rule 15Ba1-1(m)(3) for reasonable reliance on representations related
to proceeds of municipal securities. The Commission notes that no entity is required to utilize Rule
15Ba1-1(m)(3) and that any efforts to do so are voluntary.
The Commission estimates that approximately 880 persons may seek to rely on the
exception for reasonable reliance on representations related to proceeds of municipal securities. 1621

1620

See Rule 15Ba1-1(m)(3). See also supra notes 363–365 and accompanying text.

1621

As discussed above, as of May 3, 2010, of the 5,550 investment advisers with less than $100
million in assets under management registered with the Commission, 211 (or 4%) had
clients that were state or municipal government entities. See supra note 1615. So as not to
double-count those investment advisers that had clients that were state or municipal
government entities, the Commission staff identified 5,339 investment advisers with less
than $100 million in assets under management that did not respond that they had clients that
were state or municipal government entities (5,550 – 211 = 5,339). Of those, responses to
Item 5.D(6) of Part 1 of Form ADV indicate that 713 investment advisers with less than
$100 million in assets under management that did not respond that they had clients that were
state or municipal government entities responded that they had some clients that were
pooled investment vehicles (other than registered investment companies). If the
Commission estimates that the same percentage of investment advisers advise pooled
investment vehicles (other than registered investment companies) with municipal entity
investors as investment advisers that advise state or municipal government entities (i.e.,
4%), 29 of these investment advisers would be advisers to pooled investment vehicles (other
than registered investment companies) with municipal entity investors (713 × 4% = 28.52).

The Commission estimates that each person seeking to rely on this exception would need
approximately 1 hour to draft a template document to use in obtaining the written representation,
amounting to an initial, one-time burden of approximately 880 hours. 1622
In addition, the Commission estimates that, once drafted, a person seeking to rely on this
exception would need approximately 15 minutes, or 0.25 hours, to obtain a written representation
from its client. The Commission estimates that persons that will seek to rely on this exception have
approximately 25,420 clients that are state or municipal government entities or that are pooled
investment vehicles (other than registered investment companies) with municipal entity
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that approximately 1% of the 5,550 investment
advisers with less than $100 million in assets under management registered with the
Commission as of May 3, 2010, had clients that were pooled investment vehicles (other than
registered investment companies) with municipal entity investors (29 ÷ 5,550 = 0.0052). As
of January 1, 2013, there were 17,259 state-registered investment advisers. Using the same
percentage, the Commission staff estimates that approximately 180 state-registered
investment advisers have clients that are pooled investment vehicles (other than registered
investment companies) with municipal entity investors. 17,259 (number of state-registered
investment advisers as of January 1, 2013) × 1% (estimated percentage of state-registered
investment advisers with clients that are pooled investment vehicles (other than registered
investment companies) with municipal entity investors) = 172.59.
In addition, as discussed above, the Commission staff estimates that 700 state-registered
investment advisers have clients that are state or municipal government entities. See supra
note 1615. Therefore, the Commission staff estimates that 880 state-registered investment
advisers have clients that are state or municipal government entities or that are pooled
investment vehicles (other than registered investment companies) with municipal entity
investors. 700 (estimated number of state-registered investment advisers with clients that
are state or municipal government entities) + 180 (estimated number of state-registered
investment advisers with clients that are pooled investment vehicles (other than registered
investment companies) with municipal entity investors) = 880. This estimate rounds to the
nearest higher multiple of ten the estimated number of state-registered investment advisers
that have clients that are state or municipal government entities and the estimated number of
state-registered investment advisers that have clients that are pooled investment vehicles
(other than registered investment companies) with municipal entity investors. The
Commission believes this estimate, which likely overestimates the number of stateregistered investment advisers who are likely to seek to rely on this exception, is inclusive of
other persons who may seek to rely on this exception.

1623

According to responses to Item 5.D(6) of Part 1 of Form ADV, as of May 3, 2010, 756
investment advisers registered with the Commission having less than $100 million in assets
under management indicated that they had approximately 5,400 clients that were pooled
investment vehicles (other than registered investment companies) with municipal entity
investors. This estimate includes those investment advisers that had clients that were state
or municipal government entities that were excluded from the estimate of the number of
investment advisers with clients that were pooled investment vehicles (other than registered
investment companies) with municipal entity investors. See supra note 1621. The
Commission staff used the midpoint of each range to estimate the number of such clients.
The Commission does not have exact data from 2010 on the number of clients of investment
advisers because Form ADV responses are in the format of a range (e.g., 26–100 clients). In
addition, the Commission does not have the information necessary to provide another point
estimate.
The Commission staff, extrapolating from the ratio of the estimated number of pooled
investment vehicle (other than registered investment company) clients with municipal entity
investors in May 2010 to the number investment advisers with less than $100 million in
assets under management registered with the Commission as of May 2010, estimates that,
currently, state-registered investment advisers now have approximately 16,800 clients that
are pooled investment vehicles (other than registered investment companies) with municipal
entity investors. (5,400 (approximate number of pooled investment vehicle (other than
registered investment company) clients with municipal entity investors of investment
advisers having less than $100 million in assets under management that were registered with
the Commission as of May 3, 2010) ÷ 5,550 (number of investment advisers with less than
$100 million in assets under management that were registered with the Commission as of
May 3, 2010)) × 17,259 (number of state-registered investment advisers as of January 1,
2013) = 16,792.54.
In addition, as discussed above, the Commission staff estimates that state-registered
investment advisers now have approximately 8,620 clients that are state or municipal
government entities. See supra note 1617. Therefore, the Commission staff estimates that
state-registered investment advisers now have 25,420 clients that are state or municipal
government entities or that are pooled investment vehicles (other than registered investment
companies) with municipal entity investors. 8,620 (estimated number of state or municipal
government entity clients of state-registered investment advisers) + 16,800 (estimated
number of clients of state-registered investment advisers that are pooled investment vehicle
(other than registered investment company) clients with municipal entity investors) =
25,420. This estimate rounds to the nearest higher multiple of ten the number of clients of
state-registered investment advisers that are state or municipal government entities or pooled
investment vehicles (other than registered investment companies) with municipal entity
clients. The Commission believes this estimate, which likely overestimates the number of
clients from which state-registered investment advisers would obtain written representations
in reliance on this exception, is inclusive of the clients of other persons who may seek to
rely on this exception.

will be 6,355 hours. 1624
Accordingly, the Commission estimates that the total initial burden for all persons to rely on
the exception for reasonable reliance on representations related to proceeds of municipal securities
will be 7,235 hours. 1625 Because the person seeking to rely on this exception only needs to obtain
the written representation one time, the Commission does not believe that there will be an ongoing
burden.
The Commission staff will use the collection of information under the qualification in the
definition of proceeds of municipal securities in its examinations and oversight program to
determine whether a person engaging in municipal advisory activities has failed to register with the
Commission. Any information reviewed by the Commission will be kept confidential subject to
applicable law. In addition, the collection of information will allow persons relying on the
exception for reasonable reliance on representations related to proceeds of municipal securities to
demonstrate that registration with the Commission as municipal advisors was not required.

In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the total initial one-time burden for all
respondents would be approximately 71,939 hours, 1626 while the total ongoing annual burden for all
respondents would be approximately 212,135 hours. 1627 The total initial outside cost for all

VIII. ECONOMIC ANALYSIS
A.

Overview

The Commission is sensitive to the costs and benefits of its rules. When engaging in
rulemaking that requires the Commission to consider or determine whether an action is necessary or
appropriate in the public interest, Section 3(f) of the Exchange Act requires the Commission to
consider, in addition to the protection of investors, whether the action will promote efficiency,

1630

36,935 hours (estimated initial burden for Form MA and MA-I) + 54 hours (estimated initial
burden for Form MA-NR filers) + 2,035 hours (estimated initial burden for all municipal
advisory firms to obtain written consents to service of process from each natural person
engaged in municipal advisory activities on their behalf) + 2,613 hours (estimated initial
burden for exemption when a municipal entity or obligated person is represented by an
independent registered municipal advisor) + 2,855 (estimated initial burden for exception for
reasonable reliance on representations related to municipal escrow investments) + 7,235
(estimated initial burden for exception for reasonable reliance on representations related to
proceeds of municipal securities) = 51,727 hours.

1631

3,200 hours (estimated annual burden for new Form MA and Form MA-I) + 12,053 hours
(estimated annual burden for Form MA and Form MA-I amendments) + 15 hours (estimated
annual burden for Form MA withdrawal) + 5 hours (estimated annual burden for Form MANR filers) + 165,620 hours (estimated annual burden for books and records requirement) +
195 hours (estimated ongoing burden for all municipal advisory firms to obtain written
consents to service of process from each natural person engaged in municipal advisory
activities on their behalf) + 2,193 (estimated annual burden for exemption when a municipal
entity or obligated person is represented by an independent registered municipal advisor) =
183,281 hours.

1632

$1,800 (estimated initial cost to hire outside counsel for providing opinion of counsel) +
$364,000 (estimated initial cost for review by outside counsel) = $365,800.

1633

$900 (estimated ongoing cost to hire outside counsel for providing opinion of counsel) +
$40,000 (estimated ongoing cost for all municipal advisory firms to hire outside counsel to
review their compliance with the requirements of the proposed rules and forms) = $40,900.

competition, and capital formation. 1634 In addition, Section 23(a)(2) of the Exchange Act requires
the Commission to consider the effects on competition of any rules the Commission adopts under
the Exchange Act and prohibits the Commission from adopting any rule that would impose a burden
on competition not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. 1635
In the Proposal, the Commission solicited comment on the costs and benefits of the
proposed rule, including the proposed definition of “municipal advisor” and related terms;
exclusions and exemptions of certain persons from the definition of municipal advisor; registration
forms; and recordkeeping requirements. 1636 The Commission also requested comment on the
competitive or anticompetitive effects, as well as efficiency and capital formation effects, of the
proposed rules and forms on any market participants. 1637 The Commission further encouraged
commenters to provide specific data and analysis in support of their views. 1638
The Commission received approximately 38 letters that addressed the Commission’s
estimates of the costs and benefits of the proposed rule. 1639 Several commenters opined generally

that municipal advisor registration as proposed would be overly burdensome and would impose
costs that would be detrimental to the commenters. Further, some commenters criticized the
Proposal’s economic analysis generally, stating that the expected costs of the permanent registration
regime were greatly underestimated. 1640 Other commenters asserted that the economic analysis was
“superficial” in that it related “almost entirely to filling out paperwork and hardly scratches the
surface of the true regulatory burden” 1641 and that the cost-benefit analysis was flawed because it
only addressed the labor costs directly associated with registration and recordkeeping. 1642 One
commenter stated that the Commission did not appear to consider adequately the costs of the
proposed rules, particularly implementation costs and costs incurred by municipal entities and
obligated persons as a result of increases in the price of advisory services. 1643

See SIFMA Letter I. In addition, the Commission’s Office of Inspector General prepared a
report analyzing the economic analysis of several rule proposals and suggested that the
Commission could have provided additional quantitative analyses to derive certain
qualitative predictions in connection with the Proposal. See Office of Inspector General,
Commission, Report of Review of Economic Analyses Performed by the Securities and
479

The Commission does not agree that the economic analysis in the Proposal was “superficial”
or that it focused solely on the registration and recordkeeping burdens. In developing the proposed
rules and forms, the Commission considered the costs and benefits of requiring persons to register
as municipal advisors, including the costs-benefit tradeoffs implicated in interpreting the definition
of “municipal advisor” and related terms, interpreting the statutory exclusions, and proposing
additional exemptions from the definition of municipal advisor. As stated in the Proposal, in
addition to the direct, out-of-pocket costs estimated for PRA purposes, the Commission considered
the economic costs of the proposed permanent registration regime. 1644 The Commission also stated
its belief that few, if any, of the costs would be passed on to municipal entities or obligated persons
in the form of higher fees. 1645
Similarly, in light of the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate persons that engage in
municipal advisory activities and data currently available to the Commission, in determining the
appropriate scope of the final rules and forms the Commission considered the types of persons that
should be regulated as municipal advisors under Section 15B of the Exchange Act. The
Commission has sought to tailor these rules so as not to impose unnecessary or inappropriate costs
and burdens on municipal advisors. As discussed throughout this release, partly in response to
comments, the Commission has modified the rules to minimize compliance burdens where
consistent with investor protection. In addition, as discussed below, where commenters identified
costs the Commission did not consider, the Commission has revised its economic analysis of the
final rules to take these costs into account.

As discussed above in Section II.A.2.b, prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act,
municipal advisors were largely unregulated as to their municipal advisory activities. Section 975
of the Dodd-Frank Act amended the Exchange Act to establish a federal regulatory regime that
requires municipal advisors to register with the Commission,1646 grants the MSRB regulatory
authority over municipal advisors, 1647 and imposes, among other things, a fiduciary duty on
municipal advisors when advising municipal entities. 1648 The Commission recognizes that while
the final rules, which define municipal advisor and related terms as well as prescribe the exclusions
and exemptions therefrom, are integral in determining which persons will be subject to the
regulatory requirements established by Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act, the definitions,
exclusions, and exemptions do not themselves establish the scope or nature of those substantive
requirements or their related costs and benefits. For example, although a municipal advisor is
subject to a fiduciary duty when advising a municipal entity client, 1649 the Commission is not
interpreting the scope or nature of such duty in this rulemaking. Instead, the Commission notes that
the Exchange Act provides that the MSRB shall prescribe means reasonably designed to prevent
acts, practices, and courses of business as are not consistent with a municipal advisor’s fiduciary
duty to its clients. 1650
The Commission anticipates that any additional rules that the Commission adopts to
implement the substantive requirements under Section 15B of the Exchange Act will be subject to
their own economic analysis. In addition, the Commission has direct oversight authority over the

MSRB, including the ability to approve or disapprove the MSRB’s rules. 1651
In adopting the final rules and forms, the Commission has considered the costs and benefits
that accrue from subjecting municipal advisors and municipal advisory activities to the regulatory
regime created by Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission refers to those costs and
benefits as “programmatic” costs and benefits. 1652 The programmatic costs and benefits have
informed the Commission’s decisions and actions in defining municipal advisor and related terms,
its interpretations of the statutory exclusions, and its decision to provide further exemptions from
the definition of municipal advisor as described throughout the release. The Commission has also
considered the costs that persons will incur to assess whether registration as a municipal advisor is
required (i.e., “assessment” costs), as well as the costs and benefits that will accrue from the
requirement that municipal advisors register with the Commission (i.e., “registration” costs and
benefits) and maintain the books and records as required by Rule 15Ba1-8 (i.e., “recordkeeping”
costs and benefits).
1651

Section 19(b) of the Exchange Act requires an SRO to file with the Commission any
proposed rule change, and provides that a proposed rule change may not take effect unless it
is approved by the Commission or becomes immediately effective upon filing pursuant to
Section 19(b)(3)(A) of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b). Section 3 of the Exchange
Act defines the term “self-regulatory organization” to include the MSRB. See 15 U.S.C.
78c(a)(26). Section 15B(b)(2)(C) of the Exchange Act requires, among other things, that the
rules of the MSRB not be designed to impose any burden on competition not necessary or
appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78o4(b)(2)(C). In addition, with respect to municipal advisors, MSRB rules shall not impose a
regulatory burden on small municipal advisors that is not necessary or appropriate in the
public interest and for the protection of investors, municipal entities, and obligated persons,
provided that there is robust protection of investors against fraud. See 15 U.S.C. 78o4(b)(2)(L)(iv).

1652

The Commission expects that the costs and benefits resulting from the municipal advisory
regulatory regime will likely accrue primarily at the programmatic level. See infra Sections
VIII.C.1 and VIII.D.2. To the extent appropriate given the purposes of Section 975 of the
Dodd-Frank Act to regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities and data
currently available to the Commission, the Commission has sought to mitigate the costs
entities will incur in connection with the registration and recordkeeping requirements.
482

In the discussion below, the Commission begins by identifying its motivation for adopting
the rules and forms and the baseline against which the Commission considers both the costs and
benefits, as well as the effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation, of the final rules
and forms. Next, the Commission discusses broad economic considerations that stem from the final
rules and forms, including the assessment costs. The Commission then discusses the potential
programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs and benefits that the final rules and forms
implicate, as well as the effects of the final rules and forms on efficiency, competition, and capital
formation. The discussion focuses on the Commission’s reasons for adopting the rules and forms,
the affected parties, and the costs and benefits of the rules and forms compared to the baseline (i.e.,
the temporary registration regime and the requirements imposed by the Dodd-Frank Act) and to
alternative courses of action the Commission has considered.
B.

Motivation for Rules and Forms

The rules and forms adopted today are designed to enhance the Commission’s oversight of
municipal advisors. 1653 The Commission believes the information provided pursuant to the final
rules and forms may aid municipal entities and obligated persons in choosing municipal advisors
that help municipal entities and obligated persons engage in issuances of municipal securities as
well as investments in municipal financial products. The motivation for the rules and forms, which
are discussed throughout this release, are summarized below.

1653

See supra notes 101–103 and accompanying text. According to a Senate Report related to
the Dodd-Frank Act, “[t]he $3 trillion municipal securities market is subject to less
supervision than corporate securities markets, and market participants generally have less
information upon which to base investment decisions. During the [financial] crisis, a
number of municipalities suffered losses from complex derivatives products that were
marketed by unregulated financial intermediaries.” See S. Rep. No. 111-176, at 38 (2010).
Accordingly, in response to the financial crisis that began in 2008, the Dodd-Frank Act
amended the Exchange Act to require “a range of municipal financial advisors to register
with the [Commission] and comply with regulations issued by the [MSRB].” See id.
483

First, the rules are designed to provide guidance related to the definition of municipal
advisor and exclusions therefrom, as well as to provide exemptions from the municipal advisor
regulatory regime. The statutory definition of municipal advisors is broad and includes persons that
have not previously been considered municipal financial advisors. 1654 There are also relevant
exclusions from the definition of municipal advisor that limit the scope of persons included in the
municipal advisor regulatory regime. The statute, however, leaves undefined or ambiguous certain
terms that are critical for market participants to discern who is or is not a municipal advisor.
Second, the final rules and forms establish a permanent mechanism for municipal advisors
to register with the Commission. Effective October 1, 2010, the Dodd-Frank Act requires the
establishment of a registration regime for municipal advisors. 1655 As discussed above, the
Commission adopted a temporary registration regime to allow municipal advisors to satisfy
temporarily the statutory registration requirement by submitting certain information electronically
through the Commission’s public website on Form MA-T. 1656 However, as that registration regime
was intended to be temporary, the Commission is now establishing a permanent registration regime.
Third, the final rules and forms will expand the amount of publicly available information
about municipal advisors, including conflicts of interest and disciplinary history. Because
municipal advisors had been largely unregulated as to their municipal advisory activities prior to the
Dodd-Frank Act, 1657 apart from information gathered through Form MA-T, there is little publicly
and centrally available information about municipal advisors. In addition, although the information
submitted on Form MA-T is publicly available on the Commission’s website, the final rules and

1654

See supra text accompanying notes 129–131.

1655

See Section 975(i) of the Dodd-Frank Act.

1656

See supra notes 107–110 and accompanying text.

1657

See supra notes 93–96 and accompanying text.
484

forms will require municipal advisors to disclose a greater amount of information, including
conflicts of interest and more information pertaining to disciplinary history. 1658 In addition, the
final rules and forms will increase the ability of municipal entities and obligated persons to become
more fully informed about municipal advisors in a more efficient manner, and thereby, at a lower
cost. 1659
Fourth, the permanent registration regime is designed to enhance the ability of securities
regulators to oversee municipal advisors, which could increase the willingness of market
participants, specifically municipal entities and obligated persons, to utilize municipal advisors.
The Commission staff will review applications for registration and by order grant registration or the
Commission will institute proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. 1660
Requiring municipal advisors to register with the Commission under the permanent registration
regime will allow the Commission to collect additional information about municipal advisors that
can be used to facilitate examination and enforcement efforts. The Commission believes that its
authority to examine and sanction municipal advisors for false and misleading statements submitted
by municipal advisors on Form MA or Form MA-I under the permanent registration regime,
including the additional information on Form MA that is not required on Form MA-I, may result in
increased reliability of the information, which could increase the willingness of municipal entities
and obligated persons to utilize municipal advisors. Municipal advisors, knowing that additional
information about their disciplinary histories must be disclosed pursuant to the final rules, may be
further incentivized to avoid engaging in misconduct.

1658

See infra Section VIII.D.1.a.

1659

Investors could also benefit to the extent they consider whether a municipal advisor was
involved in negotiating a municipal bond offering.

1660

See 78 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2).
485

Finally, the permanent registration regime will require municipal advisors to maintain books
and records regarding their municipal advisory activities. Recordkeeping requirements are a
familiar and important element of the Commission’s approach to investment adviser and brokerdealer regulation and are designed to maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission’s
examination program for regulated entities. Rule 15Ba1-8 will assist the Commission in evaluating
a municipal advisor’s compliance with Section 15B of the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations
thereunder, and MSRB rules.
C.

Economic Baseline

The rules and forms adopted today establish a permanent registration regime for municipal
advisors. The temporary registration regime, as described below, 1661 serves as the economic
baseline against which the costs and benefits, as well as the impact on efficiency, competition, and
capital formation, of the final rules and forms are measured. The discussion below includes a
description of the costs and benefits of the temporary registration regime (i.e., the programmatic and
registration costs and benefits) as well as approximate numbers of municipal advisors that would be
affected by the final rules and forms adopted today.
By enacting Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress created a federal regulatory
regime for municipal advisors that previously did not exist. In determining the economic baseline,
the Commission recognizes that, effective October 1, 2010, any person that meets the statutory
definition of municipal advisor 1662 is currently required to register with the Commission, unless a

1661

See infra notes 1662–1669 and accompanying text.

1662

Section 15B(e)(4) of the Exchange Act defines “municipal advisor” as a person (who is not
a municipal entity or an employee of a municipal entity) that (i) provides advice to or on
behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products
or the issuance of municipal securities, including advice with respect to the structure, timing,
terms, and other similar matters concerning such financial products or issues; or (ii)
undertakes a solicitation of a municipal entity. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(A). As discussed
486

statutory exclusion applies. 1663 As discussed above, the Commission adopted a temporary
registration regime to allow municipal advisors to satisfy temporarily the statutory registration
requirement by submitting certain information, including disciplinary history of associated
municipal advisor professionals, electronically through the Commission’s public website on Form
MA-T. 1664 The Commission does not impose registration or filing fees in connection with
municipal advisor registration, either under the temporary registration regime or the permanent
registration regime.
In addition to registering with the Commission, every municipal advisor is required to
comply with the requirements imposed by Section 15B of the Exchange Act as well as rules
established by the MSRB. For example, Section 15B(a)(5) prohibits a municipal advisor from
engaging in any fraudulent, deceptive, or manipulative acts or practices when providing advice to or
on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or
the issuance of municipal securities, or when undertaking a solicitation of a municipal entity or
obligated person. 1665 A municipal advisor is also deemed to have a fiduciary duty to its municipal
entity clients. 1666

above, the statutory definition of municipal advisor is broad and includes persons that
traditionally have not been considered to be municipal financial advisors. See supra text
accompanying notes 129–131. Specifically, the definition of municipal advisor includes
“financial advisors, guaranteed investment contract brokers, third-party marketers,
placement agents, solicitors, finders, and swap advisors” that engage in municipal advisory
activities. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(B).
1663

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(1)(B); 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)(C).

1664

See supra notes 107–110 and accompanying text. See also Form MA-T, Glossary of Terms
(defining “associated municipal advisory professional”). Today, in a separate release, the
Commission is extending the expiration date of the temporary registration regime to
December 31, 2014. See supra note 115 and accompanying text.

1665

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(5).

1666

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(1). Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act did not define the contours
of a municipal advisor’s fiduciary duty to its municipal entity clients. Pursuant to Section
487

The Dodd-Frank Act also provided the MSRB with authority to propose and adopt rules
related to municipal advisors. 1667 The MSRB has already adopted some rules for municipal
advisors. 1668 For example, MSRB Rule G-17 requires municipal advisors to deal fairly with all
persons and not engage in any deceptive, dishonest, or unfair practice. In addition, prior to
engaging in municipal advisory activities, a municipal advisor must register with the MSRB and
pay a $100 initial fee and a $500 annual fee. 1669
1. Programmatic Costs and Benefits of the Temporary Registration Regime
Subjecting municipal advisors to the requirements of the temporary registration regime has a
number of programmatic costs and benefits. Municipal advisors may have incurred, and would
continue to incur, costs to comply with the standards and rules discussed above that are currently
applicable to municipal advisors by statute or MSRB rules. 1670 In addition, as discussed above,

15B(b)(2)(L)(i) of the Exchange Act, the MSRB is authorized to prescribe means reasonably
designed to prevent acts, practices, and courses of business as are not consistent with a
municipal advisor’s fiduciary duty to its clients. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(L)(i). As
discussed above, the Commission has direct oversight authority over the MSRB, including
the ability to approve or disapprove the MSRB’s rules. See supra note 1651 and
accompanying text. For purposes of this economic analysis, Congress’s imposition of a
fiduciary duty on municipal advisors under Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act is part of the
baseline.
1667

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b).

1668

Although the MSRB has adopted some rules for municipal advisors, the MSRB has yet to
detail many of the requirements that will apply to municipal advisors. For example, the
MSRB has yet to establish standards of training, experience, competence, and other
qualifications (see 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(A)); prescribe recordkeeping requirements (see 15
U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(G)); provide continuing education requirements (see 15 U.S.C. 78o4(b)(2)(L)(ii)); or provide professional standards (see 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(L)(iii)).

1669

See MSRB Rule A-12 and MSRB Rule A-14. Section 15B(b)(2)(J) of the Exchange Act
permits the MSRB to require municipal advisors to pay reasonable fees and charges. See 15
U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(J). Other MSRB rules applicable to municipal advisors include MSRB
Rules G-5 (Disciplinary Actions by Appropriate Regulatory Agencies; Remedial Notices by
Registered Securities Associations), G-40 (Electronic Mail Contacts), and A-15 (requiring
that a municipal advisor notify the MSRB if it ceases operations).

1670

See supra notes 1665–1669 and accompanying text.
488

municipal advisors that have registered with the MSRB have incurred fees assessed by the MSRB
and would continue to incur fees in each year registered with the MSRB. 1671
Municipal advisors may also have incurred, and would continue to incur, costs in association
with examinations by Commission staff. Section 15B of the Exchange Act authorizes the
Commission, or its designee, to conduct periodic examinations of municipal advisors for
compliance with the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and the rules of the
MSRB. 1672 Since the beginning of fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2013, OCIE completed 19
examinations of municipal advisors. The time and cost involved in an examination varies
depending on the size of the municipal advisor; whether the municipal advisor was also registered
with the Commission as a broker-dealer and/or investment adviser; and whether Commission staff
identified additional risks posed by the municipal advisor while onsite. 1673
Municipal advisors, faced with the costs imposed by the temporary registration regime, may
have responded in a number of ways. Municipal advisors that viewed the costs as too burdensome,
or those with extensive disciplinary histories, may have decided to discontinue engaging in
activities that would require them to register as municipal advisors (hereinafter referred to as
“exiting the market”). Other municipal advisors may have determined to consolidate with other
municipal advisory firms to better manage the costs associated with the regulatory regime. Still
others may have passed the additional costs of being a registered municipal advisor on to municipal
entities and obligated persons in the form of higher fees. 1674 In addition, some persons that may

1671

See supra note 1669 and accompanying text.

1672

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(E); 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(7)(A)(iii). See also supra note 1386 and
accompanying text.

1673

The onsite portion of an examination lasts approximately three business days.

1674

The Commission recognized in the Proposal that the cost of becoming subject to registration
for the first time could lead some municipal advisors that are not particularly active to leave
489

have otherwise newly entered the municipal advisor market may have decided not to enter the
market.
The Commission, however, is unable to estimate the number of municipal advisors that may
have exited the market or consolidated with other municipal advisory firms as a result of the
temporary registration regime because Form MA-T does not require a municipal advisor
withdrawing from registration on Form MA-T to indicate the reasons for the withdrawal. 1675
Further, the Commission does not have the information necessary to estimate how many municipal
advisors may have chosen to exit the market after the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act but prior to
the commencement of the temporary registration regime because such data is not currently available
to the Commission or otherwise publicly available. Similarly, the Commission is unable to estimate
the extent to which municipal advisors may have passed on to their clients the costs incurred to
comply with the temporary registration regime because such data is not currently available to the
Commission or otherwise publicly available. Although commenters asserted that such costs could
the business. See Proposal, 76 FR at 876. The Commission received several comment
letters that asserted the costs of the regulatory regime could cause municipal advisors to exit
the market, consolidate with other firms, or pass the costs incurred to comply with the
regime on to clients. See, e.g., Public FA Letter (“The regulations imposed on small firms
like ours could be time consuming and costly enough to either put us out of business or
cause small firms to merge with larger firms or to create larger firms.”); Fieldman Rolapp
Letter (“Most firms, regardless of revenue amount, are small businesses with insufficient
margins to bear excessive regulatory burden”); Ranson Financial Consultants Letter (“Our
options [in relation to compliance costs] may include joining another firm or simply go out
of business”); UFS Bancorp Letter (“[T]he Proposed Rules will have economic costs. These
will either come out of the bottom lines of firms or be passed along to municipal clients in
the form of fee increases.”).
The Commission is unable to estimate the number of persons who may have decided not to
enter the municipal advisor market because such data is not currently available to the
Commission or otherwise publicly available. However, the Commission notes that, as
discussed above, approximately 205 municipal advisers filed an initial Form MA-T in 2011
and approximately 115 filed an initial Form MA-T in 2012. See supra Section VII.C.
1675

As discussed above, approximately 22 municipal advisors withdrew from registration on
Form MA-T in 2011 and 24 withdrew from registration in 2012. See supra Section VII.D.4.
490

be passed on to clients, 1676 commenters did not provide specific figures in this regard, making it
difficult to evaluate these assertions.
Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act includes new investor protections, including protections
for municipal entities and obligated persons when issuing, or investing the proceeds of, municipal
securities. 1677 For example, municipal advisors are now subject to, among other things, a fiduciary
duty to any municipal entity clients and are prohibited from engaging in any act, practice, or course
of business which is not consistent with that fiduciary duty. 1678 These investor protections may
have incentivized municipal advisors not to engage in misconduct. As discussed above, Section
15B provides the Commission with explicit authority to oversee the activities of municipal advisors,
and since the beginning of fiscal year 2012 through fiscal year 2013, OCIE completed 19
examinations of municipal advisors. 1679 Similarly, Section 15B enhances municipal entity and
obligated person protections by providing the Commission with explicit authority to bring
disciplinary actions against municipal advisors for misconduct, including the ability to censure,
place limitations on the activities, functions, or operations, suspend for a period not exceeding
twelve months, or revoke the registration of any municipal advisor. 1680
2. Registration Costs and Benefits of the Temporary Registration Regime
In the Temporary Registration Rule Release, the Commission identified certain costs and

See supra note 1674.

1677

See supra note 1653 and accompanying text.

1678

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(1).

See supra notes 1672–1673 and accompanying text. The onsite portion of an examination
lasts approximately three business days.

1680

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(2). The Commission also has the authority to censure or place
limitations on the activities or functions of any person associated with a municipal advisor
or to suspend or bar any such person from being associated with a municipal advisor. See
15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(4); Rule 15Bc4-1.
491

benefits of the temporary registration regime. Municipal advisors that have registered with the
Commission on Form MA-T have incurred costs to gather the information required to complete the
form and submit that information through the Commission’s website, as well as to amend Form
MA-T as necessary. In the Temporary Registration Rule Release, the Commission estimated that
the total labor cost for all municipal advisors to complete Form MA-T would be approximately
$735,000. 1681 The Commission also estimated that the total annual labor cost for all municipal
advisors to amend Form MA-T would be approximately $147,000. 1682 In addition, the Commission
estimated that the total cost for all municipal advisors to hire outside counsel to review their
compliance with the requirements of Rule 15Ba2-6T and Form MA-T would be approximately
$400,000. 1683
In the Temporary Registration Rule Release, the Commission recognized the possibility that
the cost of registering could be passed on to municipal entities in the form of higher fees. However,
the Commission anticipated that any increase in municipal advisory fees attributable to the
temporary registration regime would be minimal given the relatively small magnitude of these costs
and the large number of municipal entity issuers. 1684
Subjecting municipal advisors to the requirements of the temporary registration regime may
have had a number of benefits. The temporary registration regime may have enabled municipal
entities and obligated persons to become better informed about a municipal advisor, including
1681

See Temporary Registration Rule Release, 75 FR at 54474 (calculating the estimated total
labor cost for all municipal advisors to complete Form MA-T). This estimate includes all of
the time necessary to research, evaluate, and gather all of the information requested in Form
MA-T and all of the time necessary to complete and submit the form. See id. at 54473.

disciplinary history of associated municipal advisor professionals, 1685 by accessing and reviewing
the municipal advisor’s Form MA-T on the Commission’s website. In addition, because
information submitted on Form MA-T is consolidated in a single online location, municipal entities
and obligated persons may have been able to access this information more efficiently, and thereby,
at a lower cost. 1686 In addition, under the temporary registration regime, municipal advisors are
required to disclose disciplinary history on Form MA-T, which disclosure may further deter
municipal advisors from engaging in misconduct. As discussed in the Proposal, the information
currently required by Form MA-T is not reviewed by the Commission or its staff prior to
registration, although the Commission retains full authority to review such information and examine
any registered municipal advisor at any time. 1687
3. Municipal Advisor Market
The discussion below includes approximate numbers of municipal advisors that would be
affected by the final rules and forms adopted today. As discussed above, according to MA-T data
as of December 31, 2012, there were approximately 1,110 Form MA-T registrants. Of these Form
MA-T registrants, as of December 31, 2012, approximately 901 were also registered as municipal
advisors with the MSRB, as they are required to do prior to engaging in municipal advisory

1685

See id. at 54469. See also supra note 1664 and accompanying text.

1686

See Temporary Registration Rule Release, 75 FR at 54474. The Commission is unable to
estimate the amount of time and money municipal entities may have saved by reviewing
Form MA-T rather than engaging in an RFP process or searching other regulatory
documents because such data is not currently available to the Commission or otherwise
publicly available. The Commission believes that the ability to access information,
including disciplinary history, on municipal advisors in a single location benefits municipal
entities and obligated persons by reducing the need to search for other regulatory documents
of those municipal advisors that are registered, or have associated persons that are
registered, in another capacity. In addition, information submitted on Form MA-T may be
the only source of information about some municipal advisors.

1687

See Proposal, 76 FR at 860. See also infra note 1705 and accompanying text.
493

activities. 1688 For the reasons discussed below, the Commission believes that the number of Form
MA-T registrants may not be an accurate representation of the number of municipal advisors and
that MSRB data represents a better basis on which to estimate the number of municipal advisors
active in the market.
The Commission believes that a number of persons, recognizing that the Commission does
not impose any fees for registration, may have registered with the Commission as municipal
advisors out of an initial overabundance of caution. 1689 Although some current Form MA-T
registrants may not have registered with the MSRB because of uncertainty regarding the scope of
the temporary registration regime, others may have determined in the intervening time after October
1, 2010, that registration with the MSRB was not required because they were not engaging in
municipal advisory activities. The Commission staff understands based on discussions with market
participants that these Form MA-T registrants may have retained Commission registration because
there are no associated fees to maintain such registration. 1690 Accordingly, based on the MSRB
registration data, the Commission now estimates that 910 municipal advisors are currently active in
the municipal advisor market. 1691
MSRB data and MA-T data also provide information regarding the types of services

1688

The Commission obtained this estimate by comparing the list of MSRB registrants to the
Commission’s list of Form MA-T registrants as of December 31, 2012.

1689

As discussed above, prior to engaging in municipal advisory activities, a municipal advisor
must register with the MSRB and pay a $100 initial fee and a $500 annual fee. See supra
note 1669 and accompanying text.

1690

The Commission staff understands that some municipal advisors may have maintained Form
MA-T registration instead of withdrawing to wait and see whether registration would be
required under the permanent registration regime, while others may not have realized they
could withdraw or may have determined not to withdraw for other reasons.

1691

This estimate rounds to the nearest higher multiple of ten the number of municipal advisors
that are registered with the MSRB to engage in municipal advisory activities.
494

provided by registered municipal advisors. 1692 According to MSRB data, 1693 as of December 31,
2012, 682 municipal advisors identified themselves as financial advisors; 192 identified themselves
as guaranteed investment contract brokers or advisors; 272 identified themselves as placement
agents; 159 identified themselves as solicitors or finders; 246 identified themselves as swap or
derivative advisors; 135 identified themselves as third-party marketers; and 201 indicated they
provide other services. 1694 In addition, according to MA-T data, as of December 31, 2012, 226
municipal advisors were also registered with the Commission as broker-dealers; 39 were also
registered with the Commission as investment advisers; and 65 were registered with the
Commission as both broker-dealers and investment advisers. As discussed above, Form MA-T
1692

The three principal types of municipal advisors are: (1) financial advisors, including, but
not limited to, brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers already registered with the
Commission, that provide advice to municipal entities with respect to their issuance of
municipal securities and their use of municipal financial products (“municipal financial
advisors”); (2) investment advisers that advise municipal entities on the investment of public
monies, including the proceeds of municipal securities (“municipal investment advisers”);
and (3) third-party marketers and solicitors (“solicitors”). For purposes of this economic
analysis, the Commission uses these terms to describe these distinct types of professionals
separately, while using the term “municipal advisor” to describe all municipal advisors
generally. As discussed above, for clarity, the Commission notes that financial advisors as
referred to herein also include swap advisors, including some that are registered with the
CFTC or the SEC in other capacities, that provide advice to municipal entities on their use
of municipal financial products.

1693

Although municipal advisors registering with the MSRB identify the types of services they
provide, the Commission staff understands that the MSRB does not validate this
information.

1694

Some municipal advisors registered with the MSRB provide more than one type of service.
According to MA-T data, as of December 31, 2012, 733 municipal advisors provided advice
concerning the issuance of municipal securities; 496 provided advice concerning the
investment of the proceeds of municipal securities; 322 provided advice concerning
guaranteed investment contracts; 365 provided the recommendation and/or brokerage of
municipal escrow investments; 365 provided advice concerning the use of municipal
derivatives (e.g., swaps); 383 were third-party marketers, placement agents, solicitors, or
finders; 470 provided the preparation of feasibility studies, tax or revenue projections, or
similar products in connection with offerings or potential offerings of municipal securities;
and 253 provided other services. The Commission staff has not validated the information
provided on Form MA-T.
495

requires municipal advisors to disclose any disciplinary history of associated municipal advisor
professionals. 1695 According to MA-T data, as of December 31, 2012, 169 registered municipal
advisors had disclosed prior disciplinary history.
The Commission and the MSRB do not capture data regarding the concentration 1696 of the
municipal advisor market. The Commission staff has evaluated data available in Thomson Reuters’
SDC Platinum database (“SDC Platinum Database”) 1697 to analyze concentration. To determine the
number of issue offerings in 2012, the Commission staff assumed that bonds issued on the same day
by the same issuer were part of the same issue. 1698 Under this assumption, and removing any deals
for which SDC Platinum Database did not record a CUSIP, the Commission staff found that, in
2012, there were 13,288 municipal bond deals, of which approximately 8,237 used a financial
advisor and 3,074 did not use a financial advisor. SDC Platinum Database was not able to provide
information regarding the use of a financial advisor for the other 1,977 municipal bond deals. The
8,237 municipal bond deals that used a financial advisor were advised by approximately 318
different financial advisors, with the 50 most-active advisors advising approximately 80% of the
advised deals, or approximately 74% by dollar volume issued of advised deals.
D.

Analysis of Final Rules and Forms

Below, the Commission addresses the costs and benefits of the final rules and forms against
the context of the economic baseline defined above, both in terms of the specific changes from the
baseline as well as in terms of overall impact on the municipal advisor market. The Commission
1695

See supra note 1664 and accompanying text.

1696

Concentration refers to how many municipal advisors handle a significant percentage of
municipal advisory business.

1697

SDC Platinum is a database that tracks, among other things, information on municipal bond
issues, including new municipal bond issues, municipal private placements, and municipal
reoffering issues, but not remarketing issues.

1698

This excludes deals where SDC does not record a CUSIP or an offering date.
496

also addresses the costs and benefits of the requirements that municipal advisors register with the
Commission and maintain the books and records required by Rule 15Ba1-8. In considering these
costs, benefits, and impacts, the Commission addresses, among other things, comments received,
modifications made to the proposed rules and forms, and reasonable alternatives, where applicable.
At the outset, the Commission notes that, where possible, it has attempted to quantify the
costs, benefits, and effects on efficiency, competition, and capital formation expected to result from
adopting these rules and forms. In many cases, however, the Commission is unable to quantify the
economic effects because it lacks the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate. For
example, the Commission does not have the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate
of the willingness of municipal entities and obligated persons to utilize municipal advisors and
improvements in investor protection. In general, secondary data regarding the municipal advisory
market that would assist the Commission in producing quantitative analyses are largely unavailable,
and, other than the academic papers cited in the Proposal and this release, few studies on municipal
securities have attempted to undertake the efforts to collect such secondary data. Additionally, the
costs incurred by a municipal advisor to comply with the final rules and forms generally will
depend on its size and the complexity of its business activities. Because the size and complexity of
municipal advisors vary significantly, 1699 their costs to comply with the final rules and forms could
also vary significantly.
The Commission received many comments on the proposed rules and forms, and has
incorporated many of the suggested alternatives into the final rules and forms and rejected, after
careful consideration, other suggested alternatives, as fully discussed in Section III. The policy
choices made to accept or reject the alternatives suggested by the commenters have been informed

1699

See supra note 1694 and accompanying text.
497

by the costs and benefit considerations. In particular, as stated above, the Commission is mindful of
the programmatic, assessment, registration, and recordkeeping costs associated with the municipal
advisor regulatory regime.
1. Broad Economic Considerations
a.

Benefits of the Final Rules and Forms

The Commission believes that the final rules and forms should result in a number of
benefits, including those discussed throughout this economic analysis. As discussed below, the
Commission has sought to subject to the municipal advisor regulatory regime those persons that
should be regulated as municipal advisors in light of the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate
those persons that engage in municipal advisory activities. The final rules and forms should
increase the amount of publicly available information about municipal advisors and enhance the
ability of securities regulators to oversee municipal advisors.
The permanent registration regime will increase the amount of information available about
municipal advisors relevant to the baseline. 1700 The forms will require municipal advisors to
provide information about their businesses, including disciplinary histories and potential conflicts of
interest (as well as information that may be useful in assessing conflicts of interest), beyond what is
required to be disclosed on Form MA-T. Although much of the additional information required by
Form MA is already publicly available with respect to municipal advisors that are already registered
with the Commission as investment advisers or broker-dealers, many municipal advisors that are
not registered with the Commission will make this type of information publicly available for the
first time. 1701 In addition, while municipal advisors are required to disclose disciplinary history for

1700

As discussed below, the permanent registration regime will also impose registration and
recordkeeping costs on municipal advisors. See infra Section VIII.D.3–4.

1701

For example, little is currently known about solicitors, and disciplinary histories and
498

some associated persons on Form MA-T, municipal advisors will be required to disclose on Form
MA disciplinary history for all associated persons. 1702
To the extent municipal entities and obligated persons consider disciplinary history and
conflict of interest information important in selecting a municipal advisor, the permanent
registration regime may reduce selection of municipal advisors that have been the subject of
disciplinary actions or whose activities or affiliations create, or have the potential to create, conflicts
of interest. Moreover, municipal advisors, knowing that more-detailed disciplinary history must
now be disclosed, may be further incentivized to avoid engaging in misconduct (or may exit the
market). 1703 In addition, municipal advisors, knowing that conflicts of interest must now be
disclosed, may also be more likely to avoid associations that create conflicts of interest or may be
more likely to avoid recommending financial intermediaries or investments for which conflicts of
interest might be present. The increased dissemination of information regarding disciplinary history
and conflicts of interest may lead to improved quality-based competition among municipal advisors
to the extent municipal advisors rely on this information in the municipal advisor selection process.

conflicts of interest about many solicitors will be disclosed for the first time.
1702

Form MA-T requires disclosure of disciplinary information of a subgroup of associated
persons who are closely associated with a municipal advisor’s municipal advisory activities
(i.e., those who are primarily engaged in a municipal advisor’s municipal advisory activities,
have supervisory responsibilities over those primarily engaged in municipal advisory
activities, are engaged in day-to-day management of the conduct of a municipal advisor’s
municipal advisory activities, or are responsible for executive management of the municipal
advisor).

1703

As discussed below, the Commission is unable to estimate the number of municipal advisors
that have exited the market due to the temporary registration regime or that will exit the
market due the permanent registration regime because Form MA-T does not require a
municipal advisor withdrawing from registration from Form MA-T to indicate the reasons
for withdrawal. See infra Section VIII.D.1.b. As a result of the requirement that municipal
advisors disclose disciplinary histories, those municipal advisors that may discontinue
activity in the market may include disproportionately more municipal advisors with
disciplinary records. Further, such public disclosure may deter municipal advisors that have
significant disciplinary histories from entering the market.
499

The Commission also believes that the permanent registration regime will enhance the
ability of the Commission and other regulators to oversee the conduct of municipal advisors, as
contemplated by the Dodd-Frank Act, which could increase the willingness of municipal entities
and obligated persons to utilize municipal advisors. 1704 The Commission staff will review
applications for registration and by order grant registration or the Commission will institute
proceedings to determine whether registration should be denied. 1705 Because Rule 15Ba1-2
provides that both Form MA and Form MA-I constitute a “report” within the meaning of Sections
15B(c), 17(a), 18(a), 32(a) (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c), 78q(a), 78r(a), 78ff(a)) and other applicable
provisions of the Exchange Act, it is unlawful for a municipal advisor to willfully make or cause to
be made, a false or misleading statement of material fact or omit to state a material fact in Form MA
and Form MA-I. The Commission believes that a municipal advisor’s knowledge of the
Commission’s authority to examine the municipal advisor and to sanction the municipal advisor for
false and misleading statements could help ensure the reliability of the information submitted by
municipal advisors under the permanent registration regime, which could increase the willingness of
municipal entities and obligated persons to utilize municipal advisors.
In addition, the Commission’s examination staff will be able to use the information provided
in Form MA and Form MA-I as a tool to prioritize and plan examinations. By securing information
regarding municipal advisors through EDGAR, relative to the baseline, Commission staff should be
able to more efficiently retrieve and analyze the data it needs to carry out its mission with respect to
municipal advisory activities effectively, such as by identifying potentially violative activities and
risky municipal advisory firms. 1706 Moreover, Rule 15Ba1-8 will assist the Commission in
1704

See 78 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(2).

1706

In addition, municipal entities, obligated persons, and other market participants will be able

evaluating a municipal advisory firm’s compliance with Section 15B of the Exchange Act, 1707 rules
and regulations promulgated thereunder, and MSRB rules. By requiring that municipal advisory
firms maintain specific types of information, the final rules will enhance the ability of regulators to
perform more-efficient inspections and examinations and increase the likelihood of identifying
improper conduct at earlier stages in an inspection or examination. In addition, municipal advisory
firms may benefit from recordkeeping practices developed pursuant to the requirements of Rule
15Ba1-8 by having their operations interrupted for shorter time periods in response to inspections or
examinations.
The requirement that a non-resident municipal advisor file Form MA-NR and obtain an
opinion of counsel in connection with the municipal advisor’s initial application, as well as annual
updates to Form MA-NR and the opinion of counsel, will also help to enhance the Commission’s
oversight of non-resident municipal advisors, which may promote the willingness of municipal
entities and obligated persons to utilize municipal advisors. The Commission believes that
requiring Form MA-NR and an opinion of counsel could improve the Commission’s oversight of
municipal advisors by: minimizing any legal or logistical obstacles that the Commission may
encounter when attempting to effect service; conserving Commission resources; and avoiding
potential conflicts of law. The requirement that a non-resident municipal advisory firm obtain an
opinion of counsel that it can provide access to books and records and can be subject to inspection
and examination will allow the Commission to better evaluate and monitor a municipal advisory

to perform their own analyses using EDGAR and provide some market monitoring.
Information submitted on Form MA and Form MA-I will be tagged in XML format, which
may improve the Commission staff’s ability to retrieve and analyze data. In addition,
tagging information in XML format could allow municipal entities and obligated persons to
perform better research into municipal advisors, which could help improve efficiency if this
increased monitoring results in greater market discipline of municipal advisors.

firm’s ability to meet the requirements of registration. These benefits will be the same across all
types of municipal advisor – municipal financial advisors, municipal investment advisers, and
solicitors.
To the extent that the registration and recordkeeping requirements result in more-effective
examinations, the enhanced ability to monitor municipal advisors could lead to increased efficiency
relative to the baseline. Enhanced oversight of municipal advisors due to the registration and
recordkeeping requirements could improve capital formation relative to the baseline to the extent
enhanced oversight increases the willingness of municipal entities and obligated persons to utilize
municipal advisors, and municipal entities and obligated persons, in turn, issue more debt or debt
with better terms. 1708 To the extent that investors decide to make greater investments in the
municipal securities market, efficiency could increase as capital is put to a more-efficient use.
b. Potential Changes to the Municipal Advisor Market
The Commission recognizes that the final rules and forms may result in changes to the
municipal advisor market. As discussed below, municipal advisors will incur programmatic costs
as a result of the statutory municipal advisor regulatory regime. 1709 In addition, municipal advisors
will incur the registration and recordkeeping costs that result from the final rules and forms. 1710 The
Commission recognizes that, as a result of these costs, municipal advisors may decide to exit the
market, consolidate with other firms, or pass the costs on to municipal entities and obligated persons
1708

See infra notes 1830–1831 and accompanying text. Investor willingness to invest in
municipal bond offerings may increase to the extent that the municipal entity issuing bonds
used a municipal advisor and investors understand and consider the benefits of municipal
advisor registration.

1709

See infra Section VIII.D.2. The Commission expects that the costs and benefits resulting
from the statutory municipal advisory regulatory regime will likely accrue primarily at the
programmatic level, and that many of these costs are accounted for in the baseline. See
supra Sections VIII.C.1.

1710

See infra Section VIII.D.3–4.
502

in the form of higher fees.
Some municipal advisors currently registered with the Commission may decide to exit the
market or reduce services provided to municipal entities or obligated persons because of the costs
associated with the final rules and forms. One commenter believed that the Commission did not
address in the Proposal potential public costs from a reduction of services to municipal entities. 1711
While the Commission recognizes that some municipal advisors may exit the market as a result of
the costs associated with the final rules and forms relative to the baseline, the Commission believes
municipal advisors may exit the market for a number of reasons, including business reasons
separate from reasons involving the costs associated with the final rules and forms. The
Commission anticipates that some exits will result from municipal advisors’ unwillingness to
disclose required information to the Commission. The Commission believes that municipal
advisors that have been subject to past disciplinary actions may decide to exit the market rather than
disclose that information, and that the departure of such “bad actors” could improve the quality of
the market for municipal advisory services and, therefore, benefit municipal entities and obligated
persons. 1712
In addition, the costs associated with the final rules and forms relative to the baseline may
lead some municipal advisors to consolidate with other municipal advisors, rather than exit the

1711

See Financial Services Roundtable Letter (“Given the burden of registering as a municipal
advisor, particularly for a small bank, we believe that there is a likelihood that smaller banks
that offer a few products to a small number of municipal entities providing services in their
communities would elect to discontinue serving municipal entities.”). See also Public FA
Letter; Ranson Financial Consultants Letter.

1712

The Commission recognizes that municipal advisors that exit the market would lose any
revenue that would have accrued from providing municipal advisory services. Municipal
entities and obligated persons could benefit, however, from not having municipal advisors
who do not want to comply with the regulatory regime or other bad actors in the market.
503

market. 1713 For example, some municipal advisors may determine to consolidate with other
municipal advisors in order to benefit from economies of scale (e.g., by leveraging existing
compliance resources of a larger firm) rather than to incur separately the costs associated with the
final rules and forms.
The Commission, however, is unable to estimate the number of municipal advisors that have
exited the market or consolidated with other firms as a result of the temporary registration regime
because Form MA-T does not require a municipal advisor withdrawing from registration on Form
MA-T to indicate the reasons for withdrawal. Similarly, the Commission is unable to estimate the
number of municipal advisors that will exit the market or consolidate with other firms as a result of
the final rules and forms. In addition, the Commission is not aware of any municipal advisors
exiting the market or consolidating with other firms as a result of the temporary registration regime.
The Commission recognizes that some of the municipal advisors that may exit the market
could be small entity municipal advisors that exit the market for financial reasons and that such
exits from the market may lead to a reduced pool of municipal advisors. In the Final Regulatory
Flexibility Analysis below, after comparing the estimated registration costs with a small municipal
advisory firm’s annual revenue, the Commission discusses alternatives considered to accomplish
the objectives of the permanent registration regime while minimizing any significant adverse impact
on small municipal advisors. 1714 As discussed in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis, the
requirements under the final rules and forms are designed to impose only those burdens necessary to
accomplish the objectives of the Dodd-Frank Act. In addition, as discussed below, the Commission
1713

See, e.g., Public FA Letter (“The regulations imposed on small firms like ours could be time
consuming and costly enough to either put us out of business or cause small firms to merge
with larger firms or to create larger firms.”); Ranson Financial Consultants Letter (“Our
options [in relation to compliance costs] may include joining another firm or simply go out
of business”).

1714

See infra Section IX.D.
504

believes that the market for municipal advisory services is likely to remain competitive despite the
potential exit of municipal advisors, including small entity municipal advisors. 1715
Some municipal advisors may pass the costs associated with the rules and forms on to
municipal entities and obligated persons in the form of higher fees. For example, one commenter
argued that the rules will have economic costs that will either come out of the bottom lines of firms
or be passed along to municipal clients in the form of fee increases. 1716 Although commenters
asserted that such costs could be passed on to clients, 1717 commenters did not provide specific
estimates, and the Commission does not have the information necessary to provide a reasonable
estimate of the extent to which municipal advisors may pass costs on to clients given the lack of
publicly available information on municipal advisory fees.
The Commission believes that the market for municipal advisory services is likely to remain
competitive despite the potential exit of municipal advisors, consolidation of municipal advisors, or
lack of new entrants into the market. 1718 As discussed above, the Commission estimates that
approximately 100 new entrants to the market will register on Form MA each year 1719 and that
approximately 30 municipal advisors will withdraw from Form MA registration each year. 1720
Because the Commission expects that new entrants to the municipal advisor market will exceed
departures therefrom, the Commission does not expect exits from the market or consolidation of

1717

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter I; UFS Bancorp Letter.

1718

The Commission recognizes that the requirements to register with the Commission and
maintain certain books and records, and the associated costs, will increase the burdens on
those seeking to enter the municipal advisor market, which may negatively impact
competition in the municipal advisor market.

1719

See supra note 1470 and accompanying text.

See supra note 1531 and accompanying text.
505

municipal advisors to result in reduced competition. 1721 In addition, the level of competition in the
existing markets for each type of municipal advisor – municipal financial advisors, municipal
investment advisers, and solicitors – suggests, based on data available to the Commission,1722 that
exits from the market, consolidation, or lack of new entrants into the market are unlikely to lead to
market concentration levels at which the remaining municipal advisors are able to increase prices
significantly. 1723 Accordingly, the Commission does not expect the departure of municipal advisors
from the market to result in a significant increase in the cost of municipal advisory services.
In addition, the registration and recordkeeping costs should not impact efficiency or capital
formation because those costs are unlikely to reduce the utilization of municipal advisors by
municipal entities and obligated persons. The Commission believes that any increase in municipal
advisory fees attributable to the registration and recordkeeping costs of the permanent registration
regime will be minimal given the average cost per municipal advisory firm 1724 and the relatively
small magnitude of these costs compared to the large number of municipal entity issuers per

1721

The Commission does not expect an effect on capital formation due to new entrants to the
municipal advisor market or from exits from the market.

1722

As indicated above, as of December 31, 2012, approximately 901 municipal advisors
registered with the Commission on Form MA-T were also registered with the MSRB, as
they are required prior to engaging in municipal advisory activities. See supra note 1688
and accompanying text. With respect to municipal advisors registered with the MSRB,
approximately 682 were financial advisors; 192 were guaranteed investment contract
brokers or advisors; 272 were placement agents; 159 were solicitors or finders; 246 were
swap or derivative advisors; 135 were third-party marketers; and 201 provided other
services. See supra note 1694 and accompanying text (discussing this data as well as similar
MA-T data).

1723

As discussed above in the economic baseline, the municipal advisor market is not highly
concentrated. See supra Section VIII.C.3. See also supra note 1694 and accompanying text
(discussing MSRB and MA-T data regarding services provided by municipal advisors
registered with the MSRB and the Commission).

1724

As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average cost per municipal advisory
firm to register with the Commission will be approximately $8,092. See infra note 1813 and
accompanying text.
506

municipal advisory firm. The Commission recognizes, however, that for smaller municipal advisors
with fewer clients the registration and recordkeeping costs may represent a greater percentage of
annual revenues, and thus, such advisors may be more likely to pass those costs along to clients. 1725
c.

Assessment Costs

Under the temporary registration regime, market participants may have incurred costs to
determine whether their business activities meet the definition of municipal advisor or if a statutory
exclusion applies, and thus, whether registration with the Commission as a municipal advisor and
compliance with the requirements imposed by Section 15B of the Exchange Act as well as rules
established by the MSRB was required. 1726 Prior to the enactment of the Dodd-Frank Act and the
Commission’s adoption of the temporary registration regime, there were no assessment costs with
respect to municipal advisor regulation. The Commission received a number of comments in
connection with the 2010 interim temporary final rule seeking guidance regarding the scope of the
statutory definition of municipal advisor and the statutory exclusions therefrom. 1727
In the Proposal, the Commission stated its belief that the direct costs for respondents to read
and apply the definitions in proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(d) would be minimal. 1728 The Commission
received several comments regarding the costs to interpret the proposed definition of municipal

advisor, proposed interpretations of the statutory exclusions, and proposed exemptions.1729 One
commenter asserted that “given that Form MA and the related rules are new, . . . outside legal fees
could easily exceed $25,000 for a financial institution that provides a variety of services to
municipal clients.” 1730
Although the above comment appears to be directed at the Commission’s estimate of the
costs to engage outside counsel in connection with completing Form MA, the Commission
recognizes that many persons will incur assessment costs to determine whether registration as a
municipal advisor is required under the final rules. The Commission, therefore, has reconsidered
the direct costs for respondents to read and apply the definitions in Rule 15Ba1-1(d). The
Commission recognizes that some market participants are likely to seek legal counsel for
interpretation of various aspects of the rule, particularly to determine whether the market
participant’s business activities meet the definition of municipal advisor or whether an exclusion or
exemption from the definition of municipal advisor is available. The Commission believes that the
assessment costs may vary depending on the relevant facts and circumstances, including the
complexity of the market participant’s business activities. The Commission also now believes that
for larger financial institutions with more complex businesses the assessment costs could range up
to $25,500, as indicated by a commenter. 1731
The Commission does not have the information necessary to provide a point estimate of the

1729

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter I; ACLI Letter; Financial Services Roundtable Letter.

See Financial Services Roundtable Letter.

1731

See supra note 1730. The Commission believes that different market participants will need
to undertake different analyses in relation to the definition of municipal advisor and
exclusions and exemptions therefrom. The estimate of assessment costs is intended to
include analysis of the exclusions and exemptions, although the Commission separately
discusses the impacts of the interpretations of the exclusions and exemptions on assessment
costs below. See infra Section VIII.D.5–6 (discussing the exclusions and exemptions).
508

potential assessment costs because the Commission believes the assessment costs associated with
determining whether a market participant is a municipal advisor under Section 15B of the Exchange
Act will vary. However, based on the Commission staff’s understanding of the industry and
comments received, 1732 the Commission estimates that the costs associated with undertaking this
determination may range from $379 to $25,500. 1733 The Commission believes that many entities
are clearly municipal advisors and that an in-house attorney, without the assistance of outside
counsel, could make such a determination in one hour. If an entity’s business is more complex, the
Commission estimates the assessment could require approximately 25 hours of in-house counsel
time and 40 hours of outside counsel time.
The Commission believes that the assessment costs associated with determining whether a
person would be required to register as a municipal advisor would be greater in the absence of the
rules the Commission is adopting today. The Commission believes the rules adopted today provide
extensive guidance to market participants and should reduce the number of requests for no-action
relief and other guidance from the Commission or Commission staff, which, in turn, should lead to
lower assessment costs for many firms.
In particular, to further facilitate market participants’ analysis of whether their activities
1732

See supra note 1730.

1733

The average cost incurred by market participants is based on the estimated amount of time
that the staff believes would be required for both in-house counsel and outside counsel to
assess whether a market participant is a municipal advisor, as that term is defined in Section
15B of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(4)) and the final rules. For the calculation of
the hourly rate for an in-house attorney, see infra note 1779. The Commission estimates the
costs for outside legal services to be $400 per hour. For an explanation of the outside
counsel cost estimate, see supra note 1538. Accordingly, the Commission estimates the cost
on the high end of the range to be $25,475 ($9,475 (based on 25 hours of in-house counsel
time × $379) + $16,000 (based on 40 hours of outside counsel time × $400). This estimate
is rounded by two significant digits to avoid the impression of false precision of the
estimate. In addition, as discussed below, the Commission estimates that the average cost
per municipal advisory firm to register with the Commission will be $8,092. See infra note
1813.
509

would require them to register as a municipal advisor, the Commission has adopted several
definitions that are consistent with existing regulatory definitions. For example, the Commission is
adopting a definition of obligated person 1734 that is generally consistent with Rule 15c2-12. This
definition will provide further protections for certain entities that participate in borrowing in the
municipal securities market, ensure uniformity among rules relating to that market, and provide
clearer guidance to market participants. In addition, the consistency with Rule 15c2-12 will likely
reduce any confusion and, thus, may reduce the cost of compliance by allowing advisors to more
quickly and accurately determine whether their clients are obligated persons. The Commission also
believes that the materiality standard for secondary market disclosure in Rule 15c2-12 is an
appropriate standard to identify those obligated persons that should have the protections afforded by
Section 15B of the Exchange Act. 1735
Similarly, as discussed above, the Commission is adopting a definition of “proceeds of
municipal securities” that is similar to the definition of proceeds for purposes of the arbitrage rules,
except that it applies to both taxable and tax-exempt municipal securities, which should lead to
lower assessment costs for many firms. 1736 Because the arbitrage rules are central to tax-exempt
municipal securities, the Commission believes that market participants will be familiar with and
able to understand easily the scope of “proceeds of municipal securities.” 1737 Further, the

1734

See supra Section III.A.1.b.iii.

1735

Similarly, in response to commenters, the Commission is providing exemptions from the
definition of municipal advisor for swap dealers that will apply the safe harbor requirements
applicable to the parties to such transactions under the existing CFTC regulatory regime and,
therefore, will apply consistent and comparable protections to municipal entities and
obligated persons as under that regime. See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(v); supra Section
III.A.1.c.vi.

1736

See supra text accompanying note 1733.

1737

The Commission recognizes that some entities may not be familiar with the arbitrage rules
and, thus, that any benefits recognized from the Commission’s reliance on the arbitrage rules
510

Commission believes that the definition appropriately limits the time and cost of compliance for a
person to determine whether it must register as a municipal advisor because if a person makes a
reasonable inquiry of a knowledgeable municipal entity or obligated person official and is informed
in writing that monies are not proceeds of municipal securities, then absent reason to know
otherwise, they are not proceeds of municipal securities. 1738 While municipal entities and obligated
persons generally already track proceeds of tax-exempt municipal securities, 1739 and thus, should
not incur additional costs in tracking such monies, municipal entities and obligated persons may
incur additional costs in tracking proceeds of taxable municipal securities. However, the
Commission believes that these costs will not be substantial because municipal entities currently
trace proceeds of taxable bonds for non-tax purposes, such as for compliance with a bond indenture
or resolution.
The Commission also believes the interpretations of the statutory exclusions adopted today
should reduce assessment costs. For example, the Commission has provided examples of activities
outside the scope of serving as an underwriter of municipal securities for purposes of the
underwriter exclusion. 1740 Similarly, the Commission has clarified the types of activities that would
fall outside of the other statutory exclusions. 1741

may be reduced.
1738

Similarly, the Commission is including a reasonable inquiry qualification in the definition of
“municipal escrow investments.” See Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2). See also notes 383–384 and
accompanying text.

1739

See supra notes 361–362 and accompanying text.

1740

See supra Section III.A.1.c.iv.

1741

For example, an investment adviser that provides advice concerning whether and how to
issue municipal securities; advice concerning the structure, timing, and terms of issuances of
municipal securities and other similar matters; advice concerning municipal derivatives; or a
solicitation would need to register as a municipal advisor. See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii); supra
Section III.A.1.c.v.

2. Definition of Municipal Advisor and Related Terms
a.

Programmatic, Registration, and Recordkeeping Costs and Benefits

As discussed above, there are programmatic costs and benefits that flow from the statutory
municipal advisor regulatory regime. Given the limitations on the Commission’s ability to conduct
a quantitative assessment of the programmatic costs and benefits associated with the definition of
municipal advisor, 1742 the Commission has considered these costs and benefits primarily in
qualitative terms. 1743 In addition, as discussed below, the Commission has quantified many of the
registration and recordkeeping costs that result from the final rules and forms. Relying on the
programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs and benefits, the Commission believes it is
possible to identify those persons that, because of the activities in which they engage, appear to be
the types of persons for which the statutory requirements of Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act
were created. 1744
As previously stated, the statutory definition of municipal advisor is broad and includes
persons that traditionally have not been considered to be municipal financial advisors. 1745 The
definition of municipal advisor the Commission is adopting today is designed to provide guidance
1742

The Commission does not have the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate
for many of the programmatic costs and benefits, in particular when discussing increases in
the willingness of municipal entities and obligated persons to utilize municipal advisors and
improvements in investor protection. In general, secondary data regarding the municipal
advisory market that would assist the Commission in producing quantitative analyses are
largely unavailable. Other than the academic papers cited in the Proposal and this release,
few studies on municipal securities have attempted to undertake the efforts to collect such
secondary data.

1743

While commenters criticized this qualitative approach, none provided or suggested sources
of data that would facilitate a quantitative analysis.

1744

As indicated throughout this release, and as discussed further below, the Commission is
mindful of the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs and has adopted a
definition of municipal advisor intended to help minimize compliance burdens consistent
with the statutory objectives.

1745

See supra note 1662.
512

that parties can use in determining whether registration as a municipal advisor is required. In
determining the appropriate scope of the definition of municipal advisor, the Commission
considered what types of persons should be regulated as municipal advisors in light of the purposes
of the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities, the overall
regulatory framework, and information currently available. The Commission has therefore sought
to adopt a definition of municipal advisor that would capture those persons without imposing
programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs on persons for which regulation currently may
not be justified in light of the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission believes that this
approach should help maximize the benefits provided by the municipal advisor regulatory regime
while minimizing costs imposed on market participants where consistent with investor protection.
Further, because the definition of municipal advisor and related terms adopted today are consistent
with the definitions in Section 15B(e) of the Exchange Act and the purposes of the Dodd-Frank
Act, 1746 the Commission believes that those persons that currently meet the definition of municipal
advisor under the final rules and for which a statutory exclusion is not available should already be
registered with the Commission and the MSRB under the temporary registration regime.
As discussed in the PRA, the Commission estimates that approximately 910 municipal
advisory firms, including sole proprietors, will register with the Commission under the permanent
registration regime. 1747 In addition, the Commission anticipates that the exemption for persons
providing advice with respect to investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the
investment of proceeds of municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of
1746

With regard to terms that are not defined in Section 15B(e) of the Exchange Act, the
Commission is defining those terms in a manner consistent with the purposes of the DoddFrank Act to regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities. See 15 U.S.C.
78o-4(e).

1747

See supra note 1446 and accompanying text.
513

municipal escrow investments 1748 could reduce the estimated number of initial Form MA
applicants. Likewise, the Commission anticipates the additional exemptions adopted today could
also reduce the estimated number of initial Form MA applicants. 1749
Because the Commission has interpreted the definition of municipal advisor consistent with
the statute, it believes that any differences from the baseline with regard to the number of municipal
advisors required to register with the Commission should be minimal as those persons should have
already registered under the temporary registration regime. In addition, any differences from the
baseline with regard to the programmatic costs and benefits related to the statutory requirements
and MSRB rules that are currently operative should be minimal because they would have already
been incurred under the temporary registration regime. 1750 Similarly, the definition of municipal
advisor adopted today should not impact efficiency, competition, or capital formation relative to the
baseline because those market participants required to register under the permanent registration
regime should already be registered with the Commission and the MSRB under the temporary
registration regime and complying with the requirements of Section 15B of the Exchange Act and
MSRB rules. 1751
As discussed above, a person that meets the statutory definition of municipal advisor, and
for which a statutory exclusion is not available, is already required to register with the Commission
on Form MA-T and is subject to a series of programmatic costs. 1752 These programmatic costs
1748

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii).

1749

See supra Section III.A.1.c.

1750

To the extent that the final rules provide guidance to certain market participants that their
activities do not cause them to be municipal advisors, those persons would not incur the
programmatic costs that flow from the regulatory regime.

1751

See supra Section VIII.C.

1752

As discussed below, the Commission is providing exemptions from the definition of
municipal advisor for persons engaged in certain activities.
514

include, among other things, those incurred to comply with applicable provisions of Section 15B of
the Exchange Act and MSRB rules. Municipal advisors will continue to be subject to a fiduciary
duty to any municipal entity client and be prohibited from engaging in any fraudulent, deceptive, or
manipulative acts or practices when providing advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or
obligated person with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal
securities, or when undertaking a solicitation of a municipal entity or obligated person. 1753
Municipal advisors will also continue to be subject to MSRB Rule G-17, which requires municipal
advisors to deal fairly with all persons and not engage in any deceptive, dishonest, or unfair
practice. In addition, municipal advisors will still need to register with the MSRB and pay a $100
initial fee and a $500 annual fee. 1754 Because the Commission is adopting a definition of municipal
advisor that is consistent with Section 15B(e) of the Exchange Act, 1755 the Commission believes
registered municipal advisors would have already incurred these costs under the temporary
registration regime. The Commission recognizes, however, that municipal advisors may incur costs
to meet standards of training, experience, competence, and other qualifications, as well as
continuing education requirements, that the MSRB may establish in the future. 1756
The Commission believes the municipal advisor regulatory regime should continue to
enhance municipal entity and obligated person protections and incentivize municipal advisors not to

1754

See MSRB Rule A-12; and MSRB Rule A-14.

1755

With regard to terms that are not defined in Section 15B(e) of the Exchange Act, the
Commission is defining those terms in a manner consistent with the purposes of the DoddFrank Act to regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities. See 15 U.S.C.
78o-4(e).

1756

See supra note 1668. In addition, as discussed below, the final rules and forms will require
every municipal advisor to register with the Commission and satisfy new recordkeeping
requirements according to Rule 15Ba1-8.
515

engage in misconduct. 1757 Municipal advisors will continue to be subject to Commission oversight,
including periodic examinations, and may be subject to disciplinary action for misconduct. 1758 In
addition, certain municipal advisors will now be subject to periodic examinations by FINRA to
evaluate compliance with the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and MSRB
rules. 1759
Market participants will need to interpret a number of related terms to determine whether
they are municipal advisors. Market participants will need to determine whether they provide
“advice to or on behalf of a municipal entity or obligated person with respect to municipal financial
products.” 1760 The term “municipal financial product” is defined as “municipal derivatives,
guaranteed investment contracts, and investment strategies.” 1761 As discussed below, although the
Exchange Act defines the terms “guaranteed investment contract” and “investment strategies,” it
does not define the term “municipal derivatives.” In addition, certain terms important to
interpreting the term “investment strategies” are undefined (i.e., proceeds of municipal securities
and guaranteed investment contracts). As discussed below, the Commission is adopting definitions
of these terms that are consistent with the purposes of the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate persons that
engage in municipal advisory activities. The Commission has adopted several definitions of other
related terms that are effectively identical to the statute (i.e., municipal entity, obligated person, and
solicitation). 1762

1762

Because the definitions of municipal entity, obligated person, and solicitation are consistent
516

The Commission is adopting a definition of guaranteed investment contract that applies only
to contracts related to investments of proceeds of municipal securities or municipal escrow
investments. 1763 The Commission believes that persons that provide advice concerning guaranteed
investment contracts should have already registered with the Commission and the MSRB under the
temporary registration regime. 1764 The Commission staff understands that most persons that
provide advice about guaranteed investment contracts specialize in public finance issues and are
unlikely to provide advice only about guaranteed investment contracts that do not relate to
investments of proceeds of municipal securities or municipal escrow investments. In addition, a
review of MA-T and MSRB data indicates that no municipal advisor registered with the
Commission or the MSRB has indicated that it provides advice only about guaranteed investment
contracts and not another service that would likely require registration with the Commission under
the final rules and forms. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that the definition of
guaranteed investment contract adopted today will result in a significant change from the baseline
(i.e., the number of municipal advisors registered with the MSRB) in the number of municipal
advisors that will register under the permanent registration regime. Similarly, the Commission does
not believe there will be a significant change from the baseline with regard to the programmatic
costs and benefits due to the definition of “guaranteed investment contract.”
Although Section 15B of the Exchange Act does not define the term “municipal

with the statute, the Commission believes that these definitions will not result in a
significant change from the baseline (i.e., the number of municipal advisors registered with
the MSRB) in the number of registered municipal advisors or in the programmatic costs or
benefits. See supra text accompanying notes 1750–1751.
1763

See Rule 15Ba1-1(a).

1764

As of December 31, 2012, approximately 320 municipal advisors registered on Form MA-T
and approximately 185 municipal advisors registered with the MSRB indicated that they
provide advice concerning guaranteed investment contracts.
517

derivatives,” the Commission is adopting a definition that is consistent with the purposes of the
Dodd-Frank Act to regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities. As discussed
above, with respect to municipal entities, the Commission has determined not to qualify the
definition of municipal derivatives as being limited to those entered into in connection with, or
pledged as security or a source of payment for, existing or contemplated municipal securities. 1765
Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that this definition of municipal derivatives will
result in a significant change from the baseline (i.e., the number of municipal advisors registered
with the MSRB) of the number of municipal advisors that will register under the permanent
registration regime. 1766 The Commission is clarifying the application of the definition of municipal
derivatives with respect to obligated persons to advice that relates to derivatives entered into in
connection with, or pledged as security or a source of payment for, existing or contemplated
municipal securities or another municipal derivative. The Commission expects that any persons
that provide advice about derivatives outside this context would not register with the Commission
under the permanent registration regime. The Commission does not believe, however, that this
clarification will result in fewer persons registering as municipal advisors because the clarification
is limited to instances that would cause a person to be an obligated person as defined in Section
15B(e)(10) of the Exchange Act. 1767
The Commission recognizes that persons that are required to register as municipal advisors

1765

See supra Section III.A.1.c.

1766

The Commission believes that persons that provide advice about municipal derivatives to
municipal entities should have already registered with the Commission and the MSRB under
the temporary registration regime. As of December 31, 2012, more than 350 municipal
advisors registered on Form MA-T and more than 230 municipal advisors registered with
the MSRB indicated that they provide advice concerning the use of municipal derivatives.
See also infra VIII.D.6 (discussing the exemption for swap dealers).

1767

15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(10).
518

because they provide advice about municipal derivatives will incur the programmatic costs of the
municipal advisor regulatory regime. However, the Commission believes that any differences from
the baseline with regard to the programmatic costs and benefits due to the definition of “municipal
derivatives” would be minimal since such advisors would have already incurred these costs under
the temporary registration regime. 1768 The Commission believes that municipal entities and
obligated persons that receive advice about municipal derivatives should receive the protections of
the municipal advisor regulatory regime. 1769 As discussed above, the permanent registration regime
will increase the amount of information available about municipal advisors. 1770 The Commission
believes that the increased availability of information relative to the baseline about municipal
advisors that provide advice about municipal derivatives, including disciplinary history and
conflicts of interest, may lead to an improvement in the selection of municipal advisors that provide
advice related to municipal derivatives because municipal entities and obligated persons will be able
to consult registration information when choosing municipal advisors that specialize in municipal
derivatives. 1771 In addition, as discussed above, the Commission believes that the increased public
availability of information about municipal advisors who engage in municipal advisory activities
pertaining to municipal derivatives may reduce from the baseline instances of misconduct to the
extent the increased amount of information disclosed on Form MA as compared to Form MA-T acts
as a deterrent against misconduct related to derivatives. 1772

1768

See supra text accompanying note 1766.

See supra notes 1752–1756 and accompanying text.

1770

See infra Section VIII.D.1.a.

1771

See infra Section VIII.D.3.b.

1772

The Commission recognizes, however, that municipal entities and obligated persons will not
have registration information for advisors to obligated persons that invest in derivative
transactions not connected with municipal securities or other municipal derivatives.
519

The Commission has determined not to adopt a separate definition of “investment
strategies,” which is defined in Section 15B(e)(3) of the Exchange Act to include “plans or
programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities that are not municipal
derivatives, guaranteed investment contracts, and the recommendation of and brokerage of
municipal escrow investments.” 1773 The Commission, however, is adopting definitions of proceeds
of municipal securities and municipal escrow investments that are consistent with the purposes of
the Dodd-Frank Act to regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities. The
Commission believes that persons that provide advice with regard to proceeds of municipal
securities and municipal escrow investments should have already registered with the Commission
and the MSRB under the temporary registration regime. 1774 In addition, the exemption in Rule
15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vii) for any person that provides advice to a municipal entity or obligated person
with respect to municipal financial products to the extent that such person provides advice with
respect to investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of
municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments will
provide greater certainty regarding the types of persons who are required to register with the
Commission. Accordingly, the Commission believes that the definitions of “proceeds of municipal
securities” and “municipal escrow investments” will not result in a significant change from the
baseline (i.e., the number of municipal advisors registered with the MSRB) with regard to the
number of municipal advisors that register under the permanent registration regime.
In addition, the Commission believes that any differences from the baseline with regard to
1773

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(3).

1774

As of December 31, 2012, nearly 500 municipal advisors registered on Form MA-T
indicated that they provide advice concerning the investment of the proceeds of municipal
securities and 360 indicated that they provide advice regarding the recommendation and/or
brokerage of municipal escrow investments. MSRB data does not separately identify
municipal advisors that provide these activities.
520

the programmatic costs due to the adoption of the definitions of “proceeds of municipal securities”
and “municipal escrow investments” should be minimal since such costs would have been incurred
under the temporary registration regime. The Commission believes that municipal entities and
obligated persons that receive advice concerning proceeds of municipal securities and municipal
escrow investments should receive the protections of the municipal advisor regulatory regime, and
that the Commission’s approach tailors protection to those activities related to the investment of the
proceeds of municipal securities and related escrow investments, which have been subject to
widespread enforcement activity. 1775
The Commission also believes the increased public availability of information relative to the
baseline about municipal advisors who engage in municipal advisory activities pertaining to
proceeds of municipal securities and municipal escrow investments may reduce instances of
misconduct to the extent the increased amount of information disclosed on Form MA as compared
to Form MA-T acts as a deterrent against misconduct related to investment strategies.
Persons may incur costs to rely on the provisions regarding reasonable reliance on
representations related to proceeds of municipal securities 1776 and municipal escrow
investments. 1777 The Commission estimates that the PRA costs 1778 for persons to rely on Rule
15Ba1-1(m)(3) for reasonable reliance on representations related to proceeds of municipal securities
will be $733,885. 1779 In addition, the Commission estimates that the PRA costs for persons to rely

See Rule 15Ba1-1(m).

(880 hours (estimated burden to draft a template to use in obtaining the written
representation) × $379 (hourly rate for an in-house attorney)) + (6,355 hours (estimated
burden to obtain the written representation) × $63 (hourly rate for a Compliance Clerk)) =
521

on Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2) for reasonable reliance on representations related to municipal escrow
investments will be $401,065. 1780 The Commission notes that no entity is required to utilize Rule
15Ba1-1(m)(3) or Rule 15Ba1-1(h)(2) and that any efforts to do so are voluntary.
b. Alternatives
One alternative to the rules the Commission is adopting today relates to the types of monies
covered under the final rules. The Commission considered whether the final rules should only
apply to the proceeds of municipal securities or whether they should also apply to funds held by, or
on behalf of, a municipal entity that do not constitute the proceeds of municipal securities. As
discussed above, because the definition of “investment strategies” in Section 15B(e)(3) of the
Exchange Act 1781 provides that it “includes” plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of
municipal securities, the Commission proposed to interpret the term to mean that it includes,
without limitation, the investment of proceeds of municipal securities, as well as plans, programs, or
pools of assets that invest funds held by, or on behalf of, a municipal entity. Commenters generally
opposed the proposed interpretation of investment strategies. 1782
As noted above, the Commission continues to believe that the term “includes” is not
$733,885. See supra notes 1622–1624 and accompanying text. Staff estimates that the
average national hourly rate for an in-house attorney is $379 based on data from SIFMA’s
Management & Professional Earnings in the Securities Industry 2012 (modified by
Commission staff to account for an 1800-hour-work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account
for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead). The $63-per-hour figure for a
Compliance Clerk is from SIFMA’s Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 2012, as
modified by Commission staff to account for an 1,800-hour work-year and multiplied by
2.93 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and overhead.
1780

(700 hours (estimated burden to draft a template to use in obtaining the written
representation) × $379 (hourly rate for an attorney)) + (2,155 hours (estimated burden to
obtain the written representation) × $63 (hourly rate for a Compliance Clerk)) = $401,065.
See supra notes 1616–1618 and accompanying text. See supra note 1779 (calculating the
hourly rate for an in-house attorney and a Compliance Clerk).

522

limiting, but is persuaded by commenters. Accordingly, the Commission has determined to adopt a
definition of “investment strategies” that focuses more narrowly on the statutorily identified
categories of “proceeds of municipal securities” and “municipal escrow investments.” 1783 The
Commission believes this approach related to investment strategies focuses the protections of the
municipal advisor regulatory regime on those activities related to the investment of the proceeds of
municipal securities and related escrow investments, which have been subject to widespread
enforcement activity. 1784 The Commission believes that a broader approach would likely result in a
greater number of persons registering as municipal advisors, which may not be necessary or
appropriate in the protection of investors at this time. 1785 In addition, because persons that provide
advice with respect to investment strategies that are not plans or programs for the investment of the
proceeds of municipal securities or the recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow
investments will not have to register as municipal advisors, the Commission recognizes that such
persons will not be subject to the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs of the
permanent registration regime.
Another alternative to the rules the Commission is adopting today is for the Commission not
to define further “municipal advisor” and related terms. The Commission did not estimate the

1783

See Rule 15Ba1-1(b). The Commission is also persuaded by commenters that, at this time,
it is appropriate to apply the definition of guaranteed investment contract more narrowly.
This approach is consistent with the Commission’s decision to limit the application of
“investment strategies” to plans or programs for the investment of proceeds of municipal
securities. The Commission expects that most providers of guaranteed investment contracts
will not be considered municipal advisors as long as they do not engage in municipal
advisory activities.

1784

See supra note 287.

1785

The Commission is unable to estimate the number of persons who would otherwise need to
register as municipal advisors under this alternative approach because it does not have the
data necessary to conduct this analysis and the information is not otherwise publicly
available.
523

assessment costs market participants would incur to determine whether registration is required
under the temporary registration regime and initially believed that the direct costs for respondents to
read and apply the definitions in proposed Rule 15Ba1-1(d) would be minimal. 1786 As discussed
above, however, in light of comments received, 1787 the Commission now believes that persons may
incur costs of up to $25,500 to determine whether their activities require them to register as
municipal advisors under the final rules. Nonetheless, the Commission believes that the assessment
costs associated with determining whether a person would be required to register as a municipal
advisor would be greater in the absence of the rules the Commission is adopting today. 1788 Without
these rules, market participants would still need to analyze whether their activities fall within the
definition of municipal advisor in Section 15B(e)(4) of the Exchange Act and would likely need to
request no-action relief and other guidance from the Commission or Commission staff, or risk
failing to register with the Commission as required. 1789 As discussed above, the Commission
estimates that the costs associated with determining whether a market participant is a municipal
advisor under Section 15B of the Exchange Act may range from $379 to $25,500, with the high end
of the range reflecting the cost for entities with more complex business activities. 1790 Thus, the
Commission believes the rules adopted today provide extensive guidance to market participants and
should reduce the number of requests for no-action relief and other guidance from the Commission
1786

See Proposal, 76 FR at 873.

1787

See supra note 1730.

1788

For example, one commenter on the Proposal stated that it lacked a clear line between
permissible and impermissible conduct that will drive up municipal advisory costs due to
cautious efforts to “over-comply” and not risk an inadvertent violation. See American
Council of Life Insurers Letter.

1789

In addition, without this guidance, a greater number of market participants would likely
decide to register as municipal advisors unnecessarily and thereby incur the programmatic,
registration, and recordkeeping costs of the municipal advisor registration regime.

1790

See supra note 1733 and accompanying text.
524

or Commission staff, which, in turn, should lead to lower assessment costs for many firms.
3. Rules and Forms Related to Registration of Municipal Advisors
The final rules and forms will create a permanent registration regime for municipal advisors
consisting of the following forms: Form MA, Form MA-I, Form MA-NR, and Form MA-W. 1791
Under Rule 15Ba1-2(a), each person applying for registration with the Commission as a municipal
advisor is required to complete Form MA and file the form electronically with the Commission. In
addition, each person applying for registration or registered with the Commission as a municipal
advisor must complete Form MA-I with respect to each natural person who is a person associated
with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities on its behalf and file the
form electronically with the Commission.1792 Each Form MA shall be considered filed with the
Commission upon submission of a completed Form MA, together with all additional required
documents, including all required filings of Form MA-Is, to the Commission’s EDGAR system. 1793
A sole proprietor will have to complete both Form MA and Form MA-I. 1794
Pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-5(a), a municipal advisory firm that registers on Form MA must
amend its Form MA at least annually, within 90 days of the end of the municipal advisor’s fiscal

1791

The Commission is establishing additional requirements for non-resident municipal
advisors. See supra Section III.A.6.

1792

See Rule 15Ba1-2(b)(1). As discussed above, natural person municipal advisors who are not
sole proprietors no longer need to register with the Commission. However, the Commission
is retaining Form MA-I to obtain information about individuals associated with municipal
advisory firms engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of such firms, which will
assist in the Commission’s oversight functions. See supra Section VIII.D.1.a (discussing the
benefits of the permanent registration regime to Commission oversight of municipal
advisors). The Commission notes, moreover, that it is the municipal advisory firms, not the
individuals, that will be required to file Form MA-I with the Commission.

1793

See Rule 15Ba1-2(c).

1794

See Rule 15Ba1-2(b)(2). The Commission has developed an online filing system to permit
municipal advisors to file a completed Form MA and Form MA-I through the EDGAR
system. The information filed will be publicly available once registration has been granted.
525

year in the case of firms or within 90 days of the end of the calendar year for sole proprietors, and
more frequently as required by the General Instructions. In addition, a registered municipal advisor
must promptly amend Form MA-I whenever any information previously provided in Form MA-I
becomes inaccurate for any reason. 1795 With respect to Form MA-I, all municipal advisory firms
will be required to amend Form MA-I to indicate that an individual is no longer an associated
person of the municipal advisory firm filing the form or no longer engages in municipal advisory
activities on its behalf. Registered municipal advisors will also report successions of registration on
Form MA. 1796
Pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-4, all registered municipal advisors are required to file Form MA-W
to withdraw from registration with the Commission as a municipal advisor. As will be the case with
both Form MA and Form MA-I, a municipal advisor must file Form MA-W electronically with the
Commission.
In adopting these rules, the Commission sought to design a registration process that is
similar to other registration processes administered by the Commission. The rules are based on
rules applicable to broker-dealers and investment advisers; similarly, Form MA is based on Form
ADV and Form BD, and Form MA-I is based on Form U4. To the extent market participants are
familiar with these existing registration processes, the Commission believes that using similar
processes to register municipal advisors will create efficiencies for market participants.
The Commission also has sought to ensure that the Commission staff has information
sufficient to make a determination as to whether registration should be granted or denied. Thus,
Form MA differs from Form ADV and Form BD because it requests information specific to the
municipal advisory business. The Commission also has sought to assure that the rules, forms, and
1795

See Rule 15Ba1-5(b).

1796

See Rule 15Ba1-7.
526

process generally are as clear as possible so as to minimize confusion. In addition, the Commission
has sought to minimize, to the extent possible, duplication and costs that the rules may impose on
firms. Finally, burdens and costs that have been estimated for PRA purposes are included in the
broader costs and benefits discussion that follows because the Commission believes, as the
registration process would largely be forms-based, it is appropriate to include them. 1797
a.

Registration Costs

The Commission acknowledges that the establishment of a permanent registration regime
will impose costs on persons registering as municipal advisors on Form MA. As discussed above,
persons meeting the statutory definition of municipal advisor and for whom a statutory exclusion is
not available should currently be registered with the Commission on Form MA-T as well as with
the MSRB. Thus, such persons would have incurred costs in connection with such registration. 1798
Because of this, the quantitative costs discussed below related to registration on Form MA represent
additional costs separate from those incurred to register on Form MA-T. However, for the reasons
discussed below, the Commission believes that municipal advisors that have already gathered
relevant information to complete Form MA-T or to register with the Commission in another
capacity may incur lower permanent registration costs than those that have not registered on Form
MA-T (i.e., new entrants to the market) or that have not registered with the Commission in another
capacity.
The Commission expects municipal advisors will incur one-time costs to familiarize
themselves with the rules and the relevant forms. The paperwork burden of gathering information
for the purpose of completing the forms will be reduced to the extent municipal advisors have
already gathered some of the information required by the forms in order to register with the
1797

See supra Section VII.

1798

See supra Section VIII.C.2.
527

Commission on Form MA-T or in another capacity. 1799 In comparison, municipal advisors not
otherwise registered with the Commission and solicitors that are not brokers, dealers, or investment
advisers, to the extent they need to gather the required information for the first time, may incur
higher one-time costs to familiarize themselves with the rules and relevant forms. 1800 In addition,
some municipal advisors may incur one-time costs to establish new internal controls, such as
procedures for obtaining the information required by the forms, as applicable. These potential onetime burdens are included in the Commission’s estimate below. 1801 The Commission believes that
these costs will be limited for municipal advisors that are registered with the Commission as
investment advisers and/or broker-dealers or that have voluntarily adopted such practices, but will
likely be higher for municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission and solicitors
to the extent they have not voluntarily adopted such practices. 1802
The Commission received one comment letter that questioned the need for the proposed
self-certification requirement. 1803 As discussed above, after careful consideration of comments
received, the Commission is not requiring self-certification in Form MA. 1804
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the total initial cost for all municipal
advisory firms and all natural person municipal advisors to register with the Commission would be

1799

See supra Section VII.D.1.

1800

See supra Section VII.D.1.

1801

See supra Section VII.D.1.

1802

Some unregulated entities that engage in municipal advisory activities have formed
professional associations that have implemented their own voluntary best practices with
respect to conflicts of interest, educational standards, and other disclosure of note to their
clients. See, e.g., National Association of Independent Public Finance Advisors,
http://www.naipfa.com/.

1803

See, e.g., Costanzo Letter.

1804

See supra Section III.A.2.b.
528

approximately $12,623,000. 1805 Although the Commission received comments suggesting that the
Proposal underestimated the hourly burden, 1806 the Commission is not changing its estimate of the
time required to register with the Commission (other than to reflect its decision not to adopt a selfcertification requirement). 1807 The Commission notes that commenters did not provide specific
figures by which to recalculate the Commission’s estimate. 1808 As discussed above, 1809 the

1805

$1,105,000 (estimated initial cost for all municipal advisory firms to complete Form MA) +
$11,118,000 (estimated initial cost for all natural person municipal advisors to complete
Form MA-I) + $400,000 (estimated cost for all municipal advisory firms to hire outside
counsel) = $12,623,000. See Proposal, 76 FR at 871, 875.

1806

See Financial Services Roundtable Letter (asserting that “initial preparation of Form MA
would require significantly greater hours and much higher costs”). See also supra Section
VII.D.1 (discussing comments regarding the hourly burden estimate from the Proposal).

1807

See supra notes 1486–1487 and accompanying text.

1808

The Commission received several comment letters that specifically addressed the costs of
registration on Form MA and Form MA-I. These commenters generally criticized the cost
of municipal advisor registration with both the Commission and the MSRB, including the
MSRB’s $100 initial fee and $500 annual fee. See, e.g., Texas Bankers Association Letter;
State of Texas Letter; John Sullivan Letter. The Commission notes that it does not charge
municipal advisors a fee to register with the Commission. For purposes of the economic
analysis, the fees imposed by the MSRB are part of the economic baseline. Although the
Dodd-Frank Act permits the MSRB to require municipal advisors to pay such reasonable
fees and charges as may be necessary or appropriate to defray the costs and expenses of
operating and administering the MSRB (see 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(J)), the Commission does
not set or approve fees charged by the MSRB. Instead, the Exchange Act provides that
certain designated SRO rules, including fees charged by the MSRB, take effect upon filing
with the Commission and may thereafter be enforced by the SRO to the extent not
inconsistent with the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and applicable
Federal and State law. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(A), (C). The Commission has sixty days
from the date of filing, however, during which it “summarily may temporarily suspend” the
fees “if it appears to the Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the
public interest, for the protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes
of” the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(b)(3)(C). If the Commission takes such action,
the Commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule should
be approved or disapproved. See id. In addition, Section 19(c) of the Exchange Act
authorizes the Commission, by rule, to abrogate, add to, and delete from the rules of an SRO
(other than a registered clearing agency) as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate
to insure the fair administration of the SRO, to conform its rules to requirements of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to such organization, or
otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(c).
529

Commission is making some revisions to clarify the questions asked in Form MA and Form MA-I
and to elicit additional information. Because some revisions will increase the hourly burden for
municipal advisors to complete the relevant forms, while others will decrease the burden, and
because most of the changes to Form MA and Form MA-I are clarifications not requiring additional
information, the Commission does not believe the additional information requirements will impose
significant additional burdens on municipal advisors and is retaining its original hourly burden
estimates as proposed. As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the total average initial
burden to complete a single Form MA will be 3.5 hours per applicant, 1810 while the average amount
of time for a municipal advisory firm to complete Form MA-I with respect to a natural person
municipal advisor will be 3.0 hours. 1811 The Commission now estimates that the total initial PRA
cost for all municipal advisory firms to register with the Commission will be approximately
$6,910,975, 1812 for an average cost per firm of $7,595. 1813 The Commission believes that the

(36,935 hours (total estimated hourly burden under the rules for all municipal advisors to
complete Form MA and required number of Form MA-I) × $166 (combined hourly rate for a
Compliance Manager and Compliance Clerk)) + $364,000 (estimated cost for all municipal
advisors to hire outside counsel to assist in completing Form MA) + ((910 hours (estimated
one-time burden for all municipal advisory firms to draft a template to use in obtaining the
written consents to service of process) × $379 (hourly rate for an attorney)) + (1,125 hours
(estimated one-time burden for all municipal advisory firms to obtain the written consents to
service of process) × $63 (hourly rate for a Compliance Clerk))) = $6,910,975. See supra
note 1501 and accompanying text (calculating the total estimated hourly burden under the
rules for all municipal advisors to complete Form MA and required number of Form MA-I);
supra note 1567 and accompanying text (estimating the total cost for all municipal advisory
firms to hire outside counsel to review their compliance with the final rules and forms);
supra notes 1579–1581 and accompanying text (estimating the one-time burden to obtain
written consents to service of process); supra note 1779 (calculating the hourly rate for an
in-house attorney and the hourly rate for a Compliance Clerk). The Commission expects
that completion of Form MA and Form MA-I will most likely be performed equally by
compliance managers and compliance clerks. Dividing the hourly rate evenly between a
530

reduction in cost from the Proposal is primarily attributable to a reduction in the estimated number
of municipal advisory firms that will initially register with the Commission; a reduction in the
estimated number of natural person municipal advisors for which municipal advisory firms and sole
proprietors will need to complete Form MA-I; 1814 and the Commission’s decision not to adopt a
self-certification requirement. The Commission notes that this estimate represents the aggregate
cost to the industry. The costs incurred by a specific municipal advisor to register with the
Commission will depend on its size and the complexity of its business activity.
The Commission also anticipates that municipal advisors will incur ongoing annual costs to
monitor and/or maintain the information required by the registration forms; 1815 to provide updates to
the registration forms; and to withdraw from registration with the Commission. In addition,
municipal advisors that are new to the market will incur costs to register with the Commission. In
the Proposal, the Commission estimated that these ongoing annual costs would be approximately
$5,292,100. 1816

compliance manager ($269 per hour) and a compliance clerk ($63 per hour) results in a cost
per hour of $166. ($269 × 0.5) + ($63 × 0.5) = $166. The $269-per-hour figure for a
Compliance Manager is from SIFMA’s Management & Professional Earnings in the
Securities Industry 2012, as modified by Commission staff to account for an 1,800-hour
work-year and multiplied by 5.35 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead. In the Proposal, the combined hourly rate was $170. See Proposal, 76 FR at 875
n.398. The combined hourly rate for a Compliance Manager and Compliance Clerk is lower
than in the Proposal because of a reduction in the rate for a Compliance Manager from $273
per hour to $269 per hour and a reduction in the rate for a Compliance Clerk from $67 per
hour to $63 per hour.
1813

$6,910,975 (estimated total initial labor cost for all municipal advisory firms to register with
the Commission) ÷ 910 (estimated number of municipal advisors registered on Form MA) =
$7,594.48.

These costs are included in the Commission’s estimate below.

$510,000 (estimated ongoing cost for all municipal advisory firms to amend Form MA and
complete the annual self-certification) + $3,519,000 (estimated ongoing cost for all natural
person municipal advisors to amend Form MA-I and complete the annual self-certification)
531

Under the final rules and forms, municipal advisory firms will incur a number of ongoing
costs. Municipal advisory firms that are new to the market will incur costs to register with the
Commission. In addition, municipal advisory firms will incur costs to amend Form MA, amend
Form MA-I, and withdraw from registration with the Commission. The Commission now estimates
that municipal advisors will incur total ongoing annual PRA costs of approximately $2,618,373. 1817
The Commission notes that this estimate represents the aggregate cost to the industry. The ongoing
costs incurred by a specific municipal advisor will depend on its size and the complexity of its
business activity. The reduction in cost from the Proposal is primarily attributable to a reduction in

advisory firms to complete Form MA-W) + $229,500 (estimated ongoing cost for all natural
person municipal advisors to withdraw from Form MA-I registration) = $5,292,100. See

municipal advisors to hire outside counsel to assist in completing Form MA)) + (12,053

reduction in the estimated number of natural person municipal advisors for which municipal
advisory firms and sole proprietors will need to amend Form MA-I; 1819 a reduction in the estimated
number of municipal advisory firms that will withdraw from registration; and the Commission’s
decision not to adopt a self-certification requirement. 1820
b. Registration Benefits
The Commission believes that the requirements that municipal advisors register with the
Commission on Form MA, submit a Form MA-I for each of its natural person municipal advisors,
and update the information provided at least annually (or more often as required by the rules) will
provide a number of benefits. In addition to the benefits discussed above, 1821 the final rules and
forms could improve the process through which municipal entities and obligated persons select
municipal advisors (referred to as the “municipal advisor selection process”), as the disclosures

1818

See supra notes 1442–1446 and accompanying text.

1819

See supra notes 1447–1464 and accompanying text. As discussed above, the Commission is
not revising the estimated time to amend Form MA and Form MA-I. See supra Section
VII.D.3.

1820

See supra Section VII.D.4. Several commenters stated that the Commission did not address
the potential liability costs associated with a permanent registration regime. See SIFMA
Letter I (expressing concerns regarding the self-certification requirement); NAESCO Letter
(expressing concerns regarding fiduciary liability). The Commission recognizes that some
municipal advisors may incur litigation costs as a result of the final rules and forms, and that
to the extent that there are such costs, some of them may be passed on to municipal entities
and obligated persons in the form of increased fees. However, commenters did not provide
estimates of potential liability costs, and the Commission does not have the information
necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of the litigation costs a municipal advisory firm
may face because the costs will depend on the facts and circumstances of each matter
litigated. In addition, the Commission notes that any litigation costs incurred separate from
the registration and recordkeeping requirements are included in the economic baseline as a
function of the statutory municipal advisor regulatory regime. Further, the Commission
believes the potential liability costs are outweighed by the benefits recognized by Congress
in establishing the statutory municipal advisor regulatory regime.

1821

See supra Section VIII.D.1.a.
533

required under the permanent registration regime should allow municipal entities and obligated
persons to become better informed about municipal advisors at a lower cost, which could increase
the use of municipal advisors. Further, the final rules and forms could incentivize municipal
advisors not to engage in misconduct. In addition, Form MA, Form MA-I, and Form MA-NR
should enhance the ability of securities regulators to oversee municipal advisors, which could
increase the willingness of municipal entities and obligated persons to utilize municipal
advisors. 1822
The Commission believes that a significant benefit of the final rules and forms is that they
could enhance the municipal advisor selection process by increasing the amount of publicly
available information about municipal advisors. The rules and forms will allow municipal entities
and obligated persons to become better informed about municipal advisors more efficiently, and
thereby, at a lower cost. 1823 Municipal advisors will be required to submit, and municipal entities,
obligated persons, the general public, and others will be able to access, information through the
Commission’s EDGAR system. In addition, because municipal advisors that are registered with the
Commission as broker-dealers and/or investment advisers will be required to provide their CRD
Number and IARD Number, respectively, on Form MA, interested parties will be able to access
other publicly available information about the municipal advisor. 1824 As discussed in the
1822

See supra Section VIII.D.1.a.

1823

The Commission is unable to estimate the amount of time and money municipal entities may
save by reviewing Form MA and Form MA-I rather than engaging in an RFP process or
searching for other regulatory documents. The Commission believes that the ability to
access information, including disciplinary history and conflicts of interest, on municipal
advisors in a single location benefits municipal entities by reducing the need to search for
other regulatory documents of those municipal advisors that are registered, or have
associated persons that are registered, in another capacity.

1824

Although EDGAR will not automatically provide an electronic link to the information on the
CRD and IARD systems, these systems are nevertheless readily accessible, and with the
identifying numbers of the relevant filings provided, interested parties should be able to find
534

Proposal, 1825 research has shown that most municipal entities do not utilize a formalized selection
process when selecting municipal advisors. 1826 Because there is little publicly available information
about many municipal advisors, municipal entities and obligated persons that do not use a
formalized selection process might not have sufficient information when deciding among municipal
advisors. 1827 As a result of the public availability of information disclosed in Form MA and Form
MA-I, municipal entities and obligated persons may be able to more easily establish objective
criteria to use in selecting municipal advisors. In addition, the availability of information required
by Form MA and Form MA-I in a uniform, standardized format will likely reduce from the baseline
the costs of collecting information and comparing it across municipal advisors. The ease of
establishing and verifying compliance with such criteria may increase the likelihood that municipal
advisors are hired because of their qualifications rather than for other reasons such as political or
personal connections to decision-making officials. Further, to the extent that municipal entities and
obligated persons have been deterred from engaging a municipal advisor because they were not
familiar with the pool of municipal advisors, the permanent registration regime may increase the use
of municipal advisors from the baseline. 1828 The reduced information search costs for municipal

the desired information easily.
1825

See Proposal, 76 FR at 874.

1826

According to Mark D. Robbins and Bill Simonsen, 2003, Financial Advisor Independence
and the Choice of Municipal Bond Sale Type, Municipal Finance Journal 24: 42 (“Robbins
and Simonsen”), an RFP had been used only 22.6% of the time by governments in selecting
the financial advisor for their last bond sale. See also Allen and Dudney, supra note 38.

1827

See supra Section VIII.D.1.a.

1828

Moreover, public disclosure of the registration information of municipal advisors and their
associated persons will make this information available not only to municipal entities and
regulators, but also to the general public. Even if a municipal entity or obligated person
does not otherwise seek to obtain this information as part of its selection process, the
information will be available to interested persons (e.g., the press and concerned citizens)
that might directly or indirectly influence the selection of the municipal advisor.
535

entities may have an incremental effect of increasing informational efficiency. In addition, an
improved municipal advisor selection process may lead to fewer municipal defaults and an
increased likelihood that municipal entities issue debt, which could improve efficiency and capital
formation. 1829
With respect to the issuance of municipal securities, the increased likelihood of using a
municipal advisor could lead to reduced issuance costs and better financing terms for municipal
entity clients, which could improve capital formation and indirectly have a positive impact on
taxpayers. As discussed in the Proposal, one empirical study suggests that the use of municipal
advisors is associated with better borrowing terms, lower reoffering yields, and narrower
underwriter gross spreads, 1830 particularly in instances where the advisors are of a higher quality. 1831
Municipal advisors can play an important role in the issuance process by successfully negotiating to
lower these costs. As these studies did not include advisory fees in calculating the cost savings, it is
possible that some of these savings may be offset by the fees municipal entities and obligated
persons pay to municipal advisors. 1832 Therefore, the Commission believes that the final rules and
forms could incentivize municipal entities and obligated persons to use municipal advisors, which
1829

See infra notes 1830–1832 and accompanying text. The final rules and forms could also
increase investor willingness to invest in municipal bond offerings to the extent that the
municipal entity issuing bonds used a municipal advisor and investors understand and
consider the benefits of municipal advisor registration, including disclosure of conflicts of
interest and disciplinary history.

1830

See generally Vijayakumar and Daniels, supra note 34. See also Proposal, 76 FR at 874.

1831

See generally Allen and Dudney, supra note 38 (“For the $16.8 million mean issue size in
our sample, the present value benefits of choosing a high-quality advisor for negotiated
issues are estimated to be $63,193 to $116,511 for 20-year term issues ($40,136 to $74,001
for ten-year term issues), depending on the measure of advisor quality used, and $84,915 to
$171,805 for revenue issues ($53,933 to $109,121 for ten-year term issues).”). See also

thereby increasing capital formation.
c.

Non-Resident Municipal Advisors

Rule 15Ba1-6 sets forth the general procedures for serving non-residents on Form MA-NR.
Pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-6 and the instructions to Form MA-NR, each non-resident municipal
advisor applying for registration, at the time of filing of the municipal advisor’s application on
Form MA, must file with the Commission a written irrevocable consent and power of attorney on
Form MA-NR to appoint an agent in the United States upon whom may be served any process,
pleadings, or other papers in any action brought against the non-resident person. In addition, each
municipal advisor applying for registration shall, at the time of filing the relevant Form MA-I, file
with the Commission a written irrevocable consent and power of attorney on Form MA-NR for each
non-resident general partner, non-resident managing agent, and non-resident natural person who is a
person associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities on its
behalf. 1833 Rule 15Ba1-6(d) will require each non-resident municipal advisor to provide an opinion
of counsel that the municipal advisor can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with access
to the books and records of the municipal advisor and submit to inspection and examination by the
Commission.
Pursuant to Rule 15Ba1-6(b), any change to the name or address of each agent for service of
process must be communicated promptly to the Commission by filing a new Form MA-NR. Rule
15Ba1-6(c) requires each non-resident municipal advisor, general partner and managing agent of a
registered municipal advisor, and each natural person associated with a registered municipal advisor
that engages in municipal advisory activities on its behalf to promptly appoint a successor agent for

1833

See Rule 15Ba1-6(a)(2).
537

service of process and file a new Form MA-NR if the non-resident municipal advisor, general
partner, managing agent, or associated person discharges its identified agent for service of process
or if its agent for service of process is unwilling or unable to accept service on behalf of the nonresident municipal advisor, general partner, managing agent, or associated person. Rule 15Ba1-6(d)
requires each non-resident municipal advisory firm to provide an opinion of counsel that the nonresident municipal advisory firm can, as a matter of law, provide the Commission with access to its
books and records and can, as a matter of law, submit to inspection and examination by the
Commission.
Non-resident municipal advisors will incur costs to complete Form MA-NR and obtain an
opinion of counsel. 1834 Non-resident municipal advisory firms may incur one-time costs to
establish new internal controls, such as procedures for obtaining the information required by Form
MA-NR. These one-time costs are included in the estimates below. In the Proposal, the
Commission estimated that the initial cost for non-resident municipal advisory firms, non-resident
general partners, and non-resident managing agents to complete Form MA-NR and for non-resident
municipal advisory firms to obtain an opinion of counsel that the municipal advisory firm can
provide prompt access to its books and records and can be subject to onsite inspection and
examination would be approximately $8,300. 1835 The Commission did not receive any comments
on this estimate. The Commission now estimates the initial PRA cost to complete Form MA-NR
and obtain opinions of counsel will be approximately $12,042. 1836 The anticipated costs are higher
1834

See supra Section VII.D.5 (estimating the number of persons required to complete Form
MA-NR).

1835

$5,100 (estimated cost for non-resident municipal advisory firms, non-resident general
partners, and non-resident managing agents to complete Form MA-NR) + $3,200 (estimated
cost for non-resident municipal advisory firms to obtain an opinion of counsel) = $8,300.
See Proposal, 76 FR at 877.

1836

(48 hours (estimated initial hourly burden under the rules for all respondents to complete a
538

than those estimated in the Proposal because Commission staff is including certain associated
persons in this estimate. 1837
In addition, as discussed below, the Commission anticipates there will be ongoing costs
related to filing Form MA-NR. 1838 In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the ongoing
annual costs for non-resident municipal advisory firms, non-resident general partners, and nonresident managing agents to complete Form MA-NR and for non-resident municipal advisory firms
to obtain an opinion of counsel that the municipal advisory firm can provide prompt access to its
books and records and can be subject to onsite inspection and examination would be approximately
$1,440. 1839 The Commission did not receive any comments on this estimate. The Commission now
estimates that the ongoing annual PRA cost for non-resident municipal advisory firms to update
Form MA-NR and/or file a new Form MA-NR and for non-resident municipal advisory firms to
obtain new opinions of counsel, as described above, will be approximately $2,369. 1840 The

Form MA-NR) × $166 (combined hourly rate for a Compliance Manager and Compliance
Clerk)) + ((6 hours (estimated initial hourly burden under the rules for all respondents to
obtain opinion of counsel) × $379 (hourly rate for an in-house attorney)) + (2 (non-resident
municipal advisory firms expected to provide opinion of counsel) × $900 (average estimated
cost to hire outside counsel for providing an opinion of counsel))) = $12,042. See supra
notes 1544–1548 and accompanying text (estimating the initial hourly burden under the
rules for all respondents to complete a Form MA-NR and the initial hourly burden under the
rules for all respondents to obtain opinion of counsel); supra note 1779 (discussing the
hourly rate for an in-house attorney); supra note 1812 (calculating the combined hourly
rate).
1837

See supra Section III.A.6.a. The estimated costs are also higher due to an increase in the
hourly rate of an in-house attorney and inclusion of the cost non-resident municipal advisory
firms will incur to hire outside counsel to provide an opinion of counsel.

1838

Non-resident municipal advisors will incur recurring costs to monitor and maintain the
information required by Form MA-NR. These costs are included in the estimates below.

1839

$340 (estimated ongoing annual cost for non-resident municipal advisory firms, non-resident
general partners, and non-resident managing agents to complete Form MA-NR) + $1,100
(estimated ongoing annual cost for non-resident municipal advisory firms to obtain an
opinion of counsel) = $1,440. See Proposal, 76 FR at 877.
539

anticipated costs are higher than those estimated in the Proposal due to an increase in the hourly rate
of an in-house attorney and inclusion of the cost non-resident municipal advisory firms will incur to
hire outside counsel to provide an opinion of counsel.
d. Alternatives
One alternative to the rules and forms adopted today would be for the Commission to make
the temporary registration regime permanent. In this alternative, municipal advisors currently
registered under the temporary registration regime would not incur the new costs to register with the
Commission. 1841 Similarly, new entrants to the municipal advisor market would incur the
comparatively lower costs to register under the temporary registration regime. 1842 In establishing
the temporary registration regime, however, the Commission intended to adopt a permanent
registration regime that would, among other things, require municipal advisors to provide more
information on Form MA than that required by Form MA-T, including information regarding
conflicts of interest and increased information regarding disciplinary history. By requiring this
additional information and requiring submission through the Commission’s EDGAR system,
Commission staff will be able to retrieve and analyze the data it needs more efficiently, which

1840

(2 hours (estimated ongoing annual hourly burden under the rules for respondents to
complete a Form MA-NR) × $166 (combined hourly rate for a Compliance Manager and
Compliance Clerk)) + ((3 hours (estimated ongoing annual hourly burden under the rules for
all respondents to obtain opinion of counsel) × $379 (hourly rate for an in-house attorney)) +
(1 (non-resident municipal advisory firms expected to provide opinion of counsel) × $900
(average estimated cost to hire outside counsel for providing an opinion of counsel))) =
$2,369. See supra note 1556–1558 (estimating the ongoing annual hourly burden under the
rules for respondents to complete a Form MA-NR and estimating the ongoing burden to
provide an opinion of counsel); supra note 1779 (discussing the hourly rate for an in-house
attorney); supra note 1812 (calculating the combined hourly rate). This estimate is lower
than the estimate in the Proposal due to a reduction in the combined hourly rate. See supra
note 1812 (discussing the reduction in the combined hourly rate).

1841

See supra Section VIII.D.3.b.

1842

See supra Section VIII.C.2.
540

should enhance the Commission’s ability to carry out its mission with respect to municipal advisory
activities effectively. In addition, as discussed above, the permanent registration regime could
improve the municipal advisor selection process and incentivize municipal advisors not to engage in
misconduct. 1843
Similarly, the Commission believes that to make the temporary registration regime
permanent rather than to establish the permanent registration regime adopted today may not
enhance competition in the market. As discussed above, the Commission believes that requiring
municipal advisors to disclose the information required by the final rules and forms will lead to a
number of benefits beyond the temporary registration regime. For example, municipal entities,
obligated persons, the general public, and others will be able to access information about municipal
advisors electronically through the Commission’s EDGAR system and easily cross-reference
information submitted through IARD and CRD. Enhancing the ability of municipal entities and
obligated persons to compare and consider municipal advisors in the municipal advisor selection
process could result in increased quality-based competition relative to the baseline, which could, in
turn, lead to reduced issuance costs and better financing terms. 1844
The Commission also considered whether to provide an alternative registration program for
persons that are already registered with the Commission in another capacity. Some commenters
indicated that Form MA is largely duplicative of other registration forms (e.g., Form BD, Form
ADV) required for other persons (e.g., broker-dealers, investment advisers). 1845 One commenter
suggested persons already registered with the Commission could check an additional box on their

1843

See supra Section VIII.D.3.b.

1844

See supra notes 1830–1832 and accompanying text.

1845

See, e.g., SIFMA Letter I; Financial Services Roundtable Letter; NASAA Letter.
541

primary registration forms, or the Commission could provide a short-form registration process. 1846
As discussed above, the Commission has determined not to create a separate registration
program for entities that are already registered with the Commission in another capacity. The
Commission does not believe that such an approach would achieve the goal of creating a
registration system specific to municipal advisors. Form MA, while modeled primarily on Form
ADV and Form BD, is designed to capture information regarding the activities of municipal
advisors and the markets that they serve that would not otherwise be captured in other forms. This
information will permit the Commission to decide whether to grant or deny an application for
registration; to manage the Commission’s regulatory and examination programs; and to make such
information available to the MSRB to better inform its regulation of municipal advisors. In
addition, having information about municipal advisors in a single location could improve the
municipal advisor selection process. 1847
Further, the Commission believes that, based on the expertise and experience of its
enforcement and examinations staff, for purposes of regulation, it is appropriate to collect
information regarding the financial industry and other activities of associated persons involved in
the municipal securities market, including swap dealers, major swap participants, and engineers and
engineering firms. The Commission believes that to allow investment advisers to register as
municipal advisors using Form ADV would not provide comparable information about certain
associated persons of municipal advisors.
In addition, requiring municipal advisors to file a registration form specifically tailored to
their municipal advisory activities is consistent with the broader public interest to make available to
the public information about municipal advisors. Absent a form specific to municipal advisors, a
1846

See SIFMA Letter I.

1847

See supra Section VIII.D.3.b.
542

municipal entity or obligated person seeking information about a municipal advisor may not realize
that the data was available on Form BD or Form ADV. The Commission believes that persons
seeking to compile, compare, and analyze data pertaining to the entire universe of registered
municipal advisors, and regulators overseeing compliance with the rules and regulations applicable
to municipal advisors, should be able to access relevant information easily within one system. 1848
As proposed and adopted, Form MA will permit municipal advisors, to the extent that the
disclosures required on Form MA have been disclosed on Form ADV or BD, to incorporate such
information by reference. 1849 Specifically, each of the DRPs of Form MA permits incorporation by
reference to DRPs with similar disclosure requirements that are already on file with regulators. The
disclosures required on the DRPs are generally the disclosures where the most significant amount of
detail is requested on Form MA and on which applicants will likely need to expend the most time
and effort. 1850 The Commission believes allowing incorporation by reference is appropriate because
it will reduce redundancy and costs that some municipal advisors will incur in completing Form
MA. 1851

1848

The ability to incorporate by reference any required information about the disciplinary
history of an applicant or associated person from a DRP or other disclosure that already has
been filed relieves the regulatory burden on applicants who can do so. However, the
Commission recognizes that such incorporation by reference may make it somewhat more
difficult for regulators and other market participants to compile, compare, and analyze data
regarding municipal advisors within one system.

1849

See supra Section III.A.2.

1850

See supra Section III.A.2.b.

1851

As discussed above, the Commission’s estimates of the time required to complete Form MA
and Form MA-I represent averages. The Commission emphasizes that, depending on the
specific circumstances of the municipal advisory firm, the initial burden to complete Form
MA and Form MA-I will vary greatly from respondent to respondent given uncertainty
about the number of municipal advisors that will incorporate by reference and the extent of
information that will be incorporated by reference. Accordingly, although Form MA and
Form MA-I generally allow incorporation by reference of certain information, the
Commission does not have the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of the
543

Another alternative to the rules and forms adopted today would be to require, as the
Commission proposed, each natural person municipal advisor to register with the Commission on
Form MA-I separately. The Commission received several comments objecting to this requirement.
Some commenters argued that there was no statutory justification to register natural persons as
municipal advisors separately. 1852 Commenters also stated that registering individuals would be
excessively burdensome, 1853 including on small municipal advisors. 1854 Another commenter stated
that dual reporting on Form MA and Form MA-I could lead to confusion and inadvertent
inconsistencies in the information. 1855 As discussed above, the Commission has decided not to
require natural person municipal advisors (other than sole proprietors) to register as municipal
advisors (although such persons will be subject to the other requirements of the municipal advisor
regulatory regime). 1856 Had the Commission required natural person municipal advisors to register
with the Commission, these persons would have incurred aggregate costs of approximately
$5,602,500. 1857 The Commission recognizes, however, that municipal advisory firms will now bear
this cost to submit Form MA-I for natural person municipal advisors, which as discussed above will
be $5,602,500. 1858

4. Books and Records to Be Made and Maintained by Municipal Advisors (Rule
15Ba1-8)
As part of the permanent registration regime mandated by the Dodd-Frank Act, Rule 15Ba18 sets forth requirements for books and records relating to the business of municipal advisors.
Among other things, the rule requires that municipal advisory firms maintain and preserve all books
and records required to be made and kept under the rule for a period of not less than five years, the
first two years in an easily accessible place. 1859
a.

Recordkeeping Costs and Benefits

Municipal advisors are likely to incur a number of costs in connection with the
recordkeeping requirements, including recurring costs related to the maintenance and storage of
books and records, as required by the rule. Municipal advisory firms will also need to provide
applicable training to ensure compliance with the recordkeeping requirements. In the Proposal, the
Commission estimated that the ongoing annual labor cost for all municipal advisory firms to
comply with the recordkeeping requirement would be approximately $9,050,000. 1860 The
Commission now estimates that the annual labor cost for all municipal advisory firms to comply
with the recordkeeping requirement will be approximately $8,777,860. 1861

1859

See supra Section III.C.

See Proposal, 76 FR at 878.

1861

910 (number of Form MA applicants) × 182 hours (estimated average hourly burden for
municipal advisory firms to comply with the books and records requirement) × $53 (hourly
rate for a General Clerk) = $8,777,860. See supra notes 1688–1691 and accompanying text.
The $53 per hour figure for a General Clerk is from the SIFMA’s Office Salaries in the
Securities Industry 2012, as modified by Commission staff to account for an 1,800-hour
work-year and multiplied by 2.93 to account for bonuses, firm size, employee benefits, and
overhead. The Commission is updating the hourly rate for a General Clerk from $50 to $53
to conform to SIFMA’s Office Salaries in the Securities Industry 2012. This estimate is
lower than the estimate in the Proposal because the Commission estimates there will be
fewer initial Form MA applicants than was estimated in the Proposal. See supra notes
1442–1446 and accompanying text.

Municipal advisors should already maintain books and records as part of their day-to-day
operations. The recordkeeping requirement, however, provides specific parameters relating to the
retention and maintenance of certain books and records that may be more extensive than current
market practices. Nevertheless, the Commission does not believe that currently operating municipal
advisory firms that already keep business records similar to those required by the rule will be
subject to significant additional recordkeeping costs as a result of the rule. For example, municipal
advisors already registered with the Commission as broker-dealers and/or investment advisers likely
already retain this type of information.
As noted above, the Commission recognizes that these costs may impact those municipal
advisory firms that are not already registered under another regulatory regime to a greater degree
than they would impact municipal advisory firms that have previously registered as investment
advisers or brokers-dealers. With respect to the books and records requirements of Rule 15Ba1-8,
the Commission currently anticipates that municipal advisory firms may incur one-time costs in
establishing the new internal controls and systems necessary to comply with the recordkeeping
requirements of the rule. The Commission believes that the costs to establish new internal controls
will be less for municipal advisory firms that are currently regulated with respect to their other
activities because the final rule allows some records to be maintained in compliance with those
other regulations. 1862 The Commission does not have the information necessary to provide a
reasonable estimate of the difference in costs for firms that already have internal controls and
systems because these internal controls and systems vary from firm to firm. The Commission
1862

See Rule 15Ba1-8(e)(1). The Commission’s estimated average burden to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements includes the costs to establish new internal controls and systems
necessary to comply with the recordkeeping requirements. However, the Commission
recognizes that those firms should realize reduced costs by leveraging the existing internal
controls and systems, as well as familiarity with books and records requirements under other
regulatory regimes.
546

believes that these costs may also be reduced for municipal advisory firms that have voluntarily
adopted similar recordkeeping practices. 1863 The Commission anticipates, however, that these costs
may be higher for solicitors and for other municipal advisory firms that are not otherwise regulated
or have not voluntarily adopted similar recordkeeping practices.
The Commission has made two substantive modifications to the recordkeeping requirements
since the Proposal. As discussed above, Rule 15Ba1-8(a)(2) will require municipal advisors to
maintain general ledgers, a requirement that was inadvertently left out of proposed Rule 15Ba17. 1864 In addition, as discussed above, Rule 15Ba1-8(a)(8) will require each municipal advisory
firm to retain written consents to service of process from each natural person who is a person
associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities solely on behalf
of such registered municipal advisor. 1865 In light of these changes, the Commission now estimates
that the average annual burden for a municipal advisory firm to comply with the recordkeeping
requirements will be approximately 182 hours.
One commenter argued that the information technology and storage facilities required for all
e-mail or similar electronic communications is expensive. The commenter believed that, regardless
of whether a firm were to develop a technology solution in-house or hire an IT professional, the cost
would be significant to firms, especially those with limited revenue. 1866 This commenter, however,

1863

The Commission does not have the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate
of the difference in costs for firms that already have voluntarily adopted similar
recordkeeping practices because these recordkeeping practices vary from firm to firm.
However, the Commission recognizes that to the extent these recordkeeping practices are
already in place, certain municipal advisors should incur lower costs to comply than those
that do not have recordkeeping practices in place.

1864

See supra notes 1359–1360 and accompanying text.

1865

See supra Section VII.D.7.

1866

See NAIPFA Letter.
547

did not provide specific figures by which to recalculate the Commission’s estimate, making it
difficult to evaluate these assertions.
As stated above, the books and records estimate, as proposed, was meant to include storage
costs and any needed technology refinements or upgrades. The Commission staff understands
based on discussions with market participants that, although larger financial institutions may
generally need to invest in more expensive technology solutions to manage their recordkeeping,
smaller municipal advisory firms with smaller clienteles may not require significant expenditures on
storage and technology to the extent they retain most of their records in their existing e-mail
systems. 1867 Furthermore, the Commission staff understands that many of the smallest municipal
advisory firms and sole proprietors may use third-party electronic mail systems that offer free and
effectively unlimited cloud storage and would be less likely to incur significant storage costs. For
these reasons, the Commission believes that the variety of technology and storage solutions, and
their resulting costs, are properly accounted for in the cost estimates.
Another commenter asserted that the Commission used an hourly rate for the books and
records cost that was too low for small entity municipal advisors. The commenter argued, “[t]he
figure [of 181 hours] was based on record keeping by ‘General Clerks’ at $50 per hour. If similar
rules are imposed on Small Entity Municipal Advisors (many of whom are solo practitioners) that
do not typically have ‘General Clerks,’ the correct hourly rate should be $170 per hour (a figure
frequently used by the Commission in the Release), which would equate to $30,770 per
advisor.” 1868
While the Commission acknowledges that small municipal advisors do not typically employ
1867

Larger firms that already have technology solutions in place would likely incur lower costs
than those that need to develop new technology solutions.

1868

See Joy Howard WM Financial Strategies Letter.
548

General Clerks and that, in many cases, the municipal advisory professional himself may be
responsible for maintaining the books and records of the firm, the Commission does not believe that
it should use a higher hourly rate to estimate the recordkeeping burden for small municipal advisors
for several reasons. The 182-hour estimate is an average annual hourly burden across all firms
regardless of their size, and is based on the Commission’s experience with other regulatory regimes.
The Commission anticipates that larger municipal advisory firms that offer a variety of services to
municipal entities and have significantly greater volumes of books and records will incur an annual
burden greater than 182 hours, while smaller municipal advisory firms that have significantly lower
volumes of books and records will incur an annual burden lower than 182 hours. Similarly, the $53
figure is an average hourly rate across all firms regardless of their size and is inclusive of the
variability of costs across municipal advisors. The Commission does not have the information
necessary to provide reasonable estimates of the differences in hourly burden among firms of
various sizes, a separate average hourly burden for small entity municipal advisors, or the
differences in hourly rates among firms of various sizes. The Commission is also unaware of any
such data being publicly available. The Commission staff also understands that some small
municipal advisors employ part-time staff to perform certain business and clerical functions and that
the costs of such employees are less likely to reflect the costs for compliance personnel at larger
municipal advisory firms or the hourly rate suggested by the commenter. The Commission assumes
that municipal advisors will use the most cost-effective approach available, depending on their size
and specific circumstances, to comply with the recordkeeping requirement. Accordingly, the
Commission does not believe that it should use a higher hourly rate to estimate the recordkeeping
burden for small municipal advisors.
However, as stated above, the Commission believes that small municipal advisory firms will

549

likely incur lower annual costs for maintaining books and records than larger firms. The
Commission recognizes that, although small municipal advisory firms and solo practitioners may
maintain their books and records without a general clerk or additional staff assistance, such activity
would not be costless. The Commission believes that it is appropriate to assume that, because small
firms will utilize the most cost-effective approach available, per-hour costs attributable to the books
and records requirements will be, at most, equivalent to the hourly rate for a General Clerk.
Therefore, the Commission uses the hourly rate for a General Clerk to estimate the average cost
across all municipal advisory firms, regardless of size. The Commission also addresses the burden
for smaller municipal advisory firms in the Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis below. 1869
Despite these costs, as discussed above, the recordkeeping requirements will benefit the
municipal securities market by enhancing the Commission’s ability to oversee municipal
advisors. 1870 Recordkeeping requirements are a familiar and important element of the
Commission’s approach to investment adviser and broker-dealer regulation, and are designed to
maintain the efficiency and effectiveness of the Commission’s examination program for regulated
entities, which facilitates the Commission’s review of their compliance with statutory mandates and
with Commission rules.
b. Alternatives
As an alternative to the recordkeeping requirement adopted today, the Commission
considered creating a unique recordkeeping requirement for municipal advisors different from the
standard recordkeeping practices under federal securities law. The Commission has determined not
to create a unique recordkeeping requirement because it expects that many entities already
registered with the Commission in another capacity, such as investment advisers and broker-dealers,
1869

See infra Section IX.

1870

See supra Section VIII.D.1.a.
550

would likely incur higher, and in many ways redundant, costs to comply with this type of regime.
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that the average hourly burden for municipal
advisory firms to comply with the books and records requirement will be approximately 182 hours
per year. 1871 The Commission anticipates that the average hourly burden estimate would be higher
to the extent the alternative recordkeeping requirement did not allow entities to maintain books and
records in a manner consistent with other regulations under the securities laws. As discussed above,
with respect to the recordkeeping requirement adopted today, the Commission believes costs may
be reduced for firms that are currently registered with the Commission with respect to their other
activities (because the final rule allows some records to be maintained in compliance with those
other regulations) and for firms that have voluntarily adopted similar recordkeeping practices. 1872 If
the Commission established a unique recordkeeping requirement for municipal advisors, the
Commission believes that many municipal advisors would incur higher costs due to the inability to
leverage experience, systems, and practices developed to comply with the similar recordkeeping
practices under federal securities law.
5. Exclusions from the Definition of Municipal Advisor
a.

Programmatic, Registration, and Recordkeeping Costs and Benefits

As discussed above, 1873 the Dodd-Frank Act included a number of statutory exclusions from
the definition of municipal advisor. 1874 The Commission is adopting interpretations of these

1871

See supra Section VII.D.8.

1872

See supra note 1862–1863 and accompanying text.

1873

See supra Section III.A.1.c.

1874

Section 15B(e)(4)(C) of the Exchange Act provides that the term municipal advisor does not
include (1) a broker, dealer, or municipal securities dealer serving as an underwriter (as
defined in Section 2(a)(11) of the Securities Act); (2) any investment adviser registered
under the Investment Advisers Act, or persons associated with such investment advisers who
are providing investment advice; (3) any commodity trading advisor registered under the
551

statutory exclusions that are consistent with the Commission’s understanding of Congress’s intent
not to provide blanket exclusions from the municipal advisor regulatory regime for underwriters,
registered investment advisers, commodity trading advisors, attorneys, and engineers, regardless of
the activities in which they are engaged. In adopting these interpretations, the Commission has
considered the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs that these persons would incur
absent an exclusion from the definition of municipal advisor.
Given the limitations on the Commission’s ability to conduct a quantitative assessment of
the programmatic costs and benefits associated with interpreting the statutory exclusions, 1875 the
Commission has considered the programmatic costs and benefits primarily in qualitative terms. In
addition, the Commission has quantified many of the registration and recordkeeping costs that result
from the final rules and forms. Relying primarily on the programmatic, registration, and
recordkeeping costs and benefits, the Commission believes it is possible to identify those persons
that, because of the activities in which they engage, appear to be the types of persons for which the
other statutory requirements of Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act were not intended.
As discussed above, persons subject to the municipal advisor regulatory regime are subject
to programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs. As indicated throughout this release, and as
discussed further below, the Commission is mindful of these costs and has interpreted the statutory
exclusions in a manner that is consistent with the purposes of Section 15B of the Exchange Act to
regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities and that is intended to help minimize
compliance burdens. The Commission’s interpretations of the statutory exclusions are designed to

CEA or persons associated with a commodity trading advisor who are providing advice
related to swaps; (4) attorneys offering legal advice or providing services that are of a
traditional legal nature; or (5) engineers providing engineering advice. See 15 U.S.C. 78o4(e)(4)(C).
1875

See supra note 1742.
552

reduce redundant regulation of entities engaged in activities related to municipal entities that are
appropriately regulated under another regime. Accordingly, the Commission is adopting an
interpretation of the statutory exclusion for underwriters that applies only to those underwriters that
engage in municipal advisory activities that are within the scope of an underwriting. 1876 The
Commission is also adopting an interpretation of the statutory investment adviser exclusion that
would permit a registered investment adviser to provide advice concerning the investment of
proceeds of municipal securities, but not advice concerning whether and how to issue municipal
securities, advice concerning the structure, timing, and terms of an issuance of municipal securities
and other similar matters, advice concerning municipal derivatives, or a solicitation of a municipal
entity or obligated person, without registering as a municipal advisor. 1877 Similarly, the
Commission is adopting an interpretation of the statutory commodity trading advisor exclusion that
is limited to registered commodity trading advisors and associated persons thereof providing advice
related to swaps in the capacity as a registered commodity trading advisor that is subject to the
Commodity Exchange Act. 1878 The interpretations of the statutory attorney exclusion and the
statutory engineering exclusion the Commission is adopting today are designed to permit attorneys
to offer legal advice or provide services that are of a traditional legal nature 1879 and engineers to
provide engineering advice 1880 without having to register with the Commission as a municipal
advisor. The Commission does not believe that imposing an additional layer of regulation,
1876

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(i). In response to comments, the Commission is also providing lists
of activities that the Commission would consider to be within or outside the scope of an
underwriting. See supra Section III.A.1.c.iv.

1877

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(ii).

1878

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(iii). Under this exclusion, a registered commodity trading advisor
could provide advice relating to swaps without registering as a municipal advisor.

1879

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(iv).

1880

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(2)(v).
553

including the fiduciary duty imposed upon municipal advisors when advising municipal entities, on
the persons described above would provide benefits that would justify the burden (i.e., the
programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs discussed throughout the economic analysis) of
municipal advisor regulation.
Because the Commission’s interpretations of the statutory exclusions are consistent with
Section 15B(e) of the Exchange Act, the Commission believes that those persons that do not
currently qualify for a statutory exclusion should already be registered with the Commission and the
MSRB under the temporary registration regime. Accordingly, because the Commission has
interpreted the statutory exclusions consistent with the statute, the number of persons for which a
statutory exclusion is available should not change significantly and any differences from the
baseline with regard to the number of municipal advisors required to register with the Commission
and the MSRB should be minimal. The Commission also believes that any differences from the
baseline with regard to the programmatic costs and benefits related to the statutory requirements
and MSRB rules that are currently operative should be minimal because they would have already
been incurred under the temporary registration regime. In addition, there should be no significant
impact on efficiency, competition, and capital formation relative to the baseline because those
market participants for which an exclusion is not available should have already registered with the
Commission and the MSRB under the temporary registration regime and be complying with the
requirements of Section 15B of the Exchange Act and MSRB rules.
Those persons who provide municipal advisory services and are not excluded from the
definition of municipal advisor as described above, however, will incur the programmatic,
registration, and recordkeeping costs of the municipal advisor regulatory regime. Accordingly,
underwriters that engage in municipal advisory activities outside the scope of underwriting an

554

issuance of municipal securities; investment advisers that provide advice concerning whether and
how to issue municipal securities, advice concerning the structure, timing, and terms of issuances of
municipal securities and other similar matters, advice concerning municipal derivatives, or a
solicitation; commodity trading advisors that are not a registered commodity trading advisor or that
provide advice with respect to an issuance of municipal securities or any municipal financial
product other than a swap; attorneys that represent themselves as financial advisors or financial
experts in connection with the issuance of municipal securities or municipal financial products and
engage in municipal advisory activities; and engineers that provide municipal advisory activities
beyond engineering advice, will incur the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs
discussed throughout this release.
The Commission believes such persons should continue to be subject to the municipal
advisor regulatory regime, including a fiduciary duty to municipal entity clients and the standards of
conduct, training, and testing as may be required by the Commission or the MSRB, and other
requirements as may be imposed by the MSRB. 1881 As discussed above, the Commission believes
that the municipal advisor regulatory regime could incentivize municipal advisors not to engage in
misconduct relative to the baseline because of the enhanced disclosure requirements of the
permanent registration regime. 1882 Municipal advisors will continue to be subject to Commission
oversight, including periodic examinations, and may be subject to disciplinary action for
misconduct. 1883 In addition, certain municipal advisors will now be subject to periodic

1881

While the underwriting activities of brokers, dealers, and municipal securities dealers in
connection with an issuance of municipal securities are currently subject to MSRB rules,
those rules generally do not apply to municipal advisory activities that are outside the scope
of an underwriting.

1882

1883

See supra note 1680 and accompanying text.
555

examinations by FINRA to evaluate compliance with the Exchange Act, the rules and regulations
thereunder, and MSRB rules. 1884
b. Alternatives
One alternative to the rules adopted today would be for the Commission not to engage in
additional rulemaking, and thus, not to further clarify the statutory exclusions from the definition of
municipal advisor. As discussed above, 1885 the Commission believes that the assessment costs
associated with determining whether a person would be required to register as a municipal advisor
would be greater in the absence of the rules the Commission is adopting today. Without these rules,
market participants would still need to analyze whether their activities fall within a statutory
exclusion and would likely need to seek no-action relief and other guidance from the Commission
or Commission staff, or risk failing to register with the Commission as required. 1886 The
Commission believes that the final rules provide extensive guidance to market participants that
should reduce the number of requests for no-action relief and other guidance from the Commission
or Commission staff, which, in turn, should lead to lower assessment costs for many firms. 1887
The Commission also considered whether to interpret the statutory exclusions using a statusbased approach, as suggested by commenters, rather than an activity-based approach. For example,
some commenters called for an exclusion for broker-dealers that would exclude broker-dealers
based on their status as a regulated entity. 1888 Similarly, some commenters argued that the statute

1884

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(b)(2)(E); 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(7)(A)(iii).

1885

See supra Section VIII.D.1.c.

1886

In addition, without this guidance, a greater number of market participants would likely
decide to register as municipal advisors unnecessarily and thereby incur the programmatic,
registration, and recordkeeping costs of the municipal advisor regulatory regime.

1887

See supra Section VIII.D.1.c.

1888

See supra note 580 and accompanying text.
556

excludes any registered investment adviser, without limitation. 1889
Although persons excluded under a status-based approach would not incur the
programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs of the regulatory regime, the Commission has
determined that to provide status-based exclusions would be inconsistent with the purposes of the
Dodd-Frank Act to regulate persons that engage in municipal advisory activities. The Commission
believes that a status-based approach would permit many persons to provide municipal advisory
services without being subject to the regulatory regime, which could cause municipal entities and
obligated persons to receive municipal advice without the protections of the regime and limit the
Commission’s ability to oversee the municipal advisory activities of those excluded persons. The
Commission believes these other regimes are not designed to address directly municipal advisory
activities and may not provide similar protections to municipal entities and obligated persons. In
addition, persons excluded under a status-based approach would not be required to register with the
Commission, which would reduce any benefits of the permanent registration regime to the
municipal advisor selection process. 1890 The Commission is also concerned that interpreting the
exclusions using a status-based approach could create inappropriate competitive advantages for
covered categories of market participants.
Another alternative the Commission considered was to interpret some of the statutory
exclusions in a manner that would allow otherwise regulated persons to engage in municipal
advisory activities that are solely incidental to their regulated activities. Some commenters stated
that the Commission should exclude from registration broker-dealers that provide advice that is
solely incidental to a transaction, similar to the broker-dealer exclusion under Section 202(a)(11)(C)

1889

See, e.g., Vanguard Letter; IAA Letter; ICI Letter.

1890

See supra Section VIII.D.3.b.
557

of the Investment Advisers Act. 1891 Another commenter expressed concern that commodity trading
advisers that provide ancillary services in connection with advice related to swaps would need to
register as municipal advisors if the ancillary services fall within the scope of municipal advisory
activities and are not deemed to be the type of advice described in the commodity trading advisor
exclusion. 1892
The Commission does not believe it is necessary to interpret the statutory exclusions in a
manner that would permit municipal advisory activities that are solely incidental to other regulated
activities, and believes that the result would be substantially similar to a status-based approach. 1893
Interpreting the statutory exclusions in this manner could result in a difficult facts-andcircumstances analysis to determine whether the exclusions apply, which is unlikely to result in any
assessment savings. In addition, the Commission has provided additional exemptions that would
limit the circumstances under which a person could be considered a municipal advisor and the range
of municipal financial products to which duplicative regulation could apply. 1894
6. Exemptions from the Definition of Municipal Advisor
a.

Programmatic, Registration, and Recordkeeping Costs and Benefits

As discussed above, 1895 the Dodd-Frank Act granted the Commission authority to
1891

See supra note 580 and accompanying text.

1892

See MFA Letter.

1893

See supra notes 1888–1890 and accompanying text.

1894

For example, the Commission is providing an exemption for any person engaging in
municipal advisory activities in a circumstance in which a municipal entity or obligated
person is otherwise represented by an independent registered municipal advisor. See Rule
15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi). In addition, the Commission is exempting from the definition of
municipal advisor persons that provide advice with respect to investment strategies that are
not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities or the
recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments. See Rule 15Ba11(d)(3)(vii).

1895

See supra Section III.A.1.c.
558

conditionally or unconditionally exempt, by rule or order, upon its own motion or upon application,
any municipal advisor or class of municipal advisors from any provision of Section 15B of the
Exchange Act or the rules or regulations thereunder, if the Commission finds that such exemption is
consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors, and the purposes of Section 15B. 1896
The final rules provide exemptions from the definition of municipal advisor, subject to specified
conditions, for (1) public officials and employees of municipal entities and obligated persons; (2)
banks; (3) swap dealers; (4) accountants; (5) persons engaging in municipal advisory activities with
a municipal entity or obligated person that is represented by an independent registered municipal
advisor; and (6) persons responding to RFPs or RFQs. As discussed below, the Commission
believes that these exemptions are consistent with the public interest, the protection of investors,
and the purposes of Section 15B. In providing these exemptions, the Commission has considered
the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs, which are discussed throughout the
economic analysis, that these persons would incur absent an exemption from the definition of
municipal advisor. The Commission has designed these exemptions to provide that municipal
entities and obligated persons receive municipal advisory services with the protections of the
municipal advisor regulatory regime.
Given the limitations on the Commission’s ability to conduct a quantitative assessment of
the programmatic costs and benefits associated with providing these exemptions, 1897 the
Commission has considered these costs and benefits primarily in qualitative terms. In addition, the
Commission has quantified many of the registration and recordkeeping costs that result from the
final rules and forms. Relying primarily on the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs
and benefits, the Commission believes it is possible to identify those persons that, because of the
1896

See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)(4).

1897

See supra note 1742.
559

activities in which they engage, appear to be the types of persons for which the other statutory
requirements of Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act were not intended.
The Commission is exempting from the definition of municipal advisor: (1) any person
serving as a member of a governing body, an advisory board, or a committee of, or acting in a
similar official capacity with respect to, or as an official of, a municipal entity or obligated person to
the extent that such person is acting within the scope of such person’s official capacity; and (2) any
employee of a municipal entity or obligated person to the extent that such person is acting within
the scope of such person’s employment. 1898 The Commission believes that this exemption will
significantly reduce the number of individuals who would otherwise have needed to register as
municipal advisors. Some commenters asserted that, as proposed, thousands of board members
would be required to register as municipal advisors. 1899
The Commission believes the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs such
board members would incur would not justify the benefits of registration for a number of reasons.
The Commission believes that individuals who engage in deliberative and decision-making
functions with respect to municipal financial products or the issuance of municipal securities as part
of their duties as members of a governing body should not have to register as municipal advisors
because they are agents of the municipal entity that is the intended recipient of the protections of the
municipal advisor regulatory regime. Board members and other officials (appointed and elected
alike, as well as their duly appointed designees) may be subject to state and local law, including
fiduciary duties and ethics laws, and the statutory qualifications for such members’ board position
1898

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(ii). See also supra note 507 and accompanying text (discussing the
Commission’s interpretation of the statutory exclusion from the definition of “municipal
advisor” for employees of municipal entities by exempting such employees “to the extent
that such person is acting within the scope of such person’s employment”).

1899

See, e.g., Bachus Letter; Marchant Letter.
560

may be significant to the mission of the municipal entity. In addition, as noted by commenters,
there would be costs to municipal entities as the requirement to register as a municipal advisor
could reduce the number of persons willing to volunteer for boards or could limit what volunteers
would say. The Commission believes this exemption appropriately balances consideration of the
need to protect municipal entities with the preservation of volunteer services by not requiring board
members to register as municipal advisors.
The Commission is also providing exemptions from the definition of municipal advisor for
certain market participants: banks, accountants, and swap dealers. As discussed above, persons
subject to the municipal advisory regulatory regime are subject to a series of programmatic,
registration, and recordkeeping costs. The Commission is exempting from the definition of
municipal advisor banks engaging in certain municipal activities, 1900 certain swap dealers, and
certain accountants. 1901 These exemptions are designed to reduce redundant regulation of entities
engaged in activities related to municipal entities that are appropriately regulated under another
regime. The Commission does not have the information necessary to provide a reasonable estimate
of the number of persons who will rely on these exemptions because Form MA-T does not collect
data on banks, swap dealers, or accountants. To the extent these entities are not required to register
as municipal advisors because of an exemption, they will not incur the programmatic, registration,
1900

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(iii). Because the Commission is exempting from the definition of
municipal advisor persons that provide advice with respect to “investment strategies that are
not plans or programs for the investment of the proceeds of municipal securities or the
recommendation of and brokerage of municipal escrow investments” (see Rule 15a11(d)(2)(vii)), the Commission believes that the performance of many of the bank activities
and services about which commenters were concerned will not require banks to register as
municipal advisors.

1901

The Commission is exempting from the definition of municipal advisor any accountant to
the extent that the accountant is providing audit or other attest services, preparing financial
statements, or issuing letters for underwriters for, or on behalf of, a municipal entity or
obligated person. See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(i).
561

and recordkeeping costs discussed throughout the economic analysis, and thus, will realize cost
savings.
The Commission does not believe that imposing an additional layer of regulation, including
the fiduciary duty imposed upon municipal advisors when advising municipal entities, on these
persons would provide benefits that would justify the burden (i.e., the programmatic, registration,
and recordkeeping costs discussed throughout the economic analysis) of municipal advisor
regulation. 1902 Those persons that provide municipal advisory services beyond the activities
described above, and thus, that do not qualify for one of the exemptions, however, will incur the
programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs of the municipal advisor regulatory regime.
The Commission believes that the exemption for banks will help ensure that parties engaging in key
municipal advisory activities are registered, while permitting banks to continue to provide banking
services to municipal entities and obligated persons for which they are currently subject to
regulation. 1903 Similarly, the final rule provides exemptions for registered swap dealers that are
consistent with the exemptions promulgated under Title VII of the Dodd-Frank Act. 1904 The
1902

The Commission received a number of comments about the costs that would be imposed on
banks under the Proposal. See, e.g., Old Point Bank Letter; Union Bank Letter; Texas
Bankers Association Letter; American Bankers Association Letter II. These comment
letters are discussed extensively earlier in this release.

1903

To the extent a bank provides advice with respect to a municipal derivative or engages in
any other non-exempted municipal advisory activity through a SID, Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(4) will
permit the SID to register as a municipal advisor rather than the bank itself. The
Commission believes that permitting SIDs to register instead is in the public interest in that
it will ensure that municipal entities and obligated persons receive the regulatory protection
intended by the statute while not imposing the burdens of the municipal advisor regulatory
regime (i.e., the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs discussed throughout
the economic analysis) on the bank as a whole.

1904

The final rule exempts any registered swap dealer to the extent that such dealer recommends
a municipal derivative or a trading strategy that involves a municipal derivative for sale by
such dealer or an affiliated registered swap to a municipal entity or obligated person,
provided that the dealer meets any applicable safe harbor requirements for parties to such
transactions under the CFTC’s regulatory regime. See supra Section III.A.1.c.vi. The
562

Commission believes it is appropriate to provide an accountant exemption that includes accountants
providing audit or other attest services since both audit and other attest services are generally
subject to regulation and professional standards (including independence requirements) 1905 –
requirements that could potentially conflict with a municipal advisor’s fiduciary duty to its
municipal entity clients. 1906
The Commission is also exempting from the definition of municipal advisor any persons
engaging in municipal advisory activities in a circumstance in which a municipal entity or obligated
person is otherwise represented by an independent registered municipal advisor 1907 with respect to
the same aspects of a municipal financial product or an issuance of municipal securities, subject to
certain requirements. 1908 As long as a municipal entity is represented by an independent registered
municipal advisor, the Commission believes it is desirable to allow municipal entities to receive as
much advice and information as possible from a variety of sources, even if the providers of such

Commission notes that swap dealers will incur costs to qualify for the exemption under the
applicable regulatory regime, and that these costs will likely be lower than the
programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs of the municipal advisor regulatory
regime.

Standards AT §101.06 (providing that “[a]ny professional service resulting in the expression
of assurance must be performed under AICPA professional standards that provide for the
expression of such assurance”).

See AICPA Attestation Standards AT §101.35, 101.36. Accountants providing attest
services are also required to meet general standards related to adequate technical training
and proficiency; adequate knowledge of subject matter; suitability and availability of
criteria; and the exercise of due professional care. See AICPA Attestation Standards AT
§101.19 to 101.41.

1907

The term “independent registered municipal advisor” means a municipal advisor registered
pursuant to Section 15B of the Exchange Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4) and the rules and
regulations thereunder, and that is not, and within the past two years was not, associated
with the person seeking to rely on Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi). See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi)(A).

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(vi). See also supra notes 564–572 and accompanying text
(discussing the requirements for the exemption).

advice are not subject to a fiduciary duty, because such advice could lead to better decision making
where the municipal entity or obligated person also receives the advice of an independent registered
municipal advisor. 1909 The Commission, therefore, does not believe at this time that imposing an
additional layer of regulation, including the fiduciary duty imposed upon municipal advisors when
advising municipal entities, on persons providing advice to a municipal entity that is otherwise
represented by an independent municipal advisor would provide benefits that justify the burden
(i.e., the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs discussed throughout the economic
analysis) of registration.
As discussed above, the Commission believes that underwriters in negotiated deals are the
persons most likely to rely on this exemption. 1910 The Commission estimates the total initial PRA
burden to rely on this exemption in the first year will be $297,339. 1911 The Commission estimates
that the ongoing PRA burden to rely on this exemption in each year after the first will be
$138,159. 1912 In comparison to the registration and recordkeeping costs, estimated above, the
Commission believes that these costs will be minimal, and that persons relying on this exemption
1909

The Commission staff understands based on discussions with market participants that
market participants and others, including underwriters, often are aware of important facts
and are in a position to offer valuable advice and information to municipal entities and
obligated persons. The Commission does not want to curtail the receipt of such advice and
information so long as the municipal entities and obligated persons are represented by
independent registered municipal advisors who are subject to a fiduciary and other duties
and who can help the municipal entities and obligated persons evaluate the advice and
identify potential conflicts of interest.

burden to draft the required disclosure) × $379 (hourly rate for an in-house attorney)) +

Compliance Clerk)) = $297,339. See supra note 1611 and accompanying text; supra note

will realize cost savings by not being subject to the municipal advisor regulatory regime.
The Commission is also exempting from the definition of municipal advisor any person
providing a response in writing or orally to an RFP or RFQ from a municipal entity or obligated
person for services in connection with a municipal financial product or the issuance of municipal
securities, provided that such person does not receive separate direct or indirect compensation for
advice provided as part of such a response. 1913 The Commission believes that responses to RFPs
and RFQs by themselves do not constitute municipal advisory activities, and thus, that imposing an
additional layer of regulation, including the fiduciary duty imposed upon municipal advisors when
advising municipal entities, on persons responding to RFPs and RFQs would provide benefits that
justify the burden (i.e., the programmatic, registration, and recordkeeping costs discussed
throughout the economic analysis) of registration. The Commission does not have the information
necessary to provide a reasonable estimate of the number of persons who may rely on this
exemption because the Commission does not have data regarding the number of persons who
respond to RFPs and RFQs, and is unaware of such data being publicly available. The Commission
staff understands based on discussions with market participants, however, that a significant number
of persons respond to RFPs and RFQs, some of which would be registered municipal advisors;
others may be already-regulated entities, such as Commission-registered investment advisers and
broker-dealers, whose responses may be subject to fair dealing, suitability, fiduciary, or other
standards.
The exemptions adopted today could allow for more-efficient use of resources by persons
that are no longer required to register with the Commission as a municipal advisor pursuant to one
of the exemptions in the final rules because such persons will now be able to put to use the

1913

See Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(iv).
565

resources that would otherwise have been spent registering. However, to the extent that such
persons were registered under the temporary registration regime, the absence of current information
about such persons on Form MA and increased difficulty in finding information about such persons
could reduce informational efficiency relative to the baseline. The exemptions could also improve
competition relative to the baseline among exempted persons engaging in those activities that are
consistent with the relevant exemption to the extent they remain in their respective industry as a
result of an exemption. 1914
b. Alternatives
One alternative to the rules adopted today would be for the Commission not to engage in
additional rulemaking, and thus, not to provide any exemptions from the definition of municipal
advisor. As discussed above, the Commission does not believe that the benefits that would accrue if
the Commission did not provide the exemptions would justify the costs that would accrue from
subjecting certain market participants to potentially conflicting and redundant obligations under the
municipal advisor regulatory regime. In addition, the Commission believes the exemptions provide
greater clarity to market participants by delineating the types of activities that are not subject to the
municipal advisor regulatory regime. To the extent that a person can determine that registration as a
municipal advisor is not required based solely on the availability of an exemption, the Commission
believes the exemptions adopted today should lead to lower assessment costs for many firms. For
example, board members should be able to determine relatively easily whether registration as a
municipal advisor is required. Absent these rules, it is likely that market participants would need to
seek no-action relief and other guidance from the Commission or Commission staff, or risk failing
1914

For example, if swap dealers were required to register as municipal advisors, some might
determine to no longer sell swaps to municipal entities and obligated persons. The
exemption may incentivize such swap dealers to stay in the market and compete with each
other.
566

to register with the Commission, if required. The Commission believes the final rules provide
greater clarity to market participants that should allow them to make determinations without
requesting interpretations from the Commission or Commission staff, which, in turn, should lead to
lower assessment costs for many firms.
The Commission also considered whether to provide exemptions using a status-based
approach rather than an activity-based approach. For example, some commenters called for a
blanket exemption for swap dealers, arguing that registration as a municipal advisor would be
duplicative. 1915 Similarly, some commenters recommended that municipal advisor regulation
should not apply to banks since they are already regulated. 1916
Although persons exempt under a status-based approach would not incur the programmatic,
registration, and recordkeeping costs of the regulatory regime, the Commission believes that to
provide status-based exemptions would be inconsistent with Congress’s intent to regulate persons
that engage in municipal advisory activities. The Commission believes that since the exclusions for
regulated entities in Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act are limited in scope to certain regulated
activity, any exemptions the Commission provides should be similarly limited. For example, the
Commission believes that a bank that provides advice with respect to municipal derivatives or the
issuance of municipal securities should not be exempt unless the bank qualifies for another
exclusion or exemption. Similarly, the Commission believes that a registered swap dealer should be
exempt only if it meets the requirements of Rule 15Ba1-1(d)(3)(v). The Commission believes that a
status-based approach would permit many persons to provide municipal advisory services without
1915

See supra note 748 and accompanying text. Commenters also requested an exemption for
security-based swap dealers. The Commission is not adopting an exemption for securitybased swap dealers at this time. See supra notes 763–765 and accompanying text.

1916

See supra notes 875–878 and accompanying text. Although the Commission is providing
exemptions for certain banking activities, it has determined not to exempt banks entirely
solely because of their status as otherwise regulated entities.
567

being subject to the regulatory regime, which could cause municipal entities and obligated persons
to receive municipal advice without the investor protections of the regime. The Commission also
believes such an approach could limit the Commission’s ability to oversee the municipal advisory
activities of those exempt persons. The Commission believes these other regimes are not designed
to address directly municipal advisory activities and may not provide similar protections to
municipal entities and obligated persons. In addition, persons exempt under a status-based
approach would not be required to register with the Commission, which would reduce any benefits
of the regime to the municipal advisor selection process. 1917 The Commission is also concerned that
providing status-based exemptions could create inappropriate competitive advantages for covered
categories of market participants.
IX.

FINAL REGULATORY FLEXIBILITY ANALYSIS
The Commission has prepared the following Final Regulatory Flexibility Analysis

(“FRFA”) in accordance with Section 4(a) of the Regulatory Flexibility Act (“RFA”). 1918 This
FRFA relates to Rules 240.15Ba1-1 through 240.15Ba1-8 under the Exchange Act, which set forth
the requirements for municipal advisors to register with the Commission and the books and records
that registered municipal advisory firms must make and keep. The Commission prepared an Initial
Regulatory Flexibility Analysis (“IFRA”) in conjunction with the Proposal. 1919
A.

Need for and Objectives of the Rules

The final rules and forms establish a permanent registration regime for municipal advisors in
accordance with Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank Act. Section 15B of the Exchange Act, as
amended by the Dodd-Frank Act, is intended generally to strengthen oversight of the municipal
1917

568

securities markets and to broaden current municipal securities market protections to cover, among
other things, previously unregulated market activity. The rules and forms are designed to meet this
mandate by requiring each municipal advisor to provide basic identifying information, a description
of its activities, and facts regarding disciplinary history and conflicts of interest, if any.
The Commission believes that the information provided pursuant to these rules and forms
will aid municipal entities, obligated persons, and others in choosing municipal advisors or
engaging in transactions with municipal advisors, including participating in transactions of
municipal securities offerings in which a municipal advisor provided municipal advisory services.
In addition, the information disclosed pursuant to the rules and forms will provide significant value
to the Commission in its oversight of municipal advisors and their activities in the municipal
securities markets.
B.

Significant Issues Raised by Public Comment

In the Proposal, the Commission solicited comment on the IRFA. In particular, the
Commission sought comment on the number of small entities that would be subject to the proposed
rules and forms; compliance burdens and how they would affect small entities; and whether the
proposed rules and forms would have any effects that have not been discussed. 1920 In addition, the
Commission requested that commenters describe the nature of any effects on small entities subject
to the rule and provide empirical data to support the nature and extent of such effects. 1921
The Commission received approximately ten comment letters that provided specific
evaluative comments about the IRFA and the potential effect of the rules on small businesses. Most
of the commenters were concerned that the requirements of the permanent registration regime

1920

See id. at 881.

1921

See id.
569

would be too costly and burdensome for small entity municipal advisors. 1922 Several commenters
emphasized in particular that the Small Business Act (“SBA”) threshold of $7 million in revenues
that the Commission estimated for small businesses was too high. 1923
Many commenters recommended that the Commission create exemptions for small
independent advisors. 1924 Two commenters suggested exempting from registration municipal
advisors involved in transactions below a debt financing limit. 1925 One commenter suggested the
Commission allow small municipal advisors to convert their temporary registration to permanent
status by agreeing to observe a fiduciary duty to clients and filing Form ADV (Part 1) with
FINRA. 1926 Another commenter recommended small firms be allowed to pay lower registration
fees to the MSRB. 1927 The Commission addresses these comments below. 1928
The Commission recognizes that small municipal advisors are concerned with the potential

Financial Consultants Letter; Tamalpais Advisors Letter.

Public FA Letter; Ranson Financial Consultants Letter; Tamalpais Advisors Letter; Joy

annual receipts, the Commission is likely to determine that there are few, if any, rules that
would ‘impose a regulatory burden on small entities.’ Such a conclusion would likely be
true for firms that have millions of dollars in annual receipts; however, most independent
financial advisor firms have significantly lower revenues.”).

does not exceed a certain size or is of a certain nature, that a firm would not have to

burdens that the permanent registration regime may impose. The Commission recognizes that some
municipal advisory firms, including some smaller municipal advisory firms and sole proprietors,
may exit the market for various reasons, including the costs related to the registration and
recordkeeping requirements in the final rules and forms. The requirements under the final rules and
forms were designed to impose only those burdens necessary to accomplish the objectives of the
Dodd-Frank Act. The Commission continues to believe that the costs associated with municipal
advisor registration generally will not be overly burdensome for small firms, and notes that small
municipal advisory firms and sole proprietors may exit the market for a number of reasons,
including business reasons separate from the costs incurred with respect to the permanent
registration regime.
C.

Small Entities Subject to the Rule

In developing the final rules and forms, the Commission has considered their potential
impact on small entities to which they will apply. The final rules and forms will affect municipal
advisors required to register with the Commission, including small municipal advisors. Under
Section 601(3) of the RFA, the term “small business” is defined as having “the same meaning as the
term ‘small business concern’ under section 3 of the Small Business Act, unless an agency, after
consultation with the Office of Advocacy of the Small Business Administration and after
opportunity for public comment, establishes one or more definitions of such term which are
appropriate to the activities of the agency and publishes such definition(s) in the Federal
Register.” 1929 The Commission’s rules do not define “small business” or “small organization” for
purposes of municipal advisors. The SBA defines “small business,” for purposes of entities that
provide financial investments and related activities, as a business that had annual receipts of less

1929

5 U.S.C. 601(3).
571

than $7 million during the preceding fiscal year and is not affiliated with any person that is not a
small business or small organization. 1930
As stated above, several commenters emphasized in particular that the SBA threshold of $7
million in revenues that the Commission used for purposes of estimating the number of small
businesses was too high. 1931 For example, one commenter countered that the median annual
revenue of a four-person financial advisory firm was closer to $800,000, and thus, that the majority
of such small advisory firms would earn annual revenue far below the $7 million threshold. 1932
This commenter and two others recommended a $1 million threshold for annual revenue as a more
realistic number for small municipal advisors. 1933 Another commenter argued that, as a sole
proprietorship, his firm has never generated more than $1 million in total revenue in any given year,
and that for the past two years, his firm’s gross revenue has never been over $350,000. 1934 This
commenter suggested that, as an alternative to using the SBA threshold of $7 million, municipal
advisors involved in transactions below a debt financing limit should be exempt from municipal
advisor regulation. 1935
The Commission has considered all public comments relating to the IRFA included in the
Proposal. After considering these comments, the Commission has determined to continue to use the
SBA threshold of $7 million in revenues to denote small businesses. The Commission did not have
sufficient data regarding municipal advisors to propose a definition of “small business” or “small
entity” for purposes of the municipal advisor regulatory regime. The Commission believes that it

will benefit from analyzing data submitted on Form MA over time, as well as data others may
collect once the permanent registration regime is in place, before deciding whether to establish a
separate definition of “small business” or “small organization” in Rule 0-10 under the Exchange
Act 1936 for purposes of municipal advisors. 1937 As the Commission obtains additional information
about municipal advisory firms after the commencement of the permanent registration regime, the
Commission may reevaluate the appropriateness of the annual receipt threshold. The Commission
may then determine, if appropriate, to promulgate a definition of “small business” or “small entity”
for purposes of municipal advisors, as it has done in other contexts. 1938
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that approximately 1,000 municipal advisory
firms, including sole proprietors, would be required to complete Form MA. 1939 For purposes of the
IRFA, the Commission believed that the proportion of small municipal advisory firms subject to the
proposed rules compared to all Form MA applicants would be similar to the proportion of small
registered broker-dealers compared to all registered broker-dealers. 1940 The Commission had
previously estimated that approximately 17% of all broker-dealers are “small” for the purposes of
the RFA. 1941 Thus, the Commission estimated that approximately 170 municipal advisory firms
that would be required to register with the Commission would be small entities subject to the
1936

17 CFR 240.0-10.

1937

Form MA, Item 10, will ask municipal advisors to indicate whether they meet the definition
of “small business” or “small organization.” In addition, the Commission will leverage data
collected by others (e.g., the MSRB) to determine whether it should re-assess its
determination of who is a small municipal advisor. As a result, in the future the
Commission will have information it can use to reevaluate estimates of the number of small
municipal advisors subject to its rules.

573

rules. 1942
In connection with the Proposal, commenters did not provide estimates of how many
municipal advisory firms would be small businesses or small organizations. One commenter
asserted that “the large majority of [independent public finance advisory firms] would fall within
the definition of ‘small business’ that the SEC has proposed it adopt; indeed, a high percentage of
[independent public finance advisory] firms likely generate revenue in amounts substantially less
than $7 million per year.” 1943 Other commenters, as noted above, also argued that most independent
financial advisory firms earn annual revenues far less than $7 million.1944
With respect to municipal advisors registered with the Commission as investment advisers
and/or broker-dealers, commenters did not provide, and the Commission is not aware of, any
alternative reliable estimates for the percentage of small entities. The Commission continues to
believe that the percentage of “small” broker-dealers (i.e., 17%) is a reasonable estimate of the
number of small entity municipal advisors that are registered with the Commission as investment
advisers and/or broker-dealers. As discussed above, the Commission estimates that approximately
273 Form MA registrants will be municipal advisors registered with the Commission as investment
advisers and/or broker-dealers. 1945 Thus, the Commission estimates that approximately 46
municipal advisors registered with the Commission as investment advisers and/or broker-dealers
will be small entities. 1946

1942

1,000 (estimated number of municipal advisors subject to the Rule) × 0.17 (Proposal’s
estimated percentage of municipal advisors that are small entities) = 170 small entity
municipal advisors. See Proposal, 76 FR at 879.

1946

273 (estimated number of municipal advisors registered with the Commission as investment
advisers and/or broker-dealers) × 0.17 (estimated percentage of municipal advisors
574

The Commission recognizes, however, as suggested by commenters, that a significant
majority of municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission and solicitors that will
be required to register with the Commission may be small entities subject to the final rules and
forms. Therefore, the Commission is revising its estimate to reflect its belief that approximately
90% of municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission and solicitors earn annual
revenue less than $7 million. 1947
As discussed above, the Commission estimates that approximately 491 Form MA registrants
will be municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission1948 and 146 will be
solicitors. 1949 Thus, the Commission estimates that 573 municipal advisors not otherwise registered
with the Commission and solicitors will be small entities. 1950 In total, the Commission estimates
that approximately 619 municipal advisory firms will be small entities. 1951

registered with the Commission as investment advisers and/or broker-dealers that are small
entities) = 46.41 small entity municipal advisors registered with the Commission as
investment advisers and/or broker-dealers.
1947

See, e.g., NAIPFA Letter I (indicating that smaller financial advisory firms’ average revenue
of approximately $200,000 per natural person municipal advisor). As discussed above, the
Commission estimates that firms not otherwise registered with the Commission and
solicitors will have, respectively, an average of ten and five natural person employees who
engage in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf. See supra text accompanying
notes 1458 and 1461. Assuming average revenues of $200,000 per natural person municipal
advisor, such entities would likely have revenues far below $7 million. However, the
Commission believes a small number of such firms are likely to have revenues in excess of
$7 million. For these reasons, the Commission estimates that approximately 90% of
municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission and solicitors earn annual
revenue less than $7 million.

1948

See supra note 1459 and accompanying text.

1949

See supra note 1463 and accompanying text.

1950

637 (estimated number of municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission
and solicitors) × 0.90 (estimated percentage of municipal advisors not otherwise registered
with the Commission and solicitors that are small entities) = 573.3 small entity municipal
advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission and small entity solicitors.

1951

573 small entity municipal advisors not otherwise registered with the Commission and small
575

In the Proposal, the Commission also estimated that, with respect to Form MA-I, only those
that are sole proprietors and meet the annual receipts threshold would be considered small entities
subject to the proposed rules. 1952 The Commission stated in the Proposal that, because all sole
proprietors would be required to complete Form MA in addition to Form MA-I, sole proprietors that
would be small entities subject to the proposed rules (i.e., that are under the “small entities” annual
receipts threshold) were already counted among the original estimate of 170 small entities
calculated in the Proposal. 1953
Although, as discussed above, the Commission is revising its estimate of the total number of
municipal advisory firms that will be considered to be small entities, the Commission did not
receive comment regarding, and is not revising its approach regarding, the estimate of the number
of small entities with respect to Form MA-I. The Commission continues to believe that, because all
sole proprietors must complete both Form MA and Form MA-I, those sole proprietors that will be
considered small entities are already counted among the new estimate of 619 small entities. Thus,
the Commission maintains that it will not be necessary to further estimate the number of small
entities with respect to Form MA-I.
D.

Reporting, Recordkeeping, and Other Compliance Requirements

The final rules and forms establish a permanent registration regime for municipal advisors,

entity solicitors + 46 small entity municipal advisors registered with the Commission as
investment advisers and/or broker-dealers = 619 small entity municipal advisory firms.
1952

In the proposal, the Commission noted that individuals who are not sole proprietors (i.e.,
employees of municipal advisors) and must register on Form MA-I do not fall within the
definitions of “small business” or “small organization” because only those businesses and
organizations that are “independently owned” may qualify as small entities pursuant to the
definitions contained in the RFA. See 5 U.S.C. 601(4) and 15 U.S.C. 632(a)(1). See also
Proposal, 76 FR at 879. As discussed in this release, such individuals will no longer be
required to register as a municipal advisor.

1953

See Proposal, 76 FR at 879.
576

including small municipal advisors, which consists of Form MA, Form MA-I, Form MA-W, and
Form MA-NR. The final rules also establish recordkeeping requirements for registered municipal
advisors, including small municipal advisors. 1954 These requirements and the burdens on small
municipal advisors are discussed below. The Commission received several comment letters that
addressed the Commission’s burden estimates. 1955
Rule 15Ba1-2 imposes costs on all municipal advisors, including small municipal advisors,
by requiring each person applying for registration with the Commission as a municipal advisor to
complete Form MA and file the form electronically with the Commission. In addition, a person
applying for registration as a municipal advisor must complete Form MA-I with respect to each
natural person who is a person associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal
advisory activities on its behalf and file each Form MA-I electronically with the Commission. 1956
Each Form MA will be considered filed with the Commission upon acceptance of Form MA,
together with all additional required documents, including all required Form MA-Is, by the
Commission’s EDGAR system. 1957
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average initial cost per applicant to
complete Form MA and the initial self-certification would be approximately $1,110, 1958 and the
average initial cost per applicant to complete Form MA-I and the initial self-certification would be
approximately $510. 1959 The Commission received comment letters that addressed the

Commission’s burden estimates for Form MA 1960 and Form MA-I. 1961 The Commission now
estimates that the average initial PRA cost per applicant to complete Form MA will be
approximately $581. 1962 The Commission also estimates that the average initial PRA cost for a
municipal advisory firm to complete Form MA-I with respect to each natural person who is a
person associated with the municipal advisor and engages in municipal advisory activities on its
behalf will be approximately $498. 1963 The total initial cost incurred by a municipal advisor to
register with the Commission as a municipal advisor will depend on a number of factors, including
the size of the municipal advisory firm; the complexity of its business activities; the amount and
type of information to be included on Form MA and Form MA-I; and the number of natural persons
municipal advisors for whom the municipal advisory firm will need to submit Form MA-I. The
Commission estimates that the average initial registration burden across all firms will be
approximately $7,595 per applicant. 1964
The Commission notes that the estimated $166 hourly rate for compliance personnel that the
Commission uses to estimate calculations with respect to certain figures 1965 will be less likely to

3.5 hours (estimated hourly burden for one municipal advisor to complete a Form MA) ×
$166 (combined hourly rate for a Compliance Manager and Compliance Clerk) = $581.
This estimate is lower than the estimate in the Proposal due to the Commission’s decision
not to adopt a self-certification requirement and a reduction in the combined hourly rate for
a Compliance Manager and Compliance Clerk from $170 to $166. See supra note 1812
(calculating the combined hourly rate).

1963

3.0 hours (estimated time required to complete Form MA-I) × $166 (combined hourly rate
for a Compliance Manager and Compliance Clerk) = $498. This estimate is lower than the

Manager and Compliance Clerk from $170 to $166. See supra note 1812 (calculating the
combined hourly rate).

apply to small entities and solo practitioners because they will be less likely than larger firms to
employ highly compensated compliance professionals. In the case of such entities, the
Commission’s per-applicant cost estimates represent the upper range of potential registration costs,
and the Commission expects that the actual registration costs for small entities will be significantly
lower.
In addition, municipal advisors will use Form MA and Form MA-I to amend information
previously reported to the Commission.1966 Under Rule 15Ba1-5 and the General Instructions, a
registered municipal advisor must amend Form MA at least annually and whenever a material event
has occurred that changes the information provided in the form. 1967 As a result of certain changes to
the final rule, a registered municipal advisor must also promptly amend the information contained in
Form MA-I by filing an amended Form MA-I whenever the information contained in the form
becomes inaccurate for any reason. 1968 Municipal advisors will also need to submit an amendment
to Form MA-I to indicate that an individual is no longer an associated person of the municipal
advisory firm filing the form or no longer engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf. 1969
In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average ongoing annual cost per
applicant to amend Form MA and complete a self-certification would be approximately $510, 1970
and the average ongoing annual cost per applicant to amend Form MA-I and complete a selfcertification would be approximately $160. 1971 The Commission received one comment letter that

The Commission now estimates that the average annual PRA cost per registered municipal advisor
to amend Form MA will be approximately $332. 1973 The Commission also now estimates that the
average annual PRA cost per registered municipal advisor to prepare updating amendments to Form
MA-I for each of its natural person municipal advisors will be approximately $141, 1974 and that the
average PRA cost per registered municipal advisor to amend Form MA-I to indicate that an
individual is no longer an associated person of the municipal advisory firm filing the form or no
longer engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf will be approximately $83. 1975
Municipal advisors will also file a notice of withdrawal from registration as a municipal
advisor on Form MA-W. 1976 In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average cost per
registrant to complete Form MA-W would be approximately $85. 1977 The Commission now

the Commission’s decision not to adopt a self-certification requirement and a reduction in

estimate in the Proposal because natural person municipal advisors are not required to

estimates that the average PRA cost per registered municipal advisor to complete Form MA-W will
be approximately $83. 1978
Non-resident municipal advisors will incur costs to complete Form MA-NR and provide an
opinion of counsel. In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average cost per filer to
complete Form MA-NR would be approximately $255 1979 and that the average cost per non-resident
municipal advisory firm to obtain an opinion of counsel, including the cost to hire outside counsel,
would be approximately $1,960. 1980 The Commission now estimates the average PRA cost to
complete a single Form MA-NR will be approximately $249. 1981 The Commission also estimates
that the average PRA cost per non-resident municipal advisor to obtain an opinion of counsel,
including the cost to hire outside counsel, will be approximately $2,037. 1982
The Commission also believes that some municipal advisory firms will incur costs
associated with hiring outside counsel to help them comply with the requirements of the final rules
and to complete Form MA. In the Proposal, the Commission estimated that the average cost per
1978

0.5 hours (average estimated time to complete Form MA-W) × $166 (combined hourly rate
for a Compliance Manager and Compliance Clerk) = $83. This estimate is lower than the

attorney). $900 = average estimated cost to hire outside counsel to provide opinion of
counsel. $1,137 + $900 = $2,037. This estimate is higher than the estimate in the Proposal
due to an increase in the hourly rate for an internal attorney from $354 to $379. See supra
note 1538 (explaining the outside counsel cost estimate).
581

municipal advisory firm to hire outside counsel would be approximately $400. 1983 The Commission
continues to estimate that the average cost per municipal advisory firm to hire outside counsel will
be approximately $400. 1984
Rule 15Ba1-8 will require all registered municipal advisors to maintain true, accurate, and
current books and records relating to their municipal advisory activities. Generally, Rule 15Ba1-8
will require such books and records to be maintained and preserved for a period of not less than five
years, the first two years in an easily accessible place. In the Proposal, the Commission estimated
that the average cost per municipal advisory firm to comply with the proposed recordkeeping
requirement would be approximately $9,050. 1985
The Commission estimates that, on average, the annual hourly burden for each municipal
advisory firm to comply with the recordkeeping requirements will be 182 hours. 1986 Thus, the
Commission estimates that the average PRA cost per municipal advisory firm to comply with the
recordkeeping requirements will be approximately $9,646 each year. 1987 In addition, the
Commission continues to believe that it is appropriate to assume that, for small firms, the per-hour
costs attributable to the recordkeeping requirements will be, at most, equivalent to the hourly rate

the Proposal because of an increase in the hourly rate for a General Clerk from $50 per hour
to $53 per hour.

for a General Clerk. 1988 Thus, the Commission estimates that the average PRA cost per small entity
municipal advisory firm to comply with the recordkeeping requirements will be approximately
$9,646 each year. 1989 The Commission believes that for many small entity municipal advisory
firms the actual cost will likely be lower for a number of reasons, including differences in the
variety of services offered to municipal entities and the number of municipal entity clients, but is
using a conservative estimate of such costs.
As discussed above, one commenter asserted that the Commission used an hourly rate for
the books and records estimate that was too low for small entity municipal advisors since they often
do not employ General Clerks. 1990 While the Commission acknowledges that small municipal
advisors do not typically employ General Clerks and that, in many cases, the municipal advisory
professional himself may be responsible for maintaining the books and records of the firm, the
Commission does not agree that it should use a higher hourly rate to estimate the recordkeeping
burden for small municipal advisors for several reasons. The 182-hour estimate is an average
annual hourly burden across all firms regardless of their size, and is based on the Commission’s
experience with other regulatory regimes. The Commission anticipates that larger municipal
advisory firms that offer a variety of services to municipal entities and have significantly greater
volumes of books and records will incur an annual burden greater than 182 hours, while smaller
municipal advisory firms that have significantly lower volumes of books and records will incur an
annual burden lower than 182 hours. Similarly, the $53 figure is an average hourly rate across all
firms regardless of their size and is inclusive of the variability of costs across municipal advisors.

1988

See supra note 1987 and accompanying text.

1990

1867.
583

The Commission does not have the information necessary to provide reasonable estimates of the
differences in hourly burden among firms of various sizes, a separate average hourly burden for
small entity municipal advisors, or the differences in hourly rates among firms of various sizes. The
Commission is also unaware of any such data being publicly available. The Commission staff also
understands that some small municipal advisors employ part-time staff to perform certain business
and clerical functions and that the costs of such employees are less likely to reflect the costs for
compliance personnel at larger municipal advisory firms or the hourly rate suggested by the
commenter. The Commission assumes that municipal advisors will use the most cost-effective
approach available, depending on their size and specific circumstances, to comply with the
recordkeeping requirement. Accordingly, the Commission does not believe that it should use a
higher hourly rate to estimate the recordkeeping burden for small municipal advisors.
Further, as stated above, the Commission believes that small municipal advisory firms will
likely incur lower annual costs for maintaining books and records than larger firms. The
Commission recognizes that, although small municipal advisory firms and solo practitioners may
maintain their books and records without a general clerk or additional staff assistance, such activity
would not be costless. The Commission believes that it is appropriate to assume that, because small
firms will utilize the most cost-effective approach available, per-hour costs attributable to the books
and records requirements will be, at most, equivalent to the hourly rate for a General Clerk.
Therefore, the Commission uses the hourly rate for a General Clerk to estimate the average cost
across all municipal advisory firms, regardless of size.
The Commission recognizes that such compliance burdens and expenses may cause some
smaller municipal advisory firms and sole proprietors to exit the market or consolidate with other
municipal advisory firms. The Commission estimates that, at the upper range of annual costs, a

584

small entity municipal advisory firm will incur approximately $17,241 in PRA costs during the first
year 1991 and $11,721 each subsequent year to maintain its registration and books and records. 1992
The Commission estimates that sole proprietors will incur a lower PRA cost of approximately
$11,125 during the first year 1993 and $10,119 each subsequent year. 1994
One sole proprietor has asserted that his annual revenue during the past two years has not
exceeded $350,000, 1995 while another commenter estimated that the median annual revenue for a
four-person municipal advisory firm was $800,000. 1996 Such comments indicate that registration
costs could comprise approximately 2% of a sole proprietor’s 1997 or a four-person municipal
advisory firm’s 1998 annual revenue. Nevertheless, the Commission acknowledges that some small

1991

$7,595 (estimated average initial registration burden for a single municipal advisory firm) +
$9,646 (estimated cost to maintain books and records) = $17,241. See supra note 1813

firm).

natural person municipal advisor)) + $9,646 (estimated cost to maintain books and records)
= $11,721.13.

1994

$332 (estimated annual cost for one municipal advisor to amend Form MA) + (1.0 (sole
proprietor required to complete a Form MA-I) × $141 (estimated annual cost to complete

burdens necessary to accomplish the objectives of the Dodd-Frank Act.
E.

Agency Action to Minimize Effects on Small Entities

The RFA directs the Commission to consider significant alternatives that would accomplish
the stated objective, while minimizing any significant adverse impact on small advisors. 1999 In
considering whether to adopt the final rules and forms, the Commission considered the following
alternatives: (i) the establishment of differing compliance or reporting requirements or timetables
that take into account the resources available to small municipal advisors; (ii) the clarification,
consolidation, or simplification of compliance and reporting requirements under the rules for such
small advisors; (iii) the use of performance rather than design standards; 2000 and (iv) an exemption
from coverage of the rules, or any part thereof, for such small advisors.
The Commission received several comments recommending that the Commission create
exemptions for small independent advisors. 2001 Two commenters suggested exempting from
registration municipal advisors involved in transactions below a debt financing limit. 2002

annual revenue for a four-person municipal advisory firm) = 2.07%.
1999

See 5 U.S.C. 603(c).

2000

The Commission does not consider using performance rather than design standards to be
consistent with the Commission’s understanding of Congress’s intent to have the
Commission register municipal advisors and oversee their activities or with other
registration regimes under Commission rules.

2001

See, e.g., Bradley Payne Letter; Chancellor Financial Associates Letter; Ranson Financial
Associates Letter; Specialized Public Finance Letter; Sullivan Letter; Tamalpais Advisors
Letter.

Revenue Code’s $10 million limit (during a calendar year) in order for an issuer’s bonds to

586

The Commission does not believe differing compliance or reporting requirements or an
exemption from coverage of the final rules and forms, or any part thereof, for small municipal
advisors (i.e., the first and fourth alternatives) would be appropriate or consistent with investor
protection or with the Commission’s understanding of Congress’s intent to have the Commission
register municipal advisors and oversee their activities. Because the Commission believes the
protections of Section 15B of the Exchange Act, as amended by Section 975 of the Dodd-Frank
Act, are intended to apply equally to clients of both large and small municipal advisory firms, the
Commission believes it would be inconsistent with the purposes of the Exchange Act to specify
different requirements for small municipal advisors under the final rules and forms. In addition, the
requirements under the final rules and forms are designed to impose only those burdens necessary to
accomplish the objectives of the Dodd-Frank Act.
As discussed above, the Commission believes that the requirement that municipal advisors
register with the Commission on Form MA and update the information provided at least annually
(or more often as required by the rules) will provide a number of benefits. 2003 For example, the
final rules and forms should allow municipal entities and obligated persons to become better
informed about municipal advisors at a lower cost, which could increase the use of municipal
advisors. In addition, the permanent registration regime and recordkeeping requirements should
enhance the ability of Commission and other securities regulators to oversee municipal advisors and
monitor compliance with the requirements of the Exchange Act and MSRB rules. The Commission
believes that requiring less information about small municipal advisors would be insufficient for
these purposes.

does not exceed a certain size or is of a certain nature, that a firm would not have to
register”).
2003

See supra Section VIII.D.3.b.
587

Regarding the second alternative, the Commission does not believe it is necessary to clarify,
consolidate, or simplify the registration or recordkeeping requirements for small municipal advisors.
In developing the rules and forms, the Commission considered requiring additional information
from municipal advisors and using different submission mechanisms. The Commission decided
that the information in the forms and the submission requirements are simple and straightforward,
and that they take into account the resources available to all municipal advisors, including small
municipal advisors. The Commission believes that small advisors will incur less cost to complete
Form MA than larger municipal advisory firms with more complex businesses because certain
disclosures, for example disclosures related to Item 6 and the number of DRPs required, will be less
complicated and require less time to complete.
One commenter suggested the Commission allow small municipal advisors to convert their
temporary registration to permanent status by agreeing to observe a fiduciary duty to clients and
filing Form ADV (Part 1) with FINRA. 2004 The Commission acknowledges that this approach
would expedite the registration process for those municipal advisors that currently file Form ADV,
but also notes that this approach would result in a registration process with multiple formats that
may become difficult to track over time. In addition, the information required to be disclosed on
Form ADV would not provide comparable information about municipal advisory activities. The
Commission continues to believe that the collection of information in a uniform, standardized
format from all municipal advisors will facilitate consistent public disclosure of municipal advisor
registration information to municipal advisors, municipal entities, obligated persons, the
Commission, and other interested persons.
Another commenter recommended small firms be allowed to pay lower registration fees to

2004

588

the MSRB. 2005 As discussed above, 2006 the Commission does not charge municipal advisors a fee to
register with the Commission. Although the Dodd-Frank Act permits the MSRB to require
municipal advisors to pay such reasonable fees and charges as may be necessary or appropriate to
defray the costs and expenses of operating and administering the MSRB, 2007 the Commission does
not set or approve fees charged by the MSRB. Instead, the Exchange Act provides that certain
designated SRO rules, including fees charged by the MSRB, take effect upon filing with the
Commission 2008 and may thereafter be enforced by the SRO to the extent not inconsistent with the
Exchange Act, the rules and regulations thereunder, and applicable Federal and State law. 2009 The
Commission notes, however, that the MSRB is required to consider the effects of its rules on small
municipal advisors. 2010
One commenter suggested that the Commission could provide meaningful relief by waiving

however, during which it “summarily may temporarily suspend” the fees “if it appears to the
Commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest, for the
protection of investors, or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of” the Exchange Act.
See id. If the Commission takes such action, the Commission shall institute proceedings to
determine whether the proposed rule should be approved or disapproved. See id. In
addition, Section 19(c) of the Exchange Act authorizes the Commission, by rule, to
abrogate, add to, and delete from the rules of an SRO (other than a registered clearing
agency) as the Commission deems necessary or appropriate to insure the fair administration
of the SRO, to conform its rules to requirements of the Exchange Act and the rules and
regulations thereunder applicable to such organization, or otherwise in furtherance of the
purposes of the Exchange Act. See 15 U.S.C. 78s(c).

provided that there is robust protection of investors against fraud”).
589

small firms from the requirement to provide audited financial reports. 2011 The Commission notes
that the final rules and forms do not require audited or other financial reports as part of the
recordkeeping requirement. The preparation of audited financial reports is at the discretion of the
municipal advisor, and the Commission expects that municipal advisors will generally utilize the
most cost-effective solution to comply with the requirements of the permanent registration regime.

598

rules and regulations thereunder.
(B) For purposes of determining whether a swap dealer is acting as an advisor in this

person that, by obtaining such representation from the obligated person, such person is not a
municipal advisor with respect to the municipal financial product or issuance of municipal
securities, and provides a copy of such disclosure to the independent registered municipal advisor.

identifiable department or division that meets the requirements of this paragraph (d)(4), the
determination of whether those municipal advisory activities cause any person to be a municipal
advisor may be made separately for such department or division. In such event, that department or
division, rather than the bank itself, shall be deemed to be the municipal advisor.
(i) Separately identifiable department or division. For purposes of this paragraph (d)(4), a

are separately maintained in, or extractable from, such unit’s own facilities or the facilities of the

thereunder, and the rules of the Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board relating to municipal
advisors.

investments, provided that the person seeking to rely on such representations has a reasonable basis
for such reliance.

municipal securities, including reserves, sinking funds, and pledged funds created for such purpose,
and the investment income derived from the investment or reinvestment of monies in such funds.
When such monies are spent to carry out the authorized purposes of municipal securities, they cease

608

persons associated with the municipal advisor (as defined in section 15B(e)(7) of the Act (15 U.S.C.
78o-4(e)(7))) and engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf, to enforce this chapter.
(b) The registered municipal advisor shall communicate promptly to the Commission by
filing a new Form MA-NR (17 CFR 249.1330) any change to the name or address of the agent for
service of process of each such non-resident municipal advisor, general partner, managing agent, or

behalf.
(c)(1) Each registered non-resident municipal advisor must promptly appoint a successor
agent for service of process and file a new Form MA-NR (17 CFR 249.1330) if the non-resident
municipal advisor discharges its identified agent for service of process or if its agent for service of
process is unwilling or unable to accept service on behalf of the non-resident municipal advisor.
(2) Each registered municipal advisor must require each of its non-resident general partners
or non-resident managing agents, or non-resident natural persons who are persons associated with
the municipal advisor (as defined in section 15B(e)(7) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(e)(7))) and
engaged in municipal advisory activities on its behalf, to promptly appoint a successor agent for
service of process and the registered municipal advisor must file a new Form MA-NR (17 CFR

15B(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)) shall provide an opinion of counsel on Form MA (17 CFR

(e) Form MA-NR (17 CFR 249.1330) must be filed electronically.
§ 240.15Ba1-7 Registration of successor to municipal advisor.
(a) In the event that a municipal advisor succeeds to and continues the business of a
municipal advisor registered pursuant to section 15B(a) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)), the
registration of the predecessor shall be deemed to remain effective as the registration of the
successor if the successor, within 30 days after the succession, files an application for registration
on Form MA (17 CFR 249.1300), and the predecessor files a notice of withdrawal from registration
on Form MA-W (17 CFR 249.1320); provided, however, that the registration of the predecessor
municipal advisor will cease to be effective as the registration of the successor municipal advisor 45
days after the application for registration on Form MA is filed by the successor.
(b) Notwithstanding paragraph (a) of this section, if a municipal advisor succeeds to and
continues the business of a registered predecessor municipal advisor, and the succession is based
solely on a change in the predecessor’s date or state of incorporation, form of organization, or
composition of a partnership, the successor may, within 30 days after the succession, amend the
registration of the predecessor municipal advisor on Form MA (17 CFR 249.1300) to reflect these
changes. This amendment shall be deemed an application for registration filed by the predecessor
and adopted by the successor.

the business or withdrawal from registration as a municipal advisor.

application for registration.
(3) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, a nonresident municipal advisor need not keep, maintain, or preserve within the United States copies of
the books and records referred to in paragraphs (f)(1) and (2) of this section, if:

the books and records which such municipal advisor is required to make, keep current, maintain, or
preserve pursuant to any provision of any rule or regulation of the Commission adopted under the
Act, or any part of such books and records that may be specified in such demand. Such undertaking
shall be in substantially the following form:
The undersigned hereby undertakes to furnish at its own expense to the
Securities and Exchange Commission at the Commission’s principal office in
Washington, DC or at any Regional Office of the Commission specified in a demand
for copies of books and records made by or on behalf of the Commission, true,

suspended during any period when the undersigned is making, keeping current,
maintaining, and preserving copies of all of said books and records at a place within

undertaking shall be binding upon the undersigned and the heirs, successors and
assigns of the undersigned, and the written irrevocable consents and powers of

or suspends for a period not exceeding twelve months or bars such person from being associated
with a broker, dealer, investment adviser, municipal securities dealer, municipal advisor, transfer
agent, or nationally recognized statistical rating organization, if the Commission finds, on the record
after notice and opportunity for hearing, that such censure, placing of limitations, suspension, or bar
is in the public interest and that such person has committed any act, or is subject to an order or
finding, enumerated in subparagraph (A), (D), (E), (H), or (G) of paragraph (4) of section 15(b) of
the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)(A), 78o(b)(4)(D), 78o(b)(4)(E), 78o(b)(4)(H), 78o(b)(4)(G)), has been

U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(4)), or is enjoined from any action, conduct, or practice specified in subparagraph
(C) of such paragraph (4) (15 U.S.C. 78o(b)(4)(C)). It shall be unlawful for any person as to whom

15B(c)(5) of the Act (15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(5)) suspending or barring him from being associated with
a municipal advisor is in effect willfully to become, or to be, associated with a municipal advisor
without the consent of the Commission, and it shall be unlawful for any municipal advisor to permit
such a person to become, or remain, a person associated with it without the consent of the
Commission, if such municipal advisor knew, or, in the exercise of reasonable care should have
known, of such order.

Form MA-NR: Designation of U.S. Agent for Service of Process for Non-Residents
Form MA-W: Notice of Withdrawal from Registration as a Municipal Advisor

General Instructions
Read these General Instructions carefully before filing Form MA, Form MA-I, Form MA-NR, or
Form MA-W. Specific instructions for certain items in Forms MA and MA-I, and General
Instructions to Form MA-NR appear after these General Instructions. Failure to follow
instructions or properly complete any of the forms may result in your registration being delayed
or your application rejected.
Italicized terms are defined or described in the Glossary of Terms appended at the end of these
instructions.
1. Where can an applicant obtain more information on Form MA, Form MA-I, Form MANR, Form MA-W, and electronic filing of these forms with the SEC?
The Commission provides information about its rules with respect to municipal advisors
and the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as well as the submission of these forms, on its
website at: http://www.sec.gov/info/municipal.shtml. A comprehensive explanation of
the requirements in these forms is provided in the release issued by the Commission on
______, 2013, in adopting the rules relating to municipal advisor registration, which can
be viewed at http://www.sec.gov.
2. Who should file these forms?
a. Form MA
A partnership, corporation, trust, limited liability company, limited liability partnership,
sole proprietorship, or other organized entity that engages in municipal advisory activities
(i.e., a municipal advisory firm) must register with the Commission on Form MA. The
same form is also used to amend a previously submitted Form MA, and to file the
required annual update described in General Instruction 8 below.
b. Form MA-I
A municipal advisory firm must complete and file Form MA-I with respect to each
natural person associated with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on
the firm’s behalf, including employees of the firm. Independent contractors are included
in the definition of “employee” for these purposes. The same form is also used to amend
a previously submitted Form MA-I. A natural person doing business as a sole proprietor

must complete and file Form MA-I in addition to Form MA and must amend each form
whenever applicable, as described below.
c. Form MA-NR
Every municipal advisory firm that is a non-resident of the United States must file a
completed and executed Form MA-NR together with its initial application for registration
on Form MA and submit a new Form MA-NR when required by filing an amendment to
Form MA with the new Form MA-NR attached. See “General Instructions to Form MANR,” Instruction 4, below. A sole proprietor should file Form MA-NR as an attachment
to his or her Form MA.
In addition, a municipal advisory firm must file a separately completed and executed
Form MA-NR for (i) every general partner and/or managing agent of the firm that is a
non-resident, and (ii) every non-resident natural person associated with the firm and
engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf. Form MA-NR must be
completed and executed by these persons regardless of whether the firm itself is
domiciled in the United States or is a non-resident filing a Form MA-NR on its own
behalf. Form MA-NR for general partners and/or managing agents is filed by the firm
together with the firm’s Form MA. Form MA-NR for natural persons associated with the
firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf is filed by the firm
together with the Form MA-I relating to the natural person associated with the firm.
Unlike the other forms in the Form MA series, which are completed online and signed
electronically, Form MA-NR must be printed out and signed manually by both the nonresident and the person designated as agent for service of process. Each of the signatures
must be separately notarized, and a scanned copy of the signed and notarized form must
then be attached as a PDF file to the Form MA or Form MA-I being submitted.
However, it is the obligation of the municipal advisory firm, not the obligation of the
general partner, managing agent, or natural person associated with the firm, to file the
executed Form MA-NR with the Commission as an attachment to Form MA or Form
MA-I, as applicable.
Failure to attach a signed and notarized Form MA-NR, where required, for a nonresident municipal advisor or for any non-resident general partner or managing agent
of a municipal advisory firm or non-resident natural person associated with the
municipal advisory firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the
firm, may delay SEC consideration of the municipal advisor’s application for
registration.
d. Form MA-W
A business entity (including a sole proprietorship) that is registered as a municipal
advisor but is no longer required to be registered must file Form MA-W to withdraw its
registration. Specific instructions for completing Form MA-W are included on the form.
(When a natural person with respect to whom a municipal advisory firm filed Form MA-I
622

is no longer associated with the firm or no longer engaged in municipal advisory
activities on behalf of the firm, the firm must file an amendment to the Form MA-I to
indicate this change.)
3. How is Form MA organized?
The main body of Form MA asks a number of questions about the municipal advisor, the
municipal advisor’s business practices, the persons who own and control the municipal
advisor, and the persons who engage in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the
municipal advisor. All items must be completed except where otherwise indicated.
Form MA also contains several supplemental schedules that must be completed where
applicable:
• Schedule A asks for information about the municipal advisor’s direct owners and
executive officers.
• Schedule B asks for information about the municipal advisor’s indirect owners.
• Schedule C is used to amend information on either Schedule A or Schedule B.
• Schedule D asks for additional information on certain items and provides space for
explanations.
Form MA also contains Disclosure Reporting Pages (“DRPs”), which require further
details about events and proceedings involving the municipal advisor and/or the
municipal advisor’s associated persons that the applicant was required to report on the
main body of the form. These include Criminal Action DRPs, Regulatory Action DRPs,
and Civil Judicial Action DRPs.
Form MA also includes an “Execution Page” where the form is signed. More detail on
the Execution Page is provided below.
4. How is Form MA-I organized?
The main body of Form MA-I asks a number of questions about a sole proprietor and
natural person associated with a municipal advisory firm and engaged in municipal
advisory activities on the firm’s behalf, including the residential history and employment
history, and other businesses in which such person is engaged. All items must be
completed except where otherwise indicated.
Form MA-I also contains DRPs that require further details of events and proceedings
involving the sole proprietor and natural person associated with a municipal advisory firm
and engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf that the filer was
required to report on the main body of the form. These include DRPs for reportable
instances of Criminal Action, Regulatory Action, Investigations, Terminations,
623

Judgments/Liens, Civil Judicial Action, and Customer Complaint/Arbitration/Civil
Litigation.
5. Who must sign Form MA or MA-I?
The individual who signs the form depends upon the municipal advisor’s form of
organization:
• For a sole proprietorship, the sole proprietor (both forms);
• For a partnership, a general partner;
• For a corporation, an authorized principal officer; or
• For all others, an authorized individual who participates in managing or directing the
municipal advisor’s affairs.
For purposes of these electronic forms, the signature is a typed name.
6. Where does an applicant sign Form MA?
The municipal advisor must sign the appropriate Execution Page – either the:
•

Domestic Municipal Advisor Execution Page, if the municipal advisory firm
(including a sole proprietor) is a resident of the United States; or

•

Non-Resident Municipal Advisor Execution Page, if the municipal advisory firm
(including a sole proprietor) is not a resident of the United States. Non-Resident
municipal advisors must also file Form MA-NR as specified in General Instruction
2.c. above.

7. Where does a municipal advisory firm sign Form MA-I?
The municipal advisory firm must sign Form MA-I in Item 7 of the form.
8. When does Form MA need to be updated or amended?
Every municipal advisory firm must renew Form MA each year by filing an annual
update within 90 days after the end of its fiscal year (calendar year for sole proprietors).
In addition to the annual update, a municipal advisor must promptly file an amendment
to its Form MA whenever a material event has occurred that changes the information
provided in the form.
Each time a firm accesses its Form MA after its initial filing of the form, the information
from the firm’s most recent previous filing will appear. Only the information that has
changed will need to be amended; the applicant will not need to complete the entire form
again.

624

For purposes of Form MA, a material event will be deemed to have occurred if:
•

Information provided in response to Item 1 (Identifying Information), Item 2 (Form
of Organization), or Item 9 (Disclosure Information) becomes inaccurate in any way;
or

•

Information provided in response to Item 3 (Successions), Item 7 (Participation or
Interest of Applicant or Associated Persons of Applicant in Municipal Advisory
Client or Solicitee Transactions), or Item 8 (Owners, Officers, and Other Control
Persons) becomes materially inaccurate.

Note: If submitting an amendment between annual updates, a municipal advisor is not
required to update the responses to Item 4 (Information About Applicant’s Business),
Item 5 (Other Business Activities), Item 6 (Financial Industry and Other Related
Affiliations of Associated Persons), or Item 10 (Small Businesses) even if the responses
to those items have become inaccurate.
A non-resident municipal advisory firm must promptly file an amendment to Form MA
to attach an updated opinion of counsel – see General Instruction 13 below – after any
changes in the legal or regulatory framework or the firm’s physical facilities that would
impact the ability of the municipal advisory firm, as a matter of law, to provide the
Commission with access to its books and records or to inspect and examine the municipal
advisory firm.
Failure to amend or update Form MA as required by this instruction is a violation of
SEC rule 15Ba1-5 and could lead to the revocation of registration. See Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 section 15B(c)(2), 15 U.S.C. 78o-4(c)(2).
9. When does Form MA-I need to be updated or amended?
Form MA-I must promptly be amended whenever any information previously provided
on Form MA-I becomes inaccurate.
10.

How does a municipal advisor file a Form MA, MA-I, MA-NR, or MA-W?
A municipal advisor must complete and submit the relevant form, including any required
attachments, electronically. Form MA is considered “filed” with the Commission upon
submission of a completed Form MA, together with all required additional documents,
including required filings of Form MA-I, to the Commission’s Electronic Data Gathering,
Analysis, and Retrieval (“EDGAR”) system. See more at General Instruction 14 below.
When a municipal advisor’s submitted Form MA is accepted by the Commission, the
municipal advisor will receive an SEC file number with an 867- prefix. As used in the
forms, the terms “MA Registration Number” and “Municipal Advisor Registration
Number” refer to this same SEC file number.

Form MA-NR, which must be printed out, signed, and notarized before being filed, is

11.

How does an applicant start the process of filing electronically?
Each form of the Form MA series, to be filed, must be submitted electronically to
EDGAR. General information about EDGAR is available at
http://www.sec.gov/info/edgar.shtml, where the EDGAR Filer Manual can also be
accessed. We recommend that applicants read this filer manual before they begin using
the system.
If you are already a filer on the EDGAR system: You may proceed directly to the
Commission’s primary EDGAR filing website at https://www.edgarfiling.sec.gov and
navigate the links to the Form MA series. Then, you will be given a choice of which
form in the series to access and complete.
If you are new to EDGAR: Before you can electronically file with the SEC on
EDGAR, you must become an EDGAR filer with authorized access codes. To do so, log
on to the following website: https://www.filermanagement.edgarfiling.sec.gov/.
Through this website, you will be able to create a “Form ID” and submit it to the SEC for
authorization.
Upon accessing the site, you will see a screen with a warning about use of government
websites for unauthorized purposes, followed by some brief instructions. At the bottom
of the screen, you will see a button that says “Press Here to Begin,” through which you
can access Form ID. Make sure that you specify municipal advisors, where indicated,
when accessing the form. Complete the form online and submit it to the SEC. When the
form is accepted, you will receive, via e-mail, a unique CIK (Central Index Key) number.
After receiving your CIK number, return to the same website
(https://www.filermanagement.edgarfiling.sec.gov/). Use your CIK and a passphrase to
create your EDGAR access codes. Once you have your access codes, you will be able to
use EDGAR. Log on to the primary EDGAR filing website at
https://www.edgarfiling.sec.gov/ and navigate the links to the Form MA series. Then,
you will be given a choice of which form in the series to access and complete.

What other legal designations and representations are made in signing the Execution
Page of Form MA and Form MA-I?
Form MA: By signing the Execution Page of Form MA, if you are an authorized
signatory of a domestic municipal advisory firm (see General Instruction 5 above), you
are appointing on behalf of your firm the Secretary of State or other legally designated
officer of the state in which the firm maintains its principal office and place of business
as the firm’s agent to receive service of process. You are also attesting to the truth and
correctness of the information provided in the form. In addition, you are declaring on
behalf of the firm that the firm’s books and records will be preserved and available for
626

inspection and that any person having custody of the books and records is authorized to
make them available to federal regulators.
If you are signing Form MA on behalf of a non-resident municipal advisory firm, you
must use the version of the Execution Page that is specifically required for such firms.
(See General Instruction 6.) On this page, you are attesting to the truth and correctness of
the information the firm is providing on the form and making the same representations as
a U.S. firm regarding books and records. Additionally, the signatory is agreeing on
behalf of the firm to provide, at the firm’s own expense, current, correct, and complete
copies of the firm’s books and records to the SEC upon request. A non-resident
municipal advisory firm must designate its agent for service of process, however, on a
separate form, Form MA-NR.
Form MA-I: If you are an authorized signatory of a domestic municipal advisory firm
filing Form MA-I with respect to a natural person associated with the firm and engaged
in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firm, by signing the Execution Page of
Form MA-I, you are attesting to the truth and correctness of the information provided in
the form. You are also attesting that the municipal advisory firm has obtained and
retained written consent from the natural person associated with the firm that service of
any civil action brought by, or notice of any proceeding before, the SEC or any selfregulatory organization in connection with the individual’s municipal advisory activities
may be given by registered or certified mail to the individual’s address given in Item 1 of
the form.
If you are filing Form MA-I as a sole proprietor, by signing the Execution Page of Form
MA-I, you are consenting that service of process may be given to you by registered or
certified mail to the address you have supplied in Item 1of the form. You are also
attesting to the truth and correctness of the information you have provided in the form.
13.

What is the opinion of counsel that is required to be filed by a non-resident municipal
advisory firm?
A non-resident municipal advisory firm must attach to the Execution Page of its Form
MA an opinion of counsel that the municipal advisor can, as a matter of law, provide the
Commission with access to its books and records and that the municipal advisor can, as a
matter of law, submit to inspection and examination by the Commission.

14.

In what circumstances must additional documents be attached to Form MA or
Form MA-I?
As already noted, an applicant filing a Form MA or a municipal advisory firm filing Form
MA-I must complete the entire form online, including, where applicable, Schedules A, B,
C, and D (in the case of Form MA) and any DRPs that are required. Note that these
schedules and the DRPs comprise the form itself, and are not considered attachments.
The signatures that are required on Form MA and Form MA-I are executed
electronically; thus no paper document must be copied and attached to evidence a
signature.
627

In certain circumstances, however, a filing requires the attachment of a copy (or copies)
of an additional document (or documents) when the online Form MA or Form MA-I is
submitted. Such copies must be filed in PDF format. Filers will be prompted to attach
each such document at the appropriate place in the relevant online form. Filings that
require such PDF attachments include:
• Documents relating to criminal actions. The Criminal Action DRPs of Form MA and
Form MA-I require that applicable court documents (e.g., criminal complaint,
information or indictment as well as judgment of conviction or sentencing
documents) and other supporting documentation must be attached to, and filed
electronically with, the form in conjunction with the DRPs.
• Manually-signed Form MA-NR (for non-residents). Form MA-NR is accessed
electronically via links within Form MA and Form MA-I, and the information
requested by the form may be entered online. However, the form must be printed out
and signed manually – both by the non-resident (an authorized signatory in the case
of a firm) and by the designated agent for service of process – and each of the
signatures must be notarized. After the signatures and notarizations are completed,
Form MA-NR must be attached in PDF format to the Form MA or Form MA-I.
• Written authorization to sign a Form MA-NR. When a Form MA-NR is signed on
behalf of a municipal advisory firm or a natural person (whether a general partner,
managing agent, or person associated with the firm and engaged in municipal
advisory activities on the firm’s behalf) pursuant to a written authorization (e.g., a
board resolution or power of attorney), a copy of the authorization must be attached
in PDF format together with the signed and notarized Form MA-NR.
• Written contractual agreements relating to a Form MA-NR. When a written contractual
agreement or other written document exists that evidences (a) the designation and
appointment of the U.S. agent for service of process by the non-resident for whom a
Form MA-NR is being filed, and/or (b) the agent’s acceptance of such designation
and appointment, a copy of the document must also be attached in PDF format
together with the signed and notarized Form MA-NR.
• Opinion of Counsel for non-resident municipal advisory firms. As described in General
Instruction 13, a non-resident municipal advisory firm must attach to its Form MA an
opinion of counsel that the municipal advisor can comply with certain requirements.
A copy of the opinion must be attached in PDF file format.
15.

What if the deadline for submitting an initial filing, an annual update, or
amendment to a form falls on a day on which the Commission is not open for
business?
If the deadline for submitting an initial filing, annual update, or amendment to a form
occurs on a Saturday, Sunday, or holiday on which the Commission is not open for
business, then the deadline shall be the next business day.
628

Federal Information Law and Requirements
Section 15B(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 [15 U.S.C. 78o-4(a)] authorizes the SEC
to collect the information required by Forms MA, MA-I, MA-NR, and MA-W. The SEC collects
the information for regulatory purposes. Filing Form MA and Form MA-I (where applicable) is
mandatory for municipal advisors who are required to register with the SEC. Filing Form MAW is mandatory for a municipal advisor that has a Form MA on file but is no longer required to
be registered. Filing Form MA-NR is mandatory for each non-resident municipal advisor, nonresident general partner or non-resident managing agent of a municipal advisor, and nonresident natural person who is a person associated with the municipal advisor and engaged in
municipal advisory activities on its behalf. The SEC maintains the information submitted on
these forms and, unless otherwise specified, makes it publicly available. The SEC will not
accept forms that do not include the required information.
SEC’s Collection of Information
An agency may not conduct or sponsor, and a person is not required to respond to, a collection of
information unless it displays a currently valid control number. The Securities Exchange Act of
1934 authorizes the SEC to collect the information on Form MA from applicants and on Form
MA-I from municipal advisory firms. See 15 U.S.C. 78o-4. Filing of the form is mandatory.
The main purpose of Form MA is to enable the SEC to register municipal advisors. Every
applicant for registration with the SEC as a municipal advisor must file Form MA electronically
with the SEC. See 17 CFR 240.15Ba1-2(a). The purpose of Form MA-I is to enable the SEC to
collect information about natural persons associated with a municipal advisory firm and engaged
in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firm.
When an applicant for registration successfully transmits a Form MA and/or Form MA-I to the
SEC’s electronic systems, the SEC does not make a finding that the form has been completed or
submitted correctly. Form MA must be updated annually by every municipal advisory firm, no
later than 90 days after the end of its fiscal year (calendar year for sole proprietors). Form MA
also must be amended promptly during the year to reflect changes as described in these
instructions. Form MA-I must be filed by every municipal advisory firm with respect to each
natural person associated with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of
the firm. Form MA-I also must be amended promptly whenever any information previously
provided becomes inaccurate. The SEC maintains the information on the forms and, unless
otherwise specified, makes it publicly available through the SEC website.
Anyone may send the SEC comments on the accuracy of the burden estimate on page 1 of the
forms, as well as suggestions for reducing the burden. The Office of Management and Budget
has reviewed this collection of information under 44 U.S.C. 3507.
The information contained in the forms is part of a system of records subject to the Privacy Act of
1974, as amended. The SEC has published in the Federal Register the Privacy Act System of
Records Notice for these records.

629

Intentional misstatements or omissions of fact constitute federal criminal violations.
See 18 U.S.C. 1001 and 15 U.S.C. 78ff(a)

Specific Instructions for Certain Items in Form MA
These instructions provide further detail and explain how to complete certain items in Form MA.

1. Item 3: Successions
If the applicant (i) is not currently registered as a municipal advisor and has taken over
the business of a registered municipal advisor or (ii) was registered as a municipal
advisor but has changed its structure or legal status (e.g., form of organization,
composition of a partnership, or date or state of incorporation), a new organization has
been created that has its own registration obligations under the Exchange Act. The
applicant in these situations must file in accordance with the instructions below. In
addition, the applicant may rely on special registration provisions in the SEC’s rules for
“successors” to registered municipal advisors that are designed to ease the transition to
the successor municipal advisor’s registration.
In situation (i), follow the instructions below under: “Succession by Application.” In
situation (ii), follow the instructions below under “Succession by Amendment.”
a. Succession by Application. If the applicant is not registered with the SEC as a
municipal advisor, and is acquiring or assuming substantially all of the assets and
liabilities of the advisory business of a registered municipal advisor, file a new initial
application for registration on Form MA. The applicant will receive a new SEC file
number. The applicant must file the new application within 30 calendar days after the
succession. On the application, make sure to check “Yes” to Item 3, enter the date of
the succession in Item 3, and complete Section 3 of Schedule D.
Until the SEC declares the new registration effective, the applicant may rely on the
registration of the acquired municipal advisor, but only if the acquired municipal
advisor is no longer engaged in municipal advisory activities. Once the new
registration is effective, a Form MA-W must be filed with the SEC to withdraw the
registration of the acquired municipal advisor.
b. Succession by Amendment. If a new municipal advisor is formed solely as a result
of a change in form of organization, composition of a partnership, or date or state of
incorporation of an existing registered municipal advisor, and there has been no
practical change in control or management, the new municipal advisor may file an
amendment to the Form MA of the predecessor municipal advisor to reflect these
changes rather than file a new, initial application. The new municipal advisor will
keep the same SEC file number, and no Form MA-W should be filed. On the
amendment, make sure to check “Yes” to Item 3, enter the date of the succession in
Item 3, and complete Section 3 of Schedule D. The amendment must be submitted
within 30 calendar days after the change or reorganization.
2. Item 4: Information About Applicant’s Business
631

Guidance for Newly-Formed Municipal Advisors: Several questions in Item 4 that ask
about municipal advisory activities assume that the municipal advisor has been in
existence for some time. For newly-formed municipal advisors, responses to these
questions should reflect the applicant’s current municipal advisory activities (i.e.,
activities at the time of filing of the Form MA), with the following exceptions:
•

Applicant should base responses to Item 4-I, J, and K on the types of
compensation the applicant expects to accept; and

•

Applicant should base responses to Item 4-L on the types of municipal advisory
activities in which the applicant expects to engage during the next year.

3. Additional Information
Complete the final section of Schedule D – “Miscellaneous” – if any response to an item
in Form MA requires further explanation or if the applicant wishes to provide additional
information.
Specific Instructions for Certain Items in Form MA-I
These instructions provide further detail and explain how to complete certain items in Form MA-I.

1. Item 1: Identifying Information
A. The Individual
CRD Number. Some individuals may have an assigned number, known as a CRD
Number, in the CRD system for the registration of broker-dealers and broker-dealer
representatives or in the IARD system for investment advisers and investment adviser
representatives. You are not required to provide an individual’s CRD number if the
individual does not have one.
Social Security Number. A social security number is needed for regulatory purposes.
However, the version of completed Form MA-I that will be available for viewing by the
public will not show a social security number.
B. Municipal Advisory Firms Where the Individual Is Employed
Office. The phrase “office from which the individual is or will be supervised” in
subsection (2) of Item 1-B requires you to provide the information requested even if the
individual does not work at that location.
2. Item 2: Other Names
This item requires you to enter – besides the full legal name you provided in Item 1 – any
other name that the individual has used or is using, or by which the individual is known
632

or has been known, since the age of 18. Be certain to include, for example, nicknames,
aliases, and names used before or after marriage.
3. Item 3: Residential History
You must provide all the addresses at which the individual has resided for the past 5
years, leaving no gaps greater than 3 months between addresses. Post office boxes are
not acceptable. This information is needed for regulatory purposes. However, the
version of completed Form MA-I that will be available for viewing by the public will not
show the private residential addresses that you enter.
4.

Item 4: Employment History
You must provide the individual’s entire employment history for the past 10 years,
leaving no gap greater than 3 months between entries. All entries must include beginning
and end dates of employment. Account for full-time and part-time employment, selfemployment, military service, and homemaking. Unemployment, full-time education,
extended travel, and other, similar statuses must also be included, and entered on the line
provided for “Name of Municipal Advisor or Company.”

5. Item 5: Other Business
Provide information regarding any other business in which the individual is currently
engaged, whether as a proprietor, partner, officer, director, employee (including
independent contractor), trustee, agent, or otherwise. If you do not know exactly the
number of hours the individual devotes to this business, give a reasonable estimate. If the
number of hours per week or month varies, provide an average.
6. Item 6: Disclosure Questions
Note that an affirmative answer to certain disclosure questions may make an individual
subject to statutory disqualification as defined in Section 3(a)(39) and Section 15B(c) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
7. Item 7: Signature
Signature is effected by typing a name in the designated signature field. By typing a
name in this field, the signatory acknowledges and represents that the entry constitutes in
every way, use, or aspect, his or her legally binding signature. Submit the signed form
electronically with the Commission. Note that if the individual is a non-resident, you
must attach a manually-signed Form MA-NR to the form.
General Instructions to Form MA-NR
1. When must a Form MA-NR be filed?

633

Form MA-NR must be filed for each non-resident municipal advisory firm and each nonresident general partner and/or managing agent of a municipal advisor at the time of the
municipal advisory firm’s initial application for registration on Form MA as an
attachment to the form. In addition, a municipal advisory firm must file Form MA-NR as
an attachment to each Form MA-I filed by the firm for a non-resident natural person
associated with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf
when the firm initially files the Form MA-I.
2. Must more than one Form MA-NR be filed per municipal advisory firm?
In certain circumstances, yes. When you are filing a Form MA on behalf of a municipal
advisory firm, and one or more general partners and/or managing agents of the firm is a
non-resident, you must attach a separate Form MA-NR designating an agent for U.S.
service of process for each such person, signed by that person and the designated agent.
This requirement applies even when the firm itself is a non-resident and you are attaching
a Form MA-NR on the firm’s own behalf. You must attach a Form MA-NR for each
such other person even if the person has previously designated an agent for service of
process on a Form MA-NR filed by another municipal advisor. If you are filing Form
MA-I, you must attach a Form MA-NR for every non-resident natural person associated
with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firm.
3. Must a Form MA-NR be filed at any time other than a municipal advisor’s initial
registration?
Yes. An SEC-registered municipal advisory firm that becomes a non-resident after the
municipal advisor firm’s initial application has been submitted must file a Form MA-NR
within 30 days of becoming a non-resident. The same applies when a general partner or
managing agent of a municipal advisory firm becomes a non-resident. A municipal
advisory firm must also file Form MA-NR within 30 days of the date that a non-resident
becomes a general partner or managing agent of a municipal advisory firm if this occurs
after the firm initially registers on Form MA. In such cases, the municipal advisor must
file an amendment to Form MA, with the new Form MA-NR attached.
A municipal advisory firm must file a Form MA-NR together with Form MA-I if, after
the firm’s initial registration, a non-resident natural person becomes associated with the
firm and engages in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf. In addition, a
municipal advisory firm must file a Form MA-NR if a natural person associated with the
firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on behalf of the firm becomes a nonresident after the firm has filed a Form MA-I relating to that individual. The firm must
file the Form MA-NR within 30 days of such individual becoming a non-resident.
Note: As discussed elsewhere in these instructions, a non-resident municipal advisory
firm that is filing a Form MA must also comply with two further requirements. In
addition to completing Form MA-NR, the firm must (a) complete the special execution
page of Form MA required for non-residents, which includes an undertaking regarding
books and records (see General Instruction 12); and (b) attach to Form MA an opinion of
634

counsel that the municipal advisory firm, as a matter of law, can provide the Commission
with access to its books and records and can submit to inspection and examination by the
Commission (see General Instruction 13).
4. When must a new Form MA-NR be filed?
A new Form MA-NR must be filed promptly if a previously-filed Form MA-NR becomes
invalid or the information in it becomes inaccurate. (This is accomplished by submitting
an amendment to Form MA with the new MA-NR attached. No other changes to any
information in Form MA need be made in the amendment if not otherwise required.)
This includes any change to the name or address of the non-resident municipal advisory
firm, general partner, managing agent, or natural person associated with the firm and
engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf, as well as any change to the
name or address of the agent for service of process of the municipal advisory firm,
general partner, managing agent, or natural person associated with the firm. Each nonresident municipal advisory firm, general partner, managing agent, and natural person
associated with the firm and engaged in municipal advisory activities on the firm’s behalf
must promptly appoint a successor agent for service of process and the municipal advisor
must file a new Form MA-NR if the non-resident municipal advisor, general partner,
managing agent, or natural person associated with the firm discharges its identified agent
for service of process or if its agent for service of process becomes unwilling or unable to
accept service on behalf of the non-resident municipal advisor, general partner,
managing agent, or natural person associated with the firm.
