COMPLAINT FOR INJUNCTIVE AND OTHER RELIEF
Plaintiff Securities and Exchange Commission alleges as follows:
INTRODUCTION
1.

The Commission brings this action to enjoin Global Digital Solutions, Inc.

(“Global Digital”), its former Chairman and CEO, Richard J. Sullivan, and its former CFO,
David A. Loppert (collectively “Defendants”), from further violations of the anti-fraud and
reporting provisions of the federal securities laws, and against Defendants Sullivan and Loppert
from further violations of the certification provisions of the federal securities laws.
2.

From approximately October 2013 through approximately March 2014,

Defendants issued misleading press releases and filings regarding Global Digital’s operations,
revenue projections, and acquisitions of various companies relating to Global Digital’s purported
cyber arms manufacturing and security and technology solutions capabilities. At the same time,
Global Digital’s website falsely described Global Digital as having sophisticated operations and
potential revenue growth in these areas.

Case 9:16-cv-81413-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2016 Page 2 of 17

3.

Global Digital misrepresented in press releases that it planned to merge with a

company that had a $95 million exclusive equipment manufacturing contract for sophisticated
grenade launchers, when in fact the company had no such contract.
4.

Global Digital also stated in a press release that in the upcoming quarter, it

anticipated being able to project annual revenue between $60 million to $75 million, when it had
no reasonable basis for this projection.
5.

Global Digital also issued a press release announcing that it had made an offer to

acquire a large arms manufacturer for $1.082 billion, while failing to disclose that it had no
prospect of financing the purchase and that the arms manufacturer had already rejected Global
Digital’s offer. Misleading information pertaining to the $1.082 billion acquisition was also
included in Global Digital’s March 11, 2014 Form 8-K and in its 2014 year end Form 10-K
filings with the Commission. Both Sullivan and Loppert signed these filings, falsely attesting to
their accuracy.
6.

Sullivan edited, reviewed and approved Global Digital’s website where false and

misleading press releases were also posted.
7.

Neither Sullivan nor Loppert filed with the Commission Forms 3, Forms 4 or

Forms 5 indicating their beneficial ownership in Global Digital’s securities.
8.

By reason of the foregoing, Global Digital, Sullivan and Loppert violated Section

17(a)(2) of the Securities Act of 1933 (“Securities Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 77q(a)(2), and Section
10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (“Exchange Act”), 15 U.S.C. § 78j(b), and Rule
10b-5(b) thereunder, 17 C.F.R. § 240.10b-5(b); Global Digital violated Section 13(a) of the
Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78m(a), and Rules 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 thereunder, 17 C.F.R.
§§ 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1, and 240.13a-11; Sullivan and Loppert violated Section 16(a) of the

2

Case 9:16-cv-81413-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2016 Page 3 of 17

Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. § 78p, and Rules 13a-14(a) and 16a-3 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§
240.13a-14(a) and 240.16a-3; Sullivan and Loppert aided and abetted Global Digital’s violations
of Sections 10(b) and 13(a) of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78j(b) and 78m(a), and Rules
10b-5(b), 12b-20, 13a-1, and 13a-11 thereunder, 17 C.F.R. §§ 240.10b-5, 240.12b-20, 240.13a-1,
and 240.13a-11. Unless the Court enjoins the Defendants, they are reasonably likely to continue
to violate these provisions of the federal securities laws.

Global Digital. is incorporated in New Jersey, with its principal place of business

located in West Palm Beach, Florida.

Global Digital purports to be in the “cyber arms

manufacturing” and “security technology solutions” industry. Global Digital’s common stock is
registered with the Commission pursuant to Section 12(g) of the Exchange Act. Its stock is
quoted on the OTC Link marketplace for trading over-the-counter stocks operated by OTC
Markets Group, Inc., under the ticker symbol “GDSI.” Global Digital’s stock is a “penny stock”
under the federal securities laws. Global Digital was previously named Creative Beauty Supply,
Inc., until March of 2004 when Global Digital and Creative Beauty Supply Inc., merged. Global
Digital is delinquent in making required filings with the Commission, having not filed its
December 31, 2015 Form 10-K or its March 31, 2016 Form 10-Q.
10.

Richard J. Sullivan is a resident of Boynton Beach, Florida. He was Global

Digital’s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer during the relevant period.
11.

David A. Loppert is a resident of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida. He was Global

Digital’s Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer during the relevant period.

JURISDICTION AND VENUE
12.

The Court has jurisdiction over this action pursuant to Sections 20(b), 20(d)(1),

20(g), and 22(a) of the Securities Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 77t(b), 77t(d)(1), 77t(g), and 77v(a); and
Sections 21(d) and 27 of the Exchange Act, 15 U.S.C. §§ 78u(d) and 78aa.
13.

The Court has personal jurisdiction over the Defendants, and venue is proper in

the Southern District of Florida, because many of the Defendants’ acts and transactions
constituting violations of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act occurred in the Southern
District of Florida. In addition, at all relevant times, Global Digital’s principal place of business
was in the Southern District of Florida, and Sullivan and Loppert resided in the District.
14.

In connection with the conduct alleged in the Complaint, the Defendants, directly

or indirectly, singly or in concert with others, made use of the means or instrumentalities of
interstate commerce, the means or instruments of transportation or communication in interstate
commerce, or the mails.
DEFENDANTS’ FRAUDULENT CONDUCT
A. Global Digital’s Business
15.

Though previously known as Creative Beauty Supply, Inc., a beauty products

supply company incorporated in New Jersey, during the relevant period, Global Digital held
itself out to be a company “that is positioning itself as a leader in providing cyber arms
manufacturing, complementary security and technology solutions and knowledge-based, cyberrelated, culturally attuned social consulting in unsettled areas.”
16.

On August 12, 2013, Sullivan was appointed as Global Digital’s President and

Chief Executive Officer, and Loppert was appointed Executive Vice President and Chief
Financial Officer. Thereafter, both Sullivan and Loppert were involved in all aspects of Global

4

Case 9:16-cv-81413-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2016 Page 5 of 17

Digital’s business. Loppert resigned his position in April 2015 and Sullivan resigned in May
2016.
17.

From at least August 2013 until March 2014, Global Digital operated out of an

office in West Palm Beach, Florida; however, it had no customers, never manufactured any
“cyber arms” and never provided any “security technology solutions” services or “social
consulting in unsettled areas.”
B. Global Digital’s False and Misleading Press Releases And Subsequent PrivatePlacement Fundraising
1.
18.

The $95 Million Exclusive Manufacturer Contract Press Releases

On October 8, October 11, and October 21, 2013, Global Digital issued three

press releases, each touting its impending merger with Airtronic USA, Inc., a company which
Global Digital claimed had become the exclusive OEM (Original Equipment Manufacturer)
supplier of M203 and M203A grenade launchers for a major international client under a private
label agreement with a “first stage value of approximately $95 million.” In the October 8, 2013
press release, Sullivan described the announcement as “exciting but not completely unexpected
news.”
19.

Defendants’ representation that Airtronic would be the exclusive supplier of $95

million worth of grenade launchers was false and misleading. Airtronic was not positioned to be
the OEM for the $95 million agreement referenced in the release, as this agreement never
actually existed. Indeed, Airtronic only had an order for grenade launchers and accompanying
equipment worth approximately $300,000. The then CEO of Airtronics repeatedly requested
Global Digital to remove these misleading statements from Global Digital’s website and
specifically cited its failure to do so as one of the reasons why Airtronics terminated its merger
agreement with Global Digital.
5

Case 9:16-cv-81413-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2016 Page 6 of 17

20.

On November 11, 2013, only a few weeks after the misleading October 21, 2013

press release, Global Digital raised $50,000 from investors through a private placement offering.
2.

21.

The $60 Million to $75 Million Annual Revenue
Projection Press Release

On November 15, 2013, Global Digital issued a press release stating that in the

upcoming first quarter of 2014, it anticipated being able to project annual revenue between $60
million to $75 million because it expected that it would be able to announce several acquisition
agreements for its “targeted global growth strategy.”
22.

Global Digital’s revenue projections were false and misleading, and it had no

basis for them. First, during the fourth quarter of 2013, Global Digital had only $509,224 in cash
and no credible financing in place to acquire any of these companies. Second, Global Digital
only undertook financial due diligence on one company after the issuance of its November 15,
2013 press release.
23.

Global Digital never acquired any of the companies referenced in its press release

and never informed the public that their projected annual revenue would not be reached.
3.
24.

The March 11, 2014 and March 12, 2014 Remington Press Releases

On March 11, 2014, Global Digital issued a press release announcing that the

company had issued an unsolicited letter of intent to acquire Remington Outdoor Company, Inc.
(“Remington”), also known as Freedom Group, Inc., a large arms manufacturer located in the
United States. The press release stated that Global Digital had made an unsolicited offer on
March 10, 2014, to purchase Remington for $1.082 billion in cash. The press release further
represented that Global Digital was pursuing two acquisitions in addition to the Remington offer.
Sullivan detailed several reasons why he was optimistic about the potential acquisitions, and was

6

Case 9:16-cv-81413-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2016 Page 7 of 17

quoted as saying that the company was “extremely excited and confident about all three of these
proposed acquisitions.”
25.

This press release was false and misleading. During the first quarter of 2014

Global Digital had less than $272,000 in cash and had no credible financing options to pursue
this acquisition.

Additionally, Sullivan and Loppert knew as early as January 2014 that

Remington only wanted a fully-financed, cash-only deal and the investment bank assisting
Global Digital in presenting the offer never attempted to find financing options for the
Remington deal because the parties did not have a signed offer letter. Indeed, Sullivan and
Loppert knew the Remington offer had repeatedly been rejected and therefore Sullivan had no
reason to be “excited” or “confident” about the proposed Remington acquisition.
26.

Global Digital failed to consummate either of the other two deals referenced in

the press release. No subsequent press releases were issued informing the public that these
acquisitions did not go forward.
27.

On March 12, 2014, Global Digital issued an identical press release included with

its Form 8-K, with one minor correction, stating that the offer to acquire Remington was for
$1.082 billion “in cash and shares” of Global Digital common stock, instead of just cash per the
March 11, 2014 release. However, the content still contained the same false and misleading
information since Sullivan and Loppert knew that Remington had already rejected the offer and
would only consider a fully-financed, cash-only deal. Moreover, again, Global Digital had less
than $272,000 in cash and no imminent, credible financing when it made this statement.

C. Global Digital’s False and Misleading SEC Regulatory Filings
1.
28.

Global Digital’s False and Misleading Form 8-K

On March 11, 2014, the same day that Global Digital issued a press release

announcing its unsolicited offer to purchase Remington, Global Digital also filed a Form 8-K
containing the same information and attaching a copy of the March 11, 2014 press release as an
exhibit. Sullivan signed this Form 8-K.
29.

This Form 8-K represented that Global Digital had submitted a non-binding offer,

dated January 27, 2014, and received “no response” to such offer, which by its terms then
expired on February 17, 2014.
30.

The next day, on March 12, 2014, the March 11, 2014 Form 8-K was amended

via an explanatory note clarifying that the offer to purchase Remington contemplated cash and
stock, rather than just cash as stated in the March 11, 2014 press release. This amended Form 8K was resigned and refiled by Loppert.
31.

These Forms 8-K were false and misleading. It was not true that Global Digital

received “no response” to its offer. In fact, Global Digital received various communications
from the investment banker representing Remington’s shareholders, and these communications
were always consistent:

Remington had no interest at all in Global Digital’s offer; the

investment banker repeatedly told Global Digital’s investment banker that Remington was only
interested in a fully-financed, cash-only deal; Remington rejected the deal on several occasions,
including after the January 27, 2014 offer and the March 10, 2014 offer.

Remington’s

investment banker relayed these rejections to Global Digital’s investment banker, and this
individual communicated these rejections to Sullivan and Loppert prior to the release of the
March 12, 2014 Form 8-K.

8

Case 9:16-cv-81413-XXXX Document 1 Entered on FLSD Docket 08/11/2016 Page 9 of 17

32.

It was also misleading to announce publicly an offer to purchase a company for

over $1 billion (whether in cash or in cash and stock), given that Global Digital had less than
$272,000 in cash and had no credible financing options to support making such an offer.
Moreover, Sullivan and Loppert knew Remington was only interested in a fully-financed, cashonly deal as early as January 2014.
2.
33.

Global Digital’s False and Misleading Form 10-K

After Global Digital filed the March 11, 2014 and March 12, 2014 Forms 8-K and

companion press release, various news sources reported on Global Digital’s offer to purchase
Remington.

Many of these sources also referenced an internal memorandum written by

Remington’s CEO/Chairman which dismissed Global Digital’s offer as a publicity stunt that
lacked any credible financing. On March 17, 2014, Sullivan wrote a letter to Remington’s
CEO/Chairman, asking to speak with him and “dispel these misguided notions and set the record
straight.”
34.

On March 28, 2014, approximately two weeks after Global Digital issued its

Forms 8-K and companion press release regarding the Remington offer, the company filed its
Form 10-K, stating that Global Digital had not received a response to its offer and would
“continue efforts to enter into discussions with a view of moving forward” with the offer.
35.

The statements contained in the Form 10-K were false and misleading, as Global

Digital knew it had no chance of consummating the Remington offer and had no means of
financing such an acquisition. In fact, no deal was ever consummated and no correction was
ever issued. Both Sullivan and Loppert were fully aware that Remington’s CEO/Chairman
dismissed the offer and yet both signed the March 28, 2014 Form 10-K without changing any of
the language contained in the March 11, 2014 Form 8-K.

D. Global Digital’s Misleading Website
36.

Global Digital’s website, which Sullivan authored, reviewed or approved,

contained the November 15, 2013 and “corrected” March 12, 2014 press releases. Moreover, the
October 8, October 11 and October 21, 2013 press releases were also available on the website
until Global Digital removed or modified them.
E. Sullivan and Loppert Failed to File Statements of Beneficial Ownership of Securities on
Forms 3, 4 and 5
37.

Global Digital became an effective reporting company with the Commission on

October 10, 2013. At that time, both Sullivan and Loppert owned shares of Global Digital stock,
and both failed to file an Initial Statement of Beneficial Ownership, known as Form 3.
38.

On March 5, 2014, Sullivan was granted 3 million stock options of Global Digital

stock and Loppert was granted 1.5 million. Neither filed a Statement of Changes in Beneficial
Ownership of Securities, known as Form 4.
39.

As indicated in Global Digital’s Form 10-K, dated March 30, 2015, Sullivan

owned 30,240,000 shares of Global Digital Stock and Loppert owned 9,500,000. Together both
Sullivan and Loppert owned just over 36% of Global Digital stock as of March 26, 2015. At no
time did Sullivan or Loppert file an Annual Statement of Beneficial Ownership of Securities,
known as Form 5.
